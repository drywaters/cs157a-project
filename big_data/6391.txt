focus on blackout prevention fast system restoration 1  b e t t e r estimation of fault location integrating communication in protection condition monitoring and diagnostics etc Application of the digital recording technology in the power systems transient events results in high quality and huge quantity of disturbance records Information from the analysis of digital records are required to get an insight into the behavior of the power system as well as the performance of the protection equipments However manual analysis of the records is both time-consuming and complex One of the major challenges in the Smart Grid initiative is to automatically convert data into knowledge This will allow more time and 003exibility of the human resources to implement corrective or preventive action 2  Secondly the transformation of the power systems disturbance data to information in an automated way is an even bigger challenge for the power utilities worldwide The huge amount of disturbance data are practically never analyzed Therefore with intelligent techniques if this huge amount of data could be reduced to meaningful information at source that is of great interest This paper will highlight the nature and source of such big data and possible ways to reduce it The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section II describes the current best practices in power systems disturbance analysis e.g protection devices characteristics of those major manufacturers and common mode standard Section III describes the automated analysis system's architecture speci\002cations

B Characteristics The protection devices can be characterized typically by the following parameters 017 Recording channels Each DFR recording typically consists of 32 points binary information and analog information in the form of voltages and currents per phase as well as the neutral current It could have additional diagnostics and binary inputs ranging up to 40 channels 017 Sampling frequency It varies from about 1 kHz for LV systems typically 4\2268 kHz up to about 15.36 kHz corresponding to maximum allowed 256 samples/cycle for 60 Hz nominal frequency 4   017 Fault record time typically between 3\2265s 017 Number of transient records storage typically about 100 017 Sensor inputs Typically about 10 5 current transformers or CTs 5 voltage transformer or VTs along with optional sensors like temperature etc 017 Input accuracy 0.5\2265 0.5 metering 5 protection C Major Manufacturers The list of manufacturers of protective relays is a growing one Some of the leading manufacturers are ABB Siemens GE Alstom Schweitzer Electrical Laboratories SEL Eaton etc the order does not signify any relative measure D COMTRADE Standard The variety of sources of transient data such as DFRs DPRs and transient simulation programs e.g EMTP 8  f r o m different manufacturers using proprietary or different standard formats made it necessary to introduce the IEEE Standard for Common Format for Transient Data Exchange COMTRADE for power systems as speci\002ed by the IEEE standard C37.1111991 9  The standard 002les are ASCII 002les Each event has three types of 002les associated with it Each of the three types carries a different class of information header HDR con\002guration CFG and data DAT The header 002le includes the following information 1 Description of the power system prior to disturbance 2 Name of the station 3 Identity of the line transformer reactor capacitor or circuit breaker that experienced the transient 4 Length of the faulted line 5 Positive and zero sequence resistances and reactances 6 Capacitances 7 Mutual coupling between the parallel lines 8 Locations and ratings of the shunt reactors and the series capacitors 9 Nominal voltage ratings of the transformer windings 10 Transformer power ratings and windings connections 11 Positive and zero sequence impedance of the source 12 Description of how the data was obtained 13 Description of the anti-aliasing 002lters used 14 Description of analog mimic circuitry 15 Number of discs on which the case data is stored 16 The format in which the data is recorded 17 The headings of the columns of the data table The intent of the con\002guration 002le CFG is to provide the information necessary for a computer program to read and interpret the data values in the associated data 002les consisting of the following contents 1 Station name and identi\002cation 2 Number and type of channels 3 Channel names units and conversion factors 4 Line frequency 5 Sample rate and number of samples at this rate 6 Date and time of 002rst data value 7 Date and time of trigger point 8 File type The data 002le DAT contains the data values in rows and columns where each row consists of a set of data values preceded by a sequence number and the time for that set of data values No other information is contained in the data 002le The 002rst column contains the sample number of the data set in that row The second column gives the time of the data in microseconds from the beginning of the record The third and remaining columns contain the data values that represent voltages currents and status information Fig 1 shows a typical COMTRADE fault record Fig 1 Typical COMTRADE fault record III A UTOMATED D ISTURBANCE A NALYSIS A Architecture Following IEEE COMTRADE standard 9  t h e D F R recordings are used for disturbance analysis frequency analysis state estimation etc 3   1 0    1 1   H o w e v e r  m o s t o f t h e tasks performed are dependent on human experts typically at the network control centers Even though semi-automatic network management systems NMS are evolving fully automated disturbance analysis is still a wish The aim of the automated analysis system 12 226  1 5  w o u l d b e t o t r a n s f o r m data into knowledge Recently multi-agents technology 16 and data mining 17 a r e a l s o a p p l i e d f o r t r a n s f o r m i n g d i s t u r bance data into knowledge Fig 2 shows the disturbance analysis scheme typically employed at the utility network control NC centers In Fig 2 the blocks in solid-lines indicate the existing systems whereas the blocks in dotted-lines indicate proposed automatic disturbance recognition and analysis systems 2014 IEEE Innovative Smart Grid Technologies - Asia \(ISGT ASIA 127 


Fig 2 Typical disturbance analysis scheme employed at network control centers As per Fig 2 when a transient event Tx-event takes places in the power transmission network the NC gets informed via a SCADA Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition network and also the DFRs will be triggered The protection engineers provide a 24-hour support through the analysis of these records It is possible to download the fault record via the X.25 communication network The protection engineer has to do manual analysis to create a report for the NC which is cumbersome It takes a lot of time typically from 1 hour to 10 hours or more depending on the complexity and severity of the event Additionally an automatic scanning PC downloads the records The records need to be saved manually at a 002le server Results from the analysis of the digital fault records are also captured in the transient information processing and protection systems TIPPS database 2  D u e t o l a r g e a m o u n t of historical data available trend analysis on the performance of primary and secondary equipment can be done An automated analysis system AAS shown in dotted lines in Fig 2 would be much faster It could be placed in two different ways The more ef\002cient way is to do the automated analysis directly at the substation transmitting only a report to the NC This is the fastest way to do it but additional PCs and communication infrastructure are needed Standards like IEC 61850-9-2 4 w o u l d f a c i l i t a t e m o r e c o m m u n i c a t i o n s i n future The other way is to run the automated analysis on a central PC The automated analysis system should also be able to write the analysis results to the TIPPS database B Speci\002cation Primary Information The 002rst requirement for the AAS is that it must be able to read a COMTRADE 002le The AAS must be able to automatically import the COMTRADE 002le from a user de\002ned directory do the analysis and produce the results in a format which can be viewed by any text editor The distribution of the results should be done through any of the following media email SMS print or Web The AAS must extract from the COMTRADE 002le the following information 017 Faulted phase\(s 017 Fault type 017 Total fault duration 017 Main 1 protection operating time 017 Main 2 protection operating time 017 Fault location 017 Fault resistance 017 DC offset 017 Breaker operating time 017 Auto re-close time C Speci\002cation Secondary Information Besides the above mentioned parameters the AAS must also determine and report on the following information 017 Was the fault on the speci\002c feeder 017 Did the main 1 relay operate 017 Did the main 1 relay operate correctly 017 Did the main 2 relay operate 017 Did the main 2 relay operate correctly 017 Was the main 1 permissive carrier signal sent and was this correct 017 Was the main 2 permissive carrier signal sent and was this correct 017 Was the main 1 permissive carrier received and was this correct 017 Was the main 2 permissive carrier received and was this correct 017 How did the breaker operate 1 pole or 3 poles 017 Did the breaker auto re-close ARC 017 What was the magnitude of the fault current 017 What was the magnitude of the neutral current 017 What was the magnitude of the healthy phase currents during the fault 017 What was the depression in voltage on the faulted phase/s 017 What was the depression in voltage on the healthy phase/s 017 What were the dominant frequencies before and during the fault 017 Did any of the breaker poles re-strike IV B IG D ATA  A MOUNT  R EDUCTION A Size of Disturbance Big Data The total size of the disturbance data basically depends on the typical COMTRADE 002le size The 002le size mainly depends on the sampling frequency and length of the records Current power systems disturbance data communication standard 4 allows for maximum of 256 samples/cycle For the maximal systems frequency of 60 Hz this will translate to 15.36 kHz for possible maximum sampling frequency For typical data recording for 5s it would provide 76800 samples There will be additionally overhead information as described in section 2014 IEEE Innovative Smart Grid Technologies - Asia \(ISGT ASIA 128 


Fig 3 Wavelet transform-based segmentation of the voltage left and current right signals during power systems disturbances II.D This typically leads to about 1\2263 megabytes MB of 002le size for each data record There could be several thousand disturbance records in a particular substation Depending on the protection settings many relays are placed If the relays typically record about 100 records in a particular time period and there are 1000 relays which will cover relatively reasonable area this will lead to 3 002 100 002 1000  300  000 MB i.e about 300 GB of data for a typical substation area please note this is an empirical rough estimate This 002gure multiplied by the exact number of DFRs in a substation and total number of substations would provide an idea about the total amount of data being generated B Steps to Reduce Big Data The 002rst step in such disturbance analysis is to identify the fault Here a fault generally means an overcurrent 1  m a i n l y from a short circuit In power systems the protection follows sequential steps For example there is normal prefault condition then fault inception takes place which is followed by fault identi\002cation If the fault is persistent CB opening is done As many disturbances in power systems are rather temporary and selfclearing an auto-reclosing of the CB is done after pre-de\002ned period which might result in successful system restoration or opening of CB again due to permanent fault The DFR recordings typically cover the entire sequence of events The 002rst step in automated analysis is to perform a segmentation of the disturbance signals according to the sequential protection events There are different approaches to achieve the segmentation using abrupt change detection methods 20   2 1   A m o n g s t t h e s e  t h e w a v e l e t t r a n s f o r m b a s e d method 2   1 0  226  1 8   a n d s y s t e m i d e n t i 002 c a t i o n b a s e d m e t h o d 19   2 1  a r e p a r t i c u l a r l y u s e f u l  H o w e v e r  i n p o w e r s y s t e m s disturbance analysis the speed of operation is very important From that perspective the wavelet transform performs much better than the system identi\002cation approach 10   1 1    1 9   Once the segmentation is done as in Fig 3 the fault section can be considered instead of the whole signal For example in Fig 3 the total signal length is 6500 samples However for subsequent analysis one would be interested in the fault section which is segment B about 200 samples Fig 4 Architecture of the Automated Analysis System Fig 5 Semi-parametric approach based feature vector construction Therefore instead of saving the whole signal the segment information and sections of particular interest could be saved For example the long part C after CB opening which is about 1100 samples could be removed and only the beginning and end point of segment C could be kept This will reduce the disturbance 002le size by 20 Further intelligent reductions could be achieved Then we would construct the appropriate feature vectors for the different segments e.g using semi-parametric method 22   2 3   A n d 002 n a l l y t h e p a t t e r n m a t c h i n g a l g o r i t h m s w o u l d be applied using those feature vectors to accomplish the fault recognition and associated tasks 2   3   T h e 003 o w c h a r t is shown in Fig 4 and the semi-parametric feature vector construction in Fig 5 These steps would contribute to derive the required information as described in section III.B\226C C Centralized Protection In power distribution systems radial and ring-main subtransmission systems are commonly used topology Typically a nondirectional time-delay protection logic is used to protect 2014 IEEE Innovative Smart Grid Technologies - Asia \(ISGT ASIA 129 


Fig 6 Centralized protection in distribution systems the line But it will be dif\002cult to identify effectively the affected zones only and accordingly cut out minimal sections without interrupting customers who are outside the faulty zones In comparison effective protection in terms of optimal section breaking could be offered with current-only directional relays 24 226  2 6   F i g  6 s h o w s t h e d i s t r i b u t i o n t o p o l o g y w i t h centralized protection scheme In case of faults the relays at G H R can communicate the directional judgment relative to their own position to a central computer substation or controller unit The decision levels are Forward as 1 fault between source to relay point Reverse as 2261 fault between relay point to line Neutral e.g outside directional sensitivity or Normal as 0 The central computer or unit has to identify which of the contiguous relays provide contradicting decisions The fault section would be between those This way we can ensure optimal fault sectionalization which is only possible with the position-aware sensing by the novel current-only directional relays 24 226  2 6  a l o n g w i t h t h e d e c i s i o n l o g i c  The centralized protection scheme would leverage the IEC 61850 standard 4 f o r d i g i t a l s u b s t a t i o n  T r a n s m i t t i n g t h e disturbance data to the central computer would increase the system reliability It would also reduce the big data as data accumulation and analysis could be done concurrently with the help of the central computing resource This is currently not possible with the nodal and local computations using the relays which have limited computational power D Remote  Distributed Disturbance Analysis The big data from power systems disturbances could be effectively reduced by performing the analysis remotely in a distributed manner This could be effectively realized using the application service provider ASP technologies 27   2 8   Fig 7 shows the schematics of the remote disturbance analysis using the ASP service The automatic analysis system could be available for use via the ASP technology over the Internet in two modes In the Indirect mode of use users will need to upload their fault signals via the Internet into the analysis system and will get back the analysis report via the Web and e-mail In the Direct mode of use users will be able to use the analysis system Fig 7 Remote disturbance analysis using application service provider ASP backbone remotely hosted in a central server computer via the Internet after logging into the system using their login id and password 27   2 8   It will be required to web-enable and integrate various systems in the indirect mode e.g the fault analysis engine the web interface feedback system etc which are cross-platform from the point of view of operating system and programming languages So the Web service would be the perfect technology to integrate and implement the indirect mode of the ASP of the automatic fault analysis system 27   2 8   Using the ASP low level relay testing could be done Test results are reported in 28  A s t h e d i s t u r b a n c e a n a l y s i s is done remotely and in a distributed manner this scheme would effectively reduce the large volume of disturbance data Besides it will effectively create valuable information from data which most of the power utilities are lacking today V D ISCUSSIONS The following comments are cited 1 The intelligent signal processing techniques e.g the segmentation and selection would need to be applied in an embedded manner in the DFR so that the disturbance record 002le size can be reduced 2 Further 002le size reduction could be done by computing the parameters required in the automated analysis as speci\002ed in the sections III.B\226III.C Those values could be stored in the DFR and communicated accordingly 3 For communicating reduced and processed information some adjustments in the standard would be necessary This is because currently standard like IEC 61850-92 4 d e 002 n e s r e q u i r e m e n t s f o r t h e s a m p l e v a l u e s o n l y  not for processed or modi\002ed information However the nature of the processed information as demonstrated in this paper is not critically different It is just rejecting unnecessary parts of the complete records Therefore existing standard like IEC 61850-9-2 4 i s well applicable The reduced data would require reduced communication bandwidth as well 4 As the change in modus operandi would require signi\002cant computation the DFRs would need more computational resources e.g processor speed etc On the other 2014 IEEE Innovative Smart Grid Technologies - Asia \(ISGT ASIA 130 


hand less storage would be required And subsequently the problem of huge amount of data residing at the network control centers which never practically gets analyzed could be improved 5 Besides storing the computed information those could be communicated to the operating and the maintenance personnel via sms email etc 6 Besides the signal processing-based methods presented in this paper data compression techniques could be applied to compress the data 29  H o w e v e r  f o r d i s turbance analysis that might not be preferred Also the interoperability of protective devices by different vendors with the compressed data might be a problem VI C ONCLUSION The analysis of faults and disturbances plays a central role for a secure and reliable electrical power supply This is becoming even more important in the Smart Grid initiative with focus on blackout prevention fast system restoration better estimation of fault location etc DFRs enable digital recording of the power systems transient events with high quality and huge quantity The transformation of the power systems disturbance data to information expectedly in an automated way is a big challenge for the power utilities worldwide but a key focus for realizing the Smart Grid The architecture and speci\002cation for the primary and the secondary information for the automated systems are described in this paper This will provide a guideline what to derive out of the big data Furthermore a quanti\002ed estimate of big data typically in the order of 100\226300 GB for a particular substation has been estimated empirically in the paper Finally possible ways to reduce the big data by utilizing intelligent segmentation techniques are described with real example Big data in the distribution side could be reduced by adopting the centralized protection scheme Transmitting the disturbance data to the central computer e.g using the IEC 61850 standard would increase the system reliability It would also reduce the big data as data accumulation and analysis could be done concurrently with the help of the central computing resource This is currently not possible with the nodal and local computations using the relays which have limited computational power Furthermore the big data from power systems disturbances could be effectively reduced by performing the analysis remotely in a distributed manner using the application service provider ASP technologies This scheme would effectively reduce the large volume of disturbance data Besides it will effectively create valuable information from data which most of the power utilities are lacking today R EFERENCES 1 P  M  A n d e r s o n  Power System Protection  McGraw-Hill NY 1999 2 A  U k i l  R  Z i v a n o v i c  223 A p p l i c a t i o n

 The average interval between consecutive Load Information and Resource Status Update messages is 10 ms Fourth, some messages can contain multiple instances of some data structures, one for each cell for which information is reported. On this matter, in order to perform our calculations we made the following assumptions  Within each UE Measurement Report, data relative to 8 neighbour cells \(the maximum allowed number included  Each eNB has 3 cells for which it includes information within the Load Informa tion and Resource Status Update messages  Each cell is interfered by 8 neighbour cells, with whom it interchanges inter-cell interference coordination information via the Load Information message Finally, we need some assumptions on the network topology in order to derive our figures on how big is big data for a BES approach. To this aim, we adopt the values proposed  for a res i dential deploym ent, i.e  The UE density is 10000 UE/km2  The macro eNB density is 4.62 eNB/km2  The pico/femto eNB density is ranging from 50 to 100 eNB/km2, which, according p onds to a  total network capacity ranging approximately from 50 to 300 GB/h/km2 C  Results In Fig. 2 we show the amount of data that would be gathered per unit area following respectively the BES and SoTA approach. The most striking aspect of the results is that the transition from a SoTA approach to a BES approach implies an increase on the amount of data to be handled between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude. Additionally, we note that the BES approach exhibits a significant dependence on the small cell \(pico/femto\hereas the SoTA approach is constant. This is due to the fact that, as per our assumptions, the amount of information gathered by the SoTA approach depends only on the UE density, but not on the eNB density. Considered the volume of the data, the velocity of processing that a BES solution would require in order to satisfactorily address the use cases that we discussed in Section V, and the variety in the data itself due to the very complex interdependencies among the variables involved, we observe that the BES approach has indeed all the characteristics of a Big Data problem In Fig. 3 we report the average network load per eNB due to the collection of the network information needed as input for the BES optimization. We assumed that the network load is shared equally among eNBs regardl ess of their type; while not very accurate \(e.g., the actual load per eNB would vary according to how many UEs are associated to each eNB assumption can still yield a meani ngful order of magnitude of the considered metric. From the figure, we note that the SoTA approach has a network load on the order of kilobits per second per eNB, compared to the order of megabits per second per eNB of the BES approach. We note that these figures do not take into account any protocol overhead, so the actual network load would be probably slightly larger Overall, the results that we ju st presented show that the realization of a BES solution will require significant investments in data processing infrastructure as well as in additional network capacity. Because of this, a BES approach will only make sense if it is effectively able to achieve a significant improvement in network performance and efficiency as well as a reduction in network runni ng costs. On this respect, we argue that more research on practical BES solutions is needed in order to be able to evaluate their effectiveness and viability in real network deployments VII  CONCLUSIONS In this paper we introduced the concept of Big Data Empowered Self Organized Networks, discussing its main  Fig. 3  Network load per eNB on the backhaul link due to the gathering of monitoring information for the BES and SOTA approaches defined in Section VI.A considering the assumptions described in Section VI.B 1.00 10.00 100.00 1000.00 10000.00 100000.00 1000000.00 10000000.00 25 50 100 200 400 800 1600 network load bit/s/eNB small cell eNB density eNB/km 2  BES SoTA  Fig. 2  Amount of mobile network data to be gathered and processed for the BES and SOTA approaches defined in Section VI.A considering the assumptions described in Section VI.B 0.01 0.10 1.00 10.00 100.00 1000.00 10000.00 25 50 100 200 400 800 1600 data amount GB/day/km 2  small cell eNB density eNB/km 2  BES SoTA European Wireless 2014 187 ISBN 978-3-8007-3621-8 VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany

These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
