GPUs offer an order of magnitude higher compute power and memory bandwidth than CPUs GPUs therefore might appear to be well suited to accelerate computations that operate on voluminous data sets in independent ways e.g for transformations ltering aggregation partitioning or other Big Data style processing Yet experience indicates that it

is difìcult and often error-prone to write GPGPU programs which efìciently process data that does not t in GPU memory partly because of the intricacies of GPU hardware architecture and programming models and partly because of the limited bandwidth available between GPUs and CPUs In this paper we propose 
BigKernel 
 a scheme that provides pseudo-virtual memory to GPU applications and is implemented using a 4-stage pipeline with automated prefetching to i optimize CPU-GPU communication and ii optimize GPU memory accesses BigKernel simpliìes the programming model by allowing programmers to write kernels using arbitrarily large data structures that can be partitioned into segments where 
each segment is operated on independently these kernels are transformed into BigKernel using straight-forward compiler transformations Our evaluation on six data-intensive benchmarks shows that BigKernel achieves an average speedup of 1.7 over state-of-the-art double-buffering techniques and an average speedup of 3.0 over corresponding multi-threaded CPU implementations 
Keywords 
I I NTRODUCTION An important class of computations operate on voluminous data sets in ways similar to what is sometimes referred to as Big Data computations and other times referred to as 
GPU CPU communication management optimization stream processing 
 These computations perform simple straightforward and independent operations on a large number of input data records one chunk at a time and hence are trivially parallelizable This is a large class and includes computations that lter transform aggregate or partition large data sets We are interested in using GPUs for these types of computations On the surface it appears that GPUs would be ideal for this The many GPU cores allow for highly parallelized processing and offer large aggregate compute power compared to CPUs e.g 4.5 TFLOPS vs 460 GFLOPS Nvidia GTX Titan vs Intel Ivy Bridge And GPU memory has signiìcantly higher theoretical bandwidth than CPU memory since they were 
streaming computations 
designed for graphics processing e.g 288 GB/s vs 52 GB/s However a number of issues complicate the efìcient use of GPUs for these types of computations Firstly CPUs and GPUs have separate memories requiring explicit data transfers between CPU and GPU memory and GPU memory is limited in size currently up to at most 6GB Because of the limited size the large quantity of data to be processed needs to be explicitly partitioned into chucks and iteratively copied into GPU memory for processing there Efìcient partitioning is not always straight-forward especially when dealing with non-indexed variable-length records To enable concurrency between GPU processing and data transfers double-buffering 
is typically used where the GPU processes the data in one of the buffers while data is being transferred into the other buffer But coding double buffering has been shown to be tedious and error-prone Secondly the PCIe link that connects the two memories has limited bandwidth and for the computations we are considering can often be a bottleneck starving GPU cores from their data For example PCIe Gen 3 has a theoretical maximum throughput of 15.75 GB/s far lower than memory bandwidth GPU-side and difìcult to exploit in practice Indeed while impressive speedups have been reported for many GPU applications the speedups were often calculated without taking into account the overhead of transferring data 
between CPU and GPU memory Thirdly the high bandwidth of GPU memory can only be exploited when GPU threads executing at the same time access memory in a 
coalesced 
fashion where the threads simultaneously access adjacent memory locations otherwise memory accesses may become serialized resulting in signiìcantly lower memory throughput Low memory throughput for data-intensive applications like the ones we are targeting results in highly underutilized GPU cores Because such applications are not a priori structured to operate on data in a coalesced fashion the data has to be reorganized to support coalesced accesses on the GPU which is non-trivial In this paper we describe 
 a mixed compile-time run-time scheme that addresses the issues listed above by using data prefetching within a 4-stage pipeline The key idea behind BigKernel is to have GPU threads identify online but ahead of time which data they will access in their computations transfer this information to the CPU and then have the CPU assemble the data and transfer it to GPU memory prior to when the GPU threads access the data This scheme has a number of potential advantages First the amount of data transferred over the PCIe link from CPU

memory to GPU memory is often reduced because only the data being accessed GPU-side is transferred as opposed to all data Secondly it allows the CPU to assemble the data in a way that increases coalesced data accesses on the GPU for more efìcient GPU memory accesses Finally it signiìcantly simpliìes the programming model since the programmer need not deal with and manage i buffers ii the transfers of data between CPU and GPU and iii the reorganization of data so as to enable coalesced accesses BigKernel allows the programmer to write a GPU program with arbitrarily large data structures as if pseudo virtual memory were available GPU side if they are accessed in a streaming fashion The program is compiler-transformed to one that automates the management of buffers the transfers and the layout of GPU-side data in a way that is transparent to the programmer Moreover the fact that the transformed program only invokes a single kernel once for the entire computation means that the kernel context i.e registers and GPU shared memory is available throughout the entire computation without having to manage it separately as would be the case when kernels are invoked iteratively further simplifying her programming efforts However one should note that BigKernel is not a general framework It targets only a subset of computations namely streaming computations which are computations that operate on input records in independent ways However we argue that this is a large and important subset Moreover BigKernel involves a number of tradeoffs For example BigKernel uses twice as many GPU threads potentially limiting the degree of parallelism GPU-side although we have found GPU core utilization to be low for the class of computations being considered As another example BigKernel uses more CPU-side resources compared to traditional schemes i.e more CPU threads more memory accesses and more buffers that are pinned so that they cannot be paged out which may impact other concurrently running processes on the CPU Our initial performance evaluation presented in Section VI is encouraging With six benchmarks we show that BigKernel outperforms corresponding single and double buffering implementations across all benchmarks by up to 4.6X and 3.1X and on average by 2.6X and 1.7X respectively Compared to corresponding multi-threaded CPU implementations BigKernel executes up to 7.2 times faster and on average 3.0 times faster As far as we know BigKernel 1 is 1 the rst scheme to improve on the performance of state-of-the-art double-buffering schemes for GPUs 2 the rst scheme to automate CPU-GPU data transfers for large data sets without requiring the programmer to split the data or annotate the code 1 The name SM each of which contains multiple computing cores registers and a small e.g 64KB but fast on-chip memory called  accessible to the cores of the SM The cores of an SM execute in lock-step with each core executing the same instruction at the same time i.e in SIMD fashion The GPU is connected to an off-chip DRAM memory called  with up to a few gigabytes of space to all cores of all SMs Accesses to global memory is an order of magnitude slower than accesses to registers and shared memory We refer to this global memory as in this paper to differentiate it from CPU main memory The GPU is connected to the CPU through a bidirectional link such as PCIe The GPU will have one or more DMA engines capable of transferring data over this link between CPU and GPU memory However the DMA engine can only access CPU memory that has been pinned so that it will not be paged out by the OS The DMA engines also provide GPU cores direct but slow access to CPU memory The term is used to denote the function that executes on the GPU by a collection of threads in parallel The programmer conìgures the kernel to be executed by a given number of GPU threads These threads are grouped into as conìgured by the programmer Each thread block is assigned to a SM by a hardware scheduler Threads of a thread block are further divided into groups of 32 called  The threads in a warp execute in lock-step because the cores share the same instruction scheduler will occur if on a conditional branch threads of the same warp take different paths which can lead to serious performance degradations Inter-warp divergence does not negatively impact performance III B IG K ERNEL O VERVIEW BigKernel organizes a computation into four pipeline stages 1 GPU-side GPU threads calculate the addresses of the data needed by the computation threads later in Stage 4 The code to generate the memory addresses is obtained from the original GPU kernel source code by removing all statements except i those that contribute to control ow ii those that contribute to memory access address calculations and iii the memory accesses themselves The memory access instructions are transformed so that instead of making memory accesses the address is recorded in an CPU-side reserved for that purpose See Fig 1

was chosen because i its target applications are those with Big Data-style processing of large datasets ii the programmer can write a single big kernel that can operate on all data even if the data does not t in memory and iii the kernel that is generated is big compared to a traditionally implemented kernel e.g a kernel that is implemented in 70 LOC is transformed into one that has over 500 LOC 3 the rst scheme to provide the continuous execution of a single kernel on arbitrarily large input/output data sets Section II gives a brief background on GPUs for those less familiar with GPUs Sections III and IV describe BigKernel in more detail Sections V and VI present our performance evaluation We close with related work and concluding remarks II GPU B ACKGROUND GPU hardware consists of several

CPU-side The prefetch data is assembled into a in CPU memory based on the addresses generated in Stage 1 3  the GPU DMA engine transfers the contents of the prefetch buffer to a in GPU memory 4 GPU-side GPU threads execute the actual computation using the prefetched data The code for the computation is obtained by transforming the original GPU kernel to use the prefetched data in the data buffer instead of the original memory accesses To provide more detail using an example consider part of a K-means computation where represents a element particle array that does not t in GPU memory but is accessed in a streaming fashion represents an array of clusters that ts entirely in GPU memory and returns the id of the cluster closest to the target particle Because the particle array does not t in GPU memory the array would traditionally be processed in chunks with the following GPU code invoked iteratively disregarding s return value for now to simplify the example The corresponding CPU code i allocates space for the cluster array GPU-side and copies the cluster array to GPU memory and then ii iteratively copies the next chunk of the particles array to GPU memory before invoking the GPU on the chunk  is equal to the number of particles that t in the GPU buffer  Using BigKernel the programmer no longer needs to partition the large particle array into chunks and manage the transfers Instead she would provide the following CPU-side code that assumes the existence of an arbitrarily large array in GPU memory that is virtually allocated with and mapped to the CPU-side particles array with  The corresponding GPU-side kernel code written by the programmer remains unchanged but gets invoked only once Note that the K-means kernel accesses two types of data structures the cluster array which is explicitly copied to GPU memory and does not involve BigKernel and the particle array that does not t in GPU memory and is mapped BigKernel manages the accesses to the latter We now describe each of the four stages of the BigKernel pipeline in more detail using the same running example  The prefetch address generation code is obtained from the original GPU kernel by transforming the read accesses to the array in the for-loop to instead store the addresses in an array CPU-side 016\015\033\011\003\005 002\003\004\003\005\006 007\010\002\011\003\012\003\004\003\013\014\015\002\014\006\003\012\003\016\003\017\020\021\006\003\012\022\022\003\023\003\024 025 Currently our transformations are relatively simplistic in that they cannot deal with indirections or ow control based on application data that may be modiìed in which case then the transformation simply defaults to fetching all data making the resulting code similar to the double-buffering scheme This technique has three potential downsides First if the same data item is accessed multiple times in the code then it will be be transferred multiple times leading to extra overhead However we have not found this to be the case with the applications we examined and believe that it is

rare in Big Data-style streaming applications Second when characters which are typically 1-byte are accessed then the communication overhead of transferring the addresses which are typically 4 or 8-bytes is far greater than the overhead of transferring the characters We address this issue in the next section Finally the CPU-side address buffer must be pinned i.e non-pageable so that it can be accessed by the GPU DMA engine While this consumes physical CPU memory that cannot be made available to other processes this should rarely become an issue given todayês CPU memory sizes  A dedicated CPU thread is responsible for fetching the corresponding data element from the particles array for each address in the address buffer and placing it in the prefetch buffer which also must be a pinned buffer Note that the layout in the prefetch buffer enables coalesced accesses after it has been transferred to GPU memory This is because the addresses were stored into the address buffer in the order they were accessed by the GPU threads so data accessed at the same time will be adjacent to each other This data assembly process has one potential disadvantage Because data assembly occurs CPU-side it involves twice as many memory accesses CPU-side compared to traditional GPGPU applications In traditional GPGPU applications data for the GPU is rst copied to a pinned buffer resulting in a CPU-side read and a write for each data element However with BigKernel the address is rst DMAed to memory by the GPU the CPU then reads the address before copying the target data to the pinned prefetch buffer resulting in two reads and two writes for each prefetched data element  The data transfer stage is executed by the GPU DMA engine allowing CPU and GPU cores to concurrently do other work  The computation code is compiler generated from the GPU kernel by transforming the accesses to the array in the kernel loop to instead access the data previously transferred from the CPU in  Fig 3 shows the implementation of the 4-stage pipeline depicted in Fig 2 assuming a single thread block Unlike what is shown in Fig 2 the time it takes for each stage to complete in practice will vary depending on the application However prefetch address generation takes the least amount of time across all applications we experimented with The CPU launches twice as many GPU threads as speciìed in the original program Half are responsible for generating loop of the kernel lines 10-38 processes one chunk of data at a time The address generation stage lines 13-20 ends when is full at which time all the address generating threads rst barrier line 22 and one of the threads in thread block signals the CPU that the addresses are ready The CPU waits until the addresses are ready line 55 and then assembles the data lines 56-57 copies the data to the GPU line 59 and then signals the GPU computation threads that the data is ready line 60 at which time the computation stage lines 26-37 can commence Some details were omitted from the code in Fig 3 for simplicity For example multiple instances of each buffer are required to allow for concurrency although the code only shows one At minimum two of each are required so that one can be produced while the other is still being consumed  Writes to steaming data are handled similar to the way reads are handled each write results in the writing of the target address to an address buffer CPU side and the data value is written to a write buffer GPU side which is then transferred to CPU memory by the DMA engine This requires two extra set of buffers one GPU side to collect the writes and one CPU side to which the data is transferred This also adds two stages to the pipeline one for the data transfer back to CPU memory and one for a CPU thread to process the transferred data and update the target data structure  The examples and code above assumed all threads were running within one GPU thread block Supporting multiple thread blocks adds a few complications which however are handled through compiler transformations in a straightforward way A separate set of buffers is needed for each thread block both CPUand GPU-side A separate CPU thread for each GPU thread block is responsible for data assembly CPU-side Threads within a thread block need to be organized so that half of them are responsible for prefetch address generation and the other half are responsible for computation so that each computation

The address generation stage makes use of a pattern recognition component that attempts to extract patterns from the memory addresses it generates The goal of this component is to reduce the amount of address information that needs to be sent to the CPU by replacing the generated addresses with a pattern that can be used to reproduce the addresses Such pattern recognition if successful is particularly impactful performance-wise when dealing with text-based input data since an address 4 or 8-bytes would otherwise be required for each accessed character 1-byte Each address generation thread starts by generating a few addresses storing them in a private temporary address buffer 2 The number of addresses generated is dictated by the size of the buffer which is typically a few tens of bytes It then invokes a pattern recognition function to identify a potential pattern from the stored addresses A pattern if found consists of a base address and a number of strides between subsequent addresses For instance if stored addresses are 0x00100 0x00105 0x00110 0x00115 then the pattern would be  If no pattern is found then the addresses collected in the temporary buffer are copied to the CPU-side address buffer and address generation continues as described earlier in Section III If a pattern is identiìed then the address generation thread continues generating data access addresses but now veriìes that each subsequently generated address follows the identiìed pattern If it does not then address generation is started again this time without attempting to identify a pattern and writing the addresses to the CPU-side address buffer If all subsequently generated addresses adhere to the pattern then the pattern instead of the addresses is written to CPU memory and a signal is sent to the CPU indicating that a pattern was found The pattern recognition scheme described above is rather simplistic but we have found it to be effective with our benchmarks  see Section VI One can easily conceive of ways to extend it and make it more versatile e.g allow patterns to change midstream Compared to traditional double-buffering implementations BigKernel incurs extra memory accesses during the data assembly stage CPU-side If access patterns are provided by the prefetch address generation stage then the overhead of the data assembly can be reduced by improving memory access locality and the attendant cache hit rate We focus on improving memory access locality when reading data from the source of the mapped data as opposed to when writing data to the prefetch data buffer because we found that the cost of these reads is far higher than the cost of the writes To read the prefetch data speciìed by the pattern instead of reading the data items in the order they are needed by the GPU computation threads we read all of the prefetch data for one GPU thread at a time This results in increased data locality in CPU reads because each GPU thread tends to access consecutive data The fetched data is however still stored in the prefetch data buffer in the order they will be 2 Preferably these temporary buffers are allocated in GPU shared memory but if there is not enough space there because it is needed by the computation the buffer is allocated in GPU memory

accessed GPU-side If multiple data structures are mapped and accessed by the GPU then we additionally read the data from each structure separately Synchronization in GPGPU applications is complicated by the intricacies of the GPU hardware In particular there is no signaling mechanism between CPU and GPU beyond using ags located in memory and busy waiting for a speciìc ag value For this reason it is important to implement synchronization so as to minimize the number of memory accesses required especially on the GPU because of the large number of threads that execute there The rst three stages of the BigKernel pipeline are producers for their following stages the address generation stage produces addresses for the data assembly stage which produces data for data transfer stage which produces data for computation stage For each buffer used in the pipeline proper synchronization is required to ensure that consumption of the buffer data does not commence before the data has been produced and that data for a buffer is not produced until the buffer has previously been consumed The GPU signals the CPU at the end of the address generation stage by setting a ag in CPU memory The CPU busy waits on that ag before it starts the data assembly stage The GPU cannot signal the CPU until all of the address generating threads have completed their stage Hence the address generation threads rst barrier at the end of their stage before one of the threads signals the CPU We use the GPU instruction for barriering because it is efìcient and can barrier a given number of threads No synchronization is needed between the data assembly stage and the data transfer stage because the latter is initiated by the CPU thread after it completes the data assembly The DMA engine knows when the data transfer stage has completed but there is no mechanism for the DMA engine to signal the kernel computation threads that this occurred We rely on the fact that the DMA engine performs data transfers in order After the CPU instructs the GPU DMA engine to transfer the data buffer using  it instructs the DMA engine to copy a ag to a speciìc location in GPU memory that indicates the data transfer has completed The ag will not be transferred until the data buffer has been transferred Instead of having each GPU computation thread busy wait on that ag only one computation thread is assigned that task All the other computation threads barrier again using  to ensure they do not start the computation phase until the ag has been set To prevent subsequent address generation stages from overwriting an address buffer that has not yet been consumed we barrier all threads in a thread block once for each chunk iteration 3 Each address generation thread in iteration  This relies on the fact that when a computation stage starts all three stages prior to it have completed and the buffers of the previous stages can safely be overwritten Synchronization between threads across different thread-blocks is not needed because both computation threads and their corresponding address generation threads are packed into the same thread-block and they interact with a separate CPU thread responsible for their data prefetching To ensure efìcient use of memory resources both CPUand GPU-side BigKernel allocates data and address buffers only for active thread-blocks reusing them when inactive thread-blocks become active 4 which only occurs when a resident active thread-block retires The beneìt of allocating buffers only for active thread-blocks is that buffers can be made larger potentially improving performance by reducing the number of synchronization points We use a hybrid compile-time runtime method to identify the number of active thread-blocks First the resource usage required by a thread block  is determined at compile-time and provided as a constant value in the applicationês code The resources provided by the GPU hardware is then probed at runtime using provided API functions The number of active thread-blocks is then calculated as where is the number of thread-blocks set by the programmer as the argument of the kernel invocation V E XPERIMENTAL S ETUP Our baseline hardware infrastructure consists of a 3.8GHz Intel Xeon Quad Core E5 with 8 hardware threads and 10MB of combined L2/L3 cache connected to 16GB of quad-channel memory clocked at

applications are compiled with the corresponding version of the compiler using optimization level three For our experiments we ran six applications with a range of different data access patterns 5 partitions particles into clusters so that particles are assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean Each consists of the particleês coordinates their clusterIds and a few other data values The kernel reads particle coordinates and sets its clusterId the clusterIds therefore have to be transferred back to CPU memory 4 The number of thread-blocks that become active depends on the resources

To gain more insight into which features of BigKernel lead to performance improvements we ran BigKernel with certain features disabled and measured the speedup obtained over the single-buffered implementation 1  this variant transfers all data in its original layout i.e no optimizations to reduce the data transferred and no optimization for increased coalesced accesses Hence this variant thus only provides pipelined execution where communication and computation is overlapped 2  this variant transfers only the data required by the computation but leaves the transferred data in its original layout with the optimizations for coalesced accesses disabled 3  the complete BigKernel implementation Fig 5 depicts the incremental speedup obtained from running one variant over the other The gure thus gives an indication of the contribution of reduced data transfers and data layout optimized for coalesced accesses 6 As expected the data transferred for MasterCard Afìnity and Word Count cannot be reduced and therefore they only beneìt from communication/computation overlap and memory coalescing Opinion Finder also does not exhibit performance improvements from reducing the CPU-GPU data transfers due to its dominant computation stage The effect of the memory coalescing optimization varies from application to application based on a number of factors 1 the ratio of accesses to mapped data over all data accesses in the kernel  the higher the ratio the greater the performance beneìt 2 whether the data transfer stage dominates or not  if it does there is no beneìt from optimizing memory accesses and 3 whether or not the original layout already leads to 6 It should be noted that the graph would look substantially different if the disabling of features had been done in a different order because the contributions of each feature overlap in the pipeline

Fig 6 Relative completion time of each BigKernel stage 
For optimal execution each stage in the BigKernel pipeline would ideally take the same amount of time to complete This is obviously not the case and the amount of time each stage requires to complete varies from application to application For each application we experimentally measured the time each stage required on average to complete 7 Fig 6 shows for each application the time each stage took to complete on average relative to the stage that took the longest The address generation stage requires only a small fraction of the total execution time usually less than 20 as it only executes those instructions that contribute to memory address calculations The time taken by the data assembly stage varies for the different applications based on i the amount of data that has to be assembled and ii the data locality of the data items being accessed by CPU memory and hence the cache hit rate The time taken for the data transfer solely depends on the size of data to be transferred because the data to be transferred is put in a contiguous pinned-buffer and therefore is efìciently transferred to GPU memory by the GPU DMA engine Finally the computation itself is responsible for a considerable portion of the execution time Clearly this is expected for those applications that originally had a dominant computation stage However it is interesting to note that BigKernel signiìcantly increased the computation  communication ratios relative to the original single-kernel implementations Fig 4\(b The fact that the computation stage is the slowest stage for many of these applications indicates that GPU memory may be the bottleneck Recognition of access patterns during the prefetch address generation stage is a key optimization in BigKernel This is 7 To measure execution breakdown we inserted time measurements at the beginning and end of each stage The data transfer stage in particular is measured by having the CPU continuously ping the status of data transfers to stop the timer when the transfer has completed Application Performance difference K-means 31 Word Count 66 Netîix 3 Opinion Finder 6 DNA Assembly 7 MasterCard Afìnity 57 MasterCard Afìnity Indexed NA TABLE II P ERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT DUE TO THE USE OF ACCESS PATTERNS  shown in Table II that lists the performance improvements when only having to transfer patterns to CPU memory over having to send the actual addresses The extent to which performance is improved for each application depends on the number of addresses sent during the address generation stage which in turn depends on the granularity of the data being accessed For instance in K-means one address is sent for each variable i.e 8-byte while in Word Count one address has to be sent for each required character i.e 1-byte Having to send a large number of addresses relative to the amount of data to be transferred adds signiìcant overhead to PCIe transfers for addresses and on CPU memory to read addresses during the data assembly stage Replacing the addresses with a pattern can thus have a signiìcant performance impact VII R ELATED W ORK Managing CPU-GPU data communications is a well-known challenge both from a programmability and a performance point of view The majority of existing work addresses this challenge only from a programmability point of view 8  18 Some prior w ork also considers performance which is more closely related to our work Komoda et al propose a library for OpenCL that automatically overlaps computation with data communication given the memory usage pattern of a kernel The performance of the resulting applications is close to that of the double-buffering scheme However the programmer is still required to provide various details on the data usage pattern of the kernel CGCM and DyManD are two systems that automate CPU-GPU data communications through a hybrid compile-time and run-time scheme 11 Ho we v er  the data transfers are not overlapped with computation And the programmer is still responsible for splitting the data into smaller chunks and invoking the kernel multiple times Pai et al propose a system that automates CPU-GPU memory management based on a coherence scheme in order to reduce superîuous communication T o do this when a data item is accessed on one side CPU or GPU side it is transferred from the other side if it is not locally available or if its local version is stale This system does not overlap computation and communication There is interesting prior work to automatically manage and optimize data transfers but they target transfers between GPU global memory and GPU shared memory 7 9 Interestingly they also target streaming computations but

they assume the data is already in GPU global memory CUDA-lite translates an annotated kernel so that it prefetches the data from GPU memory in a coalesced fashion and stores it in GPU shared memory to where future data accesses are redirected In a similar w ork Y ang et al proposes various compiler optimizations including one that converts non-coalesced accesses into coalesced ones through the use of shared memory None of this prior w ork considers CPU-GPU data communications Our prefetching scheme is related to a method of dealing with irregular problems in distributed systems known as  15 Finally Zhang et al optimize the layout of irregularly accessed data to achieve more efìcient GPU memory accesses by having the CPU place elements of an irregularly accessed array that will be accessed by GPU threads at the same time next to each other resulting in a higher degree of coalesced accesses VIII C ONCLUDING REMARKS We introduced  a scheme that provides pseudo-virtual memory to Big Data-style GPGPU applications that operate on streaming data BigKernel uses a 4-stage pipeline with automated prefetching to i optimize CPU-GPU communication and ii optimize GPU memory accesses It simpliìes the programming model by allowing programmers to write kernels using arbitrarily large data structures where the data records can be operated on independently thus relieving the programmer from having to partition the data into segments manage buffers transfer data between CPU and GPU and having to invoke GPU kernels multiple times Straight-forward compiler transformations are used to transform traditional GPU kernels into BigKernel On six applications we experimentally showed that BigKernel achieves an average speedup of 1.7X over implementations that use double buffering and an average speedup of 3X over multi-core CPU implementations We also showed that BigKernel largely removed PCIe from being a bottleneck for these applications with the bottleneck migrating to the GPU cores As future work we intend to gain more experience with additional applications with more complex data structures in particular we plan on applying BigKernel to MapReduce Since GPU processing is now often the bottleneck for the applications we studied we also intend to focus on improving GPU processing efìciency IX A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors are grateful to the anonymous reviewers Leonid Ryzhyk and Ding Yuan for their constructive and helpful comments This work is supported by NSERC research grants R EFERENCES  M Bauer  H Cook and B Khailan y  cudaDMA Optimizing GPU Memory Bandwidth via Warp Specialization In
