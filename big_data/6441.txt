227This paper aims to detect features of coordinated attacks by applying data mining techniques Apriori and Pre\036xSpan to the CCC DATAset 2008-2010 which consists of the captured packets data and the downloading logs Data mining algorithms allow us to automate detecting characteristics from large amount of data which the conventional heuristics could not apply Apriori achives high recall but with false positive while Pre\036xSpan has high precision but low recall Hence we propose hybriding these algorithms Our analysis shows the change in behavior of malware over the past 3 years 
Abstract 
I I NTRODUCTION Malware has been improved in recent years For example many variants of malware are used for infection using multiple download servers controlled by some This avoids researchers from tracing the source of malware developers In particular an advanced technique refereed as 
with multiple servers makes detection of malwares to be extremely dif\336cult Moreover in recent years 322Gumblar\323 and other Webbased malware newly introduced an attack called 
the botnet coordinated attacks 
driveby-download 
 and can be used to detect the association rule of the malware for coordinated attacks It w as designed to detect signi\336cant correlations 
which involved many web servers to make victim hosts downloading malware resulting increase of the damage It is almost impossible to manually trace the path of downloads because of the quantities and kinds of packets used to the drive-by-download attack Instead we need to use an algorithm of data mining for analysis There are two major data mining technique for extracting a valuable features of the malware from downloading logs 321

are in DMCC In fact in the Bugzilla of ArgoUML the bug ID 1957 7 relates the two 036les Each label text is a few pixels too high for its component They should be positioned such that the label text is vertically aligned with the text in the labeled component In FreeBSD  We 036nd that ah-core.c and hpfs-alsubr.c are in approximate DMCC In the mailing list of FreeBSD the Message-ID 200906011106.n51B62Da020139@freefall.freebsd.org states that the two 036les are related in a lengthy the message from bugmaster  FreeBSD.org on June 1 2009 about Current problem reports In SIP  We 036nd that MuteDataSource.java and CallPeerActionMenuBar.java were changed systemically with one shift change period in 036ve years In fact These two 036les implement the same feature 8  Audio-Calls In XalanC  We 036nd that Cloneable.cpp and XLocator.cpp are in approximate DMCC In the XSLT syntax and semantic speci\036cation 9  these 036les are related A single template  can pull s tring values out of arbitrary locations in the source tree it can generate structures that are repeated according to the occurrence of elements In the following scenarios we summarise the usefulness of DMCCs reported by Macocha 1 Management of Development Teams If two classes are in approximate dephase macro co-change they should ideally be maintained by the same team of developers to minimise the risks of introducing bugs in the future The team of developers most likely possesses a wealth of unwritten knowledge about the design and implementation choices that they made for these classes which would help them to prevent introducing bugs 19  Consequently a team leader should rede\036ne the organisation of the maintenance team according to the DMCCs links among 036les so that her team does not introduce bugs because of the absence of info rmation or lack of communication among developers For example in ArgoUML when we analysed changes made in three 10 11 12 dephase macro co-changing 036les that have generated bugs we found that these changes have been made with one shift in time in their periods of change and by different developers  Thus such co-changes can not be detected by previous work Thanks to DMCCs a team leader should ensure that team who will maintain these 036les in each change period have the necessary knowledge to maintain the dependency among these 036les 2 Bug and Change Propagation Knowing that two 036les are in DMCCs implies the existence of hidden dependencies between these two 036les If these dependencies 7 http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show bug.cgi?id=1957 8 http://www.jitsi.org/index.php/Main/Features 9 http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt 10 http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show bug.cgi?id=1957 11 http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show bug.cgi?id=2926 12 http://argouml.tigris.org/issues/show bug.cgi?id=4604 are not properly maintained they can introduce bugs in a program With our approach for each program studied we detected 036les in dephase macro co-changes By using external information we con\036rmed our observation and that these 036les indeed participate to bugs For example in SIP we detected seven bugs in relation with dephase macro cochanging 036les By applying the association rule approach described in 3  w e c annot 036 n d t hat t hes e 036 l es are c ochanging Thus by knowing 036les that are in DMMCs we could explain and possibly prevent bugs we plan to study in future work the bug prediction using approximate dephase macro co-changes 3 Traceability Analysis The change history represents one of sources of information available for recovering traceability links that are manually created and maintained by developers The version history may reveal hidden links that relate 036les and would be suf\036cient to attract the developers attention For example in SIP we detect traceability links between four approximate dephase macro co-changing 036les By applying the association rule approach described in we cannot 036nd that these 036les are co-changing Due to the distributed collaborative nature of open-source development version-control systems are the primary location of 036les and the primary means of coordination and archival The requirements of open-source programs are typically implied by communication among project participants and through test cases However such traces of requirements are lost in time Thus by knowing classes there are in approximate dephase macro co-change we could detect potentially traceability links between them which we plan to concretely study in future work V D ISCUSSIONS With our approach we detect 036les in MCCs or in DMCCs in four different programs belonging to different domains and with different sizes histories and programming languages However we do not detect MCCs and DMCCs with the same proportion in each program We observe that the numbers of MCCs and DMCCs found in the programs developed in Java ArgoUML and SIP are greater than the number of MCCs and DMCCs found in program developed in C or C see Table II We explain this 036nding by the fact that on the one hand the majority of FreeBSD 036les are idle and that on the other hand XalanC is the smallest program analysed Thus we also apply our approach to detect dephase macro co-changes on fewer C and C  036les than Java 036les less than 529 036les thus explaining the lower numbers of MCCs and DMCCs In future work we will conduct studies on other programs in these languages to con\036rm this observation and to assess the numbers of MCCs and DMCCs according to the programming languages A Threats to the Study Validity Some threats limit the validity of our empirical study 
331 


Construct Validity  Construct validity threats concern the relation between theory and obs ervations In this study they could be due to implementation errors They could also be due to a mistaken relation between changes in 036les We believe that this threat is mitigated by the facts that many authors discussed this relation that this relation seems rational and that the results of our analysis shows that indeed MCCs and DMCCs exist and are corroborated by external sources of information bug reports and others Actually we apply static analysis to detect MCCs and DMCCs because co-change analysis is known to be more useful when combined with static analysis 23  As previous work detected co-changes committed by the same author in a short time window relaxing these constraints may also lead to false positives The results of our empirical study show that Macocha improves precision and recall with respect to the state of the art in four different programs However we cannot claim that our approach will give similar results for any program Internal Validity  Internal validity is the validity of causal inferences in studies based on experiments The internal validity of our study is not threatened because we have not manipulate a variable the independent variable to see its effect on a second variable the dependent variable Reliability Validity  Reliability validity threats concern the possibility of replicating this study We attempted to provide all the necessary details to re-implement our approach and replicate our empirical study The change logs and the changed 036les of the four programs analysed with their pro\036les to obtain our observations are on-line at http://www.ptidej.net/downloads/experiments/wcre11b External Validity  We performed our study on four different real programs belonging to different domains and with different sizes histories programming languages Yet we cannot assert that our results and observations are generalisable to any other pr ograms and the fact that all the analysed programs are open source may reduce this generability future work includes replicating our study in other contexts and with other programs VI R ELATED W ORK The concepts of MCCs and DMCCs relate our work to that on 036le stability co-change and change propagation A File Stability Many approaches exist to group 036les based on their relative stability th roughout the software development life cycle For example Kpodjedo et al 20 propos ed t o i d ent i f y all 036les that do not change in the history of a program using an Error Tolerant Graph Matching algorithm They studied the evolution of the Mozilla class diagram by collecting 144 Mozilla snapshots over six years reverse-engineering their class diagrams and recovering traceability links between subsequent class diagrams Their approach identi\036ed evolving classes that maintain a stable structure of relations association inheritance and aggregation and thus that likely constitute the stable backbone of Mozilla As other example UMLDiff 11 compares and d etects the differences between the contents of two object-oriented program versions A fact extractor parses each version to extract models of their design Next a heuristic-differencing algorithm UMLDiff extracts the history of the program evolution in terms of the additions removals moves renamings and signature-changes of design entities such as packages classes interfaces and their 036elds and methods UMLDiff then assigns a stability to each class short-lived classes that exist only in a few versions of the program and then disappear idle classes that rarely undergo changes after their introduction in the program and active classes that keep being modi\036ed over their whole lifespan The Error Tolerant Graph Matching algorithm and UMLDiff take few hours to analyse 036le stability for the four programs analysed in this paper because they require parsing and comparing AST-like representations of the programs before performing their analyses Macocha computes stability in few minutes using the change periods of a program which depend on how the developers of the program organise their work and group changes through the life cycle of the program B Co-changing Files Ying et al 2 a nd Zi mmermann et al 3 a p p lied a sso ciation rules to identify co-changing 036les Their hypothesis is that past co-changed 036les can be used to recommend source code 036les potentially relevant to a change request An association-rule algorithm extracts frequently co-changing 036les of a transaction into sets that are regarded as change patterns to guide future changes Such algorithm uses co-change history in CVS and avoids the source code dependency parsing process However it only computes the frequency of co-changed 036les in the past and omits many other cases e.g  036les that co-change with always the same period of time between changes In Section IV we showed that approaches based on association rules cannot detect all occurrences of MCCs and any occurrences of DMCCs because by their very de\036nition they do not integrate the analysis of 036les that are maintained by different developers and–or with some shift in time which could lead to missed co-changing 036les German 7 u sed t h e in f o r m atio n i n t h e CVS t o v isu a lize what 036les are changed at the same time and who are the people who tend to modify certain 036les He presented SoftChange a tool that uses a heuristic based on a sliding window algorithm to rebuild the Modi\036cation Record MRs based on 036le revisions In Softchange a 036le revision is included in a given MR if all the 036le revisions in the MR and the candidate 036le revision were created by the same author and have the same log Thus Softchange can not detect co-changed 036le maintained in the same time by 
332 


different developers Ceccarelli et al 21 and C anfora et al 10 propos ed t h e u s e of a v ect or aut o re gres s i on model  a generalisation of univariate auto-regression models to capture the evolution and the inter-dependencies between multiple time series representing changes to 036les They used the bivariate Granger causality test to identify if the changes to some 036les are useful to forecasting the changes to other 036les They concluded that the Granger test is a viable approach to change impact anal ysis and that it complements existing approaches like association rules to capture cochanges If the authors integrate the analysis of 036les that are maintained by different developers in periods of time of more than few minutes their approach could then detect typical examples of MCCs and DMCCs Antoniol et al 8 p res e nt ed an approach t o det ect s i mi larities in evolutions of 036les starting from past maintenance notwithstanding their temporal distortions They applied the LPC/Cepstrum technique which models a time evolving signal as an ordered set of coef\036cients representing the signal spectral envelope to identify in version-control systems the 036les that evolved in the same or similar ways Their approach can 036nd 036les having very similar maintenance evolution history but they did not present a tool to detect MCCs and DMCCs It used cepstral distance to assess series similarity if two cepstra series are clos e the original signals have a similar evolution in time with which we can not distinguish between the occurrences of MCCs and DMCCs C Change Propagation The development and maintenance of a program involves handling a large number of 036les These 036les are logically related to each other and a change to one 036le may imply a large number of changes to various other 036les Change propagation analyses how changes made to one 036le propagate to others Law and Rothermel 22 presented an approach for change propagation analysis based on whole-path pro\036ling Path pro\036ling is a technique to capture and represent a program dynamic control 037ow Unlike other path-pro\036ling techniques which record intraprocedural or acyclic paths whole-path pro\036ling produces a single compact description of a program control 037ow including loops iteration and inter-procedural paths Law et al s approach builds a representation of a program behavior and estimates change propagation using three dependencybased change-propagation ana lysis techniques call graphbased analysis static program slicing and dynamic program slicing Hassan and Holt 23 in v e stig ated se v e r a l h eu r i stics to predict change propagation among source code 036les They de\036ned change propagation as the changes that a 036le must undergo to ensure the consistency of the program when another 036le changed They proposed a model of change propagation and several heuristics to generate the set of 036les that must change in response to a changed 036le Zhou et al 24 pres ent e d a change propagat i o n a nal y s i s b as ed on Bayesian networks that incorporates static source code dependencies as well as different features extracted from the history of a program such as change comments and author information They used the Evolizer system that retrieves all modi\036cation reports from a CVS and uses a sliding window algorithm to group them Canfora and Cerulo 25 proposed an approach to derive the set of 036les impacted by a proposed change request A user submits a new change request to a Bugzilla database The new change request is then assigned to a developer for resolution who must understand the request and determine the 036les of the source code that will be impacted by the requested change Their approach exploits information retrieval algorithms to link the change request descriptions and the set of historical source 036le revisions impacted by similar past change requests Theses approaches detect change propagation among 036les Their change-propagation model can be used to predict future change couplings and may involve several 036les that are in MCCs or in DMCCs but they do not allow to differentiate between these two concepts All these approaches grouped change couplings created by the same author and have the same log message thus they can not detect approximate MCCs and–or DMCCs Ambros et al 18 pres ented t he Ev olution R adar  a n approach to integrate and visualise module-level and 036lelevel logical couplings which is useful to answer questions about the evolution of a program the impact of changes at different levels of abstraction and the need for restructuring Beyer and Hassan 26 i nt roduced t h e e v o l u t i o n s t o ryboard a new concept for animated visualisations of historical information about the program structure and the storyboard panel which highlights structural differences between two versions of a program They also formulated guidelines for the usage of their visualisation by non-experts and to make their evaluations repeatable on other programs However Xing and Stroulia 27  r eport e d t hat t hes e visualisations are limited in their applicability because they assume a substantial interpretation effort of their users and they do not scale well they become unreadable for large systems with numerous components VII C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK We introduced the novel concepts of macro co-changes and dephase macro co-changes to describe that two 036les were changed by developers within same change periods with possible shifts in time We describe Macocha an approach to detect dephase macro co-changes using 036le pro\036les and their stability in time Macocha relates to 036le stability and co-changes We therefore performed two types of empirical studies Quantitatively we compared Macocha with UMLDiff 11 a nd an as sociation rules approach 3 b y a ppl yi ng and c ompari ng t h e results of the three approaches

ArgoUML FreeBSD SIP and XalanC and showed that Macocha can identify the same idle/changed 036les as UMLDiff and that Macocha has a better precision and recall than the approach based on association rules Qualitatively we used external information provided by bugs reports mailing lists and requirement descriptions to show that detected MCCs and DMCCs explain real important evolution phenomena We also showed that dephase macro co-changes do exist and can help in explaining bugs managing development teams and traceability analysis We are currently 1 replicating our studies with other programs 2 performing a comprehensive study of the number of MCCs and DMCCs with varying values of t and s especially dependent on the analysed programs 3 identifying other scenarios in which dephase macro cochanges help and 4 relating MCCs and DMCCs with static analysis and external software characteristics such as change proneness Future work also includes a comparative study of the different sets computed by Macocha and associations rules with different value of con\036dence and support other than the values reported in 3  A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been partly funded by a FQRNT team grant

relate approximately the 34% of the events, which enables the forecast of new events that are the same type as those contained in the rules. In a similar way to the presented case we analyzed 62 different measurement points with a total of 6300 events occurred in the distribution network over 2 years TABLE VI ASSOCIATION RULES AND THEIR CONFIDENCE rule conf  1]?

The parameters used to extract the association rules are win = 5, min fr = 0.15 and min conf = 0.5. The summary showed in Table VII indicates that the ranges of occurrence of events in each measurement point presents different behaviours and, therefore, it is necessary to examine separately the sequences of each measurement point for a successful development of a valid prediction. The results show that it is possible to build rules to relate time spans between successive events which give an estimate of time lag for the appearance of a new event. Although it is not possible to relate all the events of the sequence, the knowledge of network behavior is improved, and takes advantage of power system information available in databases. Finally, different values of win min fr and min conf were tested to find frequent episodes 


and association rules. The result show that increasing win larger episodes can be found, while increasing min fr and min conf the amount of frequent episodes and rules will be minor, since the requirement for selection increases Similarly, it was found that using WINEPI methodology, the frequency of an episode is proportional to the width of the window. The appropriate values of min conf and min fr are defined taking into account criteria such as sequence length, type events frequency and the confidence threshold that the user wishes to assume. It is advisable to test different values of min conf and min fr V. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS The proposed methodology suggests a new approach for failure analysis in power distribution system. The aim of the solution is the forecast of faults, which is analyzed in the domain of temporal data mining and, in particular, the discovery of patterns starting from the registers of events The proposed solution is able to extract useful information about the behaviour and evolution of the faults in the electrical system, as a first step in the exploitation of event sequences recorded in power distribution systems, for the prediction of future failures Future work should continue with the search of episodes in sequences of events to discovery patterns related with failures in components and to exploit other information contained in the events recorded besides the elapse times between events e.g., the depth of voltage sags during the fault, etc. Next use this information from a predicting point of view, to anticipate future failures VI.
