promising performance. However, with a high dimensional dataset, associative classifiers inevitably face two challenges 1\ow to extract a minimal set of strong predictive rules from an explosive number of generated association rules; and \(2 how to deal with the highly sensitive choice of the minimal support threshold. In order to address these two challenges we introduce causality into associative classification, and propose a new framework of causal associative classification In this framework, we use causal Bayesian networks to bridge irrelevant and redundant features with irrelevant and redundant rules in associative classification. Without loss of prediction power, the feature space involved with the antecedent of a classification rule is reduced to the space of the 
direct causes, direct effects, and direct causes of the direct effects, a.k.a. the Markov blanket, of the consequent of the rule in causal Bayesian networks. The proposed framework is instantiated via baseline classifiers using emerging patterns Experimental results show that our framework significantly reduces the model complexity while outperforming the other state-of-the-art algorithms Keywords- associative classification; emerging patterns causal bayesian networks I   I NTRODUCTION  Associative classification integrates association rule mining and classification. The consequent of an association rule is a class label, and the classifier is constructed using a set of association rules. This classifier is expected to produce 
good results and yield an interpretable model.

shown to be a powerful method for constructing accurate classifiers, even for imbalanced data [12, 19  A lth ou g h  many research efforts have significantly advanced the techniques for associative classification, two challenging issues remain 1  How to extract a minimal set of strong predictive rules from an explosive number of generated association rules Most associative classifiers are constructed in two steps generating frequent patterns satisfying certain minimum support and confidence constraints, and then making predictions based on the selected patterns. Although many pruning strategies have been proposed, a huge number of 
rules can still be discovered from high dimensional data even using a rather high minimum support threshold. It is difficult to store, retrieve, prune, and sort a large number of rules efficiently for classification; it hampers the understanding of the final classifier; and it leads to overfitting. These problems exist mainly because the existing associative classifiers only focus on generating rules with the support-confidence framework, without considering the predictive ability of the features involved in a classification rule. Thus, extracting a minimal set of rules with strongly predictive ability is critical to build an efficient associative classifier from high dimensional data which are prevalent in many real-world applications 
2  How to deal with the highly sensitive choice of the minimal support threshold The performance of most existing associative classifiers significantly depends on the support threshold value. For a large dataset, a small support value could generate a huge amount of rules while a large value might cause serious accuracy degradation. Thus it is a daunting problem to find an appropriate support threshold value To battle these challenges, we propose a new framework to introduce causality into associative classification Traditional associative classification algorithms identify relationships between the class label and its antecedents using statistical correlation. However, çcorrelation is not causation.é [20 F o r ex am pl e th e g r ow th of h a ir c a n b e

In this case, the correlation only reveals a spurious association, due to a possibly unobserved common cause. Consequently, by detecting causal relationships between the class label and its antecedents, we can uncover causal or consequential factors with respect to the class label The causal or consequential factors of a variable give the natural interpretation of most of the events occurring in realworld applications.

bridge irrelevant and redundant features with irrelevant and redundant rules in associative classification. Without loss of prediction power, the feature space involved with the antecedent of a classification rule is reduced to the space of the direct causes, direct effects, and direct causes of the direct effects, a.k.a. Markov blanket, of the consequent of this rule in causal Bayesian networks When generating the set of classification rules, the only features taken into account are those that belong to this causal feature space instead of the combinations of all features. Thus, it can greatly reduce computational cost and large resource demand in the stage of rule extraction Furthermore, the extracted rules are not only causally interpretable, but also causally informative. The proposed framework is instantiated via baseline classifiers using emerging patterns \(EP for short\ith two new classifiers CE-EP and MB-EP classifiers \(with CE for direct C auses and direct E ffects and MB for M arket B lanket respectively The reminder of the paper is structured as follows Section 2 reviews related work on associative classification Section 3 provides a theoretical analysis on how to extract rules with causality, and then presents a causal associative classification framework. Experimental results are reported in Section 4, and we conclude in Section 5 II  R ELATED W ORK  Associative classification is a scientific study which integrates association rule discovery and classification to a model for prediction. Existing associative classifiers can be grouped into two categories. One is based on general association rules and the other is based on emerging patterns. Successful algorithms in the first category include CBA [16  C M AR 1 5] a n d C P AR 25  C B A  Classification Based on Association\ses an Apriori-like algorithm to generate a single rule-set and ranks the rules according to their confidence/support values. Then it selects the best rule to be applied to each test instance [16  B a s e d  on CBA, Li et al n t r od uc ed CM AR  C l a ssi fi c a t i o n  based on Multiple-class Association Rule\ that generates classification association rules through a FP-tree and uses multiple rules to perform the classification, while CPAR Classification based on Predictive Association Rule combines the advantages of both associative classification and traditional rule-based classification [25 In s t e a d of  generating a large number of candidate rules as in associative classification, CPAR adopts a greedy algorithm to generate rules directly from the training data A new type of association pattern, called emerging patterns, was first introduced by Dong and Li [10  captures emerging trends in time-stamped datasets, or useful contrasts between data classes. An emerging pattern is a multivariate pattern whose support value increases sharply from a background dataset to a target dataset. Emerging patterns have shown very successful results on constructing accurate and robust classifiers. Compared to the approach based on general association rules, associative classification based on emerging patterns uses the aggregation of many groups of emerging patterns while the other approach uses general association rules. For example, CBA uses one association rule group at a time Much research on emerging patterns has largely focused on the use of the discovered patterns for classification, such as classification by emerging patterns, CAEP classifier and its variants [11 a nd c l a ssi fi c a t i o n b y j u m p i ng e m e r gi ng patterns [11  A j u m p i ng e m e r gi ng p a t t er n i s a s p ec i a l  emerging pattern whose support increases from zero in one dataset class to non-zero in the other dataset class. In addition, a strong jumping emerging pattern is a special jumping emerging pattern whose support is zero in one dataset class but non-zero, and satisfying a given minimal threshold in the other dataset class [1 m e r gi ng pa t t e r n  classifiers have been proved to be very valuable tools to solve real problems in many fields [7 Causal discovery has found wide applications in science and technology. Since late 1980ês, the work on formal theories of causality and causal induction by Spirtes Glymour, Pearl, Cooper and others has been gaining ground 18, 8, 20   A B a y e s i an  n e tw ork as on e of th e  m o s t c o m m on  models to represent causal relationships between features has been extensively studied. But learning a full Bayesian network from observational data is an NP-hard problem [9 Consequently, local causal induction which has extended learning Bayesian Networks with tens of thousands of variables has received considerable attention [23  We adopt this local approach in this paper.  The importance of introducing causality into the machine learning and data mining community has been well acknowledged [20, 13 In this paper, we introduce causality into associative classification and propose a new framework of associative classification with causality III  C AUSAL A SSOCIATIVE C LASSIFICATION  A  Extracting Rules with Causality Causal discovery is in the center of human reasoning and decision-making. Because causal Bayesian networks provide a convenient framework for reasoning about causality among random variables, to simplify our presentation, we limit ourselves to causal Bayesian networks to represent causal relationships between variables in this paper. We will denote variables in uppercase letters X; Y; S, values in lowercase letters, x; y; s, respectively. A target \(i.e., the class label\ variable is denoted as C unless stated otherwise. The words çvariable,é çnodeé, and çfeatureé are all used interchangeably in the rest of this paper A Bayesian network is a mathematical tool that compactly represents a joint probability distribution P among a set of random variables V using a directed acyclic graph G, which is annotated with conditional probability tables of the probability distribution of a variable given any instantiation of its parents. We call the triplet <V, G, P> a Bayesian network A si m p l e  B a y e si a n n e t w o r k for l ung cancer is shown in Fig. 1  T h e st a t e s  o f t h e node s a n d the probabilities that are associated with this structure are not shown for better clarify A causal Bayesian network <V, G, P> is a Bayesian network with the additional semantics that X 002 V and Y 002 V

if a node X is a parent of a node Y in G, then X directly causes Y [2 F o r ex am pl e Fig 1 can  als o be t r eat ed as  an  example of a causal Bayesian network Definition 1 1  Conditional Independence Two variables X 002 V and Y 002 V are said to be conditionally independent given some set of variables S 003 V if, for any assignment of values x, y, and s to the variables X, Y, and S respectively, P\(X=x | S=s,Y=y\=P\(X =x|S= s\ds Definition 2 18 Causal Markov Condition In a causal Bayesian network, if every node is independent of its non-effects given its direct causes, then the causal Markov condition holds Definition 3 18 Faithfulness A Bayesian network G and a joint distribution P are faithful to one another if and only if every conditional independence entailed by the graph of G is also present in P Definition 4 1 Causal faithfulness A causal Bayesian network is faithful if it satisfies the faithfulness condition of Definition 3 Let the node çLung Canceré be a target node in Fig. 1 Causal relationships between çLung Canceré and the rest nodes are classified into three categories, irrelevant nodes Markov blanket, and redundant nodes as follows Definition 5 \(Irrelevant Nodes In a causal Bayesian network, if node X is disconnected from Y, then X is a irrelevant node with respect to Y If a node X is irrelevant to Y, it cannot carry any information about Y at all, no matter what the context is. For example, the node çBorn an Even Dayé in Fig. 1 is disconnected from çLung Cancer,é thus the rule Born an Even Dayé=yes  or Born an Even Dayé=no cannot provide any predictive information to the target node of Lung Cancer Definition 6 18, 21 Markov Blanket In a causal Bayesian network with causal faithfulness, the Markov blanket of the node Y, denoted as MB\(Y\s the set of its direct causes, direct effects and direct causes of the direct effects For example, in Fig.1, the Markov blanket of node Lung Cancer includes direct causes: çSmokingé and çGenetics direct effects: çCoughingé and çFatigueé, and direct causes of the direct effects:  çAllergy  Figure 1  A causal Bayesian network for lung cancer Definition 7 \(Redundant Nodes In a causal Bayesian network, if a node X has a connecting path to Y and doesnêt belong to MB\(Y\ then it is a  redundant node with respect to Y We speak of a redundant node with respect to the node Y, if its value is fully determined by a set of nodes that does not include Y. For example, in Fig.1, according to causal Markov condition \(see Definition 2\, once all the direct causes of node Lung Cancer have been given, the value of an indirect cause \(e.g. çAnxietyé \ fully determined by the direct causes of node Lung Cancer and does not bring any additional information to the node. For instance, increased Anxietyé will increase çSmoking,é but cannot influence directly çLung Cancer,é when the value of çSmokingé is known already. Consequently, with two rules Smokingé=yes}\002{çLung Canceré=yes and Anxietyé=yes and çSmokingé=yes}\002{çLung canceré=yes it suffices to have Smokingé=yes}\002 {çLung Canceré=yes as a predictive rule and we do not need to know about çAnxiety Property 1 21 In cau s a l B ay es i an  n etw ork s  w ith  cau s a l  faithfulness, the MB\(Y\ is satisfied with the following property                Y MB Y P S Y MB Y P Y Y MB V S  002 004  This property says that the Markov blanket of each node is the set of all nodes that are dependent of it, conditioned on all other nodes. In other words, in causal Bayesian networks the direct causes, direct effects, and direct causes of the direct effects of Y store information about Y that cannot be obtained from any other nodes. For example, in Fig.1, if we know MB\(çLung Canceré\, any nodes outside of the MB\(çLung Canceré\ would be redundant. Thus, it should be noted that if the antecedent of a classification rule includes both irrelevant and redundant nodes, not only many irrelevant and redundant rules are generated, but also the learning performance will be degraded The above observations motivate us to integrate causal induction with associative classification to address the two challenges on the minimal rule set and the impact of the minimal support threshold. We plan to explore this integration with two views 1  How to bridge the gap between irrelevant and redundant nodes in causal Bayesian networks and irrelevant and redundant classification rules in associative classification 2  How to reduce the search space of the antecedent of a classification rule in associative classification to the space of direct causes and effects or the Markov blanket of the consequent of this rule in causal Bayesian networks Before we address those two views in detail, we first give the definition of the j-measure which is defined in Eq 1\s follows [5 002 003 003 004 005 006 006 007 010  x x p y x p y x p y X j      log       1 The j-measure gives the information measure that the value of y of a random variable Y provides information about another random variable X whenever it changes the probabilities of the various possible \(discrete\ values {x} of X from their prior values {P\(x\} to new, posterior values P\(x|y

It was introduced into the rule induction literature by Smyth and Goodman [2  a s  an i n fo r m a t io n t h eor e ti c m e a n s of quantifying the information content of a rule that is soundly based on theory. Given a rule of the form çif Y=y then X=xé, using the notation of   t he   a ver a g e information content of the rule, measured in bits of information, can be calculated by Eq.\(1\. It is assumed that a rule with a high j-value will tend to have a high predictive accuracy Property 2 5 Non-Negativity j\(X,Y=y 0011 0 Property 2 shows j\(X,Y=y\=0 if and only if the prior values {P\(x\ and posterior values {P\(x|y\are identical From the viewpoint of rule induction, only when the rule Y=y} provides no information about X at all, the term j\(X,Y=y\0 exists. Thus, we obtain Property 3 Property 3 If j\(X,Y=y\0, then the rule{Y=y} cannot provide any predictive information to the variable X According to Property 3, we get the definition of an irrelevant rule as follows Definition 8 \(Irrelevant Rules Let the rule {X=x} be an arbitrary rule with respect to C. If the term 0            003 004 s S x X C j C X V S exists, then the rule X=x} is an irrelevant rule with respect to C Definition 8 shows that an irrelevant rule cannot convey any further information to C with the presence of other rules For example, with two rules A S=s}\002{C=c and B X=x and S=s}\002{C=c where S=s is an arbitrary rule set for C if A conveys exactly the same predictive information as B then X=x is an irrelevant rule Lemma 1 If X is an irrelevant node to the target node C in causal Bayesian networks, then with the presence of any other rules, the rule {X=x} is an irrelevant classification rule with respect to C in associative classification Proof Since X is irrelevant to C in a causal Bayesian network, according to Definition 5, it cannot carry any information about C at all, no matter what the context is Thus, X 002 V irrelevant to C 002 V can be formulated as Eq 2             s S c C P x X s S c C P C X V S       003 004 2 Then the amount of information that the rule {X=x conditioned on any other rules {S=s} gives about the target C is calculated below  2   0    1     1 log     1         log            log           log            log         Eq to according s c p s x c p s x c p s c p s x c p s x c p s c p s x c p y c p s c p s x c p s x c p s c p s x c p s x c p s S x X C j c  003 003 004 005 006 006 007 010     003 003 004 005 006 006 007 010  003 003 004 005 006 006 007 010  003 003 004 005 006 006 007 010  003 003 004 005 006 006 007 010    002   Thus, from Definition 8, we get Lemma 1 001  For instance, in Fig.1, the node of çBorn an Even Day is an irrelevant node to the node of çLung Cancer.é It is evident that the rule Born an Even Dayé=yes and Smokingé=yes}\002{çLung Canceré=yes provides the exactly same predictive information as the rule Smokingé=yes}\002{çLung Canceré=yes  Definition 9 \(Redundant Rules Let the rule {X=x} be an arbitrary rule with respect to C. If the term 0          005 003 006 s S x X C j S X and C V S holds, then it is a redundant rule with respect to C Definition 9 shows that with the presence of a rule set S=s}, if the information of a rule {X=x} conveyed to C is fully contained by the rule set {S=s} that does not include X and C, then {X=x} is a redundant rule to C. For example with rule A X=x and S=s}\002{C=c if rule B S=s}\002{C=c contains exactly the same predictive information as A, then {X=x} is a redundant rule and A  can be replaced by B Lemma 2 If a node X is a redundant node to the target node C in causal Bayesian networks, then the rule {X=x} is a redundant rule with respect to C in associative classification Proof According to Definition 7 and Property 1, since the node X is a redundant node to the target C in causal Bayesian networks, there must have a subset   C MB S 003 for which there exist some values s and c to fully determine the value of X. By Property 1, we can formulate this as Eq.\(3     C MB X C MB S 005 003 006         s S c C p s S x X c C p       3 Thus, similar to the proof of the Lemma 1, with Eq.\(3 we can get the term j\(C=c,X=x|S=s\0 where     C MB X C MB S 005 003 That is to say, with the presence of a rule set of S=s}\002{C=c the rule X=x cannot provide any further information to the rule set of S=s}\002{C=c where     C MB X C MB S 005 003 From Definition 9, we obtain Lemma 2 001  For example, in Fig.1, given the value of node of Smokingé, the node of çYellow Fingeré is redundant to the node çLung Canceré. Therefore, with two rules Smokingé=yes}\002{çLung Canceré=yes and Smokingé=yes and çYellow Fingeré=yes}\002{çLung canceré=yes according to causal Markov condition \(see Definition 2\, it is clear that Smokingé=yes contains the information that conveyed by Yellow Fingeré=yes to the node of çLung Canceré . With the presence of the rule of Smokingé=yes  Yellow Fingeré=yes is redundant. Thus, it suffices to have Smokingé=yes}\002{çLung Canceré=yes as a predictive rule Corollary 1 The search space of classification rules in associative classification can be reduced to the space of the Markov blanket of the class label in causal Bayesian networks Proof With the results of Lemmas 1 and 2, we can remove irrelevant and redundant nodes with respect to the class label in causal Bayesian networks to achieve the goal of pruning irrelevant and redundant rules in associative classification. Thus, by removing irrelevant and redundant nodes in causal Bayesian networks, we can reduce the search space of highly predictive rules in associative classification to the space of Markov blanket of the class label in a causal Bayesian network 001

With Corollary 1, within the Markov blanket of the class label, both the direct causes and the direct effects have a direct connecting path to the class label while the direct causes of the direct effects \(spouses\ of the class label don't have. Thus, in causal Bayesian networks, the spouses cannot individually predicate the class label and only may enhance the predictive power of their direct effects when they join with its direct effects, and also, direct causes joint with direct effects give the most highly predictive ability to predict the class label. Therefore, the search space of classification rules in associative classification can be further reduced to direct causes and direct effects of the class label in causal Bayesian networks, and then we obtain Corollary 2 as follows Corollary 2 The search space of classification rules in associative classification can be further reduced to direct causes and direct effects of the class label in causal Bayesian networks For example, as indicated in Fig.1, the nodes çSmoking Geneticsé, çCoughingé, and çFatigueé give the most highly predictive ability to predict whether a person suffers from lung cancer, while the node çAllergyé cannot individually predicate lung cancer. It may enhance the predictive power of çCoughingé when it joins with çCoughing B  Causal Associative Classification Table I introduces a new framework for causal associative classification.

Building a classifier using extracted causal rules  The key tasks of our framework are \(1\removing the causally irrelevant and redundant nodes to a target, and then identifying the direct causes and direct effects or the Markov blanket of a target, and \(2\ constructing causally informative classification rules Learning a full Bayesian network is a common method to address the first task. But it is an NP-hard problem Fortunately, in associative classification, we only need to consider a rule if its consequent is the class label. Therefore with the Corollaries 1 and 2, rather than to recover a whole causal Bayesian network among all variables, in fact, our framework only needs to uncover cause-effect relationships between a target variable and the rest or to uncover the Markov blanket of a target. Moreover, much research efforts have significantly advanced the local causal induction techniques, such as the HITON_MB and MMMB algorithms 3  w h ich dis cov er l o c a l cau s e e f f ect r e la ti on sh ips a r ou n d  a  target variable of interest in the form of direct causes and effects or Markov blankets Our framework can extract causal rules from this casual feature space, direct causes and direct effects or the Markov blanket of the class label. Thus, reducing the search space of the antecedent of a rule to this causal feature space naturally endows classification association rules with strongly causal interpretability, and those rules are also causally informative. Most importantly, in a causal Bayesian network with causal faithfulness, the direct causes and direct effects or the Markov blanket of a target is unique and minimal    a n d  o u r fr a m e w o r k ha s a go od  c h a n c e  t o ge ner a te a s e t of causal rules that is as small as possible.  For example, in Fig.1, the direct causes and direct effects of lung cancer are the nodes çsmokingé, çgeneticsé, çcoughingé and çfatigue The rules extracted from the four variables naturally have strongly causally interpretable and causally informative Consequently, the rule Smokingé=yes, çCoughingé=yes 001\027 Lung Canceré=yes has a strongly causal ability to predict whether a person suffers from the disease of lung cancer With a small set of causally informative and highly predictive rules, our framework should be less sensitive to the support threshold value IV  E XPERIMENTAL E VALUATION  A  Experimental setup In order to thoroughly evaluate the proposed causal associative classifiers, twenty datasets \(Table II\e selected from the UCI datasets, the WCCI2006 datasets and the NIPS2003 datasets, respectively.

In the experiments, we set the minimum confidence threshold to 0.8 for CBA and CMAR, and set the growth rate to 20 for CAPE and our CEEP and MB-EP classifiers. To thoroughly test the impact of the support threshold values, we set seven minimum supports for CE-EP, MB-EP, CAEP, CBA, and CMAR including 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 respectively. We select the best classification accuracy under the seven minimum supports as the results for our comparative study.

The best results are highlighted in bold and the symbol ç/é denotes either the classifier runs out of memory or it doesnêt work due to a huge number of rules. Table IV summarizes win/tie/loss counts for comparing our two classifiers with the other classifiers.  As shown in Tables III and IV, our two classifiers, CE-EP and MB-EP, usually outperform CAEP SJEP, CBA, CMAR, and CPAR. Although CE-EP only considers mining the classification rules from the space of the direct causes and direct effects of the class label, it outperforms not only MB-EP, but also SJEP, CBA, CMAR and CPAR. Empirical results indicate that detecting cause effect relationships can find high quality predictive rules to achieve better accuracy.

Because of the page limit, Table V only reports the number of rules selected by five classifiers with the minimum support threshold up to 0.2 instead of all seven minimum supports used in the experiments and the best results are highlighted in bold TABLE V  C OMPARISON OF THE NUMBER OF CLASSIFICATION RULES AMONG FIVE ASSOCIATIVE CLASSIFIERS  SUPPORT 0.2 Datasets CE-EP MB-EP CAEP CBA CMAR australia 5 5 26 0 0 breast-w 201 201 201 365 832 heart 14 14 129 328 773 infant_mortality 50 58 109652 2646 ionosphere 10 43 10021 33023 3346 kr_vs_kp 37 146 614 818 151 liver 4 4 24 0 0 mushroom 156 353 388 3058 35025 pima 18 22 34 28 28 promoters 8 8  5 8 spect 3 3 43 125 890 spectf 12 58 98721 3236 vote 18 18 881 2610 11451 wdbc 39 57 2107 34100 33595 madelon 7 9  0 hiva 14 15   lymphoma 33 33  breast-cancer 40 116   ovarian_cancer 17 17   dorothea 45 60    As depicted in Table V, it is clear that the CE-EP and MB-EP classifiers select much fewer rules than the CAEP CBA, and CMAR classifiers on all the datasets except for the promoters dataset. Those results further illustrate that extracting the classification rules from the space of direct causes and direct effects or the Markov blanket of the class label not only gets a much smaller set of rules but also

achieves a higher predictive accuracy than the existing associative classifiers. Table V also indicates that even with very high-dimensional datasets, CE-EP and MB-EP only select a very small set of rules while CAEP, CBA, and CMAR cannot deal with those datasets, even with a rather high support value When the support value is up to 0.2, CBA and CMAR classifiers donêt select any rules on the australia and liver  datasets. Moreover, on the madelon dataset, CMAR also cannot select any rules. On the promoters dataset, although CBA and CMAR select a very small set of rules of 5 and 8 rules respectively, their corresponding classification accuracy is very low, only up to 15% and 2 Table VI compares the running time of our two classifiers with the CAEP, CBA, and CMAR classifiers with the minimum support thresholds up to 0.2. The best result is highlighted in bold face. The CE-EP and MB-EP classifiers are always faster than CAEP. Compared to CBA and CMAR with the same minimum support threshold, on some small datasets, such as breast-w, pima and vote CBA and CMAR are faster than CE-EP and MB-EP. On some datasets, such as australia  live and promoters although CBA and CMAR are faster than CE-EP and MB-EP, CBA and CMAR almost donêt select any rules and only achieve very low accuracy The running time of CBA and CMAR fluctuates among different datasets while CE-EP has a very stable running time for both small and large datasets TABLE VI    R UNNING TIME OF FIVE ASSOCIATIVE CLASSIFIERS IN SECOND  SUPPORT 0.2  Datasets CE-EP MB-EP CAEP CBA CMAR australia 12.58 12.58 14.67 0.14 3.072 breast-w 13.222 13.222 13.222 0.5 0.187 heart 10.28 10.28 13.08 0.36 0.438 infant_mortality 14.36 15.11 3557.41 10.047 ionosphere 8.55 11.56 19.5 208.67 51.516 kr_vs_kp 13 29.36 287.08 97.49 13.25 liver 10 10 10.51 0 0 mushroom 16.94 41.49 46.92 22.31 335.188 pima 10.49 10.49 10.49 0.25 0.062 promoters 12.39 13.39 5.83 5.9 spect 8.36 8.36 10.22 0.86 2.828 spectf 12.95 12.95 2375.63 5.406 vote 10.22 10.22 10.922 1.36 11.11 wdbc 13.59 13.84 48.39 111.42 226.219 madelon 12.86 13  20 hiva 13.14 13.25   lymphoma 10.8 10.8   breast-cancer 46.7 145   ovarian-cancer 13.8 20.8   dorothea 160.4 1789.2    D  Sensitivity Analysis on Support Thresholds  To further explore the performance of CE-EP, MB-EP CAEP, CBA and CMAR, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the classification accuracy, number of selected rules, and running time of those five classifiers with seven minimum support threshold values    1  Sensitivity analysis on classification accuracy  We plot the classification accuracy of those five classifiers on the twenty datasets with seven support thresholds, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 As illustrated in Fig.2, we can see that CE-EP, MB-EP and CAEP are less sensitive to the support thresholds than CBA and CMAR. For all datasets, both CE-EP and MB-EP are insensitive to the different support thresholds, even for those high-dimensional datasets. Furthermore, CE-EP is not only more insensitive, but also always achieves a higher accuracy under all the seven support thresholds than CAEP CBA, and CMAR on all datasets except mushroom and wdbc

   Figure 2  The classification accuracy of five associative classifers under different support threshold values on 20 datasets On the other hand, CBA and CMAR are very sensitive to the support thresholds. For example, on all the datasets except for infant-mortality and spectf when the support threshold is up to 0.3 or 0.4, the corresponding accuracy is greatly reduced. Moreover, on some datasets, the accuracy of CBA and CMAR is even reduced to 0, such as australia kr-vs-kp, liver, promoter and spect On the infant-mortality  and spectf datasets, CBA can only work on the support value greater than 0.2 From the above results, CE-EP and MB-EP are insensitive to the support thresholds. We have a further sensitivity analysis on the number of selected rules in the next section  2  Sensitivity analysis on the number of selected rules  We plot the number of selected rules of CE-EP, MB-EP CAEP, CBA and CMAR on some datasets with the various support thresholds, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 in Fig. 3, instead of all the twenty datasets due to the page limit. From Fig.3, we can see that the numbers of selected rules of CBA and CMAR are very sensitive to the support thresholds. With a small support value, CBA and CMAR select a large number of classification rules. With the support value increasing, the number of selected rules is greatly reduced. Along with Fig. 2, we can conclude that when the support value is small, CBA and CMAR can obtain a large number of rules for classification to achieve good accuracy as shown in Fig. 2. When the support value is large, CBA and CMAR prune too many rules, including useful rules, and this results low classification accuracy From Figures 2 and 3, it is clear that with a small support value, a large number of rules provide rich information for classification and make CBA and CMAR achieve high accuracy. Unfortunately, with a big support value, a large number of rules are generated, and they are difficult to store retrieve and maintain for classification. For example, in Fig 2, on the infant-mortality and spectf datasets, CBA doesnêt work under a small support value because of a huge number of rules CAEP is less sensitive to the support value than CBA and CMAR. Therefore, CAEP also gets a more stable performance than CBA and CMAR under the different support values as shown in Fig. 2. But CAEP cannot deal with a high-dimensional dataset, even on the spectf dataset As for CE-EP and MB-EP, especially CE-EP, under all seven support thresholds, CE-EP and MB-EP not only select a small set of rules, but also are insensitive to the support threshold, even on those very high-dimensional datasets Therefore, those results further demonstrate that the importance of introducing causality into associative classification. More especially, when CE-EP and MB-EP mine the classification rules from the space of the direct causes and direct effects or Markov blanket of the class label they can achieve strongly predictive rules no matter whether the support value is small or large. This also explains why the accuracy of CE-EP and MB-EP remains stable under the different support thresholds as shown in Fig. 2 Although Fig. 3 only contains eight datasets, the results on the remaining twelve datasets have a similar trend Therefore, in a word, among those five associative 
921 


classifiers, as for the number of selected rules, CE-EP and MB-EP are the most insensitive classifiers to the support thresholds while CBA and CMAR are the most sensitive ones. CAEP is less sensitive than CBA and CMAR   Figure 3  Number of selected rules with varied support thresholds  3  Sensitivity analysis on running time  Fig. 4 shows the running time of the five classifiers under seven support values, on the same eight datasets as in Fig.3. From Fig. 4, we can see that the running time of CAEP, CBA, and CMAR is very sensitive to different support thresholds, especially CBA and CMAR. In Table VI we report the running time of those five classifiers under the support value up to 0.2. CBA and CMAR are much faster than CE-EP and MB-EP on some small datasets. The running time of CE-EP and MB-EP is also insensitive to the support values while the running time of the CBA and CMAR classifiers fluctuates under the different support values   Figure 4  Running time with varied support thresholds E  Comparison of classification accuracy of our classifiers with the other state-of-the-art  classifiers  Table VII compares the accuracy of our two classifiers against well-known classifiers such as decision tree J48 Naive Bayes \(NB\, ensemble classifiers Bagging and Boosting implemented in Weka. We also present a win/tie/loss summary in Table VIII to compare the overall performance of our two classifiers against each other. From Tables VII and VIII, both CE-EP and MB-EP achieve the highest accuracy on the 9 data sets of the 20 data sets respectively. On the remaining data sets, while our two classifiers are not the best, they achieve the accuracy very close to the highest on most of these 11 data sets. Our two

Meanwhile, how to deal with high sensitivity to the minimal support threshold is another challenging problem. In this paper, we bring causality into play when designing associative classifiers and propose a new framework for associative classification. In order to validate our framework, we use EP-based classifiers as baseline methods to instantiate our framework and propose two causal associative classifiers: CE-EP and MB-EP Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework Meanwhile, we have only instantiated our framework on EP-based classifiers. Exploring our framework in general association rule classifiers is our future work A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(60975034, 61070131, 61175051 and 61005007\, the US National Science Foundation \(CCF0905337\, and the US NASA Research Award NNX09AK86G  R EFERENCES  1  H.

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
