 Furthermore, we derived collaboration networks and citation networks of Graph Drawing community and visuali z ed using Anchored map techniques to understand collaboration patterns between important res earchers in the community    Keyword s 227  Visual Analytics Web of S cience, Graph Drawing S ocial Networks   I   I NT RODUCT ION   Recent technological advances have led to the production of a big  data, and consequently have led to many massive  complex  network models in many domains  including science and engi n eering   
The most well known example is a webgraph where  nodes represent web pages and their relationships are hyperlinks. They are massive: the whole web consists of billions of nodes  M ore fa miliar e xa mp les include  s ocial networks  s uch as  facebook network, twitter  network linked in network telephone call network   patent network   citation network  and  collaboration network  These networks  are  very large  with tens of thousands of nodes   Oth e r e xa mp le s are 
 b iological network s  s uch as  phylogenetic network, gene regulatory network metabolic  pathways biochemical network and p rotein protein interaction networks. In general these networks have thousands of nodes and relationships between nodes are very complex  In engineering for e xa mp le, l arge scale software engineering deals with big data  sets of software modules and relationships between them  Vis uali z ation is  an effective analysis tool for such networks  Good visuali z ation reveals the hidden structure of the networks and 
 amplifies human understanding, thus leading to new insights  new findings and predictions. However constructing good visualization  of such massive complex networks can be very challenging  M any methods for visuali zing  large graphs have been  suggested  s ince 2000  These  include fast  mu lt i level force directed methods, geometric  or  c ombinatorial clustering methods, multi dimensional  s caling MDS and spectral graph drawing methods  For det ail s see the recent proceedings 
of Graph Drawing  or Information Visualisation conferences  i.e     However, current visualiz ation methods tend to  exhibit one of the following problems   Scalability current methods for visualisation of large  graphs can handle  at best, a few thousand nodes Most methods do not scale well, in t e r ms o f c omputational efficiency i.e runtime   Visual complexity humans have limited ability in cognition and perception. A drawing of millions of nodes can be cluttered, making it impossible  to recogni z e patterns and inhibiting good insight on the 
data set   Domain complexity  R eal world networks  have special properties and constraints that must be represented visually. For example bio logical  networks  have  established layou t conventions for specific networks Thus t he  layout algorithms must faithfully represent  these domain dependent constraints  Similarly, i n a social network, some nodes are more  important than others known as  centrality  measures [2   22

4  Centrality Analysis   Previous pictures of co citation networks support analysis on temporal dynamics and group analysis for each year. In  order to examine individual analysis   i.e., identify highly influential papers inside each co citation network  we used centrality analysis  to measure relative importance of a node in a network  2    Figure 9  shows year 2001 co citation network, visualized using a 2.5D graph layout in GEOMI with node level constraints, defined by  the  degree centrality  The size of a node represent s  the centrality  value  In this figure, the papers on the topmost level are more connected wi th other papers than the papers  on the lower levels Also, we can clearly see the relationship between important papers on the top level     Figure 9  Centrality analysis of year 2001 co citation network   B  Graph Drawing  Community   1  Data Retrieval and Data Processing   In the same way as we did for social networks, we retrieved paper records from WoS using keyword \223Graph Drawing\224 Based on the obtained raw data set, specific information of our interest was read into different tables in an Access database I nformation contained in the database  include citation network work work\, authorship network \(work  author  and  co author network \(author  author\. After examining the information contained in the database by performing SQL queries, a few types of errors or  misleading information were identified. They are   The same author was named differently, for example with or without middle names   The same paper was cited before and after published   The same paper was cited using different conference n a me o r  proceeding s  n a me for example: Graph Drawing or LNCS   These errors were removed manually fro m  the raw data Therefore, the reading process was repeated several times to ensure that the obtained data was clean and information contained was consistent from record to record. The final data obtained include   753 papers between the year of 1966 and 200 7, with 595 papers being co authored   960 authors, and    8720 papers cited as references    Fro m t h is data set, we we re  interested in highly  c ited papers and most active researcher s  in collaboration. Therefore cross table SQL queries w e re  performed  to retrieve c ollaboration network and c itation network. The collaboration network was formed by top 10 most active researchers who co authored more than 40 times and their co authors also co authored at least 10 times. The citation network was formed by top 20 most cited papers and the papers which cited them   2   Anchored Map   The derived network was vis ualized with a tool, called Anchored Maps 7   An anchored map is a node link diagram based on the spring embedder   8   It fixes  some nodes, called 223 anchors 224  at predetermined positions  and allow s  the others called 223 free nodes 224  to be arranged freely   More specifically, a n anchored map was visualized using two steps   Step 1\ Arrange anchors on the circumference at equal intervals. The order ing  of the anchors on the circumference is decided  Step 2\ Fix the anchors and arrange the free nodes at positions appropriately expressing their relationships to the anchors by the spring embedder   The number of edge crossings is  strongly influenced by the order ing  of the anchors. Deciding the order in g  is therefore the most critical problem. The tool offers five numeric indices as substitutes for the aesthetic criteria of graph drawing F or details, see [7   Here, w e used the eccentricity  of free nodes as an index. It is the sum of distances between every free node and the center  of the circumferences    3   Collaboraton Network   Collaboration network gives us information about how often researchers write papers with others, and who often write papers together. The top 10 most active researchers in collaboration identified in ou r data  set are  lis ted in Table II    In Table II, the times co authored were defined as follows if an author wrote a paper with four other authors, then th e  author co authored four times instead of  one time The co 26 


authors of these most active researchers wer e identified and if they co authored more than 10 times, then they were selected to be the part of the collaboration network  TABLE II   M OST ACTIVE RESEARCHE RS  Most Active Researchers  Ti m e s C o authore d  Liotta G  111  Di Battista G  80  T amassia R  65  Mutzel P  62  Eades P  57  Wood DR  49  Didimo W  47  Nishizeki T  46  Junger M  45  Kobourov SG  44   Figures 10 and 11 show  pictures produced by Anchored Map  In Figure 10  blue nodes \(anchors\ are most active researchers, while pink nodes are co authors of the anchors I t  can be seen that a few co authors in the middle area such as Goodrich wrote papers with more than one anchor, while other co authors on the periphery area wrote papers with one or two anchors exclusively  such as Rahman Hong, Duncan     Figure 10   Collaboration network most  active researchers as anchors  In Figure  11, where pink nodes are anchors we can identify some cliques of co authors for each active researcher.

C Processing Overhead TA PF PF TA PF 
  to reach to the RL again \(slow start phase duration\. Then the congestion avoidance phase is ente red. This is the reason why the forwarding rate decreases and increases alternately. This process is performed over and over until the end of the attack This is determined when the PF senses that the incoming rate is less than the forwarding rate \(the drop rate is zero In the proposed system, the filtering decision is made by the module at the victim end, so the module does not incur any overhead on the edge routers for making such filtering decisions. In addition, filtering is an embedded and a key feature of almost all the Internet edge routers, so there is no overhead related to installing such a feature on an edge router. The overhead of the modules on the edge routers is as low as computing the packet drop rate and communicating with the module by sending the ACK and the update messages. Therefore, a very low processing overhead \(in our experiments a few milliseconds\ incurred at the edge routers V C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  One of the major defense chal lenges against DDoS attacks is how to control the attack traffic to preserve the quality of service of the legitimate traffic. To address this issue, we have proposed TDFA, a traceback based defense system against flooding attacks that make use of spoofed addresses. The proposed framework uses the strategy of detecting the attack as well as finding the source of the attack at the victim end, and responding to the attack at the source end. These tasks are carried out by the traffic adjustment module \(TF\, DFM IP traceback algorithm at the victim end, and the packet filtering module at the edge router of the source end, respectively The recovery process is also triggered if the traffic returns to normal. In this work, we have implemented and evaluated the proposed system, TDFA, against the real-world DDoS and normal traffic traces. Our results show that TDFA efficiently drops the attack packets at the source end of the attack, while imposing a low overhead on the edge routers participating in the defense. Moreover, the location of defense modules are fully in line with the location of DFM IP traceback modules making the scheme more deployable. For future work, we plan to implement and evaluate the se curing of the TDFA system itself. In the absence of an appropriate security mechanism, an attacker can deceive the edge router into doing wrong filtering A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research is supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada \(NSERC\ grant, and is conducted as part of the Dalhousie NIMS Lab at https://projects.cs.dal.ca/projectx R EFERENCES  1

Several previous works propose to improve the efìciency of Xenês Credit CPU scheduler For example proposes a modiìcation to the scheduler that asynchronously assigns each virtual CPU to a physical CPU in order to reduce CPU sleep time Lin et al de v eloped that schedules batch workloads within interactive VMs without compromising the usability of interactive applications The drawback of this system is that it was not designed to run on a cluster Xi et al use techniques from Real-Time scheduling to give stricter deadline guarantees to each virtual machine Other work has looked at avoiding interference between these tasks by careful VM placement 23 or dedicating resources P aragon 7 proposes a heterogeneous and interference-aware data center scheduler The system prefers to assign the applications on the heterogeneous hardware platform that the application can beneìt from and have less interference with the co-scheduled applications MIMP extends our preliminary study to reduce interference through minor changes to Xenês scheduler and then uses the residual resources for big data applications To improve I/O performance Xu et al propose the use of cores that have a much smaller time-slice compared to normal cores reducing the overall IRQ processing latency Cheng et al impro v es I/O performance for Symmetric MultiProcessing VMs by dynamically migrating the interrupts from a preempted VCPU to a running VCPU thereby avoiding interrupt processing delays Our current focus is on shared environments where disk I/O is not the bottleneck for interactive applications but view this as important future work Job scheduling in MapReduce environments has focused on topics like fairness 24 and dynamic cluster sharing among users Bu et al 1 propose a ne w hadoop scheduler based on the existing fair scheduler They present an interference and locality-aware task scheduler for MapReduce in virtual clusters and design a task performance prediction model for an interference-aware policy Morton et al provide a time-based progress indicator for a series of Map Reduce jobs which can be used to predict job completion times Polo et al provide a system to dynamically adjust the number of slots provided for map reduce jobs on each host to maximize the resource utilization of a cluster and to meet the deadline of the jobs 19 decides the appropriate number of slots allocated to map and reduce based on the upper and lower bounds of batch workload completion time obtained from the history of job proìling Our work is distinct from prior work in that we estimate the job completion time of the batch jobs that are running in clusters with unpredictable resource availability due to other foreground applications Previous works 9 12 14 ha v e sho wn heterogeneous cluster designs wherein a core set of dedicated nodes running batch jobs are complemented by residual resources from volunteer nodes or in some cases using spot instances from EC2 The closest w ork to ours is by Clay et al The y present a system that determines the appropriate cluster-size to harness the residual resources

 11    Figure 7: Cost estimated per subsystem \(bar chart on top\of one spacecraft  Small Satellite Cost Model \(SSCM\ based on inputs for a candidate nano-satellite mission \(bottom excel spreadsheet   The SSCM model was then used to calculate the total cost of developing and manufacturing only the first small satellite of mass 10 kg and other specifications listed  Figure 7 The cost calculated for every subsystem and the total cost of $15.08 million in FY 2010 is therefore a function of technological variables like power and pointing and not just mass  To check the sensitivity of technology used to cost we varied some of the input parameters and checked its effect on cost in FY97 $million. Changing the data rate from 10 kbps to 10 MBps to 1 GBps resulted in a cost of $11.35 11.4 and 11.45 million respectively Since COTS products will be used to support the communication link these cost estimates imply that there will be only a 100,000 difference in deploying a radio transmitter 10 kbps\ or deploying an optical transmitter \(1 GBps\ on the 10 kg nano-satellite While previous proposals have certainly supported the availability for laser technologies 50   t h e o p tical d e m o n s tr ati o n s  t h at ar e c u r r en tl y  b ei n g  developed by DLR in Germany and the Aerospace Corporation in the US 51  clea r l y  d e m o n s tr ate  th a t t h e  cost of optical technology is more than that Similarly changing the pointing accuracy from 0.1 0.01 to 0.001 degrees resulted in the cost increasing from FY97 $ 6.45 11.33 and 22.21 million respectively The technology to support 0.1 degrees \(sun sensors\ is different from that to support 0.001 degrees star trackers However current COTS quotations \(e.g. Blue Canyon technologies XACT show that it costs 100,000 for a nanosat star tracker system Integration may cost a few additional thousands but estimating it to 18 million more sounds a bit too much  The SSCM sensitivity study above highlights the need to have cost models that are more sensitive to different technologies and their associated complexities Complexity and risk assessment has been proposed by the Aerospace Corporation in the form of their COBRA model  We used the COBRA model in our next study where the methodology and data sets are detailed in \([39   40    5 2     T h e d ata s et r elati v e to  w h ic h  co m p le x ities  ar e  calculated included 120 DoD and NASA missions from after FY89 excluded launch delays or failures and projects with heavy international cooperation. Complexity drivers include  Table 4  column 1 subsystem technical parameters e.g mass power performance technology choices\ and programmatic factors \(e.g., heritage, level of redundancy, foreign partnership  Forty such parameters are considered that are either continuous e.g mass power and represent a range of values bounded by a minimum and maximum, or discrete such as propulsion type \(none, cold gas, monopropellant bipropellant or ion engine\ that represent a finite number of choices    For our smallsat case study, the factors corresponding to spacecraft complexity as they proposed are listed in Table 4 along with the minimum and maximum value that the component takes within their data set The column  candidate nano-satellite which will be a part of a DSM  different 3D angles from the same ground spot as it formation flies in LEO 53  5 4 55    Fo r  ea ch  f ac to r   the complexity of the nanosat is calculated as a percentage of where the data point corresponding to the nanosat lies with respect to the data points for all the other space missions considered. For discrete data, the discrete rank of the data is assessed and then converted into a percentage The average complexity of the proposed nanosat is calculated to be 21.64 


 12  Table 4: Cost estimated for a spacecraft as a function of the relative complexity of its components with respect to components used in previous missions  Based Risk Assessment \(COBRA\ model. Inputs \(Data in Column 3\ are from a candidate nanosatellite mission    The map between complexity percentile and required mission cost and development time for successful missions green triangles is shown in Figure 8  using a green trend line. The missions plotted are among the 120 studied missions and equations are mentioned within the  attempted cheaper than or faster than this model predicts then there is a large probability of failure as highlighted by the red and yellow crosses on Figure 8  Using the above model the estimated cost for our candidate nanosatellite 10 kg mission is 35.824 million and the estimated development time is 35.074 months The high cost is in keeping with the intuition expressed in the data collection section that the cost of LEO small satellites are driven more by technology than mass so the utility of shrinking the satellite should be critically assessed and avoided if the mission technology is very state of art In such cases, micro satellites would win the performance to cost ratio battle    Figure 8: Predicted mission cost and development time as a function of relative mission complexity with respect to other missions evaluated by the Aerospace Corporation [39    4 0     5 2    M is s io n c o m ple x it y  is  a  function of component complexities as calculated in Table 4 The candidate mission is a LEO satellite measuring passive Earth reflectance as part of a DSM  We ran a sensitivity analysis for the COBRA model by varying the deltaV and pointing accuracy required by the candidate satellite It does a great job in predicting the increase in costs from 1 degree to 0.01 or 0.1 degree, by 


 13  estimating a $ 200-250 increase. It overshoots the COTS quotations by a slight margin but is certainly better than the SSCM estimate of  18 million more When the required delta-V is increased from none to 40 m/s to 80 m/s to 120 m/s the respective costs are estimated to be FY97 $ 35.79, 35.82, 35.85 and 35.88 million. Quotations from a 3D cold gas propulsion system printing company called AustinSat revealed that their 1U propulsion unit capable of providing 40 m/s of delta V costs 100,000 with 6DOF thrusters included and would scale almost linearly as more 1U units are added for 40 m/s of more delta-V  The COTS systems therefore cost more than what the COBRA model predicts. The model can thus be improved and made more suitable for COTS-supported small satellites if COTS data and figures were included in the data set to calculate complexity. Since we do not have the data set only the published Figure 8  we could not make the changes  Since many small satellite missions are collaborations between many organizations, the COBRA model could be improved by adding a foreign partnership complexity factor that captures the number of collaborators not just the nationality For example a recent paper 56   formulated a data supported method of capturing international cooperation related complexity using cyclometric  complexity where CGF  0.917  0.0575*CyclometricNumber and CyclometricNumber  f\(nodes, edges, outputs    Figure 9: Cost growth required to support increasing TRL for any component as published in [57    Small satellites are always pushing the boundaries of technology. It is very probable that some of its component values will fall out of range available from past missions In such a case, cost models of TRL transition such as the one shown in Figure 9  57  s h o u ld  b e in co r p o r ated  in to  the COBRA model for the relevant factors Although TRL transition correlates to the spending it does not follow traditional 80-20 rule The COBRA model also does not capture the structural complexity of a small tightly packed satellite which has been theoretically shown to drive development costs. Structural complexity can be quantified using a simple framework shown in Figure 10 35  34   an d  ca n  b e ea s il y  i n tr o d u ce d  i n  t h e COBRA model via a new factor and recalculating the data fit  Capturing the above development costs is important for small satellites whose costs are driven more by technology than by mass. Again, since we do not have the data set \(only the published Figure 8 we could not make the changes   Figure 10 Structural complexity metric introduced and validated in [35  a nd   3 4    5  C ONCLUSIONS    We identify three major problems with current cost and risk models that limit their direct application to estimating the costs of DSMs They are the absence of reliable learning curve factors small satellite 20 kg costing tools and operations costing  Existing models and methodologies that may be applicable in part to DSMs have been identified and presented using an extensive literature survey We select ed  some appropriate methods and applied them to estimate the cost of small satellites and small satellite DSMs The exercise helped us point out valuable insights and/or inconsistencies in the results with respect to the data We also suggest methods to modify the models so that they become more suitable for small satellite DSMs  As future work the operations cost model and dynamic complexity of the mission is expected to be captured by a Systems Dynamics Model Re sults from model simulations can provide insight into the effect of design and operation decisions on lifecycle cost and risk expected to improve upon the Monte Carlo results The model results can guide the trade-off of cost with performance and can help in the se lection of a final point design for any given DSM
