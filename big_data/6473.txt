Semantically based Recommendation by using Semantic Clusters of User s\222  Viewing History   Han Gyu Ko   Eunae Kim   and In Young Ko   Department of Computer Science   and  Division of Web Science and Technology    Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Techn ology KAIST  Daejeon, Republic of Korea  kohangyu, eunae kim iko}@kaist.ac.kr  Deok m oon  Ch ang  Future Technology Lab  Advanced Institute of Technology  in KT   AIT  Seoul, Republic of Korea  dm.chang@kt.com   Abstract 227  Collaborative f iltering 
based recommender  systems assume that if two users have shown similar interest on the same set of contents, they may show  a similar interest pattern  in choosing  future contents  However  users who have certain  tastes o n one specific category of contents may behave differen tly in choosing contents from other categor ies Moreover the collaborative filtering approaches may not work efficiently with sparse data sets, where there are a small number of contents or a limited number of users in the content categories In this pape r to deal with these problems we propose  a novel approach of recommending contents across different categories by 
considering both the semantic information of contents and user interests   The proposed approach uses Linked Data  as the source to find  the a ppropriate semantics of the contents extracted from users\222 viewing history   T he semantic concepts retrieved for the contents are then grouped together into  semantic clusters  based on their similarity and relevance  Our approach recommends potentially inter est ing  contents to general users based on the content consumption trends monitored from leading user groups who most proactively and frequently consume contents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by conducting an 
e xperiment  with  the real wor ld mobile IPTV service data obtained from one of the popular  IPTV service providers in South Korea   Keywords Recommend er  Systestem  User Interest  Mining  Semantic Cluster; Linked Data  I   I NTRODUCTION  As the number and types of Web contents including document s, multimedia contents, and Web services increase personalized recommendation plays an important role to meet the users\222 information needs on the Web. Famous websites such as Amazon and Netflix have successfully improved their sales by using personalized recommendation techniques [1   Most of these commercial recommender systems are 
implemented based on Collaborative Filtering \(CF\, which is the method of considering preferences of multiple users in a collective way. CF assumes that if two users have shown  similar interest on the same set of contents, they may show a similar interest pattern in choosing future contents. CF can recommend potentially interest ing  contents for users by mining users\222 content consuming patterns  2  Because CF relies only on user s\222 behavior of choosing contents without considering the content information, it has a limitation of recommending contents across different content categories [3  F o r in s t an ce   t w o u s er s w h o lik e th e s am e ty p e of movie may have different preference in cho osing TV drama contents  In this case, CF may fail to recommend appropriate contents in the TV  
drama category to the users  In addition  CF based recommend ation  approaches have  the  data sparsity  problem In case  of having various types of contents  CF base d recommendation approache s are  effective only  when they recommend contents from popular  and well known content categorie s rather than from the categories where there are a small number of contents or a limited number of users [4   To deal with these probl ems we have develop ed  a novel approach of recommending contents across different categories by considering both the semantic information of contents and 
user interests   The proposed approach uses Linked Data 1  as the source to find  the appropriate semantic s of the contents extracted from users\222 viewing history   Linked Data contains more than 28 billion  RDF triples from 203 different datasets that are domain independent  11   Especially, w e use  the DBpedia  and  Freebase  datasets as the primary knowledge bases  In addition the Linked Movie Database  dataset  is used  for obtaining semantic information about the content  categories In our approach, the concepts that are retrieved from these sources are grouped together into  
semantic clusters  based on their similar ity and relevance  In this paper, we define a semantic cluster as a group of semantically relevant terms and the relationships among them that represent the essential semantics of a topic area [9   Since the target recommendation domain of our research  is VOD \(Video on Demand\ contents a set of semantic clusters are generated from the keywords that are extracted from user s 222 viewing history  As the first step of recommending contents we identify  a set of leading users  who have watched relatively    1  http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data  83

Figure 4  compares  the number of successfully recommended contents generated by SCR  and the CF based approach  CFR, Collaborative Filtering based Recommendation  We considered the users who watched more tha n one content out of the recommended contents, and the total number of users considered is 5,830. Among these users, in comparison to CFR our approach can generate more successful recommendations for 237 users. Especially, for the users who watched more t han two contents out of the recommended contents SCR  could generate more successful cases 100  users out of 334  users in the range shaded in Figure 4\. We think that the users in the shared region are the users who consume contents actively  SCR  also cove red more content categories for content recommendation  F or 17 users out of the 100 active users SCR  recommended potentially interest ing  contents from various  content categories   C  Threats to Validity  Our experiments have some threats to validity. Firstly the dataset that we used for the experiment covers only two month period. However, the dataset contains viewing history from more than 90,000 users in a practical mobile IPTV domain Secondly  w e only used a limited number of datasets  from Linked Data  such  as DBpedia, Freebase and Linked Movie Database However they  are the most popular datasets and  contain a  large volume of  data  that cover  various types  of content  domains   V  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed a novel approach of recommending potentially interest ing  contents to  users  by using semantic clusters generated from each user\222s viewing history. In our approach, content information is enriched with  semantic clusters by associating the content with the relevant concepts that are retrieved from Linke d Data. The proposed approach finds and recommends potentially interest ing  contents based on the semantic similarity between the content consumption trends of leading user groups and general  users  The main contribution s  of our work are as follows. Firstly  we proposed a framework of utilizing Linked Data to expand keywords extracted from content metadata to semantically enriched information. Secondly, we proposed a way of comparing semantic clusters generated from users\222 viewing history to identify similar  interests of users  In our future research, we will collect more data about  users\222 viewing history as well as the metadata about more number of contents. Especially, viewing history datasets for a longer period  of time  is essential to demonstrate the prac ticality and effectiveness of our approach  in terms of recommending more personalized contents In addition, we will integrate users\222 social network data to identify their implicit interests We expect that it will be possible to produce more personalized semantic clusters from users\222 social network data and to  improve the users\222 satisfaction on the recommended contents that reflect  more personalized  preferences  of the users   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  T h is research was supported by the AIT   Advanced Institute of Tech nology   in KT  Republic of Korea  under the Open R&D program supervised by the KT   R EFERENCES    D.

server which would create a session compute the current shortest paths and return the edge list to the requester with a session identiìer In subsequent requests the requester need only reference the session identiìer and receive a list of edge insertions and deletions since the last query that can be used to keep the requester in sync with the server The visualization corresponding to such a query can be seen in Fig 7\(b We have also used monitor processes to periodically checkpoint the state of the graph to disk for an additional layer of resilience Monitor processes can perform tasks such as checking the consistency of metadata within the data structure to identify errors We provide a monitor process that periodically snapshots a client result store to a MongoDB instance VI C ONCLUSION As data volumes continue to grow it will become impossible to store all raw data that is collected At each time step data will be computed and analyzed and only those elements perceived to be most important will be stored This environment will create the need for new infrastructures and execution models for computation In this paper we have described the STINGER framework for streaming data analytics The system utilizes heterogeneous clusters to ingest data from multiple social media services form in-memory graph representations of relational data store raw data in traditional databases for historical search and give analysts up-to-the-minute insight into a suite of streaming analytics The system design is focused on performance and modularity minimizing latency and increasing throughput The infrastructure that we have described is free and open source software It is BSD licensed and available at www.stingergraph.com  In Figure 7 you will nd screenshots of
