real time recommendation, k n earest  n eighbor g raph, Greedy Filtering    I   I NTRODUCTION  U ser based c ollaborative f iltering algorithm s  are  effective way s  to recommend useful contents to users by exploiting  the intuition that a user will likely prefer  the prefer red items of similar users  More specifically, w hen a user requests a recommendation the  u ser based c ollaborative f iltering scheme 1 predicts the user 222 s preferences for all of the unseen items based on similar users 222  preferences for those items  
In a similar way the i t em based c ollaborative f iltering scheme 2 predicts the preferences of the user for all unseen items based on the preference levels of their similar items  Earlier studies in these areas produced movie recommendations of a high quality compared to baseline algorithms, which could only recommend  the most popular movies or highly rated movies [3   However, predictions are necessary for all unrated movies as well. While such an approach facilitates evaluations of the accuracy of various algorithms using a root mean square error approach, doing so c onsumes a significant amount of query processing time  Moreover, the pre computation time is also long especially for the user based collaborative filtering, as it has to calculate all of the similarity values between users 
 In this paper, we present a fas t Collaborative Filtering algorithm us ing a k nearest  neighbor graph. Not only does this algorithm predict the preferences of only the k nearest neighbor items, but it also shortens the execution time by calculating a k nearest neighbor item graph in a short pe riod  of time by calculating a k nearest neighbor item graph in less time based on greedy filtering We demonstrate that our approach outperforms tra ditional user based/item based collaborative f iltering algorithms in terms of both the preprocessing time and  the  query processing time without sacrificing the level of accuracy   II  R ELATED W ORK  U

 and   are the average rating s  of user u  and neighbor v respectively In addition   is the similarity between u  and v  We use the Pearson c orrelation c oefficient as the similarity measure for the user based Collaborative Filtering algorithm   
 In this equation m  is the number of co rated movies  I tem based collaborative f iltering algorithm s  predict the preferences of items unseen by the user  based on the preference levels  of their similar items  In a similar way, t he predicted rating is defined as follows       Note we use  the adjusted cosine similarity as the similarity measure for item based c ollaborative f iltering  92 


  Here m  denotes  the number of co raters  in this case  Note that the k nearest neighbor s  of user u  are  not identical to the k neighbors which have the highest similarity values in these collaborative filtering algorithms  In the user based collaborative filtering algorithm they are defined as the k nearest users  that  have  rated item i   whereas  in the item based collaborative filtering algorithm, they are defined as the k nearest items that have been rated by user u   E arlier studies in this area indicated that these types of algorithms produced movie recommendation results of a high quality compa red to baseline algorithms, which only recommended the most popular movies or highly rated movies However, these types of algorithms consume considerable amounts of both the preprocessing time and the query processing time; as a pre processing step, user based and item based collaborative filtering algorithms prepare a user by user similarity matrix and an l nearest item graph, respectively When a recommendation is requested, both algorithms have to predict all of the unrated movies. In Section III, we pr esent novel ways to cope with these problems  III  R EAL TIME R ECOMMENDATION  Our approach consists of two main steps: First, we approximately calculate the k nearest item graph based on g reedy f iltering  4 a s a  p re processing step Second, we recommend items to users by using our revised version of N on N ormalized C osine N eighborhood    A  k NN Graph Construction  The construction of the k nearest neighbor graph is a task which involves finding the k  nodes most similar to each node In thi s paper, we  assume that a node is a movie. One of the easiest way s  to construct a k NN graph is to calculate the similarities between all of the nodes and extract the most similar nodes for each node In spite of its simplicity, this brute force approach requires  time complexity, which is burden some when used in conjunction with large amounts  of  data. An alternative way to cope with this problem is to use Inverted Index Join using the fact that us er by item matrices are usually very sparse However, this appr oach is also not sufficient for handling large amou nts of high dimensional data   O ur main idea is to construct an  approximate k nearest neighbor graph based on g reedy f iltering [4  in o rder to speed up this process If there is no decline in the quality of recommendations when we use approximate graphs, we do not have to spend time for building an exact k NN graph T o applying the greedy filtering algorithm, we assume that the nodes \(items\ are represented by vectors. We then filter out vector pairs whose large value dimensions do not match at all  Figure 1 shows an example of g reedy f iltering  There are five  vectors  and the colored portion denotes the high value dimensions, and their values In this example, we do not calculate the similarity between the vector s   and  as they  do not have a common dimension in the colored portion Empir ically, the time complexit y of g reedy f iltering is   Note this algorithm performs much better when we apply the TF IDF weighting scheme. Because it is known that the TF IDF weighting scheme does not decrease the quality of recommendations significantly, we add the following weights for th e user by item matrix        Here   I  is the set of items, and freq\(u  is the number of items rated by user u    B  Fast Recommendation Algorithm  Recall that one of the main drawbacks of user based/item based c ollaborative f iltering schemes is that they have to predict all of the unrated items To tackle this problem w e pre sent the  novel algorithm shown below  We assume that user u  requests a recom mendation  Figure 2.

1  For all unrated item s  i   empty the list of k nearest items of i  2  For all rated item s  i add i to all of list s  of  its k nearest neighbors   3  For all unrated item s  i if the number of its k nearest neighbors is larger than k, delete all except for the most similar k neighbors  4  Then   predict the ratings for the unrated items that have only k nearest neighbors   as follows       sim\(i,j  is the cosine similarity measure defined as follows      The intuiti o n behind this algorithm is that if one of the k nearest neighbors of item i  is item j there would be a high probability that one of the k nearest neighbors of j  is i   Because user by item matrices are usually sparse, this approach can reduce the computational cost of predicting unrated items   IV  E XPERIMENTS  We use the MovieLens  dataset for comparisons   There are 1,000,209 ratings 3,952 movies, and 6,040 users in this database  We follow the testing methodology of the recommender system s  introduced by Cremonesi et al. [3   We divide the ratings into two groups. One group of data  is used for our training set \(98.6% of ratings\, and the other group of data is used for the probe set \(1.4% of ratings The test set consists of five star ratings of the unpopular items \(99.65% of the items in the probe set  Then for each rating of mov ie m  rated by user u  in the test set we randomly select 1,000 movies unrated by u  and recommend the top 10 i tems; if we recommend  m  we refer to this as a hit  Finally, we measure the degree of recall as follows       We consider ed  six  types of algorithms for a comparison User based CF  implements the work by Herlocker et al. [1   Item based CF  implement s the work by Sarwar et al. [2   Our Approach  implements only the fast recommendation algorithm presented in Section III.B and Our Approach, TF IDF appl ies  the TF IDF weighting scheme to the MovieLens datasets and implements the fast recommendation algorithm  Finally Our Approach, TF IDF, GF \(64 and Our Approach, TF IDF, GF 33 implement all of the approaches presented in this paper The percentages inside the parentheses indicate the accuracy of the generated k nearest neighbor graph  We  can change the parameter values that affect the accuracy level during the cons truction of the k nearest neighbor graph. Of course, there is a tradeoff between time and quality  Figure 2  shows that our approach outperforms user based/item based Collaborative Filtering in terms of recall That is to say  fewer rating predictions yield s better results  When we apply the TF IDF weighting scheme to our approach the recommendation quality is slightly improved When we use the approximate k NN gra ph with 33% accuracy instead of an exact k NN graph, the recall is decreased significantly. On  the other hand  the recall does not change  much when we use the grap h with 64% accuracy  Figure 3  shows the comparison result s for these algorithms in terms of the preprocessing time and the query processing  recommendation time for 100 queries Clearly our approach es  significantly outperform existing approa ches in terms of the preprocessing time Also, although the difference between the query execution times of our approaches and that of the item based collaborative filtering algorithm is not great in this figure, these differences grows as the number of nodes scales up   V  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we present a fast Collaborative Filtering algorithm using a k nearest neighbor graph. Not only does this algorithm predict the preferences of only th e k nearest neighbor items, but it decreases the  execution time by calculating a k nearest neighbor item graph in  less time based on greedy filtering  The e xperimental results show that our recommendation al gorithm is much faster than traditional user based/item based  Figure 3.

optimizing likelihood-based measures. Therefore, an AT may be a very specific topic that disambiguates one important aspect of the information need. Ho wever, it is also possible that it is a drifting topic that directs the original information need in a totally incorrect direction. As a result, we can classify ATs into two rising and drifting topic categories. Rising Topics are supposed to increase effectiveness of the query whereas drifting topics do harm on effectiveness of the query Determining a threshold dynamically for an expanded query is difficult and beyond the scope of this paper; in this work, we examine different threshold values empirically and attempt to show this notion of drifting topics would help determining goodness of an expanded query and hence improving retrieval effectiveness IV E VALUATION We now present the results of our experiments on different topic classes. Mainly, we aim at showing that Rising Topics are helpful for generating a more effective query than the original query or the OQTs. In addition, we aim at showing that the concept of topic focus is helpful in selecting topics among the rising topics to form an even more effective query than the rising topics only query We have randomly sampled 103 queries \(patents\ the NTCIR-6 USPTO 4 collection. As the number of documents used to generate topics has to be reasonable, we made sure that each IPC associated with a pate nt included in the collection contains at least 100 documents. For generating topics from both original and expanded queries, we used HDP that is configured to stop at 100 iterations on all queries with 10 burnin iterations, while all other HDP parameters set to the values listed in [13   F o r  f a i r c o m p a r i s o n s b e t w e e n a n  o r i g i n a l q u e r y  and its expanded version, the same number of documents was selected for generating topics for both In order to show that the analysis results depend on different QE methods, we employed two: Wikipedia-based Query Phrase Expansion \(WQPE a nd R e l e vancebased  Language Model \(RM\1  m e t hods Whi l e R M was chosen  because it is a strong probabilisti c model and has been heavily used as the benchmark of QE methods, WQPE is a phrasebased QE method that has proven to be more effective than RM in patent class search. It is interesting to note that both methods have generated much more topics on average \(153 topics for WQPE, and 168 topics for RM\ than the original queries \(11.3 topics\ possible reason is that expanded query terms may retrieve documents from various contexts, which would generate additional topics. Since each of the original queries was quite coherent by itself and the documents added to it all share the same IPCs, on the other hand, it is natural that HDP recognizes fewer topics Our major findings in this paper are summarized in Table 1 Showing three different sets of results \(Original Queries, EQTs after eliminating drifting topics, and EQTs after eliminating drifting topics and then eliminating unfocused topics\over three different patent classification levels \(SC, MG, and SG the table shows the effect of eliminating drifting topics  4 http://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir ntcir-ws8/data-en.html showing an effectiveness improvement in higher classification levels. By eliminating unfocused topics in addition to drifting topics, effectiveness improved on all classification levels to reach at least 13.97% and 11.72% for WQPE and RM respectively, showing higher improvement over EQTs with drifting topics eliminated \(1 3.09% for WQPE compared to 11.28% for RM TABLE 1:Comparison between RM and WQPE effectiveness using their expanded queries, queries generated from rising topics, and queries generated from rising focused topics  RM WQPE Queries \(Baseline SC 50.38 52.88 MG 34.26 35.87 SG 27.9  28.27 EQTs after eliminating Drifting Topics SC 53.62 6.43 55.39 4.75 MG 35.74 4.32 37.7 5.10 SG 28.01 0.39 28.49 0.78 EQTs after eliminating Drifting Topics then eliminating Unfocused Topics SC 59.67 18.44 11.28 63.66 20.39 14.93 MG 41.71 21.75 16.70 42.31 17.95 12.23 SG 31.17 11.72 11.28 32.22 13.97 13.09 As our focus in this paper is identifying drifting topics and showing the effect of removing them, we have conducted a series of experiments trying to identify drifting topics among other topic classes, and then investigate the relationship between effectiveness and the el imination of drifting topics from the expanded queries to prove that it will lead to enhancement in retrieval effectiveness. After several preliminary experiments on coherent and vanishing topics we have realized that expanded query drifting topics exist among appearing topics only, thus further experiments are performed on appearing topics For each of the appearing topics we measured effectiveness by generating a query from the topic terms. As individual topics achieved low effectiveness results we have decided to divide appearing topics accordi ng to their effectiveness and find the most effective amount of appearing topics that will contribute towards generating an effective query. An important act as been concluded that is, by eliminating 75% of the appearing topics, the remaining topics will generate better effectiveness than using all the topics generated from the expanded query. It has been also concluded that those 75% can be safely recognized as drifting topics, as the higher percentage of topics considered among them, the lower obtained effectiveness. On the other hand, the other 25% of the topics 181 


are recognized as the rising topi cs. Complete results of this experiment were omitted for brevity In order to examine the topi c focus importance, rising topics were further sorted according to their focus score, and various percentages have been tested. It has been concluded that selecting the top 25% focused topics among the rising topics will produce a query with higher effectiveness than using rising topics only, or even the original query. Additional experiments on the rising topics, by trying smaller percentages of the most focused topics \(i.e. 18.75%, 12.5%, and 6.25 has been made; however, selecting over-focused topics has proven to harm the reporte d effectiveness. Complete experiments and their full results were also omitted for brevity V CONCLUSIONS We have proposed a new framework where topics of expanded queries can be analy zed. In particular, we showed how drifting topics can be identified in experiments and demonstrated the negative role they play in retrieval effectiveness and positive role of rising topics. It has been proved that topic pairwise simila rities and topic attributes can be significantly useful in identifying different topic classes The main value of the work in this paper lies in the finding of different topic types and the possibility of analyzing expanded queries and selecting useful topics for retrieval effectiveness An obvious limitation in our work is the use of topic effectiveness assuming that we have the relevance judgment basically because our main goal is to study the drifting topics However, we believe that fi nding a replacement for predicting the topic effectiveness represen ts a challenge for our future work. Additionally, we aim at utilizing our analysis for devising a new QE method that utilizes topics instead of ranking documents or terms for expanding queries A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the MSIP \(Ministry of Science ICT & Future Planning\, Korea, under the ITRC \(Information Technology Research Center\ort program \(NIPA-2013H0301-13-3005\ supervised by the NIPA \(National IT Industry Promotion Agency R EFERENCES 1 M.

Figure 4  Payload Allocation Figure 5  Procurement vs Hosted Payloads Hosted payloads vs 100 procurement This case study focuses on the impact of including hosted payloads as part of the system Figure 5 presents an extended representation of the tradespace where hosted payload architectures are included The 002rst immediate conclusion that can be drawn is that based on the cost model from hosted payloads offer the possibility of signi\002cant cost reductions 050between 15 and 30%\051 As a result all architectures on the Pareto front rely on hosted payload architectures On the other hand concerns about using hosted payload assets for critical applications like astronaut support have been 003agged as a major caveat In this case an optimal solution would entail using a portfolio of hosted payloads and privately owned satellites and schedule the communications through ones or the others according to operational constraints Therefore building this portfolio can be done by analyzing what communication payloads are better suited for hosted payload con\002gurations Figure 6 presents the tradespace of architectures that mix hosted payload and procured assets Results indicate that including hosted payload assets in the system does not have a major impact on its performance but requires disaggregating the monolithic satellites identi\002ed as optimal in the previous case study That being the case the next questions arise Figure 6  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets Which payload obtains better savings when being hosted How many payloads do you want to 003y in a hosted payload approach The answer for the 002rst question can be obtained by analyzing the non-dominated architectures from 002gure 6 and estimating the cost savings when hosting the different types of antennas that are considered in this analysis Results indicate that hosting an optical payload can potentially save an 28 of the cost while a low data rate antenna 050S-band\051 only obtains a 16 cost reduction 050note that these numbers are based on the system life-cycle cost and are heavily in\003uenced by the hosted payload cost model\051 Therefore it seems to be more advisable to put high data rate payloads like optical terminals in commercial satellites and retain control of S-band communications 050which in turn ensures that contingency event will be addressed by privately owned assets not constrained by the operational limitations of host platforms\051 Finally 002gure 7 presents the tradespace of hosted payload architectures color coded by the number of antennas that are being hosted By looking at the Pareto front it can be seen that almost all architectures host one single antenna as opposed to two in order to minimize the burden on the host platform This burden is also contingent on the mass and power of the hosted communication payload This is the main reason why optical terminals become so attractive for hosted payload architectures as opposed to low frequency systems that require big parabolic antennas and power ampli\002ers to close the link budgets 6 C ONCLUSION Summary This paper has presented the 002rst set of results obtained through the developed architectural tool to evaluate space communication networks It has 002rst provided a high level overview of the tool with a description of four main constitutive elements An STK model an architecture generator an architecture evaluator and a resource manager Next it has described the newly developed scheduling algorithm based on a rule-based expert system that ef\002ciently allocates the network resources to satisfy near-Earth mission communication requirements Then a discussion on the conducted validation exercise has 11 


Figure 7  Portfolios of hosted payload and procured assets been presented in order to gain some level of con\002dence on the results that the tool outputs This discussion has focused on the validation of the scheduling algorithm by benchmarking it with operational schedules from the TDRSS Finally this paper has presented two case studies for future implementations of the TDRSS system Based on a demand forecast for the network a 002rst case study has considered the problem of selecting the frequency band to be supported and how to allocate them into the relay satellites It has been shown that maximum performance architectures require a mix of optical and RF payloads that support high throughput communications as well as reliable low data rate communications If the traditional procurement strategy is assumed 050NASA buys and operates the relay satellites\051 then monolithic architectures are preferable unless more than two high gain antennas render the resulting satellite con\002guration too complex In turn the second case study has extended this analysis by introducing architectures with hosted payloads It has been shown that according to the current available pricing model hosted payload architectures are clearly preferable than the traditional procurement strategy with cost savings between 15 to 30 for the same level of system performance It has then been discussed the advantages of having mixed procured and hosted payload architectures as a compromise to obtain networks with reduced lifecycle costs that can still address the requirements of highly sensitive and reliable applications Results have demonstrated that high data rate payloads 050speci\002cally optical payloads\051 are the best candidates to be hosted 050with savings up to 28%\051 thanks to their reduced mass and power requirement On the other hand low data rate communication payload should be allocated in privately owned satellites as they require bigger antennas and power ampli\002ers that increase the burden on the host platform Future Work The main streams of future work are as twofold On one hand additional features should be added to the model in order to better capture the complexity of the network con\002gurations 050e.g coupling between the costs of the communication payloads depending on the level of on-orbit processing the they perform\051 Additionally the size of the tradespace is currently limited to less than two thousand architectures due to computational limitations a stringent limitation given the possible combinations from the identi\002ed architectural decisions The solution currently under development is to include a genetic algorithm that alleviates this problem by iteratively generates new populations of architectures by combining the best previously evaluated networks On the other hand the other main stream of future work is related to exercising the tool in a variety of architectural decisions and mission scenarios In the presented case studies only geosynchronous constellations were considered although the tool allows comparing them with systems that place relays in MEO and LEO orbits Additionally the tool can also provide insight in valuing inter-satellite links and how the cost of putting in orbit their extra communication payloads can be leveraged by reducing the number of operating ground stations Moreover couplings between the payload allocation and fractionation strategy should also be further explored so as to understand if monolithic architectures still become preferable if relay satellites can be decomposed in clusters of independent antennas and payloads Finally supplementary what-if analysis can be conducted based on 0501\051 the demand forecast for the 2020-2030 time frame 0502\051 granted spectrum allocations to NASA and 0503\051 technology improvements that increase the spectral ef\002ciency of the communication payloads 12
