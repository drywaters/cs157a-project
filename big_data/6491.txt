Realistic Team Formation using Navigation and Homophily  Kareem Kamel    Zaher Al Aghbari  Department of Computer Science   University of Sharjah  kamel.kareem@gmail.com  zaher@sharjah.ac.ae  Ibrahim Kamel  Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Univ ersity of Sharjah  kamel sharjah.ac.ae Abstract 227 227  This paper propose s  an algorithm for selecting a team of expert s  from a social network, which is represented by a weighted undirected graph. Each node in the graph represents an individual who has one or 
mo re skills We introduce the concept of realistic team formation and its associated constraints and assumptions The main constraint is a local view of the network resulting in an absence of pre computed network statistics Nodes in the network are assumed to connect to people with whom they share common skills. Thus, this paper proposes a navigation based team formation algorithm that makes use of homophily to recruit candidates for the team The objective is to create an effective team that can carry out a  specific task Since none of the related work has had a lo cal view of the network, we use 
 BfsRecruiter a BFS based navigation algorithm  as our baseline comparison We implemented the proposed algorithm and ran many simulation experiments to measure the c ommunication cost and effectiveness  of the proposed algorithm  Keywords 227 s ocial network  analysis  team formation; graph navigation  graph processing  1  I NTRODUCTION  Social networks such as Facebook, LinkedIn MySpace, an d others can be used as a medium  to co nnect people 
It provides a great platform for recruitment agencies looking for candidates to fulfill their job openings. Since possible candidates would be connected to other professi onals from their alma mater, it provides an excellent platform for findi ng multiple candidates for multiple job openings or entire multi skilled teams for a specific project  This paves the road for the topic of Team Formation in social networks  Social networks can be visualized as a graph where the nodes represent a relatio nship between them, e.g., friends in Facebook  Normally relations 
and friendships are established when there are interest, communities or geographical locations in common  To build a successful team for a certain project many factors should be taken into c onsideration. In our work we consider a social network  that consists of people  nodes\ and relationships \(edges\. An edge between two nodes means tha t two nodes are friends Ev ery node  has a set of skills and the network is assumed to be of experts in thei r fields  This paper introduces a homophily based navigation algorithm for team formation in thrid party social networks. This work also defines the 
term realistic social network team formation. Using the formulation of a social network, the proposed formu lation leads to an unweighted undirected graph G\(V,E Since none of the previous work in the specific application has studied the effects of team formation where there is an impartial local view of the network, we will use Breadth first Search \(BFS\ as a baseline for the sake of comparison. The algorithm is able to find short paths even though they know very little about the target individual or the network  We identify  two network characteristics that can 
be used to guide navigation    The first is homophi ly  the similarity between the two sets of skills of two nodes People tend to be acquainted with other people who have similar skills or the same occupation. In this paper, the homophily of two nodes is computed as the distance between the two skill vecto rs. This distance is calculated using the WordNet ontology    The second is the existence of high degree nodes Some people have a large number of acquaintances and act as hubs that connect different social circles  Both of these characteristics are widely 
observed in real world networks, and both lead directly to navigation algorithms. Consideration of homophily gives rise to a navigation algorithm that visits the neighbor that is the most similar to the target node e.g., a java programmer who is friends w ith a target C++ programmer\. The consideration of degree enables us to locate communities or clusters of a specific skill by starting from the node with the highest degree. This latter characteristic is outside 197

4  S MART R ECRUITER A LGORITHM  This section will  explain the team formation algorithm and the methodology  behind it  Figure 1 Sample social network consisting of nodes and their respective friendships and skills  A  Uninformed Search vs. Informed Search  The most basic and na\357ve version of navigation is one that is uninformed Such an algorithm can only make use of the knowledge provided in the se arch problem. The choice of which fringe node to expand depends on  the characteristics  of  its path such as depth and cost  In graph theory, there are two such algorithms that fit the description, n amely Breadth First Search \(BFS\ and Depth First Search D FS   BFS starts from the root selecting some node as the root in the graph and expands its neighbors first before moving on to the next level DFS starts from the root  selecting some node as the  root in the graph and explores as far as possible along e ach branch before  backtracking  BFS is better suited for the  scope of social network analysis. Thus the baseline algorithm for team formation using navigation will use BFS to traverse the network and find the candidate node  Our team formation is of the l atter type of search a lgorithms, informed search. Informed search exploits additional knowledge about the problem that helps direct search explore more promising paths. They  expand the fringe node with lowest cost according to an evaluation f unct i on called  a heuristic h\(n  From this class of algorithms, we will use Greedy Best First Search in this paper, as it is the simplest form of informed search for the type of graph used by our network setup  Inspired by BFS and Greedy Best First Search the follow ing team formation algorithms build on its foundation  SmartRecruiter  an informed heuristic search algorithm that navigates through the most promising paths  Best first search works by estimating the promise of node   by a heuristic evaluation func tion  h n  which, in this case  is based on homophily that compares the similarity or dissimilarity  of a node and th e set of skills we seek T       BfsRecruiter a baseline algorithm that navigates and searches based on Breadth First Search  BFS  algorithm  forming teams   BFS navigates the socia l network  in search of a single candidate node to satisfy a subset of task T  It is then successively repeated  with the remaining skills   until all skills in the task T  are satisfied  B  SmartRecruiter An informed sear ch  We will use the example network in  Figure 1  to expla in the operation of SmartRecruiter   Let us start by taking an example. A manager at TransAtlantic Systems decides to form a team of experts in order to design a new router device. He decides that the skills needed for this task are Algorithms, AI Machine Learning, C The manager is looking for a small and efficient team to carry out this project. Of course, the size of the team directly affects the cost of the  project. Smaller teams tend to cost less. A team where the friendships between its members are of a lower degree has lower communication cost   W e will assume the set of possible candidates in the network. Given a task T  Algorithms AI Machine Learning C  which is subset of the superset  of all skills   Throughout t he rest of this paper, we will refer to a candid ate with the more general term n ode Let\222s assume node E as our root Node E  is pushed into the priority queue ToVis it  resulting in T oVisit  E  Node E  is then removed from the front of the queue and processed Node E  has skills  Networking, Computer Security Cryptography  Notice that node E  has none of the skills that we are looking for. The processing of this node is complete and a ll its neighbors are inserted into ToVisit     The order that these nodes are arranged in the priority queue is decided by a heuristic decision function based on homophilies  As mentioned earlier in this section, the most intuitive homophily for this specific network setup is one that is based on an individual\222s skills. In a professional network, we would e xpect data mining specialists to be connected together, UI designers to be connected together with possible sparse links between the two communities. It follows that the Artificial Intelligence community would have good relations with the Robotics communit y. T his relation can be found in  an  ontology An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a  domain and the relationships between those concepts We use the WordNet ontology to deduce that Robotics and Artificial Intelligence share a common ancestor This deduction is done using the Wu Palmer semantic similarity function   7  Wu Palmer is based on path length. It counts th e number of nodes C++, Machine Learning, Data Mining  Robotics, Fluid Mechanics Rheology  199 


or relation links between nodes in a taxonomy The lower the distance between two concepts the higher their similarity. Thus we introduce the following heuristic function to order the nodes in the priority queue      1   where  is the node with ID i  contains the unfulfilled skills of task T Wup is the Wu Palmer semantic similarity func tion  and  represent individual skills for each node  and remainder of the task  respectively  and  are the number of no des and number of skills in    respectively and i, j  and k  are indices. To calculate the homo phily of node  and the remain ing subset of the original task we determine the distance vector of a node 222s skills and  We find the maximum skill similarity pair for each task skill, sum them and divide them by the number of skills gi ving us an average measure of similarity for each node in the priority queue  Going back to  Figure 1 the state of th e priority queue is ToVisit = {D A, C  Node D  and node A  both have the same number of relevant skil ls; node A  has AI, Algorithms, Java  while nod e D  has AI Machine Learning Robotics  AI, Algorithms  and Machine Learning  are given a  semantic  similarity score of 1.0 while Java  is similar to C  and gets a  semantic similarity score  of 0.8  It looks lik e the homophilies of node A  and node D  are equal However, node D  has the additional skill of Robotics   which is  an application of AI  Robotics  will compare with AI  and result in a decent semanti c similarity score giving node D  an edge over node A  and thus  a bett er rank. Node C  has Distributed Systems Networking Optimization skills that are semantically far from the remaining task  Thus node D  will be processed first. Node D  is chosen for Machine Learning  and AI then removed from the queue and its nei ghbors added  to ToVisit The  team   now contains D  ToVisit now contains A F, B C  and  contains Algorithms, C  Even though Node F  and A  have the same homophily score, the priority queue data structure respects insertion order thus node A having be en in the queue longer than node F  will remain in the first position.  Since n ode  A  has the highest priority, it is removed from the queue to be  processed Node A  is chosen for Algorithms  and is added to the team    Recall that our objective is to  find a connected subgraph team in order to have a bounded communication cost Since node E  is the only path between the existing team    D  and node A  node E  must be adde d to the team as well. This addition al node  will be  considered as a commun ication cost penalty  Since node E  has no neighbors no new nodes are added to ToVisit   C  remains to be fulfilled in our task  Node F  is processed next. Node F  has the skills C Machine Learning, Data Mining  Since we\222re still looking for C  node F  is chosen for C  and added to the team  and its neighbor node G  added to the queue  Since task is now empty, it has been satisfied and the chosen  team    D, A, F   5  E XPERIMENTS AND D ISCUSSION  In this section, we discuss and compare the results that were obtained when the two team formation  algorithms are run on realistically synthetic networks  We mainly test our results on synthetic networks constructed using Power L aw  This experiment tests the team finding algorithms on a multitude of networks with varying characteristics  5.1  N ETWORK G ENERATION  One of the  main  challenges of social network mining  is finding a real world social network with the  meta data that we need. The other alternative was to try and generate a  synthetic network that would mimic a real world social network  This way we wouldn\222t have to go through  unavoidable problem of wrestling with metadata modifications But how do we dec ide  which nodes becomes friends? How many connections would each node have? On what basis are connections between two nodes formed   Our synthetic networks were built with a number of parameters that would allow us to customize the network\222s structure    N et work  s ize  The number of nodes that make up the network    Min imum number of f riends  The least number of connections that any node can have    Max imum number of f riends   The largest number of connections that any node can have    Skill u niverse  The universe of  skills that each node will have a subset of    Skills per node  The number of skills each node will be proficient in    M atch  t ype  Indicates whether the shared skills of two nodes  and  are the exact same skill or a similar skill \(e g.

  Similarity constraint   The minimum number of shared skills between two nodes required for a connection to exist between them  Our social network generator uses a  Power Law  Zipfian distribution  function to gener ate the edges  between the nodes The network is  a n unweighted undirected  graph G  a social network\hat consists of 1000 nodes   The Java Universal Network Graph JUNG  is used for these experiments    Now that we have a customizable social network generator, we are able to va ry the network\222s parameters introduced in  Section  5.1  to test TeamFinder on a variety if networks. We experiment with three  different networks with their resp ective parameters, as  shown in  Table 1    Table 1 A comparison of the synthetic networks formed and their respective parameters  Parameters  Network  A  B  C  Network Size \(nodes  1000  1000  1000  Min f riends \(edges  2  2  2  Max f riends \(edges  35  35  35  Skil ls u niverse \(skills  50  50  50  Skills per node \(skills  4  5  7  Min. num  of similar skills  2  2  2   5.2  P ERFORMANCE   S MART R ECRUITER  N AVIGATION  VS    B FS R ECRUITER  N AVIGATION     Figure 2 Performance gain of SmartRecruiter vs. BfsRecruite r  Recall that the main goal is to create a team with the required skill levels and a team that can work together effectively and efficiently. Therefore two measures which will be used to evaluate the possible fitness of the teams   1  Social  c loseness  of th e team. These are people that actually know each other in the outside world, whether they are family friends, colleagues or an acquaintance Since the chosen team is will always be a connected subgraph w e use the diameter of the team subgraph as a measur e of social closeness  2  Team s ize  refers to the number of team members that have been chosen. Smaller teams are easier to manage than larger teams  Each team formation algori t hm is run on the three  networks  The algorithms are run offline and thus run time is not very crucial  Each algorithm is tested 200 times for each task size, starting from a different node every time The team formation  algorithm will take as input a subset of skills, Task   and crawl through the network searching for the subgraph team Figure 3  shows the size of the result ing team as a function of Task Size number of skills in task As the plot  shows, the siz e of the team increases sub linearly  with the number of required skills  In this paper  a constraint is put on the number of skills contributed by each candidate. A candidate may  only  contribute one skill  to wards fulfillment of the task   5.3  E VALUATING THE Q UALITY OF THE TEAMS FORMED  The quality of the chosen team is measured by studying the worst case communication cost  The smaller the size the better and more efficient the team is in terms of communication be tween the team members Figure 4  shows the average team formation cost as a function of the number of skills The x axis represents the number of skills in a task and the y axis represents the diameter of the  resulting  team    5.4  E FFECT OF THE T ASK S IZE ON THE N UMBER O F H OPS  TRAVELLED  Here  we will evaluate the performance of our SmartRecruiter  algorithm. Since none of the previous work has  studied the effects of team formation where there is an impartial local view of the network, we will use Breadth first Search \(BFS  as a baseline for the sake of comparison. Thus this 201 


experiment will compare between two team formation algorithms    SmartRecruiter an informed heuristic search algorithm that navigates through the most promising paths   BfsRecruiter  baseline algorithm th at forms teams based on breadth first search algorithm  This experiment will study the above algorithms and evaluate their per formance by studying the number of h ops  traversed by each algorithm   T his will measure the number of hops traversed by each algorithm in search of a suitable team. Every node visited in the social network is counted as a hop     Figure 3 Comparison of team sizes formed by SmartRecruiter  vs BfsRecr uiter    Both algorithms were run on the three  networks introduced in  Section 5  Different task sizes from 3  to 18 were created a s a permutation of the 50 skills   Figure 4 Number of hops travelled by SmartRecruiter  vs BfsRecruiter   universe T he two team formation algorithms in question were each given the same permutation of Task T  for each task size in [3 a nd a s ke d t o f i nd a team that satisfies the task. The experiment for  each was repeated 200 times with a random starting node for each run  Figure 4  shows the  results obtained from this experiment It can be noticed from first glance that  the number of hops traversed by  SmartRecruiter  is consistently less  than those traversed by  BfsRecruiter  In fact, we can conclude from  Figure 2  that the paths travelled by SmartRecruiter  before locating the team are around 40% to 60 shorter than the paths taken by  BfsRecruiter   5.5  A  COMPARISON BETWEEN  NETWORKS  OF DIFFERENT  DENSITIES  NUMBER OF CONNECTIONS   The three synthetic networks used i n this experiment differ in the number of skills each node has. The larger the number of skills a node has, the greater the possibility of first degree connections a node can have Thus, this parameter will indirectly affect the density of the network and the ease at which teams are found. In other words t he denser the network is the smaller the number of hops travelled by the navigation algorithm This phenomenon is displayed in  Figure   5    Figure   5 Comparing number of hops travelled by navigation algorithms on networks with A:4, B:5, C 7 skills per  node  Likewise, the density of the network affects the diameter of the newly formed team  Recall from Section 5.2  that the social closeness of the team is evaluated using the diameter of the subgraph i.e. the formed team  In the network with four  skills per node, the diameter of the formed team is longer on average than the networks with five  and sev en  skills per node.  Networks made up of nodes with less number of skills will result in a smaller number of possible connections, thus a relatively sparser network. Sparser networks  will have fewer connections thus leaving the team formation  202 


algorithms wi th a smaller number of  traversable  paths. The path that joins the team    a,c,d,g,h  will increase in length Longer paths means  that  chosen nodes might be further apart thus increasing the diameter resulting in less \223social closeness\224 within the team This phenomenon is shown  in  Figure 6      Figure 6  Comparing diameters of teams formed on networks with A:4, B:5, C:7 skills per node   6  C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE WORK   We have introduced the scenario  of  realistic team formation  and our proposed method based on informed navigation. Given the nature of the connections implying a certain level of similarity the proposed algorithm SmartRecruiter  uses homophily to prioritize the order in which nodes are visited The proposed algorithm is compared with the baselin e BfsRecruiter  and the results obtained show a 40% to 60% increase in performance on average In the future, we will limit the number of skills contributed to by each node, adding a maximum capacity. We will also study a numeber of other navigation algorit hms and analyze their performance  R EFERENCES  1  T. Lappas  K. Liu, E.

factor equal to the known lower bound In the authors ar gue that the data locality may not be relevant anymore because with 100G or more adapters the performance bottleneck will be at the disk I/O rather than the network interface However unless we can avoid the oversubscription on the link capacities in the network inside a data center the network bottleneck can cause high access latency for remote data Moreover some researchers suggest that disks be replaced with ash memory or even DRAM as the primary storage in the future In such en vironments the performance bottleneck of data access could reemerge in the network interface and an ef“cient VM placement algorithm continues to be required for minimizing the access latency between data and computation nodes VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we investigated the placement problem of VMs for DNs termed VMPDN and its variant termed sVMPDN which are initially introduced and shown not to admit any approximation algorithm with a factor smaller than two in  VMPDN asks for the assignment of DNs to VMs with the minimum maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM and among all pairs of assigned VMs such that each DN is assigned to a single VM and each VM is not assigned to more than one DN In sVMPDN the maximum access latency among all pairs of a DN and its assigned VM is minimized while ensuring that the maximum access latency among all pairs of assigned VMs maximum inter-VM latency is bounded To the best of our knowledge no approximation algorithms have been proposed for VMPDN and sVMPDN in the literature so far We initially proposed a 3-approximation algorithm Algorithm 1 and subsequently proposed a 2-approximation algorithm Algorithm 2 that is an optimal approximation algorithm for VMPDN in the price of higher time complexity Furthermore we also showed that with a slight modi“cation Algorithm 2 can become a 1  2 approximation algorithm for sVMPDN In other words Algorithm 2 can be slightly modi“ed for obtaining an optimal solution of sVMPDN through a violation of the maximum inter-VM latency constraint by a factor of at most two We conducted simulations to evaluate the performance of Algorithms 1 and 2 based on four network architectures inside a data center including Tree VL2 Fat-Tree and BCube discussed in The simulation results sho wed that both Algorithms 1 and 2 make approximately optimal assignments of DNs to VMs In addition the simulation results also showed that although Algorithm 1 has a worse approximation factor Algorithm 1 performs as well as Algorithm 2 in terms of the maximum access latency in almost all cases R EFERENCES  Applying the cloud to big data storage Online A v ailable
