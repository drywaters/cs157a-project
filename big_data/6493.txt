Although a text document expresses a wide range of information, but it lacks the imposed structure of tradition database. Thus 
unstructured data, particularly free running text data has to be transferred into a structu red data. Hence, in this paper we represent the text document unconventionally by making use of symbolic data analysis concepts. We propose a new method of representing documents based on clustering of term frequency vectors.  Term frequency vectors of eac h cluster are used to form a symbolic representation by the use of Mean and Standard Deviation. Further, term frequency vectors are used in the form a interval valued features. To cluster the term frequency vectors, we make use of Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage, K Means and Fuzzy C Means clustering algorithms. To corroborate the efficacy of the proposed model we conducted extensive experimentations on 
standard datasets like 20 Newsgroup Large, 20 Mini  N ewsgroup, Vehicles Wikipedia dataset s and our own created datasets like Google Newsgroup and Research Article Abstracts. Experimental results reveal that the proposed model gives better results when compared to the state of the art techniques. In addition, as the method is based on a simple matching scheme, it requires a negligible time  Keywords  Classification   Text Documents   Representation   Clustering Algorithms   I   I NTRODUCTION   Text classification is one of the important research issues in the field of text mining, where the documents are  classified with a supervised knowledge. Based on a likelihood of the training set, a new document is classified 
The task of text classification is to assign a boolean value to each pair   ji dk DK  where  D  is th e domain of documents and  K  is a set of predefined categories. The task is to approximate the true function  1 0 DK by means of a function   1 0 DK such that  and  coincide  as much as possible. The function   
is called a classifier. A classifier can be built by training it systematically using a set of training documents D where all of the documents belonging to D  are labeled according to K 1 2  The major challenges and difficulties that arise in the problem of text classification are: High dimensionality thousands of features\, variable length, content and quality of the documents, sparse distribution of terms in documents loss of correlation between adjacent words and understanding complex semantics of terms in a document  To tackle these problems a number of methods have been reported in literature for effective  classification of text documents. Many representation schemes like binary representation 4 ontology  
N Grams  multiword terms as vector 7 UNL 8 are proposed as text representation schemes for effective text classification. Also in 9  1 0 a new representation model for the web documents are proposed. Recently    12  used bayes formula to vectorize a document according to a probability distribution reflecting the probable categories that the document may belongs to. Although many rep resentation models for the text document are available in literature, the Vector Space Model \(VSM\ is one of the most popular and widely used models for document representation 13  Unfortunately, the major limitation of the VSM is the loss of correlation  and context, of each term which are very important in understanding the document. To deal with these problems, Latent Semantic Indexing \(LSI\ was proposed by 
 The LSI is optimal in the sense of preserving the global geometric structure of a document space. However, it might not be optimal in the sense of discrimination  Thus, to discover the discriminating structure of a document space, a Locality Preserving Indexing \(LPI\ is proposed in  An assumption behind LPI is that, close inputs should  have similar documents. However, the computational complexity of LPI is very expensive. Thus it is almost infeasible to apply LPI over very large dataset. Hence to reduce the computational complexity of LPI; Regularized Locality Preserving Indexing \(RLPI  has been proposed in 16 The RLPI is being significantly faster obtains similar or better results when compared to LPI. This makes the RLPI an efficient and effective data preprocessing method for large 
scale text classification 16   However the RLPI f ails to preserve the intraclass variations among the documents of the different classes Also in case of the RLPI, we need to select the number of dimensions m to be optimal. Unfortunately we cannot say that the selected m value is optimal. Also, in conventional supervised classification an inductive learner is first trained on a training set, and then it is used to classify a testing set about which it has no prior knowledge. However, for the classifier it  would be ideal to have the information about the distribution of the testing samples before it classifies them Thus in this paper, to deal with the problem of learning from 210 


training sets of different sizes, we exploited the information derived from clust ers of the term frequency vectors of documents  Clustering has been used in the literature of text classification as an alternative representation scheme for text documents. Several approaches of clustering have been proposed. Given a classification proble m, the training and testing documents are both clustered before the classification step. Further, these clusters are used to exploit the association between index terms and documents 17 In  words are clustered into groups based on distribution of c lass labels associated with each word. Information bottle neck method is used to find a word cluster that preserves the information about the categories. These clusters are used to represent the documents in a lower dimensional feature space and na\357ve baye s classifiers are applied 19 Also, in   information bottleneck is used to generate a document representation in a word cluster space instead of word space where words are viewed as distributions over document categories   proposed an information  theoretic divisive algorithm for word clustering and applied it to text classification. Classification is done using word clusters instead of simple words for document representation. Two dimensional clustering algorithms are used to classify text documen ts in 21 In this method, words/terms are clustered in order to avoid the data sparseness problem. In 22 clustering algorithm is applied on labeled and unlabeled data and introduces new features extracted from those clusters to the patterns in the lab eled and unlabeled data. The clustering based text classification approach in   first clusters the labeled and unlabeled data. Some of the unlabeled data are then labeled based on the clusters obtained  All in all, the above mentioned clustering based c lassification algorithms work on conventional word frequency vector. Conventionally the feature vectors of term document matrix \(very sparse and very high dimensional feature vector describing a document\ are used to represent the class. Later, this matrix  is used to train the system using different classifiers for classification. Generally, the term document matrix contains the frequency of occurrences of terms and the values of the term frequency vary from document to document in the same class. Hence to preserve these variations, we propose a new interval representation for each document. We have made an initial attempt in giving an interval representation by using maximum and minimum values of term frequency vectors for the documents  3  In this paper we are using mean and standard deviations to give the interval valued representation for documents. Thus, the variations of term frequencies of document within the class are assimilated in the form of interval representation Moreover conventional data ana lysis may not be able to preserve intraclass variations but unconventional data analysis such as symbolic data analysis will provide methods for effective representations preserving intraclass variations The recent developments in the area of symbolic dat a analysis have proven that the real life objects can be better described by the use of symbolic data, which are extensions of classical crisp data 25   Thus these issues motivated us to use symbolic data rather than using a conventional classical crisp d ata to represent a document  To preserve the intraclass variations we create mul tiple clusters for each class Term frequency vectors of documents of each cluster are used to form an interval valued feature vector  With this backdrop, in our previous work  3  we made an initial attempt towards application of symbolic data concepts for text document representation. In this paper the same work is extended towards creating multiple representatives per class using clustering before symbolic representation  The  rest of the paper is organized as follows: A detailed literature survey and the limitations of the existing models are presented in section 1. The working principle of the proposed method is presented in section 2. Details of dataset used, experimental se ttings and results are presented in section 3. The paper is concluded along with future works in section 4  II  P ROPOSED M ETHOD  The proposed method has two stages  A   Cluster based representation of documents and  B   Document classification stage   A  Cluster ba sed representation  In the proposed method, initially documents are represented by term document matrix. The obtained term document matrix is of very high dimension and huge sparse matrix. We employ regularized locality preserving indexing RLPI\imensiona lity reduction technique, to reduce to a lower dimension. Unfortunately, the RLPI features of documents of a class have considerable intraclass variations Thus, we propose to have an effective representation by capturing these variations through clusterin g and representing each cluster by an interval valued feature vector called symbolic feature vector as follows  The training documents of each class are first clustered on RLPI features. Let 123    n DD D D be a set of n documents of a document cluster say j C  1 2,3 jN  N denotes the number of clusters\ and let M be the number of classes and let 123    i i i i im F ff f f be the s et of m features characterizing the document i D of a cluster j C Let jk  1 2 km be the mean of the th k feature val ues obtained from all n documents of a cluster j C   i.e  1 1 n jk ik i f n     1   Similarly, let jk  1 2 km  be the standard deviation of the th k  feature values obtained from all the n documents of the cluster j C   211 


i.e  1 2 2 1 1 n jk ik jk i f n    2   Now, we recommend capturing intraclass variations in each th k  feature values of the th j cluster in the form of an interval valued features  jk jk ff where jk jk jk f  jk jk jk f Thus, each interval  jk jk ff  representation depends upon mean and its standard deviation of respective individual features of a cluster. The interval  jk jk ff represents the upper and lower limits of feature value of a document cluster in the knowledgebase. Now  the reference document for a cluster j C is formed by representing each feature 1 2 km  in the form of an interval and it is given by  11 2 2      j j j j j jm jm RF f f f f f f   3  Where 1 2 jN  rep resents the number of clusters of documents samples of a class. It shall be noted that unlike conventional feature vector, this is a interval valued features and this symbolic feature vector is stored in the knowledgebase as a representative of the th j cluster. Thus the knowledgebase has N number of symbolic vectors representing clusters corresponding to a class   B  Document Classification  The document classification proposed in this  work considers a test docume nt, which is described by a set of m feature values of type crisp and compares it with the corresponding interval type feature values of the respective cluster stored in the knowledge base. Let 12   i i i im F ff f be a m dimensional feature vector describing a test document  Let j RF be the interval valued symbolic feature vector of th j cluster of th l class. Now, each th m feature value of the test document is compared with the corresponding interval in j RF to examine whether the feature value of the test document lies within the corresponding interval. The number of features of a test docum ent, which fall inside the corresponding interval, is defined to be the degree of belongingness. We make use of Belongingness Count c B as a measure of degree of belongingness for the test document to decide its class label   1  m c ik jk jk k B Cf f f  and    4    ik jk jk Cf f f 1  0 ik jk ik jk if f f and f f Else    The crisp value of a test document falling into its respective feature interval of the reference class contributes a value 1 towards c B and there will be no contribution from other features which fall outside the interval. Similarly, we compute the c B value for all clusters of remaining classes and the class label of the cluster which has highest c B  value will be assigned to the test document as its label. Further there may be chances of having the same c B value for two or more classes. Under such circumstances we recommend to resolve the conflict by making use of  the similarity measure proposed by  to measure the similarity between the test feature vector q R and the th j class representative j R as given by  1 _       m q j ql jl jl l Total Sim R R Sim f f f   5  Here   jl jl ff represents the th l feature interval of the th j class, and   ql jl jl Sim f f f 1  ql jl ql jl if f f and f f  6   max 1 1 1 1 ql jl ql jl Otherwise f f f f   Similarity values of the test  document with all k classes are computed and then the test document is classified to be a member of the class for which it has a highest similarity value  III  E XPERIMENTAL S ETUP  A  Datasets  To test the efficacy of the proposed model, we have used the following five datasets. The first dataset is standard 20 Newsgroup Large. It contains 20000 documents categorized into 20 classes. The second  dataset is a standard 20 M ini N ewsgroup dataset which contains about 2000 documents evenly divided among 20 Usenet discussion groups. This dataset is a subset of 20 N ewsgroups which contains 20,000 documents. In 20 Mini  Newsgroup, each class contains 100 documents in 20 classes which are randomly picked from original dataset  The third  dataset consists of vehicle characteristics extracted from wikipedia pages V ehicles   W ikipedia\. The dataset contains 4 categories that have low degrees of similarity. The dataset contains four categories of vehicles: Aircraft, Boats, Cars and Trains. All the four catego ries are easily differentiated and every category has a set of unique key words. The fourth dataset is constructed by a text corpus of 1000 documents that are downloaded from Google Newsgroup. Each class contains 100 documents 212 


belonging to 10 different cla sses \(Business, Cricket, Music Electronics, Biofuels, Biometrics, Astronomy, Health, Video Processing and Text Mining\. The fifth dataset is a collection of R esearch A rticle A bstracts. All these research articles are downloaded from the scientific web por tals. We have collected 1000 documents from 10 different classes. Each class contains 100 documents  B  Experimentation  In this section, we present the results of the experiments conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on all the fiv e datasets viz., 20 N ewsgroup L arge, 20 M ini N ewsgroup  V ehicles W ikipedia G oogle N ewsgroup and R esearch A rticle A bstracts. During experimentation, we conducted two different sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we used 50% of the documen ts of each class of a dataset to create training set and the remaining 50% of the documents for testing purpose. On the other hand, in the second set of experiments, the numbers of training and testing documents are in the ratio 60:40. Both experiments are  repeated 5 times by choosing the training samples randomly. As measures of goodness of the proposed method we computed classification  accuracy. The minimum maximum and the average value of the classification accuracy of all the 5 trials are presented in  Table 1 to Table 5   For both the experiments, we have randomly selected the training documents to create the symbolic feature vectors for each class. While conducting the experimentation we have varied the number of features m emp irically selected through RLPI from 1 to 30 dimensions. For each obtained dimension we create cluster based interval representation as explained in section 2.1 At this juncture, we used Single Linkage, Complete Linkage, Average Linkage, K Means and Fuzzy  C Means \(FCM\ clustering algorithm s  to create a cluster based symbolic representation However, it can be observed from the Table 1 to Table 5, Fuzzy C Means FCM\ clustering algorithm achieved a better results \(for 3 clusters The reason behind this is FCM has its  ability to discover cluster among the data, even when the boundaries among the data are overlapping. Also   FCM based techniques have the advantage over the conventional statistical techniques like NN classifier, maximum likelihood estimate etc  because its distribution is free and no knowledge about the distribution of data is required 26 A comparative analysis of the proposed method with other state of the art techniques using standard classifiers and benchmark datasets is given in Table 6 The number 3 in the bracket indicates the number of clusters selected \(empirically selected From the Table 6 it is analyzed that the proposed method achieves better classification accuracy  IV  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, a simple and efficient symbolic text c lassification is presented A  text document is represented by the use of symbolic features  Term frequency vectors of each cluster are used to form a symbolic representation by the use of interval valued features To check the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method extensive experimentation is conducted on various datasets The experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the other existing methods  With the successful application of concepts of symbolic data to text classi fication, it is our firm belief that this work will open up new avenues to exploit the concepts of symbolic data for effective text representation  In future, our research will emphasize in enhancing the ability and performance of our model by considering other parameters to effectively capture the variations between the classes, which in turn improves the classification accuracy Along with this, we have a plan of exploiting other similarity/dissimilarity measures, selection of dynamic threshold value and studying the classification accuracy for the varying dimensions. Besides we are also targeting towards the study of complexity issues of the proposed model with the existing representation models   R EFERENCES     Seabastiani, F, \223Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization\224, ACM Computing Surveys.

These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
