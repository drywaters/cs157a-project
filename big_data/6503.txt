Behavior Signature for Big Data Traffic Identification   Sung Ho Yoon, Jun Sang Park  and Myung Sup Kim  Dept. of Computer and Information Science  Korea University  Korea  sungho_yoon, junsang_park, tmskim}@korea.ac.kr  ChaeTae Lim  and JunHyung Cho  Korea Internet Security Center  Korea Internet & Security Agency  Korea   scorch, chtim   kisa.or.kr    Abstract 227 With  the rapid development of the Internet and the popularization of multimedia service s  Internet traffic has become a b ig d ata traffic  that its  volume, variety and velocity has dramatically increased   This phenom enon causes several limitations in traffic cla ssification such as increased computational complexity and difficult real time control In this paper 
we propose  a  behavior signature for application level traffic  identification to overcome these limitations  The proposed behavior signature is the  identity pattern of traffic behavior appearing in the first few request packets of plural traffic flows when a specific function is conducted  by an application This is in contrast to the previous signature techniques that usually use a singular packet or  flow for feature extraction and traffic identification. In order to prove  the feasibility of the proposed behavior signature, we present the experimental results based on five popular  applications  Keywords 227 behavior signature big data analysis  traffic c lassification; traffic identification; network management  I   I NTRODUCTION  The efficient network management is emphasized with the rapid growth in Internet penetration and greater diversification 
of  Internet application s [1   An  applicati on level traffic i dentification  that ascertains which application is contributing to the network traffic should be preemptively accomplished  before applying the various network management policies   T he final goal of application level traffic identification is to accurately name all of the Internet network traffic according to the corresponding application s To utilize the identification results  as  traffic control policies effectively the identificati on process should be complete d  within a given time Therefore  the Internet traffic identification is a time sensitive process  However t he Internet traffic has become b ig d ata having increasing  volume \(amount of data\, velocity \(speed of data in and out\, and variety \(range of data types and sources 
due to the rapid development of Information  Communication Technology  ICT which includ es Internet, mobile, and mass media  3  The many previous identification methods that are mostly focusing on the completeness and accuracy  have limitations when appl ied  to real operational network  due to the explosion of traffic T ypical limitations include high computational complexity and difficult real time control [4   Although there are several b ig d ata analy sis  solutions such as Hadoop Distributed File Systems \(HDFS c loud technology   and h ive database a fundamental  approach  that is identification method using various traffic features is  needed  to solve these problems for real time identification of big traffic data 
 In this paper, we propose  a  behavior signature and an  extraction algorithm to overcome the limitations of earl ier  methods  Most Internet applications generate multiple traffic  flow s  when a user performs a specific function such as login chat, file transfer, etc. For example several flows  that are involved in authorization application update, and encryption nego tiation are generated in the  log in phase of most  application s   Moreover there is a unique pattern in the sequence and interval  of these flows  T hus, w e devise the behavior signature centered  on the idea that the unique patterns of several flows can  represent a specific  function   T he behavior  signature uses the inter flow unit to extract the signat 
ure and identify traffic which is contradictory to packet or flow uni t s  us ed  in the previous signature  technique   T he inter flow unit is a set of the first request packets of more than one flow   T h is  new traffic unit has some advantages It is possible to identify several flows at once   more than one flow and it can be appl ied  immediately after a specific function has  occurred  first request packets  Ano ther distinguishing characteristic of the signature is that it us es combinations of various traffic features such as IP address, port number L4 protocol, and payload  data   I t allows that we can extract signatures easily because using multiple  features can expand extraction range 
 compare d  to using single feature  only  I n addition the behavior  signature can reduce the  identification time because all features even payload are located in fixed offset W e use the first N  bytes payload in the request packe t  The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We survey several existing behavior  based on traffic identification methods in Section  2  I n Section 3 we describe t he concept of the proposed behavior  signature  in detail In Section  4, we propose the  automatic extraction algorithm  of the behavior signature In Section 5, we discuss the experiment al results  to  prove the feasibility  of behavior  signature 
Lastly, we present our conclusion and future work in Section  6  II  R ELATED W ORK  Because of Internet  traffic growth  and development of various Internet applications   s everal s tudies on traffic  identification ha ve  been p roposed  already   The e arlier studies have suggested that a port number was  sufficient to identify traffic because most applications follow the Internet Assigned Number Authority IANA   assertion   5  6    However, recently it is becoming more difficult to identify traffic despite using This research was funded by the MSIP\(Ministry of Science, ICT Future Planning\, Korea in the ICT R&D Program 2013  261

In case of recall, it depends on the applications T he average is 0.18 in flow units and 0.57 in byte units. This is caused by the statistical characteristic s of each application a s having heavy or light flow Thus the b ehavior  signature is more useful in detection and control of applications than traffic monitoring  C  Comparison with payload Signature  W e conduct a comparison  test on between the payload signature method and the behavior  signature method W e use the payload signature based on the Longest Common Subsequence \(LCS\ algorithm [13   T he payload signatures used  in this test are shown in Table V  TABLE V  P AYLOAD S IGNATURE FOR COMPARI SON TEST  Application  No Signature  Example  Nateon  42  naeon  nate  nate  com  PVER  DropBox  3  GET /subscribe.host_int  Dropbox,Inc.*dropbox  com  UTorrent  13  BitTorrent protocol  d1:ad2:id20  Skype  1  User Agent:.*Skype  Teamviewer  1    x00  x17  x24  x6A  x00  Table I V show s  the results of behavior  and payload signatures. The following equation is the metric for measuring performance        5   PS is the ratio of identified traffic using the payload signature. BS is the ratio of identified traffic using behavior  signature. PS BS is the ratio of total identified traffic using either payload or behavior  signature s  is the ratio of overlap of traffic identified by the payload and behavior  signature. PS c  is the ra tio of traff ic identified using the behavior  signature, but not identified when using the payload  c  is inverse case  The value of PS c  for  Nateon is zero  because the traffic identified by using the payload method include s  all  traffic  by  behavior  method  This is due to the Nateon application characteristic using the open protocol instead of the encryption of traffic   On the other hand, the behavior signature s  of Dropbox, Teamviewer and Skype include the payload signature. In the case of Dropbox HTTPS traffic is used for data encryption Therefore  it is difficult  to extract the payload signature s  using the  LCS algorithm The behavior  signa ture  method, however can extract the  signature using a combination of several entries  to identif y  traffic precisely  According to this comparison test, we can  find that payload and behavior signatures are complementary  relation in traffic identification. In case of using the open protocol such as Nateon and UTtorrent the payload signature has good pe rformance. In case of using the encryption and proprietary protocol such as DropBox, Skype, and Teamviewer, behavior signature is good  for it   Figure 7 shows a comparison test of execution  time   T PS   is the execution time when it is applied to given test traffic  by payload signature   T BS   is the execution time when it is applied by behavior signature   T BS+PS   means the execution 265

We use the five popular  applications to prove  the feasibility of the proposed signature  A lthough our method shows low recall the precision was  100% for all applications and that means  all extracted signature identified traffic correctly  A comparison test on the  payload signature method  proved tha t the behavior signature can be utilized as a supplementary method to identify  the encrypted traffic flows  It improves the performance in execution time and completeness  For future research, we plan to improve the extraction algorithm  by applying various  networks and applications  Moreover, we plan to develop the identification system based on the proposed signature  to operate in real networks A nd we are going to address the problem that a single function of application is conducted on a single flow by dividing  the flow into multiple sup flows according to the request response  of packets   R EFERENCES     S H.
