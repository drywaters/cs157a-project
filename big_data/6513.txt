A Paravirtualized File System for Accelerating  File I/O  Kihong Lee, Dongwoo Lee, Young Ik Eom  College of Information and Communication Engineering  Sungkyunkwan University  Suwon, Republic of Korea  wlcraze, lightof, yieom}@skku.edu   Abstract  With sever al new virtualization technologies, a virtual machine has gradually achieved higher performance However, I/O intensive workloads still suffer from performance deg radation due to CPU mode switching and duplicated I/O stacks. In this paper, we propose a fr amework for improving file I/O performance in a virtualized environment, which consists of a paravirtualized file system, a shared queue, and an I/O 
dedicated thread. The key idea is to make file I/O requests handled without mode switching and to bypass a guest I/O stack. We implemented a prototype and measured its performance. The results show that our framework gives 1.2 1.6 times better performance than virtio and most of vmexits are eliminated  Keywords 227  I/O virtualization  paravirtualization  file sys tem vmexit  I/O stac k  I   I NTRODUCTION  With the development of high performance virtualization technologies, virtualization is now being widely used in both desktop and server system. The advance of virtualization technology can be categorized into two type 
s: software based approaches and hardware based approaches. The hardware based approaches take advantages of devices which are aware of virtualization. The software based approaches do not require special features of hardware but need a change of guest ker nel Nowadays, in terms of I/O device virtualization, both hardware based approaches and software based approaches have been actively studied, whereas hardware based ap proaches are dominant in processor and memory virtualization  SR IOV [1  an d I OM MU  2   are well known hardware based techniques of I/O virtualization. Providing the interface through which a virtual machine can directly access physical 
devices, these techniques give high performance close to that of non virtualized systems. However, there ar e few devices adopting the new techniques currently, because they require high product cost. Besides, data servers and cloud service centers are unwilling to adopt hardware based I/O virtual ization because it can weaken key characteristics of virtualizati on, such as portability and flexibility. In contrast software based approaches make it easy to encapsulate virtual machines, i.e., live migration or VM snapshot. They also allow virtual devices with no physical counterpart to be assigned to guests, e.g a disk image file as a block device. But software based approaches practically showed worse performance than hardware  
based ones  In this paper, we concentrate on two major causes of performance degradation in software based I/O virtualization The first i s that a hypervisor should interfere in guest I/O process because a virtual machine has no privilege to access physical I/O devices. The second problem is the nesting of I/O stacks. A host and many guests have their own OS, so also have their own I/O stack To resolve these problems, we propose a new framework for accelerating file I/O. It consists of 3 components: a paravirtualized file system, a shared queue and an I/O dedicated thread. With a paravirtualized file system we can avoid the execution of a redundant I/O stack on the guest side. An I/O dedicated thread and a shared queue help virtual machines to reduce the occurrence of 
vmexit s  To give details of our approach, this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we overview related work. Section III describes our framework and its components. The experimental results of our prototype is presented in Section IV, and Section V discusses some issues relating to our approach such as compatibility and safety. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section VI  II  R EALATED W ORK  One of the prevale nt device driver frameworks for virtualization is virtio [3  w h i ch h as  b ee n in c lu d e d in m ain lin e  of Linux kernel since version 2.6.24. In most cases, full emulation of I/O devices is complicated and inefficient, so virtio relatively gives better performan ce than typical device 
emulations. And if I/O requests are generated frequently, virtio coalesces the requests for increasing I/O throughput. At the point of processing the requests, however, it is required to switch a CPU mode from a guest to a host, i.e  vmexit which causes significant overheads. Especially, the faster a device operates, the more vmexit s affect the performance degradation It implies virtio cannot control the occurrence of vmexit s well whereas our proposed approach remarkably decreases  the occurrence of vmexit s, which is explained in Section IV  S ome previous studies suggested structures using dedicated CPU cores for accelerating performance of virtual machines SplitX [4 s u g g este d a n e w  v ir tu ali za t io n m o d el th at a

Their studies demonstrated that using dedicated cores for I/O was an effective way to reduce vmexit s in a virtualized environment While these two studies aimed to improve the performance of general I/O devices and modified the device driver t o be aware of virtualization, we only focus on a block I/O and a file system layer. Our approach not only effectively reduces vmexit s but also bypasses a redundant block I/O stack on the guest side, so we can achieve better performance enhancement in file I/O VirtFS [7 p r ev i o u s ly  p r o p o s e d th e  c o n ce p t o f a v i r tu ali za ti o n aware file system. Their used a client server model like a network file system, and utilized virtio. Both VirtFS and our approach have the same spirit of optimizing I/O procedure using vir tualization awareness in the file system level, but we further take account of the overheads caused by vmexit s  III  A RCHITECTURE D ESIGN  In a virtualized environment, minimizing the occurrence of vmexit s is one of the best ways to increase system performance 8    T o  d o th is  w e s u g g est an I O f r am e w o r k w h ich en ab les  virtual machines to interact with a hypervisor without a vmexit  Another virtue of the design is eliminating redundant I/O stacks. In a hosted virtual machine environment, there are more than one ope rating system; one is for the host and the others are for guests. Thus, there also exists several block I/O stacks Each block I/O stack includes an I/O scheduler and a device driver. The structure of our framework consists of a virtualization aware file s ystem, a shared queue, and an I/O dedicated thread. The overall system structure and block I/O workflow are illustrated in Fig. 1  A  Paravirtualized File System  A major role of the paravirtualized file system is to bypass guest I/O stack When an application  requests file I/O, a paravirtualized file system passes the I/O request to the host instead of the block layer of guest kernel, and waits for completion. After the request is processed in the host, the file system takes the result and acts the same as if it was handled in the guest\222s block layer. A file system is the first step of handling a file I/O requested from user applications. If I/O requests are passed to the host at this point, the rest of the guest I/O stack can be bypassed. Compared to the I/O p rocess in a non virtualized system, duplicated I/O stacks are one major cause of degrading performance in a virtual machine Especially, in case the virtual machine utilizes image files as block devices, merging and sorting operations of an I/O scheduler m ay give negative effects to the I/O process in the host. It is because the consecutive disk blocks from a viewpoint of the guest are no longer consecutive in the host. It depends on the file system type of both the host and the guest as well as the format of the disk image file. Consequently, eliminating a redundant I/O stack on the guest side can improve file I/O performance  B  Shared Queue Between Host and Guest  The shared queue is used to interact between the guest and the host. Originally an I/O operation  triggers a vmexit  because it attempts to access physical block devices but the virtual machine has no privilege to access them. When the shared queue is used, however, I/O operations are substituted with memory operations which can be directly executed in  a virtual machine. In this context, the memory address should be appropriately translated among guest virtual addresses, guest physical addresses, and host virtual addresses  After block I/O requests are enqueued from the para virtualized file system, the  I/O dedicated thread handles them and updates the completion state in the queue. Finally, the file system dequeues the requests marked with completion and continues the remaining I/O process. For sharing a queue, both the VM emulator and the virtual machi ne should know the memory address of the queue. In a typical hosted virtualization environment, it is not difficult to share memory addresses because the emulator and its virtual machine have the same address space   C  I/O dedicated Thread  With our framework  the  kernel of guest OS delegates block I/O process  to the I/O dedicated thread  Through  the shared queue, I/O requests are sent to the host without trigger ing a vmexit But there remains one more problem; notifying the host of new requests. For this, vir tio intentionally raises a vmexit   To avoid incurring vmexit s, we introduces an I/O dedicated thread, which monitors the queue whether new requests are arrived or not. To check it as fast as possible, the thread uses polling  mechanism. As a polling  thr ead occupies one CPU core all the time, it has a drawback in terms of the CPU usage, but it can improve I/O performance when I/O intensive workloads are running on the system. In addition block I/O operations are asynchronous, so the individual I/O dedica ted thread is able to handle several I/O requests from many VMs concurrently  IV  E VALUATION  In this section, we will evaluate the proposed framework To verify performance improvement of our approach, we implemented a prototype and measured the I/O performanc e against virtio. We also analyzed the overheads of vmexit s in both our framework and virtio  310 


               Random Read                   Sequential Write                   Sequential Read                   Backward Read     Fig. 2  File I/O performance of IOzone benchmark  A  Prototype Implementation  We used FUSE to handily utilize  a file system and implemented our scheme based on fuse ext2. Fuse ext2 is an implementation of ext2 file system based on FUSE. The overall mechanism of the modified fuse ext2 is the same as that of original  fuse ext2, except the modified one sends I/O requests to the shared queue rather than block layer of guest kernel at the end of the internal process. A fi le system implemented with FUSE, of course, has partial differences with the kernel level file system, but it does not seems to be crucial in verifying performance improvement of our approach. We used Native Linux KVM tool for emulating virtual machines, a nd added a shared queue and an I/O thread to the emulator. Non blocking concurrent queue algorithm is applied to the shared queue for consistency and scalability, because it is shared among the I/O thread and many virtual machines  B  Experimental Setup  Our t est machine is equipped with Intel i5 3570 \(4 cores 3.4  GHz\ and 4  GB memory. Samsung 470 Series SSD is used for experimental disk and the other programs including OS are installed on other disks. We used KVM [9  as a h y p er v is o r a n d  Native Linux KVM tool for emulating virtual machines. We assigned 1  virtual CPU i.e., vcpu  and 2  GB main memory to the guest machine. The OS of both the host and the guest are Ubuntu 12.04 with 3.9.0 kernel  For fair experiments, we create three 16  GB partitions on 64  GB SS D. The first partition is used to test the file I/O of host system, and the second and the third partitions are respectively used for virtio and our framework in the virtual machine. In addition, to avoid the effect of page cache, all file I/O operations w ere executed with O_DIRECT option  C  Performance Analysis  We measured file I/O performance in a host, a guest using virtio, and a guest using our framework. To compare our framework with the others, all environments are based on fuse ext2; the hos t and the g uest with virtio utilize  unmodified fuse ext2, and guest with our approach used modified one mentioned above We used IOzone benchmark to evaluate file read/write in various patterns  such as sequential read/write random read/write, and backward read. Fig 2 shows the results  of them Ours gives better throughput  than virtio in all cases and ours gives very similar performance to host within the margin of error The performance of ours sometimes exceeds that of host, because I/O dedicated thread exclusive ly performs I/O process in our framework It can work to advantage of our scheme in terms of cache hit ratio and context switching  overheads  In the case of sequential read  write, our framework achieves 40 60% better performance than virtio. Due to the d irect I/O, which makes  block I/O bypass page cache the result of write  operations is similar to that of read operations  In terms of random read/write and bac kward read, ours improves by 20  25%. Random write also shows similar results to random read, so we leave it out of this paper. A common block device has  the characteristics that non sequential I/O is slower than sequential I/O, so random and backward I/O are less affected by the overheads of vmexit s As a result the performance of non sequential ope rations is less improved  D  Occurrence of vmexits  One advantage of our approach is that file I/O does not trigger  a vmexit To verify this, we further analyzed the pattern of vmexit  occurrence s  in following cases: \(1 in  idle  state 2 when I/O intensive wo rkload is running on a guest using  virtio 311 


 Fig. 3  Detailed analysis of vmexit  3 when the workload is running on our framework, \(4 the workload is running on our framework and with IRQ affinity  setting We used perf  tools 10  to count detailed events of vmexit s  and  the results are illust rated  in Fig 3. In idle state there are almost no vmexit s and the overheads caused by vmexit s  is just 0.0055%. I n case of virtio, the overheads a re a bout 36ms per every second. In our framework, on the other hands, most of  I/O instruction, MSR write, an d NMI exception are disappeared However compared  to the idle  state  vmexit s  wasted about 13.9ms which are  mainly caused by external interrupts It  is due to hardware interrupts   w hen a physical core run ni ng on the virtual machine  receives hardware  inter rupts, it switches to host mode for handling  them. In case of our framework, I/O requests are processed  by the I/O dedicated thread instead of the vcpu so the physical core stays in the guest mode  most of the time. To prevent this problem  we set IRQ affi nity to deliver the interrupts of block I/O to the I/O dedicated thread. As a result, the number of external interrupt is reduced by 87%, and finally our framework saves about 34ms per second against virtio. The remaining external interrupts are caused by  local timer, rescheduling, and others These interrupts can also be removed with IRQ affinity setting but it seems to be  inordinate configuration   V  D ISCUSSION  As we previously me n tioned the paravirtualized file system is needed in our proposed framework, a nd it means the  guest OS should be modified. So our framework cannot be applied to proprietary OSs, which are restricted from modification e.g  Microsoft Windows. On the contrary, Linux allow to add a new file system as a module, so the paravirtualized f ile system  is  utilized  without re compiling the kernel. Additionally, if the file system of our framework  is implemented based on a pre existing file system, they can b e fully compatible with each other. For example, if the paravirtualized file system is b ased on ext4, our framework can manipulate data written under ext2 ext3 or ext4. It is because the modifications of our approach are altering the destination of block I/O requests, not impacting on the intrinsic mechanism of the file system  We need to ad dress security issues of our approach because it delegates  the partial role of the guest to the host But o riginally a virtual machine cannot directly execute  I/O operations except using  a SR IOV device. In other cases block I/O requests from a virtual m achine should be handled by the host, in one form or another. Our approach also hands the block I/O requests over to the host T hrough the paravirtualized file system only the point of delivering I/O requests is put forward, and it would not cause an addi tional sacrifice of safety or isolation  Another consideration is request coalescing. Some previous studies for improving I/O performance introduced batching several I/O requests into one bundle [3   6    1 1   I n  th e ca s e o f  virtio, a vmexit  will be tri ggered in order to handle each I/O request, and it incurs a considerable delay Coalescing can improve overall I/O throughput, but it may make latency of each request longer. The proposed approach in this paper, in contrast, doesn\222t involve a vmexit  during  the I/O process so the delay is minimized, by sacrificing one core to poll the shared queue. Thus, our approach can achieve the performance close to non virtualized system without coalescing I/O requests and also  does  not sacrifice the latency  of file I O   VI  C ONCLUSION  In a virtualized system, I/O intensive workloads suffer from the two major causes of performance degradation compar ed  with non virtualized environment. First, access to physical I/O devices leads to vmexit s, and second, there are redundant I O stacks because of the nested OS. In this paper, we proposed a new framework to improve file I/O performance by removing the two causes mentioned above. To deliver I/O requests without a vmexit we used a shared queue and an I/O dedicated thread. The I/O dedicated thread uses a polling  mechanism to promptly handle requests after arrived in the shared queue. Our framework also adopted a paravirtualized  file system, which makes I/O requests bypass the redundant I/O stack of the  guest so we achieved further enhancement of file I/O. The polling  mechanism makes the I/O thread occupy one CPU core all the time, but it will  put little effect on the system because nowadays the number of cores on a single CPU  has  been increased gradually. So our proposed approach  ca n be persua sive if it provides reasonable performance improvement. To verify this, we implemented a prototype and evaluated our approach. The result showed that our proposed framework improved the performance by 20 60% against virtio, and most of vmexit s  are eliminated. Moreover, if hardware itself get better performance, the frequency of the vmexit  will be increased, so our approach will  achieve further improvement  Currently, we are investigating how to apply our approach to the kernel level file system ext4. It helps us to verify our approach more practically and accurately In the future, we plan to study how to efficiently handle the requests generated by numerous VMs  R EFERENCES    Y. Dong, X.

For the proposed scheme, Dpart and Dmerge  are additional processing cost comparing to the single server approach, since the existing scheme does not need to partition  and merge tasks  We conducted an experiment to quantitatively measure the overall cost of distributed processing as we changed th e number of servers and the size of input images. For the experiment, we implemented a test client/server applications using Visual Studio 2010 on the Windows 7. Test machines are connected through 100 Mbps LAN When the client  split s  the image into pieces the number of pieces is automatically decided  to the number of connected servers. If the client connects to one server, it does not split the image   The overall cost is measured as the total elapsed time from the moment when the client splits an image t o the moment when it completes to merge image pieces. Fig   9 shows the experimental result Comparing to the case of single server, the two server case reduces the overall cost Furthermore the bigger is the image size, the more is the amount of cost reduction  VIII  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed a distributed rendering scheme In our approach, a client splits the image into pieces, and then sends them to different servers. Each server receives an image piece and run a processing routine for the styl ization of the piece. When processed image pieces are sent back to the client it merges them into one image Using multiple servers which stylize only parts of a whole image, the proposed system overcomes the limitation of single rendering server, and can  process high quality image  with marginal processing cost  Currently, our research is still in progress, and we are planning to conduct more  quantitative performance evaluation s  according to different image size and number of servers in an extensive manner We also have a plan to extend our approach to adaptive distributed rendering technique. In this approach the number of participating servers is dynamically chosen according to the size of input image in order to make the system more scalable than curren t fixed environment   Fig. 9.
