Existing mobile communication system uses CDMA 800, GSM 900, GSM 1800 and WCDMA 2000 MHz bands for which approximately 1/8 th  of the band capacity is used for in-band signaling Present work provides an assessment of vacant channels in mobile communications range which were permanently available at the time of measurement. The study used conventional Radio frequency scanners available for different bands and dedicated engineering handsets for tracking active frequencies. The tests were performed with assemblies carried in a vehicle and across the length and breadth of each city. The allotment of frequencies by Frequency Regulatory Authority to local mobile operators along with the frequency bands reserved for further distribution were also considered The experimentally collected data were anal yz ed using RF analysis software and spread sheet database  An analysis of the collected data lead to  arrive at the conclusion that more than 1/8 th  part of resources of each band are nearly permanently vacant which is enough to design in-band common contro l signalling methods for cognitive radio Also with the help of collected data of eight cities an empirical relationship has been established which can be taken as a thumb rule for projection of channel occupancy from densely populated core areas of big cities  to less populated township areas when population is known Keywords Cognitive Radio, Mobile communication, Inband signalling Radio link control common control signalling   Manuscript received October 5, 2013 Neeta Nathani is with the Department of Electronics Engineering as a Research Scholar in G.H.Raisoni College of Engineering Nagpur Maharashtra India Tel 91-9584006543 email neeta_nathani@yahoo.com    Dr G.C.

This has been added up with continued demand for higher bandwidth due to data and video. As a result, one most promising technology has come up for efficient spectrum utilization of the unused channels in the licensed band termed as Cognitive Radio CR\. Cognitive Radio users are termed as secondary users whereas licensed users are termed as primary users Since secondary user uses the same band as that of a primary user the former has to take care that the later one is not or minimum disturbed in terms of access and interference CDMA in 800 MHz band, GSM at 900MHz and 1800 MHz bands WCDMA in 2000MHz band LTE in 2300 MHz band and WiMAX at 2500MHz and 3500MHz bands are dominant players in mobile communication radio Wi-Fi and other low power radios play at ISM band at 2400MHz band. To give space to a demanding frequency channel of a band to a primary user, secondary user has to keep track of all the vacant channels of all bands and their respective qualities in terms of SNR and throughput Thus cognitive radio users deploying opportunistic spectrum access has to scan continuously the whole range of spectrum with a reasonable bandwidth and scanning frequency This is a very cumbersome and computing intensive mechanism Alternatively a scanner which scans only predefined channels of specified bandwidths and across licensed mobile radio frequency bands only shall be very efficient and trustworthy Matched filtering and coherent detection technique is most suitable in such environment 000I\000R\000U\000\003\000L\000W\000¶\000V\000\003\000V\000K\000R\000U\000W\000\003 detection time high SNR low probability of missed detection and false alarm 1   Ma tch ed  f ilter i n g  clo s el y  resemble to SDR compatible Mobile Station \(MS\available commercially and also in digital RF scanner used for drive test purpose  Also most of the communication system needs a pilot and dedicated control channels which remains as fixed during the entire period of communication between two users. This needs association of a permanent frequency channel with cognitive radio preferably in-band hired 000\002\000\003\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\001\000\005\000\006\000\007\000\010\000\011\000\007\000\012\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\015\000\010\000\001\000\004\000\016\000\017\000\007\000\010\000\012\000\020\000\016\000\001\000\003\000\015\000\021\000\021\000\022\000\010\000\014\000\012\000\007\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\005\000\020\000\012\000\023\000\010\000\015\000\024\000\015\000\025\000\026\000\027\000\005\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\030\000\001\000\031\000\015\000\024\000\032\000\001\000\033\000\034\000\001\000\002\000\011\000\011\000\022\000\020\000\001\000\035\000\034\000\001\000\036\000\007\000\010\000\022\000\007\000\006\000\026\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\033\000"\000 000\003\000\015\000$\000\026\000\006\000\014\000\025\000\023\000\013\000\001\000%\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000&\000\014\000'\000\002\000\027\000&\000\024\000\015\000\(\000\007\000\024\000\001\000\002\000\005\000\001\000'\000\020\000\011\000\020\000\007\000\006\000\012\000\023\000\001\000\002\000\010\000\011\000\013\000\014\000\013\000\022\000\013\000\020\000\030 000\002\000\003\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\001\000\005\000\006\000\007\000\010\000\011\000\007\000\012\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\015\000\010\000\001\000\004\000\016\000\017\000\007\000\010\000\012\000\020\000\016\000\001\000\003\000\015\000\021\000\021\000\022\000\010\000\014\000\012\000\007\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\005\000\020\000\012\000\023\000\010\000\015\000\024\000\015\000\025\000\026\000\001\000\027\000\005\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\030\000\001\000\031\000\015\000\024\000\032\000\001\000\033\000\034\000\001\000\002\000\011\000\011\000\022\000\020\000\001\000\035\000\034\000\001\000\036\000\007\000\010\000\022\000\007\000\006\000\026\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\033\000"\000 000\003\000\015\000$\000\026\000\006\000\014\000\025\000\023\000\013\000\001\000%\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000&\000\014\000'\000\002\000\001\000\027\000&\000\024\000\015\000\(\000\007\000\024\000\001\000\002\000\005\000\001\000'\000\020\000\011\000\020\000\007\000\006\000\012\000\023\000\001\000\002\000\010\000\011\000\013\000\014\000\013\000\022\000\013\000\020\000\030 ISBN 978-89-968650-3-2 


channel along-with primary users or select a channel out of band In opportunistic spectrum access secondary users will use licensed spectrum when primary users do not transmit According to Beibei Wang and K J Ray Liu availability of such a global control channel is not realistic since there may be no permanent channel available for secondary users 2   P r o b a b ilit y  to  g et a n  o p p o r tu n is tic  control channel in licensed band for all nodes in cognitive radio network has been narrated as dramatically small by Antonio De Domenico and co-authors 3   Thus  exploration for availability of Quasi-permanent channels in licensed mobile communication bands for cognitive radio shall truly facilitate with the advantages of working with common control channel in MAC layer  In the present study, the licenses allocated to mobile service providers of India has been taken into consideration for estimation of grossly available vacant channels of reserve bands and drive tests were conducted in eight different cities for completely allocated GSM bands It was established that more than one-eighth part of all bands are vacant which closely resembles to the requirement of one signaling channel for seven traffic channels The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section II explains the signaling channel part requirement as a fraction of channel capacity for mobile communication technology systems which enable us  to draw empirical statement for access of the whole licensed band by cognitive radio Section I II  covers literature survey indicating the availability of channels in different commercial bands Section IV discusses about the reserve spectrum and actual allotment of channels by the spectrum allocation authority.  Section V describes the measurement plan and collection of data at different cities  This is followed by presentation and discussion of the collected results in Section VI. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Section VI I  II  EMPIRICAL STATEMENT Regulatory Authorities of every country identify frequency bands for public mobile communication technologies e.g CDMA GSM WCDMA WiMAX etc Each band is divided into radio frequency \(RF\channels for license purpose Based on technology deployed operators divide each RF channel into communication channels which consists of common control \(CC\ channels and data \(traffic channels Common Control channels services traffic channels and are within licensed RF i.e in-band In 800 MHz band CDMA IS-95 uses 1.25MHz bandwidth as communication channel with one pilot and seven common control channels i.e. total 8 channels out of total 64 Walsh code channels. Walsh code count was 128 for CDMA 2000 1x i.e one RF In 1x EV  DO there are 8 control channel time slots out of total 256 time slots and 96 chips of pilot is embedded in each data slot of 1024 chips which together counts for 1/8 th  part of the channel In WCDMA out of total radiated power of 20Watts primary and secondary control channels and pilot channels constitutes 2.585 Watts leaving 17.415 Watts for traffic. In GSM, if there is one RF the first time slot works as the pilot and common control channel for remaining 7 time slots In case of 2 or more RFs on an average one time slot of first RF is used as control channel for each additional RF. In OFDMA, for a 5 MHz channel there are 60 pilot sub-carriers for 360 data sub-carrier and 92 null sub-carriers and thus the ratio is slightly higher than 1/8 th part of the whole RF channel A  Necessary Condition  Designers of mobile network communication distributes the communication access system equipments based on population density at different places. The population density has been identified as denseurban, urban, sub-urban, highway and rural. Conventional 3 sectored antenna system is used for all cell sites except highway sites where only 2 sectored antenna is deployed We take into consideration  urban areas where occupancy of deployed channels are considerably higher i It shall be fair enough to estimate that a minimum of 30 of the channels are  occupied in the sub-urban areas even if operators uses them inefficiently ii Occ upancy grows linearly with population at lower population areas and the efficiency of channel utilization also increases iii With increase of population occupancy of channels increases operators use different optimization techniques for maximum use of available channels but slowly attains saturation. The increased need of channels with population increment and counter-balancing the need through efficient  optimization techniques can be mathematically expressed as negative requirement of channels and graphically it can be expressed as saturation. With further increase of population operators has to borrow traffic channels from higher frequency band lowering the occupancy at lower frequency band and consequently it may be reflected as occupancy depression in lower band. Thus, the  occupancy of  channels with increase of population can empirically be expressed by the relation   y 30+15x-x 2  where  y  percentage occupancy of channels in lower frequency band and x population size in millions B Sufficient Condition  Approximately 7/8 th  part of a licensed RF channel of a frequency band is available for useful communication and the remaining part is used for control purpose As a corollary of the above we can say that 7/8 th  part of a band is used for purposeful data communication and remaining 1/8 th  part for common control and signaling purpose. Alternatively, if 1/8 th part of a frequency band is permanently available as spare and the same is used for common control purpose the total band can be completely accessed for cognitive radio communication purpose III  LITERATURE SURVEY en-IN An extensive measurement campaign was conducted in the city of Aachen located in Germany near to the border to Netherlands and Belgium The spectrum occupancy of several frequency bands was measured over longer time periods up to seven days The Authors deployed the amplitude probability distribution method to decide spectrum occupancy data which can help to optimize the search for unused spectrum i.e. white space[4   The Authors identified FM radio bands around 100MHz and the GSM 000\002\000\003\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\001\000\005\000\006\000\007\000\010\000\011\000\007\000\012\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\015\000\010\000\001\000\004\000\016\000\017\000\007\000\010\000\012\000\020\000\016\000\001\000\003\000\015\000\021\000\021\000\022\000\010\000\014\000\012\000\007\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\005\000\020\000\012\000\023\000\010\000\015\000\024\000\015\000\025\000\026\000\027\000\005\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\030\000\001\000\031\000\015\000\024\000\032\000\001\000\033\000\034\000\001\000\002\000\011\000\011\000\022\000\020\000\001\000\035\000\034\000\001\000\036\000\007\000\010\000\022\000\007\000\006\000\026\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\033\000#\000 000\003\000\015\000$\000\026\000\006\000\014\000\025\000\023\000\013\000\001\000%\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000&\000\014\000'\000\002\000\027\000&\000\024\000\015\000\(\000\007\000\024\000\001\000\002\000\005\000\001\000'\000\020\000\011\000\020\000\007\000\006\000\012\000\023\000\001\000\002\000\010\000\011\000\013\000\014\000\013\000\022\000\013\000\020\000\030 000\002\000\003\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\001\000\005\000\006\000\007\000\010\000\011\000\007\000\012\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\015\000\010\000\001\000\004\000\016\000\017\000\007\000\010\000\012\000\020\000\016\000\001\000\003\000\015\000\021\000\021\000\022\000\010\000\014\000\012\000\007\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\005\000\020\000\012\000\023\000\010\000\015\000\024\000\015\000\025\000\026\000\001\000\027\000\005\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\030\000\001\000\031\000\015\000\024\000\032\000\001\000\033\000\034\000\001\000\002\000\011\000\011\000\022\000\020\000\001\000\035\000\034\000\001\000\036\000\007\000\010\000\022\000\007\000\006\000\026\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\033\000#\000 000\003\000\015\000$\000\026\000\006\000\014\000\025\000\023\000\013\000\001\000%\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000&\000\014\000'\000\002\000\001\000\027\000&\000\024\000\015\000\(\000\007\000\024\000\001\000\002\000\005\000\001\000'\000\020\000\011\000\020\000\007\000\006\000\012\000\023\000\001\000\002\000\010\000\011\000\013\000\014\000\013\000\022\000\013\000\020\000\030 ISBN 978-89-968650-3-2 


en-IN channels bands around 900MHz as the measured minimum level was above 80 dBm Marc McHenry did large scale spectrum occupancy measurement and observed that the spectrum occupancy in several American cities was found to be always below 25 which is mostly caused by a rather high decision threshold between 90 and 105 dBm 5  In Qatar A comprehensive wideband spectrum occupancy measurement was performed over multiple dimension \(time frequency and space concurrently over an  utilized 000E\000D\000Q\000G\000Z\000L\000G\000W\000K\000\003 000L\000Q\000\003 000W\000K\000H\000\003 000\032\000\023\000\023\000\003 000í\000\003 000\026\000\023\000\023\000\023 MHz band over a three day measurement period Across four different locations the bandwidth utilization varies between 4 and 15 It wa s observed that bandwidth utilization is time variant with peak times ranging from afternoon to sunset in almost all of the locations [6   I n  R o m a n ia  co r r esp o n d in g  to  t h e d o w n li n k   en-IN communication direction i.e for 880  960 GSM E-GSM Military bands, occupancy level was found by Authors to be which covered the frequency range from 75MHz to 3GHz in an outdoor urban environment The measured frequency range was divided into six consecutive 500 MHz blocks Each block was measured during a continuous period of 48 hours and was observed that only 22.57 of the whole frequency range between 75MHz and 3GHz wa s occupied   46.80  and for 1710   1880 GSM 1800 occupancy was 22.86  7   A survey was conducted in Barcelona Spain   8   to carry out a broadband spectrum measurement campaign A similar type of survey was conducted in Singapore   9   to  f in d  t h e  s p ec tr u m  u s a g e p atter n  i n  frequencies from 80 MHz to 5.85 GHz  The 24 hour measurement  had been taken at the roo f top of Institute for Infocomm 0005\000H\000V\000H\000D\000U\000F\000K\000¶\000V\000\003 000E\000X\000L\000O\000G\000L\000Q\000J\000\003 000R\000Y\000H\000U\000\003 000\024\000\025\000\003 000Z\000H\000H\000N\000G\000D\000\\\000\003 000S\000H\000U\000L\000R\000G\000V  which indicated that the average occupancy on the frequency range from 80 MHz to 5.85 GHz wa s only  about  4.54   In a s urvey at the Loring Commerce Centre   10    t he measurements were made during a normal work week for 3 days for the frequency range s  between 100 MHz to  3 GHz Based on the results of the study it was observed  that the average spectrum usage during the measurement period was 1.7  The static measurement shows that the mobile licensed bands and ISM bands are partly occupied and the remaining parts of the spectrum resembles noise It is apparent that no study has been made to assess actual occupancy of mobile communication bands based on measurements at different locations of the same city in licensed band Also no study has been made to find variation of channel occupancy for different type of cities These studies shall help us to accurately identify the frequency channels with low or no active utilization and successfully deploy them in cognitive radio technology  I V RESERVE SPECTRUM AND ALLOCATION In India the radio frequencies are being used for different types of services like mobile communication broadcasting radio navigation satellite communication defense communication etc The National Frequency Allocation Plan NFAP forms the basis for development and manufacturing of wireless equipment and spectrum utilization in the country Frequency bands allocated to various types of mobile communication se rvices in India are mentioned in Table I    TABLE I LICENSED BANDS OF DIFFERENT WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES  Technology u sed  Band and Channel Width  Technology Bandwidth  in MHz  Allocation   Occupancy  Remarks  CDMA  890 915MHz  935 960MHz   Channel B/W 1.25MHz FDD; 20 channels  25+25  5 Operators   2 RF each  50% vacant  GSM 900MHz  824 849MHz 869 894MHz  124 channels of 200 kHz spacing  25+25  4 Operators   Fully Li censed  v acant channels to find out experimentally  GSM   1800 MHz  1710 1785MHz 1805 1 880MHz   374 channels  75+75  4  Operators    6 0  vacant channels actual to find  WCDMA  1920 1980MHz 2110 2 170MHz  60+60  3 Operators 5 MHz each  75 vacant channels  WiMax 4 G  2 500 000 2690MHz   19 0  3 Operators  15 MHz each  77% vacant channels  WiMax   fixed  34 00 3 600 MHz   20 0  One 20MHz  90% vacant channels   As per available information    So far CR technology has been developed keeping into consideration that all channels in licensed bands are dynamically accessed and released Game theory is applied for capturing a vacant channel inviting competition amongst CR operators Further there is a possibility of occupying a vacant band by CR secondary user in the guise of a primary user In addition a concept of bidding for vacant channels has also come up for use by secondary users at a comparative cost. All these factors introduces the concept of business out of the unused channels of a licensed user with or without having a permanent infrastructure for CR It is thus envisaged that mainly public authorities providing public utility services at almost zero cost may be authorized to operate over unoccupied spectrum even though licensed However the number of such public utility service providers is expected to be very limited.

The population data has been collected from internet and limited to city municipal areas only as declared by local civic authority The population was mostly taken on the basis of 2011 sensus  Figure 4 depicts the spectrum occupancy in eight cities of India In figure 4 above it is projected that even the most sub-urban area with scanty population shall have nearly 30% occupancy For population between 1 million to 4 million the increase is nearly linear The occupancy saturation is observed in the range of 4 million to 7 million Also with projected expansion of densely populated city core areas to 8 million, occupancy level is estimated go upto 86 leaving a clear space of 14 of channels for use of  cognitive radio  TABLE II  POPULATION SPECTRUM CHART   0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 0 2 4 6 8 10   Population  in various cities \(in millions  Spectrum Occupancy in various cities    S p e c t r u m  O c c u p a n c y  S.No  City  Population  in millions    Spectrum  Occupancy  1  Bhopal  2.36  74.19  2  Patna  1.68  75.8  3  Kolkata  4.48  72.58  4  Ranchi  2.91  52.42  5  Jaipur  6.66  75  6  Dibrugarh  1.5  50  7  Shillong  1.43  54  8  Port Blair  0.9  43  000\002\000\003\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\001\000\005\000\006\000\007\000\010\000\011\000\007\000\012\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\015\000\010\000\001\000\004\000\016\000\017\000\007\000\010\000\012\000\020\000\016\000\001\000\003\000\015\000\021\000\021\000\022\000\010\000\014\000\012\000\007\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\005\000\020\000\012\000\023\000\010\000\015\000\024\000\015\000\025\000\026\000\027\000\005\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\030\000\001\000\031\000\015\000\024\000\032\000\001\000\033\000\034\000\001\000\002\000\011\000\011\000\022\000\020\000\001\000\035\000\034\000\001\000\036\000\007\000\010\000\022\000\007\000\006\000\026\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\033\000#\000\033 000\003\000\015\000$\000\026\000\006\000\014\000\025\000\023\000\013\000\001\000%\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000&\000\014\000'\000\002\000\027\000&\000\024\000\015\000\(\000\007\000\024\000\001\000\002\000\005\000\001\000'\000\020\000\011\000\020\000\007\000\006\000\012\000\023\000\001\000\002\000\010\000\011\000\013\000\014\000\013\000\022\000\013\000\020\000\030 000\002\000\003\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\001\000\005\000\006\000\007\000\010\000\011\000\007\000\012\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\015\000\010\000\001\000\004\000\016\000\017\000\007\000\010\000\012\000\020\000\016\000\001\000\003\000\015\000\021\000\021\000\022\000\010\000\014\000\012\000\007\000\013\000\014\000\015\000\010\000\011\000\001\000\005\000\020\000\012\000\023\000\010\000\015\000\024\000\015\000\025\000\026\000\001\000\027\000\005\000\004\000\003\000\005\000\030\000\001\000\031\000\015\000\024\000\032\000\001\000\033\000\034\000\001\000\002\000\011\000\011\000\022\000\020\000\001\000\035\000\034\000\001\000\036\000\007\000\010\000\022\000\007\000\006\000\026\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\001\000\033\000#\000\033 000\003\000\015\000$\000\026\000\006\000\014\000\025\000\023\000\013\000\001\000%\000\001\000\037\000 \000\035\000!\000\001\000&\000\014\000'\000\002\000\001\000\027\000&\000\024\000\015\000\(\000\007\000\024\000\001\000\002\000\005\000\001\000'\000\020\000\011\000\020\000\007\000\006\000\012\000\023\000\001\000\002\000\010\000\011\000\013\000\014\000\013\000\022\000\013\000\020\000\030 ISBN 978-89-968650-3-2 


The obtained results demonstrated the existence of significant amounts of spectrum potentially available for the future deployment in CR networks in lower bands of GSM which are not at all used VII.   CONCLUSION Discussion from above reveals that more than 20% of the completely licensed bandwidth is practically vacant in a saturated market environment This is  well above the requirement of 1/8 th part of the band to get access to the whole of the bandwidth at a time by cognitive radio and adequate to take additional MAC level overhead required for Cognitive Radio.  There is no immediate necessity of these channels by the licensed operators which can be safely deployed as common control channel for cognitive radio purpose Further to doubly enhance protection of common control channel a disaster recovery common control channel may be designated which will hold the replica of allotments and processing status of CR Primary Common Control Channel Also depending upon the population it is possible to approximate channel occupancy and hence cognitive radio technology planners can draw a long term plan for efficient use of them in public benefit Use of commercially stable technologies with minimum changes at Operator Transceiver equipment and user mobile equipment for adaptation to Cognitive Radio technology shall lead to development of a economically deployable system   VIII.

4.4 Scalability of DARE Data Reduction 
In order to better evaluate the scalability of DARE on larger backup datasets we have implemented the schemes of Stream-Informed Delta Compression SIDC  2  in SiLo  20  a memory-ef cient near-exact deduplication system that exploits the backup-stream similarity and locality As introduced in Section 2.1 SIDC only detects resemblance in the backup-stream locality-preserved cache that can reduce the indexing overhead of SFs and scales well in large-scale deduplication system Thus we employ their method to assess the scalability of different resemblance detection schemes and implement SiLo with a 20MB locality cache similar to SIDC  2  with a se gment size of 1MB The stream-informed approaches are denoted by the Cached/Cac pre“x in Table 4 and Figure 5 The rst column under a dataset Freq or Less in Table 4 shows the percentages of data reduction and the second column shows the data reduction factor the ratio of before/after data reduction Since SiLo achieves nearly 99 deduplication ef“ciency of the exact deduplication i.e full index in memory while requiring substantially less memory overhead about 1/250 of the exact deduplication approach for ngerprint indexing  20  we only discuss the results of resemblance detection after SiLos deduplication here in Table 4  As shown in Table 4  resemblance detection further reduces the storage space after the deduplication process by a factor of about 2.5 meaning that we can save about 60 of the post-deduplication storage space by resemblance-detecting post-deduplication chunks DARE achieves a superior data reduction ef“ciency on both datasets while the cached SF-2F and SF-4F schemes detect less resemblance which is consistent with the results on our real-world datasets summarized in Table 3  Table 4 also shows that the cached SF-2F and SF-4F schemes fail to detect a noticeable amount of resemblance due to the sometimes weak or lack thereof locality in the backup stream as the limitations of the stream-informed cache approach  2  To further understand the scalability of DARE Figure 5 shows the percentages of resemblance detected by its DupAdj detection and by the SF-2F and SF-4F approaches showing the individual contributions by the SF the SF and the SF on the two synthesized datasets DupAdj is very effective and ef“cient in detecting resemblance in the deduplication system with abundant duplicate-adjacency information i.e dedupe factor 2 leaving DAREs improved super-feature approach very little smaller than 1 if any additional resemblance to detect see the DARE bars Figure 6 shows that DARE achieves the highest throughputs among all the approaches compared running on both RAID-structured HDDs and the SSD Cached SF-4F has the lowest throughput

Intuitively delta compression should slow down the data-restore performance of a data-reduction system since it needs to restore the resembling chunks by two reads one for the delta data and the other for the base-chunk and then delta decode them But in our evaluation of the restore operations for resembling chunks we nd that the speed of delta decode i.e Xdelta  8  tends to be v ery f ast about 1GB/s in the DARE system Another interesting observation is that for a restoration cache of a given size with a delta chunk and its based chunk  DARE actually caches more logical content of the two chunks and than a deduplication-only system and thus improves the datarestore performance by virtual of the enlarged restoration cache due to delta compression Figures 7\(a and 8\(a show that DARE on average doubles the data-restore speed of the deduplication-only system both running on the RAID Figures 7\(b and 8\(b clearly show that the reason lies in the fact that DARE reads half as many containers for restoration as the deduplicationonly system The superior data-restore performance of SF-2F and SF-4F to the deduplicationonly system is attributed to their data reduction ef“ciency see Tables 3 and 4  Since the restoreperformance for the other six datasets is similar to and consistent with that of the Less dataset they are omitted to save space The sudden increase in the data-restore performance of the deduplicationonly approach at the backup version 17 Figure 8\(a we observe is due to the fact that most of the backed-up sources targeted for restoration are from the current and recent backups and thus have fewer random reads for restoration

In this paper we present DARE a deduplication-aware low-overhead resemblance detection and elimination scheme for delta compression on the top of deduplication on backup datasets DARE uses a novel resemblance detection approach DupAdj which exploits the duplicate-adjacency information for ef“cient resemblance detection in existing deduplication systems and employs an improved super-feature approach to further detecting resemblance when the duplicate-adjacency information is lacking or limited Our preliminary results on the data-restore performance suggest that supplementing delta compression to deduplication can effectively enlarge the logical space of the restoration cache but the data fragmentation in data reduction systems remains a serious problem  19  W e plan to further study and improve the data-restore performance of storage systems based on deduplication and delta compression in our future work This work was supported in part by National Basic Research 973 Program of China under Grant No 2011CB302301 NSFC No 61025008 61173043 and 61232004 863 Project 2013AA013203 US NSF under Grants IIS-0916859 CCF-0937993 CNS-1116606 and CNS-1016609 This work was also supported by Key Laboratory of Information Storage System Ministry of Education China

method increases slightly which is due to two reasons 1 the data before In this experiment we investigate the performance of OLTP queries when OLAP queries are running The workload is update-only and the keys being updated are uniformly distributed We launch ten clients to concurrently submit the updates when the system is deployed on 100 nodes Each client starts ten threads each of which submits one million updates 100 updates in batch Another client is launched to submit the data cube slice query That is one OLAP query and approximately 50,000 updates are concurrently processed in R-Store The system reaches its maximum usage in this setting based on our observation When the system is deployed on other number of nodes the number of clients submitting updates is adjusted accordingly Figure 11\(a shows the throughput of the system The throughput increases as the number of nodes increases which demonstrates the scalability of the system However when OLAP queries are running the update performance is lower than running only OLTP queries This result is expected because the OLAP queries compete for resources with the OLTP queries We also evaluate the latency of updates when the system is approximately fully used As shown in Figure 11\(b the aggregated response time for 1000 updates are similar with respect to varying scales VII C ONCLUSION MapReduce is a parallel execution

Querying    Fig 8 Accuracy of Cost Model    Fig 9 Performance vs Freshness On each HBase-R node the key/values are stored in format Though only one or two versions of the same key are returned to MapReduce HBase-R has to scan all the of the table Since the is materialized to HDFS when it is full these 223les are sorted by time Thus instead of scanning all the and between  only the between   are scanned The value of decides the freshness of the result There is a trade-off between the performance of the query and the freshness of the result the smaller is the fewer real-time data are scanned Figure 9 shows the query processing time with different freshness ratios which is de\223ned as the percentage of the real-time data we have to scan for the query In this experiment  1600 million and 800 million updates on 1 distinct keys are submitted to HBase-R When the freshness ratio is 0 the input of the query is only the data cube Thus the cost of scanning the real-time data is 0 When the freshness ratio increases to 10 the cost of scanning the real-time data is around 1500 seconds because the cost of scanning the real-time table dominates the OLAP query As the freshness ratio increases the running time of and  and when it is not  and  We submit 800 million updates to the server each day and the percentage of keys updated is 223xed to 1 The data cube is refreshed at the beginning of each day and the OLAP query is submitted to the server at the end of the day Since the data are compacted after the data cube refresh the amount of data stored in the real-time table are almost the same at the same time of each day The processing time of and are thus almost constant In contrast when the compaction scheme is turned off HBase-R stores much more data and the cost of locally scanning these data becomes larger than the cost of shuf\224ing the data to MapReduce As a result the processing time of and increases over time and and a user speci\223ed timestamp still need to be scanned and 2 the amount of data shuf\224ed to mappers are roughly the same with different ratios Figure 10 depicts the effectiveness of our compaction scheme In this experiment we measure the

Compaction    a Throughput    b Latency Fig 11 Performance of OLTP Queries a large scale distributed environment However most existing works only focus on optimizing the OLAP queries and assume that the data scanned by MapReduce are unchanged during the execution of a MapReduce job In reality the real-time results from the most recently updated data are more meaningful for decision making In this paper we propose R-Store for supporting real-time OLAP on MapReduce R-Store leverages stable technology HBase and HStreaming and extends them to achieve high performance and scalability The storage system of R-Store adopts multi-version concurrency control to support real-time OLAP To reduce the storage requirement it periodically materializes the real-time data into a data cube and compacts the historical versions into one version During query processing the proposed adaptive incremental scan operation shuf\224es the real-time data to MapReduce ef\223ciently The data cube and the newly updated data are combined in MapReduce to return the real-time results In addition based on our proposed cost model the more ef\223cient query processing method is selected To evaluate the performance of R-Store we have conducted extensive experimental study using the TPCH data The experimental results show that our system can support real-time OLAP queries much more ef\223ciently than the baseline methods Though the performance of OLTP degrades slightly due to the competition for resources with OLAP the response time and throughput remain good and acceptable A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described
