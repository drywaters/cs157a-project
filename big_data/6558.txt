Energy ef\002cient handling of big data in embedded wireless sensor networks Ren 264 e Bergelt and Matthias Vodel and Wolfram Hardt Chair for Computer Engineering Technische Universit 250 at Chemnitz Chemnitz Germany Email f berre j vodel j hardt g cs.tu-chemnitz.de Abstract 227The development of wireless sensor networks has reached a point where each individual node of a network may store and deliver a massive amount of sensor-based information at once or over time In the future massively connected highly dynamic wireless sensor networks such as vehicle-2-vehicle communication scenarios may hold an even greater information potential This is mostly due to the increase in node complexity Consequently data volumes will become a problem for traditional data aggregation strategies traf\002c-wise as well as with regard to energy ef\002ciency Therefore in this paper we suggest to call such scenarios big data scenarios as they pose similar questions and problems as traditional big data scenarios Although the latter focus mostly on business intelligence problems We then propose an aggregation strategy tied to technological prerequisites which enables the ef\002cient use of energy and the handling of large data volumes Furthermore we demonstrate the energy conservation potential based on experiments with actual sensor platforms I I NTRODUCTION The total amount of user data data payload to be stored or processed doubles every two years This f act raises se v eral problems regarding data management and time-critical data processing tasks In order to handle these issues researchers all over the world are concentrating their work under the topic 224big data\224 If we talk about big data research we consider novel approaches for the processing of huge amounts of data from different heterogeneous sources Key problems include search strategies data dissemination automated analysis as well as the visualization and post processing Big data environments in a traditional manner deal with massive centralized computing resources e.g high performance computing centers and high-speed storage systems Typical scenarios focus on data mining scenarios 002nancial computing fraud detection and scienti\002c data evaluation as well as pattern recognition The majority of research and development activities in this 002eld focus on existing information in larger volumes than the amount of data usually handled with relational database systems Today the actual research focus changes rapidly Several big data projects deal with huge amounts of multi-dimensional data in embedded distributed systems Accordingly a different application context requires different strategies For example if we consider next generation driver assistance systems Vehicle-2-Vehicle V2V or Vehicle-2-Roadside concepts a large amount of sensor data is generated and needs to be fused and evaluated Additionally  such tasks require local preprocessing techniques for distributed scenarios for instance the evaluation and classi\002cation of data received by imaging systems Besides automoti v e applications further scenarios address advanced sensor and monitoring systems as well as smart metering approaches which are operating in a highly integrated and connected environment II R ELATED WORK Related research work for big data in distributed embedded systems correlates with delay tolerant network strategies DTN and adapted concepts of data aggre g ation or data fusion In contrast to traditional big data infrastructures our goal is to shrink the relevant data payload directly at the source or in-network instead of transmitting the entire raw data to the sink for long-term storage Usually the key challenge here is not the amount of the locally measured sensor data but rather the large number of distributed subsystems nodes and the changing communication infrastructure between these nodes In the automotive context energy resources as well as buffer storages are not as strictly limited as in other mobile embedded sensor platforms Nonetheless speci\002c data processing approaches have to use the given resources ef\002ciently Here key parameters are the communication time latency behavior as well as the communication range and the high level of mobility Furthermore v ehicles as netw ork nodes of fer more possibilities for sensor usage and ultimately information they are able to deliver In the k e y elements of big data are identi\002ed through the 2243V model\224 volume velocity and variety These points can also be transferred to future embedded wireless sensor networks as follows 017 Volume high node density and/or nodes having a high information potential 017 Velocity Today there is already a high velocity of changing information in WSN in many application contexts 017 Variety Supporting designedly heterogeneous WSN is a main goal of many data aggregation strategies meaning a multitude of different network nodes 978-1-4799-2179-9/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 


Sometimes veracity is also included but then the focus is more on acquired business data than on actually measured information Because of that it does not 002t WSN very well Therefore we are going to focus on the three points above Consequently the term big data for embedded sensor networks in this paper shall embrace wireless embedded sensor networks with data volumes 050on individual node-level as well as on network level\051 larger than in traditional embedded contexts Furthermore networks with a high number of embedded nodes or high node density shall be included Since resources such as processing power time and energy are limited in WSN the goal of big data applications in this context should not be collecting as much information as possible The collection of as little data as possible and still satisfying the user's need for information is required instead So the focus does not lie on data mining in large existing databases but rather on deciding which readily available information from a network or cluster should be sent in which form to the client III C ONCEPT In general sensor data collected within a sensor network may have different validity periods Single sensor values measured at a given point in time have a rather short validity period and are considered as one-shot 050or even real-time\051 data In contrast to this sensor values which are fused over time may lead to higher level conclusions or implications that are of longer validity Usually the more local 050meaning near to a single node of the network\051 an information is the shorter its validity period is whereas the more global an information the longer its validity Therefore we can distinguish between short-term and long-term sensor data or more general information For instance consider a VANET 050Vehicular ad hoc network\051 where each vehicle on a street is a sensor node The middle of the road is congested so the cars which are part of the congestion may report congested to neighboring cars or a centralized institution 050local information as seen by the individual node\051 The cars which have not reached the congestion yet and those which have already left it do report not congested on a local level Nevertheless the global perception of the street remains congested although the values of the 050moving\051 nodes change over time With ever increasing node numbers in embedded wireless sensor networks there is a need to retrieve local information and fuse it to global information as ef\002ciently as possible The rising data volumes held in local node storages make in-network processing mandatory From our point of view traditional proactive or schedule-based aggregation methods in embedded wireless sensor networks will reach their limits with the applications targeted by future sensor networks These limits occur mostly with regards to energy ef\002ciency and data volume In traditional big data scenarios relational databases have to be succeeded by more apt concepts 050such as NoSQL databases\051 In contrast this very concept can come to the rescue in embedded wireless sensor networks where traditional aggregation strategies do not 002t the problems well anymore Although the data collected by single nodes in future sensor networks increases in most use cases the user 050or client\051 does not need to extract single values from the sensor network Instead they demand a combination of values such as average of an area highest value etc Collecting and storing every available dataset in an archive for later inspection often serves for node tracking and is therefore not within the scope of our research Instead we focus on the aggregation of combined value sets of node subsets within a sensor network for immediate or short-term usage 050such as regulating actor actions based on sensor measurements\051 In addition there may be data collected by nodes which is irrelevant to the current application Being able to 002lter this from the view on the network 050by queries\051 allows to effectively reduce network traf\002c and storage requirements Therefore in order to handle data volumes which are larger than the information stored in current embedded sensor networks we propose or rather reintroduce the concept of database-oriented data aggregation The basic concept of database-oriented approaches in wireless sensor networks is viewing or modeling the network as a virtual database table where each sensor node corresponds to a row An example is given in Figure 1 where each node of the sensor network has sensors 050and therefore data\051 for temperature and pressure Consequently each sensor of a node is represented by a column in this virtual table 050which shall be called a node attribute\051 There is no requirement that each node has to have the same sensors so for some nodes there may not exist values for speci\002c columns Attributes may be simple sensor readings 050such as pressure temperature etc.\051 or higher level abstracted information 050such as 224moving slowly\224 or 224road ahead blocked\224 for V2V applications\051 Additionally in the static routing case each node knows its parent node established by a chosen routing strategy When using a dynamic routing the route to take for a query may be determined during query execution Database-oriented systems for sensor networks already in existence are TinyDB and COUGAR TinyDB runs on top of TinyOS which is an operating system for sensor nodes based on the C dialect nesC Furthermore it only supports speci\002c hardware platforms since an extended toolchain is needed TinyDB's 050publicly visible\051 development ceased at version 0.2 in 2003 COUGAR is limited to x86-architecture sensor nodes or dedicated proprietary ones Furthermore the last activity regarding COUGAR is dated 2005 and the project currently seems to be on halt As f ar as we kno w  the code which has to be run by the sensor nodes 050QueryProxy\051 has never been made publicly available Fig 1 View on a sensor network as virtual table IV T HE PROPOSED STRATEGY We think that the database-oriented approach 002ts the issues produced by big data in embedded wireless sensor networks very well Furthermore since from our point of view the systems in existence lack several functionalities needed for future networks we propose the system developed at our faculty PLANetary PLANetary is a light-weight databaseoriented data aggregation system which is platform independent and focuses on energy ef\002ciency In this paper we want to focus on the data aggregation strategies and therefore the 


used routing strategy is prede\002ned and arbitrary PLANetary does not enforce a single routing strategy but can support in 002nding optimal routes through the sensor network Selforganized tree-based routing strategies for embedded wireless sensor networks have been proposed as part of the nanett 050nano system integration network of excellence\051 project In general the database-oriented approach consists of two phases similar to those in relational database systems 017 Query compilation  optimization 017 Query execution  runtime In our approach we call these two phases query propagation and aggregation since the query has to be delivered to all concerned network nodes after its statement After that information at the nodes has to be aggregated and fused innetwork and the results need to be sent back to the client This process is shown in 002gure 2 It should be noted that query propagation and aggregation may be executed in parallel If a query reaches a leaf node the results are immediately sent back if the query conditions are met Also the propagation 050as well as aggregation\051 itself is parallel since the query 050or its results\051 are transferred into the sensor network similar to a breadth\002rst search During the query propagation we try to select as few nodes as possible to send the query to A node may be needed to execute a query when one or both of the following two statements are true for it 017 The query conditions may be satis\002ed by this node and need to be evaluated 017 The node is needed to forward results from the subtree whose parent it is As it can be seen easily intermediate nodes are only needed if their subtree contains at least one node where the conditions have to be evaluated Therefore all nodes for which the second case is true are implied by the ones for which the 002rst one is true In consequence we only have to determine all nodes for which the conditions may be satis\002able After that all intermediate nodes which are needed to transfer the results to the sink become clear In order to select a node subset we have to pre-evaluate the conditions of a query before its propagation to determine nodes where the conditions are impossible to satisfy There are different possibilities how we can determine this unsatis\002ability Each node in the network may have attributes which can be queried but are constant For instance this could be the node id or the 003oor of a building the node has been deployed to These static attributes are marked as such and are propagated to the sink during network exploration In a 002rst step we may now extract all parts of the given query conditions that only contain static attributes and remove the nodes for which these are false from the query tree In the next step we can remove nodes which do not possess the required sensors to evaluate the query Since we support heterogeneous network structures there may be nodes which for example do not have a temperature sensor equipped These nodes can be omitted from queries which select temperature values or pose conditions on temperature readings since the evaluation result would be unde\002ned This static evaluation may be repeated by each node which receives the query during propagation Within speci\002c constraints the static condition 050a\051 Query propagation 050b\051 Result aggregation Fig 2 The two phases of query execution in sensor networks evaluation is also available for dynamic attributes 050such as actual sensor readings\051 For example different nodes may be equipped with diverse temperature sensors having different measurement ranges If such information is made accessible to the system the query may be further optimized by detecting that condition checks are beyond the measurement range for a given node and sensor The corresponding node can then be omitted from the query After deriving a restricted node subset we may now construct the 002nal query tree by adding the intermediate nodes of the multi-hop architecture for the static routing case In the dynamic routing case we may now construct a minimum spanning tree within the restricted node set 050costs for instance based on node distances\051 to 002nd the 002nal query routing tree Naturally in order to send a query into the network the user needs a way of formulating it With relational databases queries are usually stated by database client software or manually by users using the SQL language Database-oriented systems pursue a similar approach where data can be queried using a declarative SQL-like query language enriched with syntax constructs useful for sensor networks For the sake of simplicity and to emphasize its origin we modeled the query language for PLANetary closer to the SQL dialect than that of COUGAR In contrast to TinyDB we replaced the SQL keywords SELECT and FROM with SENSE and AT  respectively Through this we want to highlight the area of application for the query language Ssupport for 050basic\051 actor control has also been added where queries can state actions which shall be executed when the query's conditions are met This is a similar concept as TinyDB's triggers but more versatile since each action command can have an arbitrary amount of parameters instead of just one as with TinyDB These actuator commands have to be de\002ned by the user and registered with the PLANetary core system on each sensor node PLANetary supports conjunctional and disjunctional links between condition statements as well as nested conditions 050currently up to a depth of 2\051 This is an important improvement compared to TinyDB and COUGAR since these solely support non-nested conjunctional links Therefore PLANetary allows to state more complex conditions to restrict the required node subset Most certainly this also may feel more natural for the experienced SQL user This allows the combination of aggregation requests that require multiple queries in TinyDB into a single query with PLANetaryQL This leads to improvements 


050a\051 Two queries in TinyDB 050b\051 One query in PLANetary Fig 3 Comparison of retrieving an average temperature value for two different 003oors in a building Fig 4 A query in PLANetaryQL with more complex conditions with regards to network traf\002c energy consumption and the time needed for query propagation A sample is given in Figure 3 The possibility for nested queries to be stated allows for even more complex scenarios which may result in multiple queries with TinyDB or would be very hard to state at all An example of a more complex nested query is given in Figure 4 After the query has reached a leaf node of the query tree during propagation the aggregation phase starts for this node During this phase the results are collected and fused in-network in such a way that aggregate functions 050such as sum average maximum etc.\051 are applied in place and only the required values are sent back to a parent node of the corresponding subtree 050e.g the maximum value of a sub tree\051 This enables us to reduce the network traf\002c depending on the user query and the requested values It is similar to the approaches of TinyDB and COUGAR as well The shown optimizations are especially important with regards to the energy ef\002ciency of the overall system Nodes which are not required to answer any of the running queries or forward query results should consume as less power as possible Therefore we incorporated support for wake-up receiving technology into PLANetary Wake-Up-Receiver modules are ultra low-power wireless communication modules which wait for just one signal the so-called wake-up signal In practice they accompany standard wireless communication modules 050such as WiFi XBee Bluetooth\051 which require much more energy during idle mode If there is no data transmission running the sensor node may now deactivate the standard communication module Depending on the usage case even its main processing unit can be deactivated while waiting for the wake-up signal The energy conservation potential of such a technology is enormous albeit the actual conservation depends on the wake-up frequency This is due to the fact that the wake-up process is often costly energy-wise and time-wise  Nonetheless w ak e-up technology 002ts asynchronous data aggregation strategies such as database-oriented approaches very well since 050user-de\002ned\051 queries have a relatively low frequency and their occurrence cannot be predicted reliably Here a time-based scheduling would be very prone to energy Fig 5 Dropping of unsatis\002able condition parts in-network waste Since it either would wake the nodes too often when no new queries need to be received or too seldom so that there is a noticeable delay between the query statement by the user and the arrival of results So in order to achieve the best results from the wake-up technology the node set which is required to answer a query has to be restricted as much as possible Since PLANetary supports conjunctional as well as disjunctional links in conditions the queries can be further optimized during the propagation step As some parts of conditions may be unsatis\002able in subtrees we may drop them beforehand A simple scenario is shown in Figure 5 This shows that the nodes of a subtree which has dropped conditions do not have to evaluate condition parts which can never be satis\002ed With this nodes which are further down in the subtree do not have to evaluate unsatis\002able conditions and therefore energy can be conserved as well as time 050depending on the subtree size\051 Consequently this only works with static attributes or properties which have to be part of the routing table Furthermore this optimization needs additional resources on the nodes which have to check the conditions for unsatis\002ability before forwarding the queries Therefore this optimization should be restricted to some more capable nodes Naturally this process is not suited well for highly dynamic networks where the available node set changes very rapidly Here the static attributes of new nodes which are needed for the optimization would need to be synchronized often supposedly wasting more energy than is conserved by query optimization In contrast to TinyDB where the virtual table must always be named sensors  and has no actual ef fect on the query processing 050in fact it is entirely optional\051 PLANetary allows to de\002ne an arbitrary number of other virtual tables Such a table de\002nition consists of a table name and a prede\002ned condition set which selects a subset of nodes in the network There are two main advantages of virtual tables de\002ned in this way Foremost query text becomes shorter since conditions to restrict the query to a speci\002c node subset 050e.g a speci\002c 003oor of a building\051 are implied by the virtual table Nevertheless a query on a virtual table can also be further re\002ned by using additional conditions The second advantage is that de\002nitions of prede\002ned query sets can support the exploration and routing process by clustering nodes together which belong to the same or overlapping virtual table de\002nitions Depending on the chosen routing strategy this may not be usable or suitable for all application scenarios but de\002nitely supports more or less static networks such as building automation sensor networks This concept can furthermore be enhanced to local node tables where queries collect data on a single node or a given cluster in their own virtual table assigning a timestamp to each entry These virtual tables may then later be queried themselves 


Fig 6 The network topology used for the evaluation creating a historic query since the user evaluates past data This can also further reduce the traf\002c in the network As with TinyDB queries may be marked as continuous and given a repetition interval These queries will be propagated once and saved on the nodes to be re-evaluated on a timely base This allows to cut the energy cost for queries which are static and frequently executed V E VALUATION We tested our approach with a sensor network of nine nodes 050where one node represented the data sink\051 of the PLANet type which is a platform developed at our faculty  It supports a multitude of communication standards such as WiFi XBee Bluetooth The tests were done as a proof of concept to show the energy conservation potential of the combination of database-oriented aggregation and wake-up technology The network topology we used is shown in Figure 6 and represents a simple use case for home automation scenarios Each node communicates by means of an XBee module and offers temperature sensor readings as well as the 003oor and room it was deployed to We wanted to compare timely scheduled data aggregation with the database-oriented approach So on the one hand we used a time-scheduled aggregation approach where each node sent its data during a given point in time 050the demanded data would be collected and extracted at the sink\051 On the other hand we used queries with increasing distinctiveness where no further data processing and 002ltering was required at the sink The queries range from selecting all values available 050Q1\051 over getting the average temperature by 003oor 050Q4\051 to selecting a single temperature value from a speci\002c node 050Q6\051 The energy consumption for each of these actions is given in Figure 7 For controlling the sensor network starting and stopping the aggregation and checking the received results we used the GREASE framework GREASE is a generic sensor data aggregation and evaluation framework which has been developed by us and has been demonstrated in and 19 We saw a general dependency of data volume 050network traf\002c\051 on query distinctiveness The more distinct a query is the more restricted is the node subset on which it is executed and the less values need to be gathered Therefore usually the data volume decreases with increasing query distinctiveness as shown in Figure 8 Of course the data volume required to execute a query can never fall under a certain point where the whole data transmitted is protocol data 050marked as protocol overhead in Figure 8\051 In the tested scenario the energy needed to send a wakeup signal was negligible compared to the energy of the actual Fig 7 Energy consumption for proactively sending all values 050P\051 and the execution of more and more distinctive queries 050only communication costs\051 Fig 8 General relationship between data volume to transfer and query distinctiveness communication module The energy consumed by the WuRx component was almost a thousandth of the energy of the actual communication module The averaged energy consumption of the whole network for all queries we posed is given in Figure 9 The usage of wake-up technology lead to a massive conservation of energy in the given scenario 050energy consumed is less than 30 percent\051 Naturally the energy conservation depends on query distinctiveness 050i.e number of nodes to wake\051 and query frequency But even with our test queries which were of widely different types 050many values to single value\051 we observed a drastic energy conservation effect Fig 9 Energy consumption of the whole sensor network during testing without and with using Wake-Up technology 


VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we introduced two cases where we see data aggregation in embedded wireless networks as big data applications The 002rst case represents sensor networks with a high node density so that the combination of the sensor data collected by each node is enormous The second case deals with networks with high node complexity 050such as vehicles\051 where each individual node holds a multitude of sensor data and deductions Within such networks traditional aggregation approaches reach their limits with respect to energy-ef\002ciency With further developments such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication networks and the smartdust vision the ef\002cient handling of big data volumes in embedded wireless sensor networks is growing more and more important Therefore if we speak about more than thousand 050probably energy self-suf\002cient\051 network nodes self organization and energy ef\002ciency are the main points to consider and optimize There have to be 003exible and robust ways of self-organization for such networks as well as a dynamic way to extract data from them The combination of database-orientation and wake-up technology yields a great potential in increasing the energy ef\002ciency of wireless embedded sensor networks and enables the ef\002cient handling of big data applications Additionally the proposed system may be applied on top of existing eventdriven data aggregation strategies This would allow for a more detailed and 003exible data acquisition for applications-speci\002c events The basic concept is also not restricted to WSN and can be used to stream data from computer clusters or any network like structure However the main focus of PLANetary lies on energy ef\002ciency its light-weight architecture and easy incorporability into existing networks and hardware platforms Regarding the database-oriented approach one goal and at the same time a challenge as with real database systems is to pose queries which are as distinctive as possible but still deliver results with the needed accuracy Additionally there are more query optimization techniques to be considered Next steps are the simulation of highly dynamic networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes and the deployment of a demonstrator network with a higher number of nodes than shown in this paper The limits of wake-up technology in such systems do also need to be de\002ned This includes 002nding the best compromise between longest possible sleep times with regard to query frequency and wake-up costs The PLANetary core source code shall be made publicly
