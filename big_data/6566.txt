ANGELS for Distributed Analytics in IoT Arijit Mukherjee   Himadri Sekhar Paul   Swarnava Dey   Innovation Labs Tata Consultancy Services Kolkata India  Mukherjee.Arijit  Swarnava.Dey  Himadrisekhar.Paul  tcs.com Ansuman Banerjee   Indian Statistical Institute Kolkata India ansuman@isical.ac.in Abstract The current global emphasis on Internet of Things IoT have highlighted the extreme importance of sensor-based intelligent and ubiquitous systems which are more commonly known as cyber-physical systems The technology has the 
potential to create a network of smart devices and things to an extent that has never been envisaged before far outnumbering the number of devices connected in the Internet as we know today The sheer number of such connected ubiquitous devices is likely to give rise to a hitherto unforeseen volume of data of different types with a demand for execution of analytical algorithms over the data On the success of these analytic processes will depend the actual smartness of the Intelligent Infrastructures which now form the crux of the IoT paradigm We have seen the advent of cloud-based paradigms to analyse the data in a data-parallel fashion within large data centres which now form the basis of the big-data problem But apart from the servers in the data centres we potentially have a huge pool of compute resources if we think about the smart devices in and around our homes 
collectively which remain relatively idle In this paper we present a proposal with some emulated experimental results where we claim that in an IoT framework the smart devices such as mobile phones home gateways etc can be utilised for execution of dataparallel analytic jobs This is effectively a work-in-progress and it is acknowledged that there will be further challenges for real devices Future research will attempt to consider these challenges Keywords  cyber-physical ubiquitous systems analytics parallel execution black-box mobile grid I I NTRODUCTION The inevitability of the Internet of Things IoT was underpinned by Neil Gross back in 1999 when he wrote the famous article in Business W eek where he said  In the next century planet earth will don an electronic skin It will use 
the Internet as a scaffold to support and transmit its sensations This skin is already being stitched together  He was writing about a futuristic scenario which now-a-days seems more of a reality Cyber-physical systems are not gments of imagination any more and worldwide numerous researchers are dedicating their efforts to the development of this networked infrastructure of smart objects ranging from furnitures appliances within a home or ofìce cars or buses and other means of transport healthcare devices etc As a result new complicated applications and services encompassing several domains such as eGovernance energy  utilities waste management healthcare transport systems and many more will come into effect within the next few years Many signiìcant initiatives have been taken in different countries regarding the development of such services The vision includes mobile de vices such as 
phones and sensors to be an integral part of this system as these devices will act as the primary sources of data The services mentioned before will require precise analysis of the data collected through the ubiquitous mobile devices in order to be effective for the IoT paradigm It is obvious that the volume of data will be astronomical which will require huge computing infrastructures for analysis The data which will be accrued through the smart devices serving a variety of applications in several domains are inherently heterogeneous and this mandates an extremely important role for the middleware fabric in the IoT frameworks The IoT framework can also be viewed as a large computational grid involving devices and computational resources which follows a cycle of sense  extract  analyse  respond where data are sensed at the devices extracted and analysed 
at the middleware and application level triggering back a response to the devices The analysis primarily happens on computing resources spread across the globe in large data centres However there is a scope of utilising the smart devices that are already part of the IoT framework An enormous amount of computing power is spread across millions of such devices which include home gateways routers and most of all smart phones and mobile devices These devices collectively known as edge devices often remain idle and it has been proposed in a very recent research proposal that it may be possible to execute certain sections of the IoT cycle on such devices thereby extending the computation to the edges of a compute cloud In this paper which is a work in progress we explore the idea of utilising smart edge devices for performing certain 
portions of the data analysis tasks in IoT We present the architecture of an IoT framework which will include servers and commodity compute nodes along with smart devices as computational resources We call these devices ANGELS or Available Network Gateways in Edge Locations for Sensors and attempt to show that these devices if integrated properly can appear as angels for distributed analytic processing in IoT frameworks We articulate on the various aspects of using these devices as compute nodes such as data-parallel computation and capacity-based partitioning of data where data will be partitioned based on the capacity of the available devices The rest of the paper is organised as follows in Section II the background and related works are discussed and the main motivations behind this work and potential challenges are discussed in Section III Section IV discusses the proposed 
architecture and different aspects of using the edge devices for computation We present some experimental results to understand the frameworkês behaviour when running in low bandwidth networks in Section V and discuss them A conclusion and future work is presented in Section VI II B ACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORK The work presented in this paper is related to several IoT frameworks which try to leverage the computing power spread across numerous mobile devices in order to address the problem of analysing massive data volumes A resource provisioning framework for a mobile Grid 2014 IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things \(WF-IoT 978-1-4799-3459-1/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 565 


architecture has been implemented in by utilising the computational capabilities of nearby devices The mobile devices in this work are treated as service providers and the framework addresses energy-aware resource management and uncertainty handling for ensuring application QoS in highly dynamic and unpredictable environments The authors also refer to data and task parallelism exploitation job check pointing to estimate the remaining time to complete a job Moreover the framework harnesses the power of heterogeneous mobile Grids and presents a real implementation of a use-case in the healthcare domain Another notable effort in the area of computation on mobile devices is Serendipity where jobs are distrib uted amongst nearby mobile devices with the aim to reduce the job completion time and/or conserving the device energy According to this proposal a mobile device may execute a task locally or may request the service of a nearby device based on the exchange of some meta-information The authors envisage three possible characteristics of the mobile network namely i a predictable network with a control channel for co-ordination ii a predictable network without any control channel and iii an unpredictable network More recently the researchers at Berkeley have added the capability of adding android devices to the computing pool via BOINC in order to harness the ubiquitous mobile de vices for large-scale computation This has enabled users of smart phones to donate their idle computing power voluntarily to various intense projects which require idle cpu cycles Researchers have earlier worked towards an efìcient scheduling policy and pricing strategy for these edge devices which are constrained in nature in terms of cpu memory and bandwidth Notable among these are 8 and 9 which talk about game-theory based incentive offers for the owners of the devices However none of the frameworks we have studied and discussed consider the capacity of the devices before distributing the tasks and the related dataset The Fog Computing paradigm we ha v e mentioned before will lar gely depend on the efìcient execution of tasks on edge devices and the edge devices referred in this proposal are mostly low-capacity systems with limited cpu memory and network bandwidth Further the edge devices are of unpredictable nature because of their mobility It is our belief that the resource pool will comprise numerous such edge devices along with fully powered server-class systems and in such a scenario we believe that data must be partitioned based on the capacity of the devices in a proportional manner so that the weakest node will also be able to contribute to the computing pool In this proposal we have presented a novel partitioning scheme while using HTCondor as the middle w are f abric o v e r a cluster of heterogeneous nodes including edge devices The HTCondor framework has been in use for a long time and is well-known within the Grid community for high-throughput jobs Recently there has been some work towards adapting it for high-frequency computing which mak es HTCondor more suited to the IoT domain This along with the matchmaking capability of Condor makes it an attractive framework for adoption in IoT analytics Further the recent stress on dataparallelism has resulted in the inclusion of Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS support inside Condor so that f amiliar big-data techniques can now be incorporated Our experimental results show that such an architecture can indeed be useful for data analysis in the context of Internet of Things III M OTIVATIONS AND C HALLENGES Two factors act as main motivations behind this work and in this section we discuss these factors and the challenges therewith Firstly according to a report released by the International Data Corporation IDC the mobile phone mark et across the world grew by 6 during the second quarter of 2013 and a total of 432.1 million mobile phones were shipped worldwide out of which 237.9 million were smart phones Globally the number of smartphones has already surpassed 1 billion and is expected to double by 2015 Apart from the smartphones the smart city initiatives predict extensive use of other mobile devices such as home energy gateways smart meters and other smart and mobile devices each equipped with one or more processors and memory units Thus there is already an abundance of computing power spread across the world which is going to increase in a dramatic fashion and this explosion is not so distant in the future Secondly the energy cost for running the data-centres has been ever-increasing the state of which has been outlined in  According to Gartner  the ener gy cost has increased from 10 of the IT budget for an organisation in 2006 to 50 in 2011 Further the energy rate for powering a data-centre is based on the industrial rate which is much higher than the consumer rate at which the edge devices owned by consumers will operate One of the advantages in the vision of using consumer smart devices for computing is that the energy cost will be signiìcantly less However there are signiìcant challenges which are to be overcome and we try to highlight them in the following paragraphs a Edge devices such as the smart phones have mobility as one of their major characteristic which make them volatile as compute resources b Using the Internet as the media for distributing data to the edge devices will cost the edge device owner in terms of network data usage and also affect the battery of the device The challenges in this respect are i how to reduce the cost of communication and ii how to preserve the battery power c The edge device should only be used during its idle period without affecting the user experience and hence the challenge is to sense idle time in real-time and allocate job and distribute data optimally d The edge devices are constrained in terms of cpu and memory and are heterogeneous in terms of hardware and software avours which implies that i the job scheduling system should be able to consider the device capability and ii a common middleware framework is required for job distribution and execution We are attempting to address the challenges individually and as a start we are creating the framework necessary for execution of jobs/task on edge devices depending on an allocation and scheduling policy which takes into consideration the capability of the nodes IV E DGE D EVICES AS ANGELS FOR I O T Any IoT framework which hosts a cyber-physical system is expected to cater to diverse analytical application characteristics such as periodicity data volume real-time or nearreal-time constraints In order to support such computational 2014 IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things

demands parallel and distributed processing in form of cloud computing frameworks is deemed as essential In this section we describe the architecture of our proposed framework which is capable of parallel execution of analytical jobs over a set of heterogeneous nodes which may include edge devices This framework includes a partitioner entity which takes into account the computational capabilities of the nodes that are part of the resource pool and uses this information to partition the dataset into smaller subsets based on the node capabilities Our goal is to show that this approach allows even the weakest nodes to participate in a given analysis task which forms the basis of the fog computing paradigm proposed in In this paper we consider a class of applications which can be executed in a data-parallel fashion that is applications for which the input data set can be split into several subsets and multiple instances of the same application can be executed in parallel with different subset as the input Thus the entire dataset is processed by several smaller worker processes on different compute nodes The philosophy is similar to the concept of map-reduce proposed by Dean and Ghemawat in which is adopted in the open-source Hadoop framework e xcept that the conventional map-reduce frameworks remain agnostic about the capabilities of the compute nodes and further any application must be re-written to conform to the map-reduce paradigm In our work we assume the existence of a combiner application which can collect the outputs produced by the multiple analysis processes and combine them into the nal output This can be compared to the reduce phase of a mapreduce paradigm where the user is expected to provide a script or program to collate the nal uniìed output This allows us to execute existing analytical algorithms as black boxes without having to rewrite the code to t into an execution paradigm Figure 1 depicts the architecture of our proposed distributed computing framework which incorporates a data partitioner and a combiner The data partitioner assumes the job to be data parallel and schedules it on all available nodes The execution time of the application on a given node is assumed to be dependent on the input data size it must process The partitioner module divides the dataset into smaller subsets and distributes them to the worker nodes along with the application to be executed Fig 1 Introducing Data Parallelism In the fog computing paradigm the compute resource pool will be composed of heterogeneous resources such as sensor gateways personal laptops play-stations smart-phones etc One of the major challenges with respect to the complete realisation of a compute platform on top of such devices is the management of intermittent unavailability of the edge devices which are volatile in nature The unavailability can be a result of a device failure or a link failure or both For reasons of simplicity we have temporarily assumed that the edge devices and links are available throughout the duration of the experiments We shall consider node and link unavailability at a later stage during the course of this research work In this paper we try to establish that for data parallel applications in the context of IoT the effective utilisation of the devices will depend on appropriate partitioning of the entire dataset and their distribution to the compute nodes based on the capacity of the nodes To fulìl this objective we designed a partitioner module which is capable of partitioning the input data set based on the capability of the available nodes in terms of their cpu memory and communication bandwidth The goal of this partitioning is to minimize the make-span of the job The partitions are then distributed to the compute resources and scheduled for execution Authors in ha v e proposed a data partitioning method based on computational capacity of participating nodes in a Hadoop environment Capacity measurement itself being an involved research area in computing science the authors have used a very simple metric for calculating capacity of a node The metric is a linear function of CPU speed network latency for movement of the data from a central position to the participating node memory cache and main memory capacity of the node and also the complexity of the algorithm involved The input data set is then partitioned according to the ratio of capacity values of the nodes so that the node with highest capacity gets the highest load of computation The authors have applied their method on a map-reduce application and showed that the resultant make-span for the job was better compared to the make-span in raw Hadoop settings In this paper we use a data partitioner which is an adaptation of this basic data partitioning approach We have used the well-known HTCondor framework for submission and execution of jobs on available compute nodes But the architecture differs from the traditional Condor execution system in that it has a data partitioner module which is capable of splitting the data le based on the capacity of the available nodes The combiner module is fairly rudimentary and can execute basic combiner scripts such as le concatenations submitted by the user Based on the number of data les or partitions jobs are scheduled on number of nodes to be executed in parallel Each job on a given node executes on its speciìc partition and produces some result which is nally combined using a combiner script provided by the jobsubmitter The detailed architecture of the proposed framework is shown in Fig 2 where we have a cluster of server class systems connected through HTCondor and also a set of edge devices as part of the combined resource pool Any job submitted to the framework can be distributed over any number of resources selected from the pool including edge devices Asofnow these devices are not able to use the pool as consumers by ofîoading part of their jobs to other nodes but we consider this as one of the future enhancements V E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS We conducted our experiments in a distributed infrastructure managed by HTCondor We used an Intel Xeon series 4CPU server each with eight cores 2.0GHz clock and 128GB 2014 IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things \(WF-IoT 567 


Fig 2 Detailed framework architecture RAM on which a private cloud platform was set up using OpenStack The virtualized cloud contained 12 machine instances dedicated for the experiment out of which four machines were conìgured to be high-end with 4GB memory and a single-core virtual CPU with 2 GHz clock speed The other eight machines were conìgured to emulate low-powered edge devices each having 1GB RAM and single core with 1 GHz clock We also used traces collected from real mobile handsets and replayed the traces on the low-powered nodes to properly emulate an edge device The collection and playback of traces was based on the concept provided by Dinda and OêHallaron in The original PlayLoad tool 21 w a s slightly enhanced to support playback of traces from edge devices and a snippet of such playback is shown in Fig 3 Other than this trace playback this HTCondor-based experimental set-up had no other application load Fig 3 Playback of mobile workload trace We conducted several experiments on this set-up using two different type of applications one computing the standard deviation of a large set of numbers and the other performing a text search within a large document For the standard deviation test-case we used a parallel implementation of the algorithm for a large set of numbers the count of which was varied from 100000 to 100000000 Each set of numbers was divided into sub-sets of two different sizes by the partitioner the larger of which contained approximately twice the count of the smaller sub-set We submitted the jobs to the HTCondor cluster such that the jobs with smaller input set were scheduled on the low-powered edge device emulation nodes and the jobs with the larger input set were scheduled on the high-powered nodes We compared the make-span with the result obtained from the experiments without the partitioner involved and the comparison is shown in Fig 4\(a For the text search experiments we used an application which searched for the occurrence of a string within a set of large les which vary in size We used two different sets of les where each le in one set was approximately 500KB and each le in the second set was approximately 276KB We varied the number of les to be used in the experiments and the les were chosen randomly from each set As was done in the case of the previous test-case we executed this set of experiments with and without the partitioner involved When the partitioner was involved as before the low-powered nodes were scheduled with the jobs with smaller les as input and the high-powered nodes were scheduled with the jobs with larger les as input The make-span was compared and the result is shown in Fig 4\(b All the experiments were executed multiple times and the mean result is presented in Fig 4 a Make-span optimization for Standard Deviation computation b Make-span optimization for Text Search Fig 4 Make-span minimization with partitioning It can be concluded from both set of experiments that within an IoT framework participating nodes can be better utilized thus affecting the job execution scenario in a positive manner if data can be partitioned based on the capacity of the nodes We have also performed a set of rudimentary experiments 2014 IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things \(WF-IoT 568 


using a set of real edge devices android smartphones of varying capabilities and have been able to obtain a basic result which is shown in Fig 5 The gure shows three different graphs each corresponding to the average makes-span using different set-ups namely a purely server-based set-up a purely edge-device set-up and a heterogeneous mix of server and edge-devices It can be seen that for obvious reasons the makespan on the servers is the minimum far out-performing the make-span on the edge-devices But a moderate result can be obtained on the heterogeneous set-up with a combination of edge-devices and servers We can argue that this may form the basis of a scheduling cost model based on the preferences and restrictions from the users point of view A user or a large organisation with sufìcient budget may choose to opt for the best performance and may wish to execute all their jobs on the server cluster On the other hand another user with a moderate budget may choose to sacriìce the latency in favour of cost and select the resources in the edge-devices pool which are offered at a lesser charge Fig 5 Mape-span comparison in different clusters VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we have proposed a novel framework of heterogeneous computing nodes which includes resources ranging from large server-class systems to low-powered edge-devices such as smartphones home energy gateways etc forming the basis of the fog computing paradigm W e ar gue that most of these edge devices remain idle for large part of a day and cumulatively can contribute to data-parallel computation in the context of IoT where the alternative massively parallel processing frameworks may pose certain restrictions We also note that the role of the partitioner and scheduler are extremely important in such scenarios As of now we have used a static scheduler and we are working towards a dynamic scheduler which will be able to consider dynamic availability patterns We have also mentioned about a cost model for scheduling based on the user requirement for latency and budget considerations and have done some basic work in this area The current framework for executing user jobs on real mobile devices is rudimentary in nature but is able to prove the concept We plan to extend this framework to support real user requirements We have used Condor for our experiments as the resource awareness features of Condor make it more attractive within an IoT context When we mention the fog computing paradigm we are talking about utilizing the abundant computing power of ubiquitous devices and gateways which reside on the edge of the network not just data centres at the core Previously researchers have highlighted the use of gateway devices for various IoT scenarios such as home infotainment 22 low cost remote healthcare  and home energy  each of which speak about the requirement of harnessing this abundant and ubiquitous computing power One of the most important aspects in this scenario is the is the ubiquity and volatility of the edge devices the network of which is not a controlled one The dynamic scheduler we are working on must be able to cater to the fact that the gateways and mobile devices can be switched off or disconnected from the network any time and failure is to be accepted as a norm and not an exception Consumption of battery power and network bandwidth usage are the primary concerns for most edge-device owners We think that using low-cost communication protocols such as the Constrained Application Protocol CoAP may offer some advantages in terms of bandwidth usage as well as the battery consumption related to data transfer Furthur an incentive-based scheme offering beneìts to users contributing their devices to the resource pool may also be attractive There are hurdles in the course of this research but we hope to overcome them in order to realise the full potential of the fog paradigm A CKNOWLEDGMENT We would like to extend our

judged purely by self-interest. When the opponent defects, on the next decision, the player sometimes cooperates anyway The successful strategy must not be a blind optimist. It must sometimes retaliate. Though players will retaliate, they will once again fall back to cooperating if the opponent does not continue to defect. This stops long runs of revenge and counter-revenge. The last quality is being non-envious, that is not striving to score more than opponent  We can model our CH example using a powerful tool called analytic hierarchy process \(AHP\HP can be used to make decisions in situations involving multiple objectives. The AHP method uses a weight with each attribute. A higher weight indicates a more important objectiv A n e x tens ion o f t h e Von Neumann-Morgenstern utility can be used to make decision under uncertainty where more than one attribute affects blueís preference and attitude toward risk. In order for blue to check on the consistency of the CH model, we show our example with a consistency check. We present an example using multiattribute utility function in order to show the repeatability of hierarchy level function to create consistent products most useful for the blue player where each attribute is not mutually independent but rather depends on the other We compute the consistency index \(CI\ follows  CI      n n1  8   where A T is a matrix based on the blue playerís levels of hierarchy as discussed in this paper. The values in the A matrix and the weights in the w vector are based on bands missions, assets, and organizations using Shapley, Nash, DFD and the MOC respectively. CI can be used to monitor which three band combinations are used for a given mission such that the consistency of mapping products are monitored For a perfectly consistent decision maker, CI will be equal to zero. If CI is sufficiently small, the decision makerís comparisons are probably consistent enough to give useful estimates of the weights. In our example, if the value of CI is too large, then the blue player can make some adjustments amongst the responsible organizations in order to improve competitiveness on an international level. The goal of the blue player is to manage bandwidth at the lowest level, create the most consistent products using the most efficient missions while ensuring the lower level responsible organizations are cooperating effectively VII  C ONCLUSION  Our approach is to add computational intelligence to provide the analyst with a decision making capability to reduce time to collect and process data while retaining the information needed to complete the mission analysis Since asset tasking has dynamic, discrete, strong opposition and hierarchical traits, decision making becomes more and more complex. It is difficult to analyze and resolve. In the presence of game theory and hierarchical theory, and on the basis of dynamic state attrition-models, our strategy can solve this kind of problem favorably We discussed a method for modeling asset management with limited resources for multiple sensor modality requirements. One solution is to run the Shapley and Nash algorithms for each successive tasking request and then run a dynamic fair division algorithm to ensure that each request is fair with respect to limited available assets. The motivation for fairness is used to ensure that not all sensor assets are dominated by one agent or player \(region of interest\his is needed in order to avoid missing sensing of important events that are occurring around the world. We realize that the solution presented is only a guide and is not intended to replace the human brain in decision making. We offer a user assisted means of prioritization to make agent and resources more effective We used the NPD to model group behavior and cooperation. We provided a real world application to present a framework for bandwidth management of remotely sensed data. This may be useful for generating semi-autonomous decision making tools to the analyst in order to increase the effectiveness of limited resources R EFERENCES  1  A x el r o d, R. a n d H a m i l t o n  W  D T h e e v o l utio n o f co o p e r at io n.

one is more secure than the other. Regardless of the size of the footprint or th e type of architecture, wellwritten and tested kernel code will provide better security. At best, it could be said that they meet different, competing objectives. Microkernel designs have minimal kernels and offer highly customizable management planes. They allow for tailored solutions and simplify the development process Monolithic architectures are preconfigured with necessary drivers and software in the trusted zone They require less domain knowledge to set up and provide fewer options for tampering This analysis will pr ove valuable to both IT professionals and softwa re engineers. Enterprise architects and information security professionals are often forced to make acquisition decisions will less than complete information. This research identified a number of factors to consider before implementing new technologies. However, the present study should not be considered comprehensive. Other design factors should be elicited in future research. This study should also be of interest to software engineers. Often security is considered late in the software development cycle. By analyzing security implications at the architectural level, this research attempts to incorporate security concerns earlier in the design process. Future studies should focus on approaches to compensating for security weaknesses in each type of architecture

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
