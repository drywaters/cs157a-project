association rules for multi-valued attributes are integrated in building a novel directed hypergraph based model for databases that allows to capture attribute-level associations and their strength Basing on this model we provide association-based similarity notions between any two attributes and present a method for nding clusters of similar attributes We then propose an algorithm to identify a subset of attributes known as a

classifying data Association rules help to discover interesting patterns by identifying implication relationships among attribute-value pairs present in the data An example of an association rule is If a customer buys milk and diapers then the customer also buys beer and eggs Here milk diapers beer and eggs are attributes and they each take value

 where   denotes present and   denotes absent in the association rule Attributes can be either categorical e.g days of a week or quantitative e.g stock price Agrawal et al presented association rules that target identifying implication relationships among categorical attributes that take only

values Such association rules are called association rules Srikant et al introduced the more general association rules that accommodate both categorical and quantitative attributes Henceforward we will refer to quantitative association rules as association rules Much work 4 5 has been done in mining association rules that satisfy constraints such as minimum support a measure of signiìcance and minimum conìdence a measure of predictive ability Association rules can be used to solve the following problems nding clusters of similar attributes nding a small subset of attributes that inîuences a large section of other attributes and nding classiìcation rules to predict values of attributes Some domains where association rules 
boolean quantitative 
have found important applications are as follows in marketbasket type data for identifying sales patterns in medicine for identifying relationships among medical conditions and diseases in bioinformatics for identifying interrelationships among genes 8 and in nance for identifying prediction relationships among stocks Knobbe et al proposed an approach to mine a small set of binary attributes that help differentiate observations in a database Siebes et al and Bringmann et al 11 proposed techniques for compressing a database The compressed set of binary attributes could then be used in a data mining classiìer to avoid overìtting The above methods mainly attempt to identify informative sets of

and address a variety of problems such as similarity clustering leading indicators and classiìcation We propose a novel model for any database using a directed hypergraph in which the nodes represent attributes and the directed hyperedges represent many-to-many relationships among the attributes The weights on directed hyperedges capture the likeliness of association in a particular direction We introduce the notion of association rules for multivalued attributes which is an adaptation of the deìnition of quantitative association rules known in the literature The association rules for multi-valued attributes are integrated in building the directed hypergraph model Basing on this model we provide association-based similarity notions between any two attributes present a method for nding clusters of similar

to discretize the delta time-series into a set of values Timeseries are attributes and each observation is a list of discretized values assigned to the time-series on a particular day For the construction of the association hypergraph we try two conìgurations of parameters as follows conìguration sets to  in Deìnition 5 for directed edges say o  and for todirected hyperedges say  to and conìguration sets to  for directed edges to  and for directed hyperedges to  The choice for these values in both and are based on the following reasoning a these values of lead to higher ACV values of todirected hyperedges when compared to the constituent directed edges and a similar remark can be made for the values of  b these are the stable values of and  that is slight perturbations to these values do not result in signiìcant changes to the numbers of directed edges and todirected hyperedges in  and c the values in and the values in result in comparable numbers of directed edges and todirected hyperedges in  The conìguration leads to directed edges with a mean ACV of and todirected hyperedges with a mean ACV of and the conìguration leads to directed edges with a mean ACV of and todirected hyperedges with a mean ACV of  Table I shows for each conìguration the directed edge and the todirected hyperedge with the highest for each selected nancial time-series from different sectors For example the best prediction directed edge for GT The Goodyear Tire  Rubber Company shown in Row for and represents a relationship between GT and PPG PPG Industries Inc This relationship may be interpreted in terms of GT procuring raw materials e.g precipitated silicas from PPG for the manufacturing or processing of rubber A more interesting many-to-one relationship is represented by the best prediction todirected hyperedge for GT shown in Row for  Here the todirected hyperedge for GT represents a relationship of GT with DOW The Dow Chemical Company and F Ford Motor Company This relationship may be interpreted in terms of GT procuring raw materials e.g polyurethane polymer from DOW whereas the relationship with F may be attributed towards F utilizing the products e.g tires from GT Thus we see that todirected hyperedges provide meaningful and more interesting information than directed edges do Table II shows for each conìguration the todirected hyperedge with the highest and the constituent directed edges for each selected nancial time-series from different sectors For example in Row  for the accuracy of HES Hess Corporation predicting XOM Exxon Mobil Corporation is and SLB Schlumberger Limited predicting XOM is  but both of them together predicting XOM is  This shows that the combination of two nancial time-series leads to a better predicting todirected hyperedge Figure 1 compares in-similarity and out-similarity values with Euclidean similarity for conìguration  A similar gure for conìguration is omitted due to lack of space Here the Euclidean similarity between any two nancial time-series and is computed as follows Let and  where and are the values that and take in the th observation The Euclidean distance between and is deìned as ED normalized normalized  where for any vector  normalized  and   Now the Euclidean similarity ES between and is deìned as ES ED  Note that ES is a real value in the range such that a higher value indicates a greater similarity Figure 1 shows that Euclidean similarity does not differentiate between time-series pairs as distinctly as our similarity measures do This could be due to the fact that Euclidean similarity accounts for pair-wise differences in price variations on a day-to-day basis whereas the similarity measures account for the closeness in being associated with common sets of time-series on an average basis Figure 2\(a shows a clustering of nancial time-series for conìguration obtained using approach in Section III-A A similar gure for conìguration is omitted due to lack of space The collection is the set of all time-series in our data set The value of parameter in the clustering algorithm is set to  which is the total number of sub-sectors over the entire sectors as pointed out at the beginning of Section V The rst cluster center is picked from the sector as this sector has the maximum number of time-series in our data set We experimentally veriìed that the weight function in Deìnition 7 satisìes the triangle inequality property and hence the factor approximation of the optimal diameter of the clustering is in fact achieved by the algorithm For clarity of display Figure 2\(a shows clusters of size greater than  The edges that connect all cluster centers to other nodes in their clusters and the edges that interconnect the cluster centers are also shown in the gure This partial similarity graph consists of nodes and edges To show the quality of the clustering obtained the following information is relevant i the mean diameter over all clusters obtained is 0.83 and the overall mean distance in is 0.89 and ii the largest cluster of size 29 contains all time-series from the sector  We nd the leading indicators for a collection of nancial time-series using the approach in Section IV-A In order to obtain a dominator set that covers the rest of the time-series via directed edges and todirected hyperedges of high  we set a threshold for

Figure 6 is not as signiìcant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
