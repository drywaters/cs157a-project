A Proposal of Personal Information Trading Platform \(PIT A Fair Trading between Personal Information and Incentives Ake Osothongs School of Multidisciplinary, Department of Informatics The Graduate University for Advanced Studies Tokyo, Japan ake@nii.ac.jp  Noboru Sonehara Information and Society Research Division National Institute of Informatics School of Multidisciplinary, Department of Informatics The Graduate University for Advanced Studies Tokyo, Japan sonehara@nii.ac.jp  Abstract Personal information is a valuable asset for service p roviders  They need personal information for several reasons such as target advertising and personalization. Many methods are used to collect personal information from consumers However  sometimes more personal information than is need ed  is collected  Since consumers are now more concern ed  about their privacy, service providers are finding it a lot more difficult to collect  personal information, which results in less benefit for both consumers and service providers  In this study  w e propose a new personal information trading platform that provides benefit to both service providers and consumers We present the platform design, functions and benefits  a proposed trading model, and the balanced personal information tradeoff model which is used to measure the balance between the incentive t o the service provider and the personal information of the consumer   Ke ywords-personal information trading privacy personal information trading; personal information protection I   I NTRODUCTION  In the era of Big Data people connect themselves to digital networks  Internet users frequently disclose their personal information over online networks The service providers collect personal information and use it for several purposes such as for recommendation systems a nd personalized marketing Service providers can now easily collect personal information using registration forms and by collecting automatically generated information, such as web access history, location, and sensor information. This growth of information technology raises serious concerns regarding privacy issues for the consumer Individuals have their own right to disclose their personal information or not. However, people who lack awareness of the intricacies of information technology are confront ed with many risks, such as financial fraud and identity theft, when disclosing their personal information  Although personal information collection can be a serious risk it  creates new o pportunities for service providers Thus many service providers convince consumers to provide their personal information The disclosure of personal information is becoming a common online activity In order to consume these services, the consumers have no choice but to accept to disclose their personal information without any negotiations   So me authors suggest that the personal information can be a kind of commodity 1   2  Personal information becomes a resource that can be used within a company or may sold to others 3   However  it  is   difficult to accept be ing  treated  as an asset because  it is difficult to estimate the value  of personal informa tion There are researchers who have  worked on the value of personal information and the result s  vary  For example r esearch ers  developed a tool called Cloudsweeper   which aims a t find ing  the value of a n  email  account The email acco unt  value  is calculate d  from the service  account s  value  that are associated with each email  4    Otsuki and Sonehara  estimated the value of personal  info rmation using  a SNS utility  The result s  show  an  estimation value of the personal information  that  is b ased on the cost of the protection of personal information  5   These  research es  are just a couple of  example s  of  different opi nion s  about the value of personal information   Even if  the value  of personal information is diffic ult to estimate the service provider still offers the incentives as a reward to the  consumer in order to trade the ir  personal information The se  reward s  possibl y  affect  the self disclosure decision 6     Moreover the privacy and personal identity protection regulations are now very strict in many countries due to the rapid development of information technology This may create a new problem in the future as business industries might not be able to collect personal information from their consumers or cannot use their already collected personal information  They have  to find better ways to attract consumers and get them to provide their personal information and also to accept the usage of it This study proposes a personal information trading platform \(PIT\ and a model for personal information trading  This platform aims at  be ing a medium between the service and identity providers in order to provide maximum benefit for the service provider and privacy protection for the identity provider. In Section 2, we discuss the definition of personal ISBN: 978-1-4799-3724-0/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 269 


information that will be used in this research. In Section 3 we discuss the current problems involved in personal information trading and collection, which leads to the design of PIT In Section 4  we present the design architecture of PIT  its benefits, and propose a trading decision  W e discuss  an evaluation model  of the platform   How to find the maximum benefit for the service provider a s well as  provide privacy  protection to  the identity provider  is our focus so we present  a case study  for this  in Section 5 W e conclude  the future institutional requirements and the challenges f o r  implement ing  PIT  in the final section   II   P RELIMINARY DEFINITIO N  A collection of personal information problems usually starts with a question what is personal information The terms  information PI and  widely used interchangeably and have the same meaning T he ir  definitions have  been debated for a long time  especially in the legal terms  However, the definition is still unclear 5   7   th-TH  In early 2000s most personal information was still retained in offline databases  Personal information problems were not a big issue because it was easy to control  Privacy concerns arose when an individual system stored personal information that could identify an individual such as in a health care system Many countries back then defined personal information in the same way and it was usually defined as information that can be identified directly or indirectly to an individual or a single person 7   8   T h e  personally identifiable information PII 9    10  had the same meaning in many counties   Information technology have recently become tightly integrated with human life The definition of personal information has changed to refle ct  the new age Big Data which at small information prices can lead to identifying a n individual Even if a de identification method such as anonymization, encryption and data shading have been used to protect an individual, researchers have frequently proven that anonymized information can be re-identified to an individual 11    12    Therefore personal information is any information relating to an individual. It can be any information direct ly or indirect ly  collect ed  from an individual regardless of its source   III  P R OBLEM S OF PI COLLECTION AND TRADI NG  W e focused on the following personal information collection and trading problems in our study   Illegal collectors  Even though privacy laws and regulations that deal with the collection of PI  have been published in many countries and are widely debate d illegal collector s  are  still a big problem Today t here are a lot of untrustworthy PI  collectors  such a s unknown application providers  who ask for   PI  when they  install an application   Lack of fair trading  People usually focus on the protection of privacy for consumers but the trading benefits for the service providers usually are ignored Some researchers suggest that the consumer hide their PI  Alastair et al introduced MockDroid  a modified version of the Android operating system, which provides a method to return a valid but incorrect information to the service provider [13   Georgios, Michalis, and Evangelos implemented a SudoWeb module, an extension for the Google web browser, in which the user can select an identity from two prepared identities when using a social login 14  These are examples of the customer protection that does not return any value back to the service provider No o pt out and limit of usage time  The European Commission proposed a new  that allows people to opt-out from the service providers  15   No wadays many websites and applications state the ir  privacy agreements and show the opt-out option. However sometimes people cannot control the opt-out request For example  emails were illegal ly  co llected by web crawlers and illegally sold online in the black market  Another problem occurs when PI has been collected and there are no statements as to th e limit of usage time of the PI      Over trading  The service provider always requests as  much PI as they desire  They can request more information than is necessary One problem is it is difficult to find the balance between the protection of privacy and the utilization of the information 16    W e a  re always faced with this kind of request in many services such as a request on a mobile phone application and social network login  Felt et al. found that the popular Facebook applications require too much PI  wh en a consumer requests the ir services [17       Fake PI   The service provider can collect the automatically generated information. However, the PI that is directly collect ed  from the consumer provider is still necessary Identity providers usually submit fake PI  for several reasons. Some criminals use it for criminal activities such as identity fraud 18    So m e cr ea te  f a k e p r o f ile s  to  h id e  th emselves when they use the online services such as social network service 19    Mo r eo v er   s o m e p r o f ess io n al ad v i s e rs  ad vise people to use fake information when they do  no t  trust the service provider  20    T h is  f ak e PI  can be a method to hide the ir identity on the Internet, but we argue that this leads to a new problem when the legal service providers use the PI  for their legal purposes   I V  P ROPOSAL OF PIT   A  P ERSONAL I NFORMATION T RADING P LATFORM  Some reviews for resolving the problems with PI  collection and PI trading we re  described in Section 3  Therefore, we propose a new Personal Information Trading platform \(PIT\ to solve the se issues   A  P latform design The proposed PIT in this study is expect ed to contain the following three components ISBN: 978-1-4799-3724-0/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 270 


a  A Service Provider\(SP  provides any services or products that require PI For example, hotel, travel agencies and finance institutions, etc b  An Identity Provider\(IdP  is a consumer and their personal information   c  An Personal Information Trading Platform PIT  address es between a SP and an IdP   Fig 1  Platform Architecture of PIT   Fig 2  The design of sequence diagram for PIT   Figure 1 shows the platform architecture of PIT, which consists of 3 modules security management offer management and incentive management systems  Figure 2 represents the design of a sequence diagram for PIT The following activities occur dur in g each trading activity 1  SP selects an IdP target group and sends an offer 2  IdP receives an offer and makes a decision   3  I dP sends a response of the offer 4  PIT sends the response with the PI to the SP 5  SP sends an incentive to PIT with the PI request 6  PIT sends incentives to the IdP B  Functions and benefits SP s currently offer incentives to attract IdPs to provide their PI  The incentive can be monetary such as a gift voucher product discount  and coupon However it is still difficult to collect reliable information from an IdP as described in Section 3  The PIT is a platform that will be placed between the SP and IdP. It can provide the following benefits to the SP and IdP a  SP  The PIT requires registrations from the SP when it  requests the PIT service the first time The PIT administrator reviews the SP to filter out illegal collectors The objects of this action are to reduce the number of illegal collectors and gain the trust of each SP to increase the selfdisclosure level of the IdPs  The PIT provides the list of IdPs and their PI in an an onymity format that the SP can select as a target group in order to send the offer This method can decrease the cost of the advertising because the SP can select quality IdPs as a target group and aims at  increasing the response rate   b  I dP  The PIT allows IdPs to approve or reject the incentive offers when receiving them from SPs For this reason it is possible to build up the IdPs confidence for providing real PI  in the platform The PIT decreases the amount of over-requested information by controlling the balance between an offered incentive and the requested PI  Moreover, the trading is not limit ed  to the PI of the IdP but also includes the usage policy such as the usage time limit and information sharing agreement C  Trading Model development Regarding the assumption that the PI  trading activity constitutes a SP  and an IdP we propose a model that describes the trading of PI and associated incentives among SP s We begin with the concept of a simple socially beneficial model to depict a comprehensive view of our model  We chose a socially beneficial model because money cannot be used to di rectly represent the value of PI The IdP does not decide to trade his information solely for money The social benefits for PI trading are the sum of the profits of both the SP  and that of  the IdP. Then we also look at the concept of social exchange theory for looking into the decision of the trading activity for the IdP and SP because it suggests that  behavior is a result of the exchange process between the cost \(C\ and reward \(R   W e h ave structured the simplest model for illustration purposes here. The situation is an SP who wants to trade an incentive to  IdPs Let i be the SP  who wants to trade the incentive for the PI  The cost of the SP when providing an offer is the incentive value of the offer. The reward of the SP  is the value from the PI including the value chain in the business The total SP profit can be express ed  by     There is only one SP in this study so the total SP profit is       1 ar-SA  L et j be the number of IdPs who use service provider i  The cost of the IdP  is the value of the PI from the  perspective. The reward of the IdP  is the value of the incentives that were offered by the SP. When a SP sends an ISBN: 978-1-4799-3724-0/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 271 


offer of incentives to more than one IdP, the total profit of the IdP consists of the cost C IdP  and reward R IdP  It can be expressed as          2 Fo r the PIT, the value of the PI from the SP  the  perspectives are important. However, the values of PI from the IdPs perspective always fluctuate and change In the prototype design  each IdP has to complete a value of PI questionnaire before starting the trade  The results of the total profit of the SP  X and IdP Y can be positive  and negative Figure 3 shows a flowchart of a decision model in the PIT When the SP can gain profit from the trade X > 0  the PIT suggests it to create an offer. Then, after the I dP registers in the system, the PIT calculates the total profit of the offer for the IdP. If the IdP can gain profit from the trade Y  0  the PIT suggests the trade to the IdP This decision module aims to create a win-win situation for both sides  Fig 3  Decision flowchart of PIT  For example, we analyzed a situation in which the SP is in the hotel business. The hotel wants to increase the number of customers, so it creates a discount coupon to discount the room price to trade with the PI. C SP is value of the discount advertising cost  R SP  is va lu e of the PI from the  perspective + the other related profits, such as the restaurant spa, etc C IdP  is value of the PI from the   R IdP is value of the discount coupon D  Balanced personal information tradeoff Model We propose a model for use in the PIT for estimating the balanced PI tradeoff in order to provide an effective and fair trade by supplying the maximum benefits to the SP while protecting the privacy of the IdP  This model comes from an assumption that each business has a different PI necess it y level and each person has his or her own PI value  Each SP has a specified demand of PI attributes. The SP continuously increases the level of services or products when the IdP discloses their PI  However  the SP in each specified business ha s a limit of their services or products When the IdP continuously provides more PI to the SP  the PI attributes will exceed the necessity of the business. In the trading, we focus on the value of each type of PI in a specified business  and the value of each type of PI for the IdP  When  is high, the necessity of that PI is high. When is low, the necessity for that PI is also low. On the other hand th e IdP does not want to disclose thei r PI when  is high. When  is low, the IdP ea sily discloses their PI In this research both the  and   have been used t o  calculate the total value of the PI for a specified business        3   w here n is the amount of PI in a business Even if the IdP continuously provides more PI after all the necessary PI have been collected  the services or products of the SP remain the same. Thus, it is not necessary to provide PI that does not relate to the business For this reason the maximum PI tradeoff between the offer and value of the PI can be decided on from the highest necessity PI attributes for a specified business and the highest offer 100 of the offer If  the IdP wants to provide only parts of the PI, the offer can be decreased   Mo reover  there are several situations in which the IdP trades between the PI  and the incentives Both sides can  possibly gain and lose their benefits  First a SP may request a lot of information so the IdP los es their benefits when they trade high value PI for low value offers. Second a SP may provide a high offer for low value PI The balanced PI tradeoff model to avoid an unbalanced trade can be expressed using the following linear regression       4  where X max is a total value of PI at maximum offer 100  Figure 4 shows the relation between the offer level and the total value of the PI for a specified business on the PIT platform using the balanced PI tradeoff model. For the same amount of PI, a SP or an IdP might possibly lose benefit when they do not carefully make the trade   Fig 4  Illustration of balanced PI trade off  Moreover, we might be able to judge the value of the PI for creating a win-win situation by determining the maximum profit for both the SP and IdP. When a SP requests more PI from the IdP, there are three possib le cases when we compare the value of the PI for the SP in a specified business and from the IdP during the trade for each PI attribute  Case 1: The value of the PI for the SP in a specified business is high but the value of the PI for the IdP is low. Case 2: The value of the ISBN: 978-1-4799-3724-0/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 272 


PI for the SP in a specified business is the same value as that for the IdP Case 3 The value of the PI for the SP in a specified business is low but the value of the PI for the IdP is high. The PI in Case 1 is the best choice for the SP for gaining maximum profit during the trade because the SP can negotiate for a lower cost from the IdP. Thus, Case 2 is the second choice, and Case 3 is the worst choice V  A  C ASE STUDY   T RAVEL BUSINESS  In Section 4  we discussed the design of the PIT platform, trading model, and evaluation model. We aimed t o evaluate our balanced PI tradeoff model in this case study W e have selected the travel business which is it is one of the most popular businesses that adopt online information technology into the business model as a case study A  Sampling frame and Measurement The value of the PI for a SP in the travel business in this study was calculated by the necessity of the PI for the SP in the travel business  The following two sampling frame groups were the ones we focus ed on    1  SP  We consider ed  the necessity of PI in the travel business by focusing on the average value of PI in the travel business  We gathered the PI attributes from the registration pages of the websites from many businesses to study the necessity of PI for general SP s. The websites were selected from the top-ranking websites from the Alexa website, which publicly provides  s We chose this data collection method because we want ed to find the minimum PI necessary for a specified business. W e can interview SP s but they may add unnecessary PI in their answers for other objectives   2 IdP We used an online questionnaire to find the value of PI for the IdPs. In this research, we chose the comfort level in which discloser of their PI to a SP is acceptable as the value of the PI for the IdP. The sampling frames study came from people who regularly use the Internet  The monitors we re in Thailand and they were between 15 to 70 year old. We used the five stages assessment system to ask about the comfortable level when disclosing their PI requested from an  online SP  Level 5 is the most un comfortable level for disclosing PI whereas Level 1 is the most comfortable B  Results and analyses  Personal information was collect ed  from 212  websites T here are a total of 35 PI attributes th at were collect ed from the 212 websites for several businesses From the websites collected  there were 25 travel websites and 19 PI attributes that were collect ed by the travel business es  The number of websites that collect ed each PI attribute was calculated into  a percentage  A higher percentage of the websites that request ed  PI  means that the PI wa s more necessary in the travel business field  Then the percentage was normalized from 0 to 5 for analysis purposes   Next, we design ed  a set of questions for the IdP using the PI attributes that were collected by the SP. We asked for the comfort level when the IdP discloses each PI attribute  532 people completed the survey. The respondent information in this survey i s summarized in Table 1  The results for each type of PI were collect ed  and calculated using arithmetic means for our analysis purposes TABLE I  R ESPONDENT P ROFILE   Age   Education   15 20  3.7   High school  5.4   21 30  39 3   College  2.8   31 40  47.8   Bachelor's degree  47.6   41 60  8.6   Graduate degree  40.5   More than 60  0 03     Career   Gender   Student  16.6   Male  48.4   Self employ  14 0   Female  52.1   Private company  32 0     Government officer  27 2     State Enterprise  2.8     Unemployed/Housemaid  3.5     Other s  3.5      The charts i n Figure 5 show the results of the values of each PI  attribute for the SP s and IdPs The travel business collects 19 PI attributes that are maximum necessity PI for the travel business  The results were sort ed and re arranged by V SP  from high to low W e can easily understand from the results the proportion of V SP and V IdP In this case study, the values of some PI attributes are on the same direction. For example, the values for their home number and last name are important for both the SP and IdP However the values of some PI are totally conflicting For example the business phone number and company address have high values for the IdP but low ones for the SP th-TH  Fig 1  Value of PI for SP and IdP Moreover, we are able to divide the results of PI in this case study into three groups using value of the PI for the SP. We assume a necessary  point that separates the results when the V SP is more than 2 1  Necessary PI \(NPI  The value of the PI for the SP is higher than the necessary point. These PI are highly required for a specified business 2  Additional PI \(API The  value of the PI for the SP is lower than the necessary point but higher than zero. These PI are moderately required for a specified business ISBN: 978-1-4799-3724-0/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 273 


3  Unnecessary PI \(UPI The value of the PI for the SP is zero  These PI are of no value to a specified business ar-SA  The SP can reduce the trading cost by decreasing the request for some PI which are API and UPI. If the SP needs more API it can select API that has a h igh value of PI for them but a low value for the IdP, such as their gender Furthermore  Figure 6 shows the evaluation results from the balanced PI  tradeoff model The chart shows that the maximum tradeoff position when the SP collects all the necessary PI attributes and provides 100 of their offer. In o rder to reduce the offer cost the SP may decrease the amount of PI that is request ed from the IdP. Besides, SP can estimate the offer cost, if IdP negotiates to  enclose some PI  Fig 2  Evaluation results of balanced PI tradeoff model for the travel industry VI  C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  Recent results suggest that PI collection is a major key to targeted advertising. Trading with an incentive has recently become a method that SP s use to attract the Id P to provide PI  However, the trade balance between the SP and IdPs is still difficult to adjust W e tried to determine the current problems with PI  collection and PI  trading in this study  We proposed a personal information trading platform called PIT which aims at  be ing a middle man between the SP and IdP. Not only does it provide the trading platform but it also aims to recommend a reasonable trade providing maximum profit for the SP  and privacy protection for the IdPs. We proposed a balanced personal information tradeoff model that uses the value of PI from both the SP  IdP  s to find the balanced tradeoff position  The balanced personal information tradeoff provides an appropriate level of trade in which the SP s do not lose their profits and the IdPs do not unnecessarily disclose PI      ar-SA  T he future challenges of the development of PIT are security issues and intelligence functions Security technology has to be carefully integrated within the platform because PIT contains PI  that can be a target of criminals  After developing the platform, it will be possible to increase the system performance by combining it with an intelligence system such as an automated negotiation system VII  R EFERENCES  1  R.

extension on different machines in a network Figure 7b shows an infographic where  RSP  stands for remote synchronization point S  for server IC  for input client and OC  for output client Deployment of a remote synchronization point starts with deploying an RSP S on some machine in the network Essentially an RSP S is a Web service implemented using J AX WS  5 whose operations provide its clients access to a classical LSP inside of it Once an RSP S has been deployed one can construct input and output ports to access it including input and output clients During execution those port interfaces use such clients for delegating to the deployed RSP S  those method calls that they cannot process locally e.g checking for pending I  O operations The CA implementations that call methods on port interfaces do not know whether those calls require network communication whether synchronization points accessed through port interfaces run locally or remotely is completely transparent B Hybrid Code Generator Our extension to the Reo-to-Java code generator is as the original—implemented in Java as an Eclipse plugin This plug-in depends on the Extensible Coordination Tools E CT  a collection of Eclipse plug-ins that constitute an IDE for Reo 6 Our extension outputs  Java classes one for every part in the reasonable partition computed using the algorithm in Figure 6—each of which implements the Runnable interface Instances of those classes can be deployed on different machines and connected to each other via distributed-memory ports including the required remote synchronization point servers and clients For testing purposes the code generator also generates a default main program which deploys an instance of each of the  classes and each of the required distributed-memory ports on the same machine For performance reasons we simpli\002ed the implementation of the algorithm in Figure 6 and the actual code generation process using ANTLR's StringTemplate engine by exploiting the observation that the only primitive currently supported by the E CT that satis\002es the 002rst condition in Lemma 3 is FIFO  This for instance reduced checking the condition of the if statement in Figure 6 from iterating over all transitions of a CA to checking that CA s type V C ASE S TUDY In the following case study we elaborate on the same example as given in which implements a classical onlinepurchase scenario This interaction involves four Web services  WS  named ClientBroker  StoreOf\002ce  SalesOf\002ce  and Bank  The ClientBroker service takes care of interfacing a client to the other services which deal with the information about the store i.e the StoreOf\002ce service the procedure 5 http://jax-ws.java.net 6 http://reo.project.cwi.nl Figure 8 Connector for orchestrating the four WS s Colored regions denote deployment of medium CA implementations and the StoreOf\002ce service on machine Blue to prepare the invoice i.e the SalesOf\002ce service and the effective payment management i.e the Bank service See for a more detailed d e scription Figure 8 sho ws a Reo connector named Orchestrator  for orchestrating the four WS s A Reo expert designed this connector by hand Alternatively depending on the expertise available in an organization one can specify the orchestration protocol as an automaton as a B PEL program or as a U ML sequence/activity diagram and use mechanical connector synthesis technology to obtain this or a behaviorally equivalent connector 16 In Jongmans et al generate a centralized implementation of Orchestrator and deploy that implementation on a single machine in a network We improve on that by using our hybrid-code generator to obtain a hybrid implementation and deploy it across multiple machines First our code generator establishes that Orchestrator consists of 43 channels and 42 nodes It then matches each of those constituents with a CA describing that constituent's behavior which yields k  85 small CA  For instance Figure 9 shows seven CA describing the constituents in the largest colored region in Figure 8 Next our code generator runs the algorithm in Figure 6 to obtain a reasonable partition This partition consists of thirteen parts seven singleton parts for asynchronous regions i.e FIFO s which satisfy 1 000  and six parts for synchronous regions For instance the CA in Figure 9 form a complete part of the latter kind none of those seven CA shares a port with any CA in any other part The code generator then computes for every part the 002 product of the CA in that part This yields   13 medium CA  For instance Figure 10 shows the 002 product of the CA in Figure 9 Finally the code generator compiles the thirteen medium CA to as many CA implementations For instance at run-time the generated implementation of the CA in Figure 10 has only one execution step i.e transition that it repeats in\002nitely often it atomically transports a piece of data from StoreOf\002ce to SalesOf\002ce and

orders 8 Because the hybrid approach allows us to sensibly distribute CA implementations over machines minimizing network traf\002c as explained above it is—contrasting the centralized approach—suitable for Big Data coordination VI R ELATED W ORK In this section we list a selection of related work on Reo and distributed orchestration/work\003ow For reasons of space here we merely describe related work without comparing it to our work see for additional comparati v e notes A Related Work on Reo Closest to ours is the work on splitting connectors into a regions for better performance Proenc¸a developed the 002rst implementation based on these ideas demonstrated its merit through benchmarks and invented a new automaton model to reason about split connectors 5 B Related Work on Distributed Orchestration/Work\003ow To put our previous case study in perspective we conclude with related work on distributed orchestration/work\003ow In Nanda et al present a technique for partitioning a composite service written as a single B PEL  program into an equivalent set of decentralized processes In their approach Nanda et al construct the dependency graph of a B PEL program with the aim of minimizing communication costs while maximizing throughput In Cha\003e et al decentralize the orchestration of a FindRoute service by partitioning the B PEL code into four parts which are executed by four distinct Java engines Afterward Cha\003e et al compare the performance of the centralized and the decentralized implementation by using both service-time and message-size metrics Cha\003e et al also estimate the additional complexity in error recovery and fault handling in a decentralized orchestration In Mostarda et al use a B PEL based language for distributed orchestration in the context of pervasive computing In their approach Mostarda et al automatically decompose a centralized work\003ow into implementations of 002nite state machines that when synchronized using a consensus protocol execute the original work\003ow In Fern  andez et al introduce an execution model for distributed orchestration based on a metaphor from chemistry In this approach services communicate with each other through a distributed shared multiset chemical solution which contains both control-\003ow and data-\003ow information molecules A work\003ow engine then executes an orchestration protocol by applying formal rewrite rules chemical reactions Fern  andez et al propose translating B PEL programs to chemical representations that the work\003ow engine they describe can process 8 Nowadays these qualify as Big Data Wal-Mart handles more than one million customer transactions every hour feeding databases estimated at more than 2.5 petabytes http://www.economist.com/node/15557443 In Bark er et al present an architecture including a proxy API  for optimizing data-\003ow in work\003ow execution In their architecture control-\003ow messages are still sent to a centralized orchestration engine while data-\003ow messages i.e the actual potentially large pieces of data go directly from one service to another The latter reduces network traf\002c and it coincides with the heuristic we adopted for distributing the CA implementations over machines in our case study Similarly motivated as the work of Barker et al i.e optimizing data-\003ow in Binder et al propose a distributed orchestration methodology based on decomposing an orchestration protocol or work\003ow into a directed acyclic graph of service invocations represented as triggers  Every trigger encodes the data dependencies of the invocation it represents i.e the parents and children of the corresponding node in the graph Triggers act as proxies they collect all input data before actually invoking the service and they transmit all output data directly to the dependent triggers for subsequent service invocations In T retola and Zimeo present a technique for improving concurrency in work\003ow execution Their technique works by concurrently executing otherwise sequential datadependent service invocations with dummy data until those services require the actual data If service invocations have a data-independent initialization phase for instance the work\003ow engine of Tretola and Zimeo executes those intialization phases in parallel instead of in sequence For work\003ows and services implemented on top of the framework of Tretola and Zimeo this process happens automatically In Pedraza and Estublier present FOCAS This framework consumes as input an annotated APEL speci\002cation of an orchestration scenario and produces as output a number of suborchestrations and a deployment plan for distributing suborchestrations over machines Finally in Muth et al use the formal semantics of state/activity charts to develop an algorithm for transforming centralized state/activity charts into equivalent partitioned ones suitable for distributed execution by a work\003ow engine Muth et al subsequently re\002ne their basic approach to also reduce communication overhead and exploit parallelism between parts in partitions VII C ONCLUSION We presented a hybrid approach for the implementation of Reo connectors by partitioning them into several a regions at build-time Every such region can be executed on a different machine at run-time We use the term hybrid because our approach is neither purely centralized regions run in parallel at run-time nor purely distributed the elements inside a region are compiled to a sequential program at build-time and require no distributed algorithms or communication at run-time In this way we have the bene\002ts of both pure approaches the high run-time

Changing the data rate from 10 kbps to 10 MBps to 1 GBps resulted in a cost of $11.35 11.4 and 11.45 million respectively Since COTS products will be used to support the communication link these cost estimates imply that there will be only a 100,000 difference in deploying a radio transmitter 10 kbps\ or deploying an optical transmitter \(1 GBps\ on the 10 kg nano-satellite While previous proposals have certainly supported the availability for laser technologies 50   t h e o p tical d e m o n s tr ati o n s  t h at ar e c u r r en tl y  b ei n g  developed by DLR in Germany and the Aerospace Corporation in the US 51  clea r l y  d e m o n s tr ate  th a t t h e  cost of optical technology is more than that Similarly changing the pointing accuracy from 0.1 0.01 to 0.001 degrees resulted in the cost increasing from FY97 $ 6.45 11.33 and 22.21 million respectively The technology to support 0.1 degrees \(sun sensors\ is different from that to support 0.001 degrees star trackers However current COTS quotations \(e.g. Blue Canyon technologies XACT show that it costs 100,000 for a nanosat star tracker system Integration may cost a few additional thousands but estimating it to 18 million more sounds a bit too much  The SSCM sensitivity study above highlights the need to have cost models that are more sensitive to different technologies and their associated complexities Complexity and risk assessment has been proposed by the Aerospace Corporation in the form of their COBRA model  We used the COBRA model in our next study where the methodology and data sets are detailed in \([39   40    5 2     T h e d ata s et r elati v e to  w h ic h  co m p le x ities  ar e  calculated included 120 DoD and NASA missions from after FY89 excluded launch delays or failures and projects with heavy international cooperation. Complexity drivers include  Table 4  column 1 subsystem technical parameters e.g mass power performance technology choices\ and programmatic factors \(e.g., heritage, level of redundancy, foreign partnership  Forty such parameters are considered that are either continuous e.g mass power and represent a range of values bounded by a minimum and maximum, or discrete such as propulsion type \(none, cold gas, monopropellant bipropellant or ion engine\ that represent a finite number of choices    For our smallsat case study, the factors corresponding to spacecraft complexity as they proposed are listed in Table 4 along with the minimum and maximum value that the component takes within their data set The column  candidate nano-satellite which will be a part of a DSM  different 3D angles from the same ground spot as it formation flies in LEO 53  5 4 55    Fo r  ea ch  f ac to r   the complexity of the nanosat is calculated as a percentage of where the data point corresponding to the nanosat lies with respect to the data points for all the other space missions considered. For discrete data, the discrete rank of the data is assessed and then converted into a percentage The average complexity of the proposed nanosat is calculated to be 21.64 


 12  Table 4: Cost estimated for a spacecraft as a function of the relative complexity of its components with respect to components used in previous missions  Based Risk Assessment \(COBRA\ model. Inputs \(Data in Column 3\ are from a candidate nanosatellite mission    The map between complexity percentile and required mission cost and development time for successful missions green triangles is shown in Figure 8  using a green trend line. The missions plotted are among the 120 studied missions and equations are mentioned within the  attempted cheaper than or faster than this model predicts then there is a large probability of failure as highlighted by the red and yellow crosses on Figure 8  Using the above model the estimated cost for our candidate nanosatellite 10 kg mission is 35.824 million and the estimated development time is 35.074 months The high cost is in keeping with the intuition expressed in the data collection section that the cost of LEO small satellites are driven more by technology than mass so the utility of shrinking the satellite should be critically assessed and avoided if the mission technology is very state of art In such cases, micro satellites would win the performance to cost ratio battle    Figure 8: Predicted mission cost and development time as a function of relative mission complexity with respect to other missions evaluated by the Aerospace Corporation [39    4 0     5 2    M is s io n c o m ple x it y  is  a  function of component complexities as calculated in Table 4 The candidate mission is a LEO satellite measuring passive Earth reflectance as part of a DSM  We ran a sensitivity analysis for the COBRA model by varying the deltaV and pointing accuracy required by the candidate satellite It does a great job in predicting the increase in costs from 1 degree to 0.01 or 0.1 degree, by 


 13  estimating a $ 200-250 increase. It overshoots the COTS quotations by a slight margin but is certainly better than the SSCM estimate of  18 million more When the required delta-V is increased from none to 40 m/s to 80 m/s to 120 m/s the respective costs are estimated to be FY97 $ 35.79, 35.82, 35.85 and 35.88 million. Quotations from a 3D cold gas propulsion system printing company called AustinSat revealed that their 1U propulsion unit capable of providing 40 m/s of delta V costs 100,000 with 6DOF thrusters included and would scale almost linearly as more 1U units are added for 40 m/s of more delta-V  The COTS systems therefore cost more than what the COBRA model predicts. The model can thus be improved and made more suitable for COTS-supported small satellites if COTS data and figures were included in the data set to calculate complexity. Since we do not have the data set only the published Figure 8  we could not make the changes  Since many small satellite missions are collaborations between many organizations, the COBRA model could be improved by adding a foreign partnership complexity factor that captures the number of collaborators not just the nationality For example a recent paper 56   formulated a data supported method of capturing international cooperation related complexity using cyclometric  complexity where CGF  0.917  0.0575*CyclometricNumber and CyclometricNumber  f\(nodes, edges, outputs    Figure 9: Cost growth required to support increasing TRL for any component as published in [57    Small satellites are always pushing the boundaries of technology. It is very probable that some of its component values will fall out of range available from past missions In such a case, cost models of TRL transition such as the one shown in Figure 9  57  s h o u ld  b e in co r p o r ated  in to  the COBRA model for the relevant factors Although TRL transition correlates to the spending it does not follow traditional 80-20 rule The COBRA model also does not capture the structural complexity of a small tightly packed satellite which has been theoretically shown to drive development costs. Structural complexity can be quantified using a simple framework shown in Figure 10 35  34   an d  ca n  b e ea s il y  i n tr o d u ce d  i n  t h e COBRA model via a new factor and recalculating the data fit  Capturing the above development costs is important for small satellites whose costs are driven more by technology than by mass. Again, since we do not have the data set \(only the published Figure 8 we could not make the changes   Figure 10 Structural complexity metric introduced and validated in [35  a nd   3 4    5  C ONCLUSIONS    We identify three major problems with current cost and risk models that limit their direct application to estimating the costs of DSMs They are the absence of reliable learning curve factors small satellite 20 kg costing tools and operations costing  Existing models and methodologies that may be applicable in part to DSMs have been identified and presented using an extensive literature survey We select ed  some appropriate methods and applied them to estimate the cost of small satellites and small satellite DSMs The exercise helped us point out valuable insights and/or inconsistencies in the results with respect to the data We also suggest methods to modify the models so that they become more suitable for small satellite DSMs  As future work the operations cost model and dynamic complexity of the mission is expected to be captured by a Systems Dynamics Model Re sults from model simulations can provide insight into the effect of design and operation decisions on lifecycle cost and risk expected to improve upon the Monte Carlo results The model results can guide the trade-off of cost with performance and can help in the se lection of a final point design for any given DSM
