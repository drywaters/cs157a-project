REFERENCES  10 BIOGRAPHY  10 1 INTRODUCTION MSL is taxing the limits of current modeling capabilities for Mars entry missions Aeroheating uncertainties are greater than 5000 on the heatshield due primarily to early transition to turbulence surface chemistry and ablation induced roughness 
A primary source of this uncertainty is a lack of relevant flight data to validate and improve computational models Flight data are required for engineering validation 1 1 U.S Government work not protected by U.S copyright 2IEEEAC paper 1510 Version 3 Updated December 15 2007 1 


of atmospheric models especially in terms of Martian atmospheric winds and density aerothermodynamics models entry system aerodynamics models and TPS response models The data obtained will allow validation of Earth-based physical models and subscale testing procedures for the Martian carbon-dioxide atmosphere In addition Entry Descent and Landing EDL flight data will allow separation of the atmospheric and aerodynamic performance issues that is not possible with inertial data alone Uncertainties in these models are significant and limit the ability to design and validate a more robust EDL architecture for future planetary missions The database of EDL flight data is sparse with the bulk of data acquired in the 1960s primarily in support of the Apollo program Furthermore for the most part these data sets have not been critically evaluated or used for codevalidation purposes in more than 30 years Recent attempts to propose dedicated flight experiments have failed to reach fruition largely because of budget constraints and competing mission objectives While many early planetary missions contained at least a minimal set of engineering instruments including Pioneer Venus Viking and Galileo attempts to instrument recent science mission vehicles have been largely unsuccessful This policy change was mainly because of conflicting mission assurance concerns and the high priority on utilization of limited financial resources for science payloads While a brief highlight of MEDLI-relevant EDL flight experience is given here a more comprehensive summary of aeroheating flight data is provided in 1 and an overview of the flush air data system flown on the Shuttle is given in 2 In 1976 the two Viking entry vehicles were instrumented with pressure and temperature sensors and provided the first aerodynamic flight data on Mars Both probes were 70degree sphere-cones with an ablative forebody heat shield made of a lightweight silicone-based ablator called SLA561V injected into a phenolic fiberglass honeycomb structure Atmospheric properties along the reconstructed flight trajectories are provided by Seiff and Kirk.3 Each probe included a base pressure sensor and two surfacemounted aft-body temperature sensors one on the fiberglass inner cone and one on the aluminum skin of the outer cone.4 The base pressure sensor was mounted inside the vented aeroshell Three of the four temperature sensors functioned as expected but the sensor on the aluminum outer cone of the Viking I entry vehicle failed near the peak heating point Edquist et al examined the aft-body thermocouple data on Viking I and showed that modern computational tools generally under-predict the measured heating rates.5 The Shuttle Entry Air Data System SEADS was a flush mounted orifice air data system in the nose cap of the Shuttle Orbiter It provided accurate data across the Orbiter speed range throughout the sensible atmospheric flight region Fourteen pressure ports were located in the shape of a cruciform in the nose cap Acquired data when coupled with static pressure ports mounted on the fuselage permitted computation of angle of attack angle of side slip Mach number and velocity.2 In 1997 the entry vehicle of Mars Pathfinder was instrumented with nine thermocouples TCs embedded at various depths within the vehicle's TPS also SLA-561V and three platinum resistance thermometers PRTs used to provide a reference calibration point for the TC data Three of the nine thermocouples including two of three on the backshell returned no useful data and apparently failed prior to or during launch.6 Of the other six thermocouples the temperature data from those on the heatshield TC2TC6 is incorrect because the cold-junction temperature from PRT2 was pegged at the low temperature cutoff during entry This calibration error was partially corrected with pre-launch calibration data and the resulting reconstructed heat flux was consistent with approximately 85 of the predicted laminar fully catalytic level.6 The MEDLI dataset will provide the first non-Earth entry aeroheating data since the Pathfinder mission and will provide more than an order of magnitude more data than all previous Mars entry missions combined The acquired data will help answer some of the fundamental questions relating to leeside turbulent heating levels forebody transition and TPS material response in a carbon dioxide atmosphere and will permit a more accurate trajectory reconstruction as well as enable separation of aerodynamic and atmospheric uncertainties in the hypersonic and supersonic regimes Overview ofMSL The MSL EDL system is a new architecture based on Viking heritage technologies and designed to meet the challenges of landing larger mass payloads on Mars.7 In accordance with level-I requirements the MSL EDL system is being designed to land an 850 kg rover to altitudes as high as 1 km above the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter MOLA defined areoid and within 10 km of the desired landing site Accordingly MSL will enter and land the greatest entry mass fly the largest aeroshell generate the highest hypersonic lift-to-drag ratio and deploy the largest Disk-Gap-Band supersonic parachute of any previous mission to Mars One primary departure from heritage design is the use of the sky crane terminal descent system which will replace the Pathfinder heritage airbags and lower the rover to the Mars surface on a tether A second major departure from Viking heritage may be the choice of heatshield TPS material Due to the high heating and shear environments encountered during MSL entry the program has recently baselined Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator PICA as the heatshield TPS material with SLA561V carried as a backup PICA has flown previously on Stardust,7 and is the current baseline material for NASA's Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle CEV heatshield One 2 


important distinction is that PICA will require a tiled ablator integration whereas SLA is a monolithic material embedded in a honeycomb structure Major EDL events include the hypersonic guided entry supersonic parachute deploy and inflation subsonic heatshield jettison terminal descent sensor acquisition powered descent initiation sky crane terminal descent rover touchdown detection and descent stage flyaway As shown in Figure 1 MSL contains five major subsystems The cruise stage provides protection and support to the entry vehicle and rover throughout the in-space cruise phase and is jettisoned prior to atmospheric entry The backshell and heatshield form the entry vehicle which houses the rover and descent stage While descending on the subsonic parachute the heatshield is separated from the entry vehicle The descent stage then separates from the backshell and performs the terminal descent and lowers the rover to the Martian surface The major phases of the MSL EDL sequence are discussed in greater detail in 8 BakhCr/uise Stage Descent Stage Heatshield Figure 1 MSL Major Subsystems Overview of MEDLI instrumentation The MEDLI instrumentation suite consists of seven pressure ports and seven integrated sensor plugs as well as supporting electronics and wiring The suite consists of three main subsystems 1 MEDLI Integrated Sensor Plug MISP A circular plug formed from the heatshield TPS material containing four embedded thermocouples and a recession sensor 2 Mars Entry Atmospheric Data System MEADS A series of through-holes or ports in the TPS that connect via tubing to pressure transducers mounted on the heatshield interior 3 Sensor Support Electronics SSE Electronics that condition sensor signals provide power to the sensors and interface to the MSL data acquisition system All instrumentation is installed in the forebody heatshield of the MSL entry vehicle at locations determined by the science team to maximize the value of the aerothermal aerodynamic and TPS material response data The stacked thermocouples will record temperature data at varying depths in the heatshield TPS The recession sensors will measure an isotherm in the thermal protection system as it ablates during atmospheric entry The pressure ports are arranged in a bilaterally symmetric pattern about the stagnation point to provide a flush atmospheric data system from which aerodynamic data can be computed Figure 2 Locations of MISP plugs and MEADS ports on the MSL heatshield The locations of the pressure ports P and sensor plugs T are shown in Figure 2 The heatshield is colored by the predicted peak heating rate during entry No instrumentation was placed in the backshell due to schedule considerations the backshell is on the critical path for the overall aeroshell delivery The MEDLI subsystems are shown in the crosssectional view of the MSL entry vehicle in Figure 3 Timeline and operational concept The MEDLI instrumentation will be operational from approximately ten minutes before atmospheric entry to heatshield separation totaling approximately fourteen minutes in duration Acquired data will be recorded and stored on the MSL rover After landing the data will be transmitted back to Earth for analysis MEDLI instrumentation will generate approximately 0.9 MBytes of 3 


raw data With overhead and synchronization data the total un-margined data volume is expected to be 1.13 MBytes 2 MEASUREMENT OBJECTIVES The MEDLI science package consists of two subsystems The MISP subsystem gathers temperature and recession data to support aerothermal and TPS response model validation while the MEADS system gathers pressure data to support the validation of aerodynamic and atmospheric models Figure 3 MEDLI Instrumentation in MSL entry vehicle Aerothermal/TPS Objectives The design of a low mass and reliable TPS system for Martian atmospheric entry requires an accurate prediction of the encountered aerothermal environment and the subsequent TPS material response The peak heat flux along with surface pressure and shear stress determines the thermal protection material selected for the heatshield while the total integrated heat load and predicted recession determine the required TPS thickness The primary uncertainty in the ability to accurately predict Mars entry heating levels for MSL class vehicles is the onset of turbulent heating Although prior Mars missions were predicted to be dominated by laminar heating the larger lifting higher ballistic coefficient MSL entry vehicle is predicted to transition to turbulence well before the peak heating point on the entry trajectory Significant uncertainties exist in our ability to predict such a turbulent flow particularly in a reacting carbon dioxide atmosphere Baseline turbulent heating levels can be further augmented by roughness effects due to ablation of the TPS material Recent wind tunnel tests in support of MSL have also shown an apparent localized heating augmentation occasionally attributed to transition in the stagnation region of the vehicle A second significant source of aeroheating uncertainty is catalytic heating in a dissociated carbon dioxide atmosphere Catalysis in which the TPS surface facilitates the recombination of incident species can be a large contributor to the total heating rate No fully validated model currently exists to accurately predict the catalytic behavior of Mars capable TPS materials under flight conditions and thus conservative design assumptions are employed to model this effect These aeroheating uncertainties combined with other effects such as angle of attack and atmospheric dispersions result in a 3o uncertainty level of over 50\2600 for this mission.9 A more detailed discussion of the aerothermal modeling needs and current state of the art for future Mars entry missions is given in 10 In regards to TPS material response modeling the primary uncertainty is the recession rate of the TPS material particularly in a dissociated shear flow environment as is encountered on the leeside of the forebody heatshield This is true for either the primary or backup TPS material PICA recession is governed by oxidation of the carbon char which has significant uncertainty in a dissociated carbon dioxide atmosphere In contrast SLA-561V is a glassy ablator and therefore the surface recession is governed by a complex combination of vaporization and glass melt flow above hot wall heat fluxes of approximately 90 W/cm2 driven by shear gradients As of this writing neither material has been tested on the ground in a high enthalpy dissociated carbon dioxide environment and it is unclear whether there is any US facility capable of conducting such a test In contrast the in-depth thermal performance of either TPS material is believed to be comparatively well understood assuming that the surface recession is accurately predicted The primary need for in-depth thermal data is therefore to validate the current TPS performance models in an in-situ flight environment Atmospheric/Aerodynamic Objectives The MEADS subsystem will demonstrate the hypersonic through low supersonic performance of a blunt body Flush Atmospheric Data System FADS during a high-energy entry using in-situ pressure measurements and will allow a more accurate assessment of the aerodynamic and aerothermodynamic performance of the entry system The acquisition of a series of local discrete surface pressure measurements on the MSL entry aeroshell during the atmospheric entry and decent phase in conjunction with the MSL flight system inertial measurement unit IMU data will allow a more accurate post-flight reconstruction of the complete entry aeroshell states and atmospheric environmental data including low altitude wind information at supersonic conditions In particular the acquired pressure data will allow a more accurate estimation of the dynamic pressure qbar angle-of-attack c and angle-of sideslip 1 by allowing separation of the aerodynamic and atmospheric density uncertainties In addition the measured pressure data coupled with the IMU data will allow the determination of the atmospheric 4

 Pressure measurements will be made using pressure transducers mounted on the inside of the MSL heatshield and connected to the outside surface through tubing and a through-hole port in the TPS material MISP plug and the cavity in the TPS SLA shown with heatshield structure in which it is installed using a standard LMSSC TPS repair technique MEDLI utilizes one autonomous mode upon initiation of power the SSE will begin conditioning and digitizing the sensor signals From cruise stage separation until heatshield separation the DPAM will request the MEDLI sensor data from the SSE and the RCE in the rover will request and store the acquired data from the DPAM The DPAM will request the data from each address assigned to MEDLI at a 64 Hz rate The SSE multiplexes the MEDLI data into these addresses achieving effective sample rates of 8 Hz 2 Hz and lHz for its various sensors This data is held in a buffer in the DPAM and transferred across the EDL-1553 bus at the request of the RCE These are standard functions of the DPAM and RCE and require only changes to the look-up table that selects the channels to be sampled and their sample rate MSL Accommodations MSL provides the accommodations for the MEDLI instrumentation and avionics MSL provides the mechanical electrical and avionics interfaces as shown in Figure 4 The MEDLI mass allocation is 12.5 kg on the heatshield for the SSE MEADS and MISP and 2.5 kg on the backshell for power avionics cabling and the associated cable cutters The power allocation for MEDLI is 30W during EDL while no power is provided during the launch and cruise phases The avionics interface to the DPAM is an RS-422 bus The memory allocation in the RCE is 1.5 Mbytes for storage of the acquired data The cable harness from the SSE to the DPAM is routed through a cable cutter at the heatshield/backshell interface and then through a second cable cutter at the descent stage/backshell interface The components mounted on the inside of the heatshield the MEADS transducers and the SSE are fastened to standard inserts in the heatshield structure with thermal isolation standoffs A custom designed through-hole with a stainless steel sleeve provides a clear and secure path from the port in the TPS through the heatshield honeycomb structure to the pressure transducer mounted in the heatshield interior The sensor plugs will be integrated into the TPS by Lockheed Martin Space Systems Corporation LMSSC using a flight-qualified TPS repair procedure MISP MISP is an instrumented plug that is installed in the TPS Each plug is made from the heatshield TPS material and includes four embedded thermocouples at varying depths and one recession sensor The sensor wiring is routed through penetrations in the TPS behind each plug and through the heatshield structure Figure 5 illustrates the Backshel  Heatsh Figure 4 MSL Accommodations and Interfaces Each MISP plug is 33 mm 1.3 in diameter with a total depth of 20.3 mm 0.8 and contains four Type K thermocouples The thermocouples are installed in a Ushaped design at 2.54 5.08 10.16 15.24 mm 0.1 0.2 0.4 and 0.6 from the surface of the plug The plug itself is installed flush to the overall outer surface of the TPS The MISP plug does not extend all the way to the structural interface bondline Therefore since TC depths are defined from the outer surface the overall MISP design is insensitive to changes in the heatshield TPS thickness The top two thermocouples in each plug are used primarily to reconstruct the aerothermal environment during entry and descent while the two deeper thermocouples are used to validate the thermal response of the TPS material At some locations the near surface thermocouples may fail during descent due to over temping This is expected and occurs due to the desire to select a single set of TC depths that is globally optimized for all seven locations and a wide variety of possible entry trajectories The recession sensor named Hollow aErothermal Ablation and Temperature HEAT is shown schematically in Figure 6 The HEAT sensor measures the temporal progression of a 700 K isotherm through the TPS during entry and descent This sensor operates on similar principles to the Analog Resistance Ablation Detector ARAD flown on the Galileo probe,12 but the design has been significantly modified to allow for accommodation into a variety of TPS materials and to produce improved signal quality and reduction of signal dropouts A constant current excitation of 1 mA is provided by the SSE The sensor element becomes electrically conductive as the surface of the TPS and the HEAT sensor is charred As the char layer-virgin material interface advances the HEAT length and voltage output decreases The measurement range is 0 to 13 mm 0 to 0.52 from the TPS outer mold line with a measurement 6

to meet 23 grms launch loads and 28 grms entry loads as required by MSL Standoffs provide clearance for MSL's multi-layer insulating MLI blanket located on the interior of the heatshield The pressure path is simple and requires two flare fitting connections between the heatshield outer mold line OML and the pressure transducer The selection of stainless steel for the tubing mitigates the risk of bumthrough during entry The pigtail in the tube provides strain relief for mechanical and thermal distortions during launch cruise and entry Since power is not provided to MEDLI during the cruise phase the expected thermal environment at the pressure transducer location prohibited incorporating conditioning electronics in the gauge head Through a two wire interface the pressure reading is transmitted to the SSE where the signal is appropriately conditioned Key aspects of the transducer specification are shown in Table 3 Table 3 MEADS Pressure Transducer Specifications Key Parameter Specification Pressure range 0-35kPa 0-5 psia Accuracy 0.500 of reading Temperature range 225\260C to 125\260C Mass less than 368 grams digital converter Each sample is 16 bits wide with two bits reserved for data synchronization MEDLI will generate approximately 0.9 MBytes during operations The raw data rate from MEDLI to the DPAM is 4 kilobits per second The DPAM will add 1/64 second time tags 16 bits each to each data frame resulting in an additional 225 Kbytes for 30 minutes of operation The total MEDLI data volume is expected to be 1.13 MBytes Memory is allocated in the Rover Compute Element RCE when MEDLI instrumentation is activated approximately ten minutes before atmospheric interface and is held until the MEDLI data is transmitted to Earth 6.35mm 0.25 OD 0.89mm 0.035 wall Stainless Steel Tube with Strain Relief Loop A r  S Spool Insert Pressure Transducer Sensor Head Kl 3xG-10 standoffs V 3x Inserts   NAS-1 832 Spool Through a Request For Proposal RFP acquisition process a source selection board selected transducers from Stellar Technology Incorporated STI that utilize a strain gauge pressure measurement approach The temperature of each transducer head is also recorded through a TC mounted on each transducer housing SSE The SSE contains two electronic boards housed in a 76.2 x 247.7 x 336.6 mm 3.0 x 9.75 x 13.25 aluminum chassis The 158.75 x 304.8 mm 6.25 x 12.0 digital board contains the RS-422 interface and power interface to the DPAM An ACTEL field-programmable gate array will manage the analog-to-digital converter and provide the RS422 electrical interface The digital board also provides conditioning of the MSL provided 28V power and conversion to 15.OV 5.OV and 2.5V power and contains the pressure transducer signal conditioning electronics The analog board also 158.75 x 304.8 mm 6.25 x 12.0 in size contains the interface for up to 24 thermocouples from the sensor plugs up to seven thermocouples for the pressure transducers up to six HEAT sensor inputs and the pressure transducer signals conditioned on the digital board A multiplexer routes all inputs into a single 14 bit analog-toFigure 7 MEADS Overview Each of the TC inputs and HEAT inputs use transient voltage suppressors to ensure that sensor anomalies do not damage the processing electronics In addition to the sensor signals a series of housekeeping signals including cold junction compensation CJC signals reference voltages and chassis temperature are recorded As shown in Table 4 77 channels are recorded in total Table 5 shows the sample strategy for the MISP plugs The sample rates for each TC were determined based on expected responses from aerothermal and TPS thermal response modeling analysis In each plug TC1 is the TC nearest the OML 2.54 mm 0.1 depth and TC4 is nearest the bondline 15.24 mm 0.6 depth The interface to the DPAM limits the number of channels and sample rate The HEAT sensor from location T4 is at the stagnation point where little recession is expected Hence its signal will not be recorded this channel was employed for additional reference temperature and HEAT calibration measurements The deeper TCs at locations T5 and T7 will not be recorded because only 24 total TC channels are available and these four locations were prioritized lowest in terms of satisfaction of MISP science objectives 8

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
