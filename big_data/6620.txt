on could generate indicators of cyber threat activity as well a s providing in-depth understanding of the nature of its traf c Particularly we analyze darknet packets distribution it s used transport network and application layer protocols and pin point its resolved domain names Furthermore we identify its IP c lasses and destination ports as well as geo-locate its source count ries We further investigate darknet-triggered threats The aim is to explore darknet embedded threats and categorize their seve rities Finally we contribute by exploring the inter-correlation of such threats by applying association rule mining techniques t o build threat association rules Specically we generate cluste 
rs of threats that co-occur targeting a specic victim Such work proves that specic darknet threats are correlated Moreover it p rovides insights about threat patterns and allows the interpretati on of threat scenarios I I NTRODUCTION Today the safety and security of our society is entirely dependent on having a secure infrastructure This infrastructure is largely controlled and operated using cyberspa ce the electronic world created by interconnected networks of information technology and the information on those networ ks Recent events demonstrate that cyberspace could be subject ed at the speed of light and in full anonymity to severe attacks with drastic consequences One particular research reveal 
ed that 90 of United States companies have been the target of a cyber attack with 80 suffering a signicant nancial loss  1   I n a d d i t i o n  t h e C a n a d i a n  s c y b e r s e c u r i t y s t r a t e g y report  2  h i g h l i g h t e d t h e f a c t t h a t C a n a d i a n h o u s e h o l d s a n d businesses have completely embraced the cyberspace The report as well elaborated that in a recent one year period 86 of large Canadian organizations had suffered a cyber attack where the loss of intellectual property as a result of these attacks doubled between 2008 and 2010 Moreover the report alarmed that more than 60 of all the malicious code ever detected originating from more than 190 countries wa s introduced into cyberspace solely in 2010 In this context 
cyber threat intelligence generation is of vital importanc e A promising approach to gather cyber threat intelligence is t o collect and analyze darknet trafc The term darknet could be dened as one of the following  A set of unallocated network addresses and communication ports that belong either to the public cyberspace or to a specic organization Such unallocated space could be maliciously utilized to launch cyber attacks  Untraceable and inaccessible cyberspace material that is concealed from web services and search engines  Concealed communication platforms e.g P2P including social networks chat channels and le-sharing environments 
In this paper we refer to darknets as per the rst denition since these network addresses correspond to illegitimate h osts or devices any observed trafc destined to them may be suspicious and hence need to be investigated Therefore th ere is a requirement to answer the following set of high-level questions 1 What is the nature of darknet trafc and its underlying content 2 Who contributes to darknet trafc 3 Are there any embedded darknet threats 4 Can we show that such threats are correlated and hence provide their real world interpretation and impact In this work we answer such questions Specically we prole darknet trafc e.g protocols distributions typ e of 
trafc IP classes sources etc Such information gener ates indicators of cyber threat activity as well as it provides an in-depth understanding of the nature of such trafc We as well explore darknet-triggered infections/intrusions a nd geolocate their corresponding sources Moreover we generate  analyze and interpret threat association rules by applying association rule mining techniques Such work demonstrate s that certain darknet threats are correlated when targeting specic victims Moreover it provides insights about thre at patterns and allows the interpretation of threat scenarios  The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II 
discusses the related work Section III presents our proling results while Section IV demonstrates the results of darknet embedded threats Moreover Section V elaborates on the association rule mining approach for the purpose of generating and interpret ing clusters of threats that co-occur targeting a specic victi m network destination Finally Section VI summarizes our contributions and discusses future work 


II R ELATED W ORK Several studies explored darknet trafc analysis We can classify these proposals into two main categories The rst category is based on designing implementing and managing darknet platforms while the second focuses on the analysis of darknet trafc feeds In the following we describe some of the projects in the area of darknet monitoring systems In  3   t h e a u t h o r p r e s e n t e d Honeyd as a framework for the deployment of honeypots using virtual machines This project runs on unallocated address es within various operating systems Such environments provi de numerous services which aid in detecting and mitigating worms preventing spam distribution and alerting about sus picious attacks Another project is the network telescope whi ch was proposed in  4  t o m o n i t o r c y b e r i n c i d e n t s t h r o u g h t h e dark address space Moreover the Internet Motion Sensor IMS system a distributed system described in  5   r e p o r t s the network behavior originating from different monitored IP blocks Furthermore Yegneswaran et al  6  d e v e l o p e d Internet Sink iSink to monitor unused IP address space Th e iSink approach was conceived to address the scalability iss ue that is related to large address spaces It incorporates pas sive detection and monitor sensors as well as honeynet component s In the other category namely darknet analysis the researc h in  7  e l a b o r a t e d o n a d e t a i l e d a n a l y s i s o f t h e d a r k n e t d a t a  Their active and passive analyses assessed darknet samples from different networks and over a long time period Another study  8  h a s r e v i e w e d t h e l a s t m e n t i o n e d w o r k t o r e n d e r the state of this Internet background radiation at that curr ent year The authors observed signicant changes and pinpoint ed several factors that are behind these measures Moreover Fukuda et al  9  s t u d i e d c o r r e l a t i o n s a m o n g d a r k n e t t r a f  c for estimating their behaviors through small address block s by analyzing a specic type of trafc packets i.e TCP SYN There are other research proposals that investigated threats triggered through darknets such as in  10  w h e r e t h e authors were able to study the Slammer worm Moreover denial of service DoS attacks were as well addressed in  11  b y a n a l y z i n g t h e r e p l i e s o f D o S a t t a c k s f r o m s p o o f e d sources in darknet feeds Other studies such as  12  e l a b o r a t e d on scanning events misconguration and other suspicious activities The work presented in this paper which belongs to the second category contributes in the following three aspect s  Analysis accuracy The analyzed darknet data includes packet types that were omitted by other research works e.g ICMP in  13    A s s u c h  t h e d a t a s e t i s r i c h w h i c h contributes to a better accuracy of the analysis  Threat analysis By adopting an analysis methodology based on the use of network intrusion detection systems NIDSs our approach yields real world threats that are embedded in darknet trafc Such results will be presented in Section IV   Association rule mining approach By applying association rule mining and correlation techniques on the threat data we investigate clusters of threats that co-occur Suc h cyber threat intelligence proves that specic threats are correlated in addition to providing better understating by interpreting the attack scenarios targeting specic network destinations To the best of our knowledge such work has never been previously investigated III D ARKNET P ROFILING To achieve a better understanding of the nature of darknet trafc and its underlying content and threats we have performed darknet trafc proling To accomplish this task we analyzed some darknet data collected in the period between September 16th 2011 and May 9th 2012 The analyzed data feeds are retrieved in real-time from a trusted third party framework The data consists of pure darknet trafc collect ed from many 16 address blocks For more information regardin g the source of data please contact the authors We initiated our analysis by differentiating darknet packe ts according to their types following the method in  14    Scanning trafc TCP SYN packets  Backscattering trafc which commonly refers to unsolicited trafc that is the result of responses to attacks with spoofed source IP address TCP SYN+ACK RST RST+ACK and ACK packets  The remaining trafc packets are classied as misconguration Table I depicts the outcome distribution These results reveal Scanning Trafc Backscattering Misconguration 68.02 2.00 29.98 TABLE I Packets Distribution Nature of Trafc that scanning or network probing constitutes the majority o f darknet trafc Note that such trafc could be interpreted as an indication of port scanning and/or vulnerability probing Such attacks in general are preliminary triggered before laun ching a targeted attack towards a specic system We next aimed to identify the major protocols that are used in darknet trafc  Table II provides the percentages of darknet transport and network layer protocols It is observed that TCP plays the major role TCP UDP ICMP Others 91.9 5.5 2.9 0.3 TABLE II Protocols Distribution Figure 1 corroborates this fact by plotting the protocols distribution in a day sample which is the average of daily samples collected over a month's period TCP dominance can be explained by two facts First is that the majority of scanning attacks use TCP and second is that there exist known attacks that specically target TCP ports as noted in  7   T C P increase in Figure 1  especially after the 12 th hour indicates 


Fig 1 Darknet Network and Transport Layer Protocols that the darknet sensors record an increasing number of TCP packets after that period Such information pinpoints the need for a thorough temporal analysis and comparison of that phenomena which may uncover and explain the occurrence of certain attacks at speci c time periods and their absence during other periods at any given day Next we proled darknet application protocols Figure 2 illustrates the top 16 application protocols that have been found The results demonstrate that the Session Initia tion Protocol SIP is leading while the Domain Name Service is ranked second and NetBIOS is ranked third It is worthy to note that the SIP protocol is excessively used in DoS attack s specically against voice over IP VoIP servers  15   a n d thus its appearance as a top darknet application protocol is signicant and maybe alarming We further studied the sourc e Fig 2 Darknet Application Layer Protocols and destination distributions of IP classes in the darknet t rafc Table III depicts the results Usage  Class Source Destination A 62.529 0.017 B 18.529 7.138 C 18.942 92.845 TABLE III IP Class Distribution It is revealed that the majority of source IPs belong to class A whereas in the case of destination IPs class C plays the major role Furthermore Class A proportion in t he destination IPs is almost negligible i.e 0.017 whereas class B contributes relatively more It is substantial to menti on that class C being the most destined and smallest class could be an indication that it is as well the most targeted class by cyb er attacks and hence further investigation in it could yield re levant cyber intelligence Moreover we were interested in identi fying the resolved domain names in darknets After performing thi s task we identied that the top-most darknet resolved domai n belongs to a cc Internet country code top-level domain for Cocos Keeling Islands Note that this domain according to the anti-phishing working group constituted a signica nt 7.3 of all phishing attacks detected in 2010  16   S i m i l a r results could feed us in general with relevant informatio n about unsolicited/malicious domains that could be used by attackers Another analysis has been performed on the TCP and UDP ports that are used in the collected darknet trafc Specically we aimed to pinpoint the destination ports Su ch insights could reveal the targeted ports used in cyber attac ks Figures 3 and 4 illustrate such results Fig 3 Darknet TCP Targeted Ports Fig 4 Darknet UDP Targeted Ports The top three destination darknet TCP ports namely ports 445 80 and 3389 are the Microsoft active directory service  the hypertext transfer protocol and the Microsoft termina l server respectively These service ports have previously s uffered from security issues and vulnerabilities A sample of the threats targeting such services are pinpointed in  17    18  and  19  r e s p e c t i v e l y  H e n c e  i t i s a l a r m i n g t h a t s u c h p o r t s 


Fig 5 Darknet Sources Heat Map appear as the top darknet destination TCP ports On the other hand the top three destination darknet UDP ports namely ports 5060 397 1280 are the SIP the multi-protocol transp ort network mptn service and the pictography protocol respe ctively The SIP as mentioned in Section III  is a signicant target of attack This result further validates the integri ty of our insights Moreover the mptn and the pictography servic es are known to suffer from denial of service attacks when a malformed request is destined to them For the purpose of pinpointing the sources that contribute to the darknet traf c we perform darknet geo-localization Figure 5 depicts the heat map According to our analysis the source countries reache d 196 countries where the majority of source IPs are located in USA It is as well noticeable that Brazil China and Russia represent the major portion of source IPs compared to other countries Note that in Section IV  when we reveal the darknet threat analysis and geo-locate the sources behind those thr eats the three aforementioned countries as well appear amongst t he top contributed threat countries IV T HREAT A NALYSIS In this section we extend our proling task The aim is to uncover real world threats that are embedded in darknet traf c in addition to categorizing their severities and geo-locat ing their sources For that purpose we executed threat-based s everity analysis To accomplish this task Snort  20  a n d B r o  21   two open source NIDSs combining the benets of signature protocol and anomaly-based inspection were implemented and utilized Part of their content signature detection Sn ort and Bro implement the Boyer-Moore exact string matching detection algorithm in addition to a non-deterministic ni te automata regular expression detection algorithm To perfo rm the threat analysis we congured the NIDSs with rule sets from the Sourcere Vulnerability Research Team and The Bro Network Security Monitor Consequently we fed the darknet data to the NIDSs A partial outcome of this procedure is summarized in Table IV  The results reveal 30 distinct threats According to the NIDSs three threats are of high priority two are of medium severity and the rest are of low priority The rst high priority threat  t 1  is in fact an attempt to possibly overow a buffer Specically a series of NOOP no operation instructions were found in the data stream Typically most buffer overow exploits use NOOPs sleds to pad the code  22   H e n c e  t h i s t h r e a t m i g h t i n d i c a t e a n a t t e m p t to use a buffer overow exploit Thus a full compromise of a system is possible if the exploit is successful Another hi gh priority threat  t 2  is rendered as an attempt to cause a DoS Particularly a heap-based buffer overow in Microsoft MSN Messenger  23  w a s f o u n d t h a t a l l o w s u s e r a s s i s t e d r e m o t e attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecied vectors involving video conversation handling in Web Cam and video chat sessions As a result DoS and complete administrator access to a targeted system is possible The last high priori ty threat  t 3  is in reality a detected virtual private network VPN remote attempt on a set of darknet addresses Although in general VPN is not considered a threat however an attempt to gain VPN access on a specic system can be alarming On the other hand threats t 4 and t 5  and according the NIDSs are of medium severity Threat  t 4  represents an attempt to use a traceroute software where an attacker can discover live hos ts and routers on a target network in preparation for an attack Moreover  t 5  is a portmap GETPORT request to discover the port where the Remote Procedure Call RPC statd is listening  24   A n a t t a c k e r c a n q u e r y t h e p o r t m a p p e r t o discover the port where statd runs Consequently this may b e a precursor to accessing statd The remaining of the incident s are mainly scanning attempts and are considered of low severiti es Although their techniques may vary their end goal is to eith er perform port scanning or vulnerability probing in preparat ion to a possible targeted attack It is very signicant to note for the purpose of results integrity that such scanning attemp ts that constitute the majority of the threats are in accordan ce with our darknet proling results specically the packets distribution nature of trafc percentages 68.02 that w as demonstrated in Table I in Section III  For the purpose of accomplishing high level attribution we perform geo-loca tion of the threats sources Figure 6 depicts the heat map Note that the threat count metric is of the order of thousands Th e results reveal that Russia and China lead in terms of number of darknet threats Threat Type Priority t 1 Buffer Overow Exploit t 2 Denial of Service High t 3 VPN Attempt t 4 Traceroute Utilization t 5 Service Port Discovery Medium t 6  30 Scanning Attempts Low TABLE IV

Fig 6 Threats Sources Heat Map in thousands V T HREATS C ORRELATION There is a crucial need to further analyze the threats that have been previously detected and discussed This section explores the inter-correlation of such threats by applyin g association rule mining techniques to build threat associ ation rules Such work demonstrates that specic darknet threats are in fact correlated or co-occur when targeting specic victi ms Moreover it provides insights about threat patterns and al lows the interpretation of threat scenarios A Approach The goal is to investigate the interdependence and intercorrelation of darknet threats Particularly we aim to ans wer the following questions Are there any threats targeting a specic victim that follow a certain pattern Moreover if s ome of the co-occurring threats appear in a darknet trafc how condently one can predict the existence of other threats T o investigate this we employed the technique of frequent pat tern mining frequent item-set and association rule mining  25   Another outcome of this approach besides the ones mentioned above is the generation of threat association rules that co uld be used as an input to a classication model that is able to predict and hence mitigate future threat occurrences Freq uent pattern and association rule mining techniques have been proven to be very successful for identifying hidden pattern s in DNA sequences customer purchasing habits text categoriz ation and many other applications of pattern recognition T he proposed threat correlation approach is a three-step proce ss namely frequent pattern mining association rule generat ion from each frequent threat-set and rule analysis by applyin g various correlation techniques Each of these steps is deta iled below B Frequent Pattern Mining An item-set or a pattern is a group of two or more objects that appear together An item-set is a frequent pattern if its members appear together for some minimum number of times In the context of threat analysis an item or an object is a threat and an item-set is the threat-set Table V  which is used for illustration and explanation purposes depicts 10 thre atsets one threat-set per row Let T  f t 1      t m g denote the universe of all threats detected from the given darknet feed s F  Suppose a threat-set T i  T detected at a time interval  i represents a row or an instance in the threat Table V  Time Intervals Identied Threats  1 f t 2  t 5  t 7  t 9 g  2 f t 2  t 5  t 7 g  3 f t 2  t 5 g  4 f t 1  t 5  t 7 g  5 f t 4  t 5  t 7 g  6 f t 3  t 6  t 8 g  7 f t 4  t 5  t 8 g  8 f t 3  t 6  t 8 g  9 f t 2  t 5  t 8 g  10 f t 1  t 5  t 7  t 8  t 9 g TABLE V Vectors of Darknet Threats This table shows ten threat-sets captured at time intervals f  1       10 g  Let T i  T be a threat-set or a pattern in the threat table A pattern that contains k threats is a k  pattern  For instance  1  f t 2  t 5  t 7  t 9 g is a 4  pattern  Similarly the support of a pattern T i is the percentage of all the instances T in the threat table containing T i  denoted by support  T i j T   Note that the probability P  t a  t b   where t a  t b indicates that a pattern contains both t a and t b  is the union of itemsets t a and t b  The support is dened in equation 1  support  t a  t b   P  t a  t b  1 A pattern T i is a f requent pattern if the support of T i is greater than or equal to some user specied minimum support threshold which is a real number in an interval of 0  1  Further explanation of these terms is given in Example 5.1  Example 5.1 Consider Table V  Suppose the userspecied threshold min sup  0  3  which means that a pattern T i  f t 1      t k g is frequent if at least 3 out of the 10 rows contain all threat-items in T i  For instance f t 2  t 5  t 7  t 9 g is not a frequent pattern because it has support 1/10  0.1 Similarly f t 2  t 5 g is a frequent 2-pattern because it has support 4/10  0.4 and contains two threats Likewise f t 5  t 8 g is a frequent 2-pattern with support 3  10  0  3  There are various data mining algorithms for extracting fre quent patterns such as the Apriori  25   F P g r o w t h  26   a n d ECLAT  27   I n t h i s w o r k  w e e m p l o y t h e A p r i o r i a l g o r i t h m since it is easy to comprehend and it has been validated in sev eral text mining studies  28   B e l o w  w e p r o v i d e a n o v e r v i e w of the Apriori algorithm Apriori is a level-wise iterative search algorithm that uses frequent k patterns to explore the frequent 


 k  1 patterns First the set of frequent 1-patterns is found by scanning the threat table accumulating the support coun t of each threat-set and collecting the threat patterns cont aining T that also contains T i with support  T i j T   min sup  The resulting frequent 1-patterns are then used to nd frequent 2patterns which are then used to nd frequent 3-patterns an d so on until no more frequent k patterns can be found The generation of frequent  k 1 pattern from frequent k patterns is based on the following Apriori property Property 5.1 Apriori property All nonempty subsets of a frequent pattern must be frequent By denition a pattern T 0 i is not frequent if support  T 0 i j T   min sup  The above property implies that adding a threat t to a non-frequent pattern T 0 i will not make it frequent Thus if a k pattern T 0 i is not frequent then there is no need to generate  k  1 pattern T 0 i  T because T 0 i  T is also not frequent The following example shows how the Apriori algorithm exploits this property to efciently extract all frequent p atterns or threat-sets For a formal description we refer the reade r to  25   Example 5.2 Consider Table V with min sup  0  3  First identify all frequent 1-patterns by scanning the thr eat table once to obtain the support of every threat-set The ite ms having support  0  3 are frequent 1-patterns denoted by L 1  ff t 2 g  f t 5 g  f t 7 g  f t 8 gg  Then join L 1 with itself i.e L 1 on L 1  to generate the candidate set C 2  ff t 2  t 5 g  f t 2  t 7 g  f t 2  t 8 g  f t 5  t 7 g  f t 5  t 8 g  f t 7  t 8 gg and scan the threat table once to obtain the support of every pattern in C 2  Identify the frequent 2-patterns denoted by L 2  ff t 2  t 5 g  f t 5  t 7 g  f t 5  t 8 gg  Similarly perform L 2 on L 2 to generate C 3  f t 5  t 7  t 8 g  By scanning the threat table once we found that f t 5  t 7  t 8 g is not frequent i.e 3-pattern L 3 is empty The nding of each set of frequent k patterns requires one full scan of the rows in Table V  C Association Rule Mining The selected frequent patterns or frequent threat-sets are used to investigate the correlation and interdependence of the subsets of each frequent threat-set This can be achieved by applying association rule mining techniques  29   F o r t h i s  a l l 1-patterns are deleted as they contain only one threat and th us can not be associated with any other threat The 2-patterns threat-sets are used to extract single-dimensional associ ation rules while the 3-patterns and higher patterns are used to construct multi-dimensional association rules To constr uct an association rule of threats we need to calculate the conde nce for each frequent threat-set The condence is the percenta ge of threat-sets containing threat Y in addition to threat X with regard to the overall number of threat-sets containing X Assume we have a threat-set f t a  t b g for which the association rule would be f t a g  t b  Hence the association rule has a condence c in the threat table T  where P is the probability and c is the percentage of threat-sets in T containing t a that also contains t b  This statement is mathematically expressed in Equation 2  condence  t a  t b   P  t b j t a   support f t a  t b g support f t a g 2 Having support-count of  t a  t b  and t a  we can calculate condence  t a  t b  using Equation 2  Once the frequent threat-sets are extracted the related association rule of a frequent threat-set T i can be constructed as follows  Generate all non-empty subsets of T i  For every non-empty subset S  construct a rule  S   T i  S   provided that the support  T i  support  S   min conf D Correlation Analysis In order to investigate the interdependency of the threats various correlation techniques including  2  cosine measure and lift  29  c a n b e u s e d  I n t h e c u r r e n t s t u d y  w e u s e lift  which is easy to understand since it is based on probabilitie s and its results are interpretable by non-technical domain e xperts without the help of data mining experts The correlati on technique lift measures how many times more often threats t a and t b occur together than expected if they are statistically independent The lift indicates whether the identied thre at patterns are correlated together It is mathematically exp ressed as follows lift  t a  t b   P  t a  t b  P  t a  P  t b  3 If the value of Equation 3 is equal to 1 then threats t a and t b are independent and therefore have no correlation otherwi se they are either negatively correlated i.e lift  1  or positively correlated i.e lift  1  E Experimental Results We used Weka  30  t o r u n t h e A p r i o r i a l g o r i t h m  I n summary the Apriori takes the threat table in ARFF le type as input along with the user-dened parameters includi ng minimum support min sup and condence c  and generates association rules To assess our approach we experimented with different threats that were detected and mentioned in Table IV  The experimental results are achieved by employing sequential rule mining techniques for correlating same set of threats Consequently the generated rules can be used to build an associative classication model for predicting th e occurrences of specic threats in real-time darknet trafc  In general the threat rules generated by the Apriori provide d the threshold is kept low is usually very large However we can tune and lter the results to bring the rules to a manageable level by applying the following steps  Choosing a suitable value for the minimum support based on the occurrence count of the targeted threat Note that the choice of selecting a minimum support threshold is inversely proportional to the number of generated threatsets  Taking into consideration the size of the association rules by specifying the number of items per threat-set as input to the algorithm

do not contribute in information gain i.e a threat that is absen t during the analyzed period In the current work we selected a portion of darknet provide rs network blocks as the target of attacks Specically we restricted the target of the attacks to ve 24 network block s Table VI represents our frequent pattern and association rule mining results For condentiality and privacy matters we anonymized some sensitive information This table disclos es the analyzed IP blocks their corresponding identied thre at patterns or association rules coupled with their lift the ir condence and their number of occurrences per day The latte r metric is an indication that the identied threat pattern is valid since it frequently occurs per unit of time a day in our current analysis Up to this point we have demonstrated th at certain darknet threats are in fact correlated or co-occur w hen targeting specic network destinations For example cons ider association rule 1 in Table VI  This rule discloses that if we detect threats f t 7  t 8  t 9 g in some order in the live darknet data stream then with 63 condence we can as well expect to predict that threat t 10 will follow or occur Note that these threats are correlated since the value of the lift is  1 In the sequel we attempt to provide an interpretation to the ident ied threat patterns Please refer to the numbered association r ules in Table VI as a reference to the below interpretations It is worthy to note that such interpretations are solely derive d from the threat patterns and the NIDSs threat descriptions Hence we aimed to provide the most logical and best t scenario considering the threat association rules We beli eve that one interesting outcome of this work is the ability to provide insights about threat patterns and interpret real w orld threat scenarios Future work in this area could provide mor e elaborative interpretations The rst association rule discloses the following information A Unix host running FreeBSD attempts to ngerprint a target Voice over IP VoIP Session Initiation Protocol SI P server on port 5060 By ngerprinting the attacker hopes to retrieve the servers identication information such as ope rating system and installed services Finally he leverages his at tack by sending an enormous number of malformed ICMP packets directed towards the SIP server The latter can be interpret ed as a denial of service attempt The second association rule reveals the subsequent information An exploited Windows host rst attempts to ping a target to check if it is alive To retrieve more information he initiates various tracero ute commands Moreover he attempts to connect to a certain undisclosed port However he is faced with an unable to connect error message The latter effort can be explained by an attempt to gain system access The third association rule ca n be interpreted as the following A typical attacker rst perfo rms port and host scanning to identify security vulnerabilitie s and possible ways to get system access Sequentially he can tri gger various traceroute commands to retrieve more information o n how to reach his target Finally he will attempt to execute a high priority threat a buffer overow exploit to gain elev ated privilege on the victim's system The fourth association ru le presents a scanning attack targeting IP version 6 Specica lly it discloses that an attacker rst attempts to ngerprint a s erver running IPv6 After receiving a request timed out reply he launches a traceroute command to further explore his target s path Finally he extends his attack by sending a series of ICMP packets The latter can be interpreted as a denial of service attempt against the IPv6 server The fth associati on rule discloses the following information A Unix host runn ing FreeBSD as an operating system attempts to ngerprint a target server on TCP port 80 By ngerprinting the attacker hopes to retrieve the server's possibly the web server's i dentication information such as operating system and install ed services This can be a prelude to discovering vulnerabilit ies and sequentially instrumenting a targeted attack His scan ning request is made from a Flowpoint 2200 DSL router However the reply is a message indicating that such port is unreachab le In an attempt to gather more information about the target th e attacker consequently launches various traceroute comman ds The sixth association rule can be interpreted as the followi ng An attacker aims to target a Microsoft server running as a domain controller The server running Windows 2000 Server  has the Microsoft directory services installed and running  The attacker rst tries pinging the server to see if it is operati onal After receiving a positive conrmation he elevates his att ack by tracing the path to reach the server Finally he leverage s his attack by sending an enormous number of malformed ICMP packets directed towards the domain controller The sevent h association rule is a series of scanning attempts on UDP port 53 a port normally dedicated for the domain name service DNS A host running Windows 9x generated a signicant 


number of ICMP echo requests directed towards the server In an attempt to gather more information about the target the attacker consequently launches traceroute commands T he eighth association rule unveils the following information  An attacker launches various traceroute commands from a Unix host He leverages his scanning attempts by sequentially ta rgeting TCP port 3389 the Windows Remote Desktop Protocol RDP This event is alarming since it can be interpreted as an attempt to gain system access especially if the mentioned service is vulnerable or if its authentication is inadequat ely congured The ninth and tenth association rules are syntac tically different however contextually they can be interpr eted similarly They disclose that an exploited host is generati ng enormous malformed ICMP packets towards a certain target This is an indication of an attempt to launch a denial of servi ce attack against the target victims VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we investigated darknets by performing darknet characterization and trafc proling We interpreted t he output of this step by providing insights as indicators for c yber threat activity Particularly the results can be summariz ed in the following scanning trafc constitute the majority o f darknet trafc TCP leads the darknet protocol distributio n SIP contributes as the major darknet application layer prot ocol IP Class C is the most destined class of darknet trafc TCP port 445 pertaining to Microsoft active directory service  is the most targeted port We presented and discussed darknettriggered threats Distinctively we highlighted various threats as well as their severities and elaborated on their nature an d consequences This analysis step revealed three high sever ity threats namely denial of service attempts buffer overo w exploits and unsolicited VPN access Furthermore we explore d the inter-correlation of such threats by applying associa tion rule mining techniques to build threat association rules Such work demonstrated that in fact certain darknet threats are correlated when targeting specic network destinations M oreover it provided insights about threat patterns and allowe d the interpretation of threat scenarios Among the identied th reat clusters was one leading to a high priority buffer overow exploit For future work we intend to provide more cyber threat insights and build a classication model from the thr eat association rules to experiment its predictability featur es with near real time darknet trafc R EFERENCES 1 S t e p h e n

In the Mylyn dataset, the proposed method reduces the number of rules from1347 down to 13, while the delta of the prediction performance was only .015 \(from .757 down to .742\terms of the F1 value. And, in the Eclipse PDE dataset, the proposed method reduces the number of rules from 398 to 12, while the prediction performance even improved \(from .426 to .441 On the other hand, two naÔve rule reduction methods, which simply remove rules whose confidence values are smaller than the given threshold, could also reduce the number of rules, but in these cases the prediction performance became extremely low We compared our rule-based prediction with conventional model-based approaches such as logistic regression, random forest, CART and naÔve Bayes classifier. As a result, the proposed association rule mining approach was able to produce accuracy that is comparative to commonly used machine learners. This indicates the reduced rule set is worthwhile and important Through an analysis of a reduced rule set, it is confirmed that our proposed rule reduction technique provides a better understanding of the causes of faulty modules Part of this work was conducted under Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research \(C 24680003  Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T. and Swami, A.: Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc. of 1993 ACM SIGMOD Intêl Conf. on Management of Data,Washington, D.C., USA, pp.207-216 \(1993  D'Ambros, M., Lanza, M., Robbes, R.: Evaluating Defect Prediction Approaches: a Benchmark and an Extensive Comparison, Empirical Software Engineering, Published online, DOI 10.1007/s10664-011-9173-9, \(2011  Eclipse Mylyn Open Source Project http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn   Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment \(PDE http://www.eclipse.org/pde   Hamano, Y., Amasaki, S., Mizuno, O. and Kikuno, T Application of Association rule mining to Analysis of Risk Factors in Software Development Projects, JSSST Computer Software, Vol.24, No.2, pp.79-87\(2007  Kamei, Y., Monden, A., and Matsumoto, K.: Empirical Evaluation of SVM-based Software Reliability Model, In Proc. 5th ACM-IEEE Intêl Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering \(ISESE2006\p.39-41\(2006  Kamei, Y., Monden, A., Morisaki, S., and Matsumoto, K.: A Hybrid Faulty Module Prediction Using Association Rule Mining and Logistic Regression Analysis, In Proc. 2nd Intêl Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement \(ESEM2008\p.279-281\(2008  Kim, S., Whitehead, Jr., E.

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
