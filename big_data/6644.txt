Region-based Ranking in Association Analysis for News Relation Discovery 
W HILE a number of news portals on the web provide linkages between related news documents from multiple sources they face with a problem of excessive effort manual process To alleviate this problem most news portals try to organize their news content with appropriate functions Providing news relations has recently been focused among several news portals To nd relations among news document some works 2 3 have applied association rule mining to discover document relations due to its performance and scalability the complexity of 
 where is the length of the longest pattern However an inevitable issue is triggered by the large number of rules generated 5 In the past several works introduced various approaches to solve the problem of these tremendous association rules which may be classi“ed into ltering 6 constraint-based mining 8 9 and ranking 11 12 Up to present most previous works have applied single objective measure such as support or con“dence to lter constrain or rank the mined rules However they still focus on a uniform function for the whole ranking interval Intuitively only a single objective function may not be enough to prioritize the rules It is worth exploring multiple objective functions for rule prioritization Towards this this paper presents a method to selectively use different objective functions association measures for different regions to improve the ranking mechanism Socalled region-based ranking the proposed approach sets a speci“c weight for each different region range of the relation strength in order to maximize classi“cation performance In the rest Sect 2 introduces a framework of news relation discovery Section 3 describes a description of news relation types A formalism of association-based approach is presented in Sect 4 In Sect 5 non-directional association measures as well as a region-based ranking approach are depicted Details of an evaluation method are explained in Sect 6 Section 7 shows experiments and discussion Finally conclusions are made in Sect 8  Nichnan Kittiphattanabawon, Thanaruk Theeramunkong, Ekawit Nantajeewarawat School of ICT, Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology, Thammasat University, Thailand Email: knichcha@wu.ac.th, thanaruk@s iit.tu.ac.th, ekaw it@siit.tu.ac.th   Abstract Using an association-based technique to find associations among news documents can obtain useful news relations. However, existing works may not detect meaningful relations since only single association measure was used to mine news relations. This paper presents a region-based ranking approach to selectively use different association measures for different ranking regions, towards improvement of the ranking mechanism for news relation discovery. To evaluate region-based ranking, the method is compared to the conventional ranking method, which has no region construction. As performance evaluation, the topk results of each method are compared using rank-order mismatch \(ROM the non-region method, the region-based method can find meaningful relations among news with the average ROM improvement of 1.21 28.32% for confidence and 4.83% – 29.04% for conviction respectively  Index Terms region-based ranking, news relation discovery, association rule mining, rank-order mismatch

To discover meaningful news relations we introduce a framework based on association rule mining techniques as presented in Fig 1 There are three main steps i.e 1 preprocessing 2 mining process and 3 veri“cation process The remaining terms after preprocessing term segmentation and stopword elimination  are used as representatives to express the document In the second step the documents which are represented by a set of terms except stopwords are used for the association rule mining process  In this process it is possible to use one of alternative options which are varied by term representation term weighting and association measure As a result we obtain a set of association rules specifying the relation strength among documents such as in the gure and  In general among a large number of rules can be generated only some of them are potential ones To this end an additional process namely veri“cation process  can be applied to rank a set of rules based on a subjective or another objective criterion to lter or rank to obtain more proper association rules In this veri“cation step it is possible to use either a ranking method or a machine-learning technique  In this work we focus on a ranking technique As more automatic process machine learning technique can be applied This technique is left as our future work In our task three main relation types are classi“ed based on the relevance of news events 1 completely related CR 2 somehow related SH and 3 unrelated UR A CR relation stands for two news documents when they exactly describe an identical event usually reported at the same time period by two news reporters from different publishers with different headlines or phrases A SH relation may exist between two news documents with either one of three following conditions As the rst condition namely subnews two news documents describe the same event but one may have more details than the others The second condition called series represents the situation that two news documents form a series of events reported in different time sequences For the last condition named similar theme news documents hold similar topics or themes A UR relation indicates the situation that two news documents are absolutely unrelated in their contents or even their topics or themes Association rule mining is well-known data mining technique for knowledge discovery proposed by Agrawal Recently  association rule mining or its derivatives have been applied in nding relations among documents  3 14 In this work by encoding news documents as items and terms in the documents as transactions mined are a number of frequent patterns each of which represents a set of documents that share common terms more than a threshold called support Thereafter as a further step a set of frequent rules can be found based on these frequent patterns with another threshold namely con“dence As for encoding terms in the documents it is typically possible to de“ne terms in the form of single words compound words and named entities to use terms as representatives to process the document Unlike traditional association rule mining mining document relations requires handling non-binary data Towards this in 3 14

appears to be the most effective since it has the lowest ROM values of 0.41 Compared to the methods with con“dence or conviction the methods with lift are not good at the upper ranks  top but perform well in the lower ranks  top For instance the method with unigram term frequency with inverse document frequency and lift UG-TFIDF-LIFT performs the best on the top-1100 rankings by giving the lowest ROM values of 9.63 These results indicate that bigram with either con“dence or conviction is effective in the upper ranks while unigram with lift has a good performance in the lower rank and term frequency with inverse document frequency is the most effective term weighting for both cases These optimal combinations i.e 1 BGTFIDF-CONF 2 BG-TFIDF-CONV and 3 UG-TFIDF-LIFT are used in the subsequent experiments in order to show how the proposed region-based approach can help improve quality of news relation discovery This experiment investigates the performance of ranking on all relation types i.e CR vs SH vs UR with uniform weighting and no region construction This experiment helps clarifying the ranking performance when only one weighting is applied for ranking and then indicates the necessity of region construction The experimental results will be used as a baseline for the next experiment on the region-based approach The graph in Fig 3 shows the results with the legend of the weight   association measure and an average ROM calculated from the whole range respectively The average ROM is calculated by the integral of ROM over the whole range divided by the total number of ranks 1132 Based on the graph the following observations can be made Firstly the as well as   achieves the lowest ROM for the upper ranks  175 i.e 0.00  5.45 for con“dence and 0.00  5.49 for conviction while the   and   gains the lowest ROM for almost the lower ranks  175 i.e 3.71  9.92 for con“dence and 3.82  9.91 for conviction Secondly some other measures i.e     and lift are also a good weighting for the lower ranks  800 i.e 9.09  9.74 for con“dence 8.86  9.53 for conviction and 9.32  10.58 for lift Nevertheless for whole range lift obtains lower performance than and  Thirdly considering the whole range there is a lot of ranking errors a high ROM at the higher between 50 and 175 and lower ranks  500 but the number decreases at the middle ranks between 175 and 500 Fourthly although the   and   are the best weighting for the whole range with the lowest average ROM 6.65 for con“dence and 6.79 for conviction they seem not good for the higher ranks  175 while the as well as   is the worst weighting for the whole range with the highest average ROM 9.17 for con“dence and 9.10 for conviction they perform very well for the higher ranks  175 All observed characteristics give us a potential to separate ranks into several regions and then use different weightings for each region The last experiment investigates the ranking performance when different weights are assigned to different regions The performance of ranking is investigated for all relation types with varied weightings and region classi“cation According to the results of the previous experiment it is high potential that the

obtained compared to other setting i.e 6.59 for con“dence and 6.50 for conviction when the left boundary is 50 and the weight is 1 0.5 0 Then we vary the right boundary between 300 and 450 with a step of 50 when the left boundary is xed to 50 which is the best left boundary beforehand The results indicate that ranking performance is good when the right boundary is less than 400 That is the best performances the lowest average ROM are 6.57 for con“dence and 6.48 for conviction when the right boundary is 400 and the weight is 1 0.5 0 As conclusions the result of manual boundary setting implies that the left boundary should be set to 50 while the right boundary should be placed around 400 Furthermore the boundaries assigned by the manual setting are close to ones obtained from the automatic setting This result implies that our automatic boundary setting region-based weighting approach can provide suitable regions for setting different weights in ranking mechanism This paper proposed a region-based ranking method to improve discovering news relations The proposed method achieved the best performance by setting the weighting of the rst the second and the third region to 1 0.5 and 0 respectively with the average ROM of 6.57 and 6.46 for con“dence and conviction consecutively By comparing to the non-region method when the weights are set to 0 0.5 and 1 the experimental results showed that for the whole range the proposed method improves the performance with the average ROM improvement of 11.87 1.21 and 28.32 for con“dence and 11.91 4.83 and 29.04 for conviction respectively As future works to provide more practical similarity the possibility of applying latent semantic indexing or some disambiguation methods will be examined It is possible to apply a machine-learning approach to nd the optimal parameter setting in ranking mechanism This work was granted by Strategic Scholarships Fellowships Frontier Research Networks 2006 from the Commission on Higher Education and NECTEC under project number NTB-22-KE-38-54-01

improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to ef“ciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
