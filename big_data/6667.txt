    2  1  I NTRODUCTION  Missions to the outer planets in the solar system have historically provided the planetary science community with huge scientific returns at the cost of very long timescales and high price tags However it has recently been shown through missions such as New Horizons Juno and Dawn that significant science can be achieved under constrained budgets. This therefore demonstrates that planetary science missions are viable in the current economic climate Following this paradigm, one of the 2013 Planetary Science Summer School sessions was challenged to design a mission including a contributed atmospheric probe to the Neptunian system with high science return, at a cost lower than FY2015 $1.5B. Other than the cost cap, the team was instructed to follow the guidelines for a New Frontiers mission, with some minor modifications [2   W e p r esen t  t h e results from this study focusing on the engineering design of the mission, which is entitled TRIDENT \(Taking Remote and In-situ Data to Explore Neptune and Triton The Neptunian system was chosen for this study because it is a highly compelling target for both planetary and exoplanetary science Neptune is one of the ice giants the least explored class of planets in our solar system It has only been visited once, by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in 1989 There are many theories about the Neptunian system but very little observational data is available to constrain or disprove these theories Neptune was initially thought to have evolved in a similar manner to Saturn but planetary  shifted significantly since its early formation 3 6   the physical processes the planet was subjected to and created a system significantly different from any other planet in our solar system Additionally the Neptunian system possesses a number of moons one of which is believed to be a captured Kuiper Belt Object \(KBO\: Triton 7 10   T h er e is  ev id en ce  th at T r ito n  m a y  p o s s e s s  a subsurface ocean 11    1 2    m ak in g  it a p o ten tial  astrobiology target 13   Du e  to  th e lac k  o f  o b s er v at io n al  data the 2013-2022 Planetary Science Decadal survey identified a range of science objectives for the Neptunian system 1   T h ese a m b itio u s  s cie n ti f ic g o als in  tu r n  p o s e significant engineering and mission design challenges  n means that travel times from Earth exceed a decade and the arrival V inf  can be greater than 10 km/s In turn this leads to a desire for the spacecraft to have high redundancy and design margins while still enabling significant science return at a low cost Both orbiter and flyby concepts were evaluated in this study. Our initial evaluation of an orbiter mission, using an Atlas V 551 launch vehicle as our baseline showed that it would have exceeded the mass budget supported by this launch vehicle Thus a flyby architecture was ultimately selected due to technology restrictions and launch mass constraints We show that our proposed flyby mission achieves a number of the Decadal Survey goals for the exploration of Neptune and offers significant advancements over the science performed by Voyager 2 at a cost of FY2015 1.37B We first present a high level overview of  describe the chosen instrument suite. This is followed by the trajectory design and the science observation plans at Neptune and Triton as well as details of the system subsystem design and the cost breakdown Finally we discuss risk mitigation approaches, and we present potential de scope options that bring the design closer to the New Frontiers class of mission expected to be approximately FY2015 $1B 2  S CIENCE O VERVIEW  Neptune represents the least explored class of planets in our solar system, and can lend crucial insight into the formation and evolution of our solar system Giant planets beyond Mars are divided into two categories: 1\ gas giants \(Jupiter and Saturn and 2 ice giants Uranus and Neptune I ce  where early solar irradiance was low enough to allow for the existence of water methane and ammonia ices 14   T h e  a critical science question as some simulations show planetary migration in the early solar system 15 17  The Nice model [3 6  u s es ea r l y  s o lar  s y s te m  o r b ita l r eso n an ce s  an d  dynamics to explain present-day planet ephemerides This model predicts that in the early solar system the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn entered a 2:1 resonance, flinging Neptune outward from its formation location of approximately 20 AU to its present-day position of 30 AU The composition and interior structure of a planet should match the conditions of the solar nebula from which that planet formed 18    1 9    T h er ef o r e  if  Nep tu n e d id  u n d er g o  a 1 0  A U outward migration its interior structure and composition values will reflect those of its formation location, rather than its current location Measurements of the interior structure and noble gas abundance values of Neptune are crucial for validating and constraining current solar system formation  strategic pl   20  In addition to  beginnings exploration of the Neptunian system supports the recent international focus on exoplanets There are approximately 900 confirmed exoplanets, and an additional 2500 exoplanet candidates found by Kepler [21   Fro m  t h ese  observations the most common type of exoplanet and exoplanet candidate are Neptune-sized bodies 21    2 2   The ubiquity of these Neptune-sized planets has generated much intrigue within the scientific community and is an important driver for improving our understanding of the dynamical evolution of many-bodied planetary systems. The proposed TRIDENT mission would address this lack of ice giant observational data The Voyager 2 spacecraft in the late 1980s is the only mission to have visit ed  the ice giants All additional knowledge of these bodies comes from Earth-distanced observations These observations of the Neptune system 


    3  have resulted in several surprising discoveries which obfuscate our understanding of the formation and evolution of the solar system We group these discoveries into the following four categories 1 atmospheric dynamics and composition, 2 magnetospheric structure and processes, 3 interior structure and 4 geology First Neptune hosts the largest measured winds in the solar system [23   Vo y ag er  2  discovered an Earth-sized storm system designated the Great Dark Spot [24  which has since disappeared [25   T h e  Great Dark Spot and similar unexplained storm patterns have piqued scientific interest in the highly variable global   Secondly scientists were surprised  severely tilted and offset from the center of the planet. This offset tilted dipole is unique to the ice giants and has implications for the internal structure and dynamo generating the magnetic field 26  With regards to the interior structure Neptune emits approximately twice as much heat as it receives from the Sun indicating that a currently unknown internal heat source may be responsible for this excess energy flux [27  Our current interior models partially account for this excess but because observations are limited to the lone Voyager 2 flyby, the models are only loosely constrained by the data 28   Fin all y   d u r in g  th e  flyby of Triton, Voyager 2 imaged a body with few craters suggesting a relatively young age 29  an d  g e y s er li k e plumes emanating from the surface 24    3 0     3 1    T h e  active geology and young surface could indicate a subsurface ocean 11    1 2     3 2   m a k i n g  t h e Nep t u n ia n  system an important astrobiological target as well [13  We designed the core TRIDENT scientific investigation to address   The TRIDENT concept science objectives are  Understand the composition, structure, and    Understand the composition, structure, and dyn    Understand the interior structure of Neptune   atmospher ic interaction The following sections describe the main science questions and the TRIDENT instrument suite proposed to address th es e questions   Atmospheric observations of Neptune present the opportunity to answer scientific questions that are of high interest across diverse scientific fields Such observations include 1 compositional measurements that will help constrain planetary formation processes 2 dynamical observations that will improve general circulation models of the giant planets and will be useful for comparative studies and 3 crucial atmospheric monitoring to investigate the long-ter  and temperature to provide an analog for exoplanetary research Measurements of the abundances of noble gases helium He neon Ne argon Ar krypton Kr and xenon Xe and of the isotopic ratios of hydrogen H carbon C nitrogen N oxygen O and sulfur S yield information about composition during planetary formation Comparison of these measurements with current estimates of primordial solar values helps constrain and validate planetary formation models 33 35  which is a key objective of the 2006 NASA Solar System Exploration Roadmap [36   stark contrast to the relatively quiescent atmosphere of Uranus [37  Neptune hosts wind speeds of nearly 600 m/s the fastest in the solar system 2 3 Observations of Neptune indicate immense storm systems including the Voyager 2 discovery of the Great Dark Spot [24  25  Understanding these dynamical processes will help improve general circulation models of giant planet atmospheres for use in comparative climate studies 38 40  Furthermore this mission concept would help contribute to the long-term monitoring of Neptune by complementing the Voyager 2 data and allowing the dynamical and spectroscopic properties of exoplanets to be inferred We designed the TRIDENT concept payload to investigate  atmosphere The payload would include a governmentfurnished Neptune atmospheric probe which would obtain the first-ever in-situ measurements of an ice gian t atmosphere. The probe would include a mass spectrometer an atmospheric structure instrument, an ultrastable oscillator USO and a nephelometer The probe would measure atmospheric composition and vertical structure including noble gas abundances isotope ratios and global and zonal wind speeds down to 10 bar. These in-situ measurements of  temperature-pressure profile [41  cu r r en t m o d el s  r eq u ir e a n  inferred compositional profile from indirect means The main payload instrument suite would include a narrow angle camera \(NAC\ capable of imaging with 5 filters.

    4  8 hours. Voyager 2 provided only a basic understanding of this field Between 4-15 Neptune radii R N  magnetic field can be represented by an offset tilted dipole OTD\, with a tilt of 47\272 with respect to the rotation axis and a spatial offset of 0.55 R N from the geographic center of the planet 26   Ho w ev er   Vo y a g er  2  d ata s h o w  t h at th e O T D model breaks down outside this range.

The complex magnetic field creates a highly irregular magnetosphere surrounding the planet [43   E f f o r ts  to model such a magnetosphere with limited observational data have resulted in uncertainty and disagreement between  field along the flyby trajectory will enhance current magnetic field models allowing for modeling beyond the current limited range  important implications for exoplanet systems which have shown that comparative studies using planets in our solar system can provide applicable information to the broad spectrum of planetary types [44   B ased  o n  t h e s tr u ctu r al a n d  d y n a m ica l diversity of magnetospheres in our own solar system it is reasonable to assume that this diversity exists in  provides a laboratory for investigation of magnetospheric configurations that differ from what we observe at Earth and a broadened understanding of magnetospheric physics better prepares us for the study of exoplanet systems [43   TRIDENT would explore the structure composition and energy transport within this dynamic magnetosphere providing us with new insights into solar windmagnetospheric coupling in the presence of a diurnallyvarying magnetosphere The proposed payload would contain a magnetometer to map the magnetic field along the flyby trajectory, and a plasma spectrometer to measure low and high energy electron and ion fluxes, including resolving the presumed primary magnetospheric constituents  hydrogen ions  H  and nitrogen ions  N  45   T h e Voyager 2 flyby occurred shortly before the northern winter solstice 53 years later the TRIDENT flyby would occur shortly after the spring equinox, thus yielding measurements of magnetosphere variation that span over seasonal timescales TRID  measurements with a different magnetospheric configuration from the measurements of Voyager 2 In probing the magnetosphere at different configurations on both hourly and seasonal tim  measurements would be complementary to those made by Voyager 2 and its instrumentation suite and trajectory would be optimized to maximize science return in the regions of high scientific interest   Investigations of ice giant interiors lead to the validation of planetary formation and evolution models Knowledge of the structure and energetics of Neptune's interior is crucial in addressing this high scientific priority investigation Despite similar bulk characteristics size mass density between Neptune and Uranus, their energy balance, or ratio between emitted thermal and absorbed solar energies are conspicuously distinct The energy balance of Uranus is approximately unity whereas Neptune emits roughly twice the thermal energy that it receives from the Sun 27   T h e  currently accepted model for this difference in energy balance is based on the difference in stratification of the interiors of the planets 28    4 6    C u r r en t m o d els s h o w  a  disparity between the internal stratifications of Neptune and Uranus and it is known that a larger portion of the Uranus interior is stratified 47   Ho w e v er   k n o w led g e o f  t h e Neptune interior is limited to the J2 and J4 gravitational harmonics obtained by Voyager 2 [48   T h ese h ar m o n ics ar e  insufficient to determine whether Neptune has a rocky core or the location of the presumed compositional shift that is critical for determining convection and internal temperature characteristics [28    4 7    Successfully probing the interior of an ice giant will help augment our knowledge of planetary formation and evolution However improving on previous measurements with an ultrastable oscillator USO and a flyby trajectory imposes highly constraining pointing and attitude knowledge requirements Instead TRIDENT would ca rry two complementary instruments that further facilitate the probing of planetary interiors the atmospheric probe and the Doppler imager. The in-situ measurements made by the atmospheric probe would include non-condensable gas isotope ratios of hydrogen H  carbon C nitrogen N oxygen O and sulfur S as described in Table 1  which would provide insights about the formation and physical evolution of the planet The Doppler imager would utilize an innovative technique to obtain global harmonics and oscillation measurements to orders beyond what would be otherwise possible for a flyby mission 49 51   T h e instrument would image the planetary disk with spectral filters and measure the global Doppler velocity field by observing the spectral line distortion If  the rotation of the planet and relevant radial velocities are accounted for the radial velocity of different parts of the atmosphere due to natural mode oscillations could be obtained. The weighting frequencies of these natural modes would provide critical information about the interior of the planet. The information obtained by the Doppler imager would allow for a rigorous interpretation of the atmospheric probe data knowing the interior structure and the possible existence of any potential reservoirs could affect the interpretation of the measured isotopic ratio for condensable molecules determined by the shallow atmospheric probe These synergistic instruments therefore would enable the TRIDENT flyby to yield  erties that if successful would increase  interior compared to Voyager 2 or gravity measurements

Both of  composition and we designed the trajectory to facilitate this investigation The trajectory would bring the spacecraft within 1000 km of Triton allowing for magnetometer measurements to determine if Triton has an intrinsic magnetic field This closest approach would be approximately 40 times closer than that of Voyager 2 37  and the trajectory geometry would allow for USO Doppler tracking providing the first gravitational harmonics measurements of Triton. A narrow angle camera would map  and young geologic features indicative of a subsurface ocean or ongoing geologic activity UV and NIR spectrometers would be used to obtain the vertical profile and composition of the plumes. Because there are vast regions of surface that have never been imaged TRIDENT would also obtain full  Neptunian side A carefully crafted trajectory and synergistic suite of instruments would allow us to characterize the geologic surface features plumes and possible subsurface ocean on one of the most unique and unexplored satellites in our solar system Science Traceability Matrix and Instruments Table 1  presents an abridged version of the Science Traceability Matrix STM developed for this study and Table 2 provides a succinct overview of the properties of the instrument suite that would achieve the science goals  


    7  3  M ISSION D ESIGN  In this section we discuss the overall mission design and trade studies explored for the TRIDENT mission. First we give an overview of the various trade studies explored. This is followed by details of the flyby trajectory where we  section with details of the observation plans both at Neptune and Triton Trades Explored The architectures that we initially selected for this study included a flyby mission Neptune-only orbiter and a Neptune-Triton orbiter Each architecture used launch vehicles consistent with current NASA launch standards 55  an d  a v ar iety  o f  in s p ac e p r o p u ls io n  tech n iq u e s  s u c h  as  gravity assists chemical propulsion and solar electric propulsion SEP Due to their high power density Advanced Stirling Radioisotope Generators ASRGs were chosen as the power source for all the architectures analyzed in order to maximize the amount of mass available for instrumentation. ASRG lifetime is currently only rated at 17 years 3 years in storage and 14 years in flight 56   th u s  directly limiting the time of flight TOF of any mission design to the Neptunian system Consequently we only considered trajectories with a TOF of less than 15 years to minimize the risk involved with ASRG failure Table 3. Mission Architecture Trades Launch Options  Interplanetary Trajectory  Neptune Trajectory  EELV  Atlas V 551  Chemical Propulsion  Neptune Flyby  Triton/Neptune Flyby  Solar Electric Propulsion  Chemical NOI/Triton Tour   Table 3 illustrates the mission architecture trades that were explored for this study We only examined those launch vehicles deemed acceptable by the NASA Launch Services Program and the Delta IV Heavy was assumed to be unavailable for this study We therefore chose the Atlas V 551 as the desired launch vehicle for all architecture configurations due to its ability to launch the maximum payload mass to orbit. For the interplanetary portion of the trajectory we considered both chemical propulsion and  average distance from the Sun For the Neptune portion of the trajectory we only analyzed flybys or chemical orbit insertion burns Previous studies have shown that aerocapture delivers the most mass to the Neptunian system for orbiters 57   Ho w e v er   w e d ec id ed  n o t to  ex am in e t h e  use of aerocapture in this study since the risk was considered to be too high for a New Frontiers mission [2   We examined these architectures based on their cost risk science benefit, and mission constraint violations A recent study of ballistic trajectories to Neptune for launch dates ranging from 2020 to 2070 demonstrated several feasible trajectory options [58   Ho w e v er   d u e to  t h e T OF co n s tr ai n t imposed by the use of ASRGs the maximum launch mass deliverable by an Atlas V 551, and the necessary amount of  orbiter architectures only a small portion of interplanetary trajectories were found to be feasible for this study We excluded trajectories with flybys of Venus to avoi d  system. The main celestial bodies used in the initial design of gravity assists trajectories were Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn Jupiter flybys to Neptune are effective approximately every 12 years with the next opportunities occurring between 2016-2018 and 2028-2030. It is possible to use Saturn from 2022 to 2030 but this requires significantly higher launch energies thus reducing the delivered mass to orbit from the launch vehicle 58   I n  general, we found that an EEJN gravity assist \(i.e. additional flybys at Earth and Jupiter\ sequence was the most desirable for a 15-year mission to Neptune with either chemical propulsion or SEP during the interplanetary stage We first analyzed a 13.5-year and a 14.5-year EEJN chemical interplanetary trajectory for a Neptune-Triton orbiter architecture The 13.5-year 14.5-year trajectory launch C3 was 33 km 2 sec 2  31 km 2 sec 2  with a V inf  at Neptune of 12.7 km/sec 10.5 km/sec We found both of these trajectories to be infeasible due to the large chemical NOI burn The initial Neptune orbit that was targeted for NOI was a 1.1x70 R N  resulting in a chemical burn of approximately 2.5 km/sec With the Atlas V 551 launch vehicle the spacecraft design could not converge If the launch vehicle could be configured to launch approximately three hundred kilograms more than its current ratings, then a 14.5-year interplanetary trajectory with a 1-year orbiter science mission would become feasible However this mission would surpass the 14-year flight lifetime of the ASRGs, thus increasing the failure risk significantly The next trade we examined was a SEP stage for the interplanetary cruise with a chemical NOI The trajectory we used had a 14-year TOF with a launch C3 of 18 km 2 sec 2  and a V inf  at Neptune of 10.2 km/sec The SEP stage allowed for a launch mass increase of approximately 1100 kg from the chemical trajectories. While most of this mass is used for the SEP stage, the trade of using a SEP stage is to reduce the chemical propellant mass required Despite reducing the chemical propellant mass requirements we also deemed the SEP stage mission design to be infeasible as the spacecraft configuration design could not converge due to insufficient launch mass Ultimately we selected a flyby trajectory of Neptune and Triton. We used the 13.5-year chemical trajectory designed for the Neptune-Triton orbiter as the interplanetary trajectory for the flyby mission. We describe this trajectory design in more detail in the following section

The TRIDENT vehicle  concurrent engineering facility, Team X, and was driven by both science and trajectory requirements We assumed current technology levels for all subsystem components despite the 2029 launch date, since the goal of the Planetary Science Summer School was to understand what type of  technology During the Team X sessions we identified several key system trades that ultimately drove the spacecraft design The navigation trades were presented in Section 3 and trades regarding risk, reliability, and cost will be discussed in Section 5 The spacecraft design specific tr ades were related to 1 power 2 attitude control 3 telecommunication, and 4\ configuration, and are presented in Table 6  Table 6. Key Technical Trades Subsystem  Trade  Decision  Impact  Power  ASRG vs RTG vs Solar  ASRG  Dual fault tolerant power system, lifetime issues  A C S  Reaction wheels vs Propellant  Reaction wheels  No scan platform, high pointing capability  Antenna  Gimballed vs. Fixed  Gimball ed  Flexibility in operations  Config   Scan vs Fixed Pla tform  Fixed  Simpler design more stringent pointing requirements   We recognized from these trades that lifetime was ultimately the limiting factor since it significantly affects the power attitude control and propulsion subsystem requirements. In this section, we begin with an overview of the TRIDENT spacecraft and the key components. We then provide a breakdown of each subsystem and the key design considerations for each of them Finally we also offer a breakdown of the mass and power requirements for the system

As explained in Section 3, we chose the Atlas  lifting 3270 kg to orbit with a C3 of 31.0 km 2 s 2 Our design ensured accommodation of the volume and mass requirements of the Atlas V 551 Figure 5 b shows the spacecraft prior to deployment inside the Atlas V 551 fairing The TRIDENT design leverages heritage systems whenever possible and includes significant redundancies

Five ASRGs provide single fault tolerance for baseline science and dual-fault tolerance for threshold science Each ASRG has a mass of 34.5 kg including shielding\ and power output of 122 W at endof mission assuming an 0 8 per year degradation over 17 years  [62   Gen er al P u r p o s e Hea t So u r ce s   GP HSs   p r o v id e heat energy over the life of the ASRGs 56    6 2   The ASRGs are connected to two lithium ion batteries each providing a total of 24 Ah assuming a depth of discharge DOD of 65 and a 5 yearly degradation in battery performance   Table 7 illustrates the mission power modes. It demonstrates the spacecraft provides sufficient power including contingency throughout the entirety of the mission In the case of a single ASRG failure the system will rely on supplementary battery power during the radio occultation mode to meet spacecraft requirements The battery capacity is sufficient for the short duration of discharge \(4 hours Communications  We designed the communications system to be a dual-frequency system, with full redundancy and flight-proven hardware The four primary performance requirements were 1 two-way link with Earth through all mission phases 2 6 kbps data rate at 30 AU on Ka-band between the spacecraft and a 34 m beam waveguide \(BWG ground station, 3\ X-band occultation capability at Neptune and 4\ flyby spacecraft reception of probe data at 2 kbps on S-band from a range of 15,000 km Additionally we required that the command Bit Error Rate BER be 1e5 and that the telemetry frame error rate FER be 1e-4 Finally we set minimum link margins of 3 dB for all data terminal equipment \(DTE\ and 6 dB for all relays Table 9  details the flight hardware for the communications system The total system mass is 70.6 kg.

A 70 m antenna will be used for Neptune encounter and flyby tracking.

    13  software architecture where each component is an individual system and these smaller systems work together as a unified C&DH subsystem Thus each element determines its own data requirements such as compression ratio, and the C&DH and software systems handle the overall data accumulation and handling Subsystem responsibilities include 1 telemetry collection analysis 2 command processing 3 data management and 4 subsystem and instrument data collection and processing. We chose a dualstring RAD750 64  f o r  th e ce n tr al p r o ce s s in g  u n it  C P U   The C&DH subsystem is capable of 32 Gbits of RAM, and 1.6 Tbits of non-volatile RAM. This is more than sufficient storage for the 21 Gbits generated by the science instruments  Configuration  Figure 5 shows a CAD rendering of the \(a fully deployed and b Atlas V 551 fairing-configured TRIDENT spacecraft The principal components and their locations within the vehicle are also detailed The primary design considerations were instrument location fairing diameter, and propellant tank size. TRIDENT possesses two different deployment mechanisms one for the magnetometer boom and one for the probe No scan platform was included in the configuration design Therefore the imaging instruments require attitude control maneuvers during operations In order to limit the severity and frequency of these maneuvers we imposed a common look-direction requirement for the NIR spectrometer UV spectrometer and NAC which is the Y face of the spacecraft Doppler imager operation occurs 1 month prior to the encounter phase and its location was thus less strictly constrained The plasma spectrometers are located in the 255 45 260  X direction The magnetometer and its 10 m boom which do not have requirements on their position, extend in the +Y face, primarily to prevent obstruction or interference with the HGA or instrument suite Attitude Control System ACS  The ACS is three-axis controlled and we provide its specifications in Table 11 The  high pointing demands of flyby science especially due to conflicting requirements between the Doppler imager and NAC The Doppler imager science requires a very stable platform while rapid slew rates are necessary for the NAC science. The success of the encounter is therefore dependent on the performance of the ACS We designed the ACS to with full redundancy and fine control capabilities in order to meet the science requirements. The primary limitation of the ACS is the slew rate of the spacecraft Using reaction wheels a slew rate of 2.4 mrad/s is possible This rate enables the NAC to be continually positioned at the target until just before closest approach and again during the departure. During the approximately three minutes of closest approach the slew rates will be insufficient for the NAC to capture high quality images of the targets However the science goals do not depend on imaging with the NAC during those periods. Lastly, we note that even in the absence of reaction wheel control thruster pointing is sufficient to achieve full threshold science The thrusters alone would enable a similar slew rate to the reaction wheels during closest approach however the pointing stability during the acquisition of the Doppler imager science without reaction wheels will be limited to less than ideal conditions Therefore to obtain reliable Doppler science and achieve all the baseline science objectives, the reaction wheels are necessary Table 11 ACS Capabilities  Capability  Specification  Po inting Control  0.2 rad  Pointing Knowledge  0.1 rad  Axis Stability  5 rad/s   Thermal System  The thermal environment for the TRIDENT spacecraft is similar to several other spacecraft designed for deep space activity. During cruise, TRIDENT will experience low ambient temperatures throughout the trajectory Consequently we utilize a 10 W pumped fluid loop system to redistribute waste heat from the GPHSs in the ASRG systems and from other heat dissipating components to maintain operating temperatures of the entire spacecraft Additionally twelve Lightweight Radioisotope Heater Units LWRHUs are used to maintain operating temperatures of the spacecraft thrusters providing approximately 11W of power Finally the spacecraft also possess ten layers of Multi-Layer Insulation MLI to prevent heat dissipation In the hot case when the spacecraft is in the inner solar system waste heat is rejected by means of an external 0.75 m 2  passive radiator which is shown in Figure 5  MLI also prevents excessiv e heating from the Sun In the case of an ASRG failure the temperature of the GPHS used to provide heat to these nuclear power components would increase 56   Ho w ev er   th e  p u m p e d  fluid loop system was designed to effectively redistribute this excess heat for up to two ASRG failures. The fluid loop system was also designed with a redundant loop in case of failure. Excess heat from the GPHSs can also be dissipated from the spacecraft by the radiator via the fluid loop system Propulsion System  We designed a dual-mode hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide NTO propulsion system to meet  dual-mode high performance apogee thruster DM HiPAT 65  ca p ab le  o f  a 4 4 5  N o f  th r u s t w it h  a s p ec if ic i m p u ls e o f  329 s The main engine is augmented by twelve Aerojet hydrazine monopropellant engines MR-103G 66   w h ic h  are each capable of 0.9 N thrust The monopropellant engines are responsible for attitude control maneuvering  approximately 1620 m/s. The total propellant and pressurant needed to meet these requirements have a mass of 1184 kg and included 226 kg contingency for mass growth and reaction wheel de-scope 


    14  5  C OST AND M ANAGEMENT  An overview of the cost and risk management approach for the spacecraft lifecycle is presented in this section. We first provide a breakdown of the expected costs at each phase of the development followed by details of the risk mitigation strategy employed to ensure that the system survives the long travel times and the deep space environment Finally we discuss desc ope options for the spacecraft Cost Overview  Although we designed the TRIDENT mission to comply to the constraints imposed on New Frontiers missions, the cost cap for the mission was increased to FY2015 1.5B excluding launch vehicle costs\ to account for the inherent costs of flying a spacecraft to deep space We used the NASA Instrument Cost Model NICM database and parametric estimates based on heritage to estimate the instrument costs We estimated the system cost using JPL grassroots and parametric models Furthermore we used internal JPL labor rates to estimate the operations costs NASA inflation rates were used to compute cost values in 2015 dollars Table 12 provides an overview of the project costs broken down by phase and Table 13  presents the instrument cost estimates. As can be seen from these tables the spacecraft design falls well below the provided cost cap even with the significant reserve included Table 12 Mission Cost Summary Mission Phase  Reserv e    Cost  M$FY2015  Development \(A D  30  1103.1  Phase A  30  11.0  Phase B  30  99.3  Phase C/D  30  992.8  Operations \(E  15  240.3  Project Cost w/o LV  27  1343.5  Launch Vehicle \(LV  0  30.0  Total Project Cost  26  1373.7  Table 13  Su mmary of Instrument Costs Instrument  Cost \(M$FY2015  Probe  0.0  MAG  9.0  NAC  18.0  PS  11.4  UVS  14.0  NIR  28.0  Doppler  57.5  Total Cost  152.1   We made a few important assumptions in the costing process First as mentioned earlier we assumed that the Atlas V 551 launch vehicle was provided by the government at no cost, as detailed in the New Frontiers Announcement of Opportunity 2   C o n s eq u en tl y   w e o n l y  i n clu d ed  t h e  operations costs associated with the launch vehicle in the estimate for the launch vehicle cost. Furthermore, the probe was also provided as government-furnished equipment and its cost was also not included in the estimate However when calculating associated costs \(e.g. systems engineering costs we assumed that the probe cost 157M without reserves which was consistent with the Uranus probe presented in the 2013-2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey 1   Mo r eo v er   w e ad d ed  d ev elo p m en t p r o g r a m s  i n  the Phase A-D costs including 12 months of testing and 100M for the development of the Doppler imager and 100M for further ASRG lifetime testing Although we  assumed that the necessary plutonium isotopes would be available, the ASRGs were not assumed to be governmentfurnished equipment and their acquisition, costed at $215M was fully accounted for in the cost breakdown \(within Phase C/D\ provided in Table 12   Risk Mitigation We performed a thorough analysis of the risks affecting the mission to ensure that appropriate mitigations were in place  Overall, we identified five significant risks and discuss these in the rest of this section, in order of importance 1\ ASRG lifetime 2\ High activity flyby sequence 3\ Long mission duration 4\ Doppler imager 5\ Antenna gimbal failure ASRG Lifetime  As discussed in Section 3 ASRGs are currently only rated for a 17-year lifetime, specifically for 3 years in storage and a 14-year flight lifetime 56   d u e to  limitations associated with their moving parts Although lifetime tests are ongoing we assumed 2015 technology in the mission design Therefore we did not assume that ASRGs will most likely have significant heritage by the proposed 2029 launch date The trajectory used in this design has a time of flight to Neptune of 13 years, with the end of the mission scheduled 8 months after close encounter This means that the proposed mission will require the ASRGs to survive until 4 months before the end of their rated lifetime, assuming that there are no delays in schedule, which represents a significant risk To mitigate this risk we sized the spacecraft to carry five ASRGs and we performed a risk analysis to investigate the probability of mechanical failure occurring We found that there is a <10% probability of a single failure occurring, in which case all the baseline science could still be achieved We found that the probability of two ASRGs failing is 3 If such a dual failure occurred all the threshold science could still be achieved. As mentioned in the last section, we also added an additional $100M into the budget for further ASRG lifetime testing High activity flyby sequence  As detailed in the mission design section the flybys of Triton and Neptune have a short duration 2 Earth days compared to the rest of the mission During this short period a large number of activities must occur in perfect sequence in order to achieve

The main mitigation approach to avoid data loss is to have a dual string system where both ACS and CDS strings are on during approach. If a single failure occurs the system will automatically switch to the redundant system without going into safe mode or requiring operator intervention. Furthermore, we showed in Section 2 that the probe can address the top three science questions for this mission Consequently we designed the mission sequence to prioritize observation of the probe during descent There is also ample time to downlink all the data collected by the probe before the Neptune encounter occurs The key science questions can thus still be answered even if a malfunction occurs during the Neptune close approach Long mission duration  The total mission duration including the data downlink time after the close approach of Neptune, is nearly 15 years. This imposes lifetime survival requirements that are much longer than those of typical missions. To address this risk, we designed the spacecraft to be fully redundant and parts selection was commensurate with the mission duration The ACS and in particular the reaction wheels was especially sensitive to lifetime degradation failures We therefore added a spare reaction wheel to the design Additionally we found that the thrusters would provide sufficient control to achieve all of the threshold science in the case of a reaction wheel failure and we included enough spare propellant in the design to enable this Doppler imager  As we explained in Section 2 the Doppler imager is an instrument that has never been flown for planetary observation before The technology and measurement techniques must therefore be proven in the laboratory before the imager can be flown. We added twelve months to Phase A and $100M to the budget to enable this additional assessment and testing to take place Antenna gimbal failure  The proposed design includes a gimballed antenna in order to enable radio occultation measurements during the encounter. The gimbal is a moving part that presents a risk of mechanical failure However threshold science can still be exceeded and the complete set of data can be returned post-encounter in the event of a gimbal failure thus reducing the adverse effects of such a failure   De Scope Options Although the proposed design falls well below the FY2015 1.5B cost cap and includes significant margins and risk mitigation strategies such complex missions are always at risk of unforeseen cost overruns As the design develops mass and power overrun can also occur Consequently we present a list of de-scope options in Table 14 with options at each of the first three phases of the development process The primary de-scope option is the Doppler imager This instrument has a very high potential for incredible science return, but it is the single most expensive instrument in the chosen suite. The other de-scope options would simplify the proposed design while still enabling all the threshold science to be achieved Overall, we showed that this mission comes well below the cost cap even with significant margin We performed a thorough risk analysis we did not find any missionthreatening risks and we implemented several strategies to mitigate any potential adverse effects from the main perceived risks that were identified. Finally, we listed seven de scope options which together would cut up to 125M 160kg and 115W from the mission These potential descopes therefore provide several opportunities to simplify the design should the need arise while still achieving all the threshold science 6   C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we present the results of a study undertaken by 16 graduate and post-doctoral students during the 2013 Planetary Science Summer School We propose a low-cost mission concept to the Neptunian system called TRIDENT which can achieve a range of science goals with a budget of less than FY2015 $1.5B. Neptune and Triton are chosen as the target of this study because, together, they embody two fields of high scientific interest 1 ice giants and their similarities to exoplanets and 2 icy moons and their potential as astrobiology targets. Neptune and Triton among 


    16  the planetary bodies in our solar system that have the least amount of observational data and a mission such as TRIDENT would provide order of magnitude improvements on our current understanding of the Neptunian system We start the paper with a decomposition of the science goals for TRIDENT. We then show that we were unable to close on an orbital mission design due to significantly exceeding launch mass requirements, thus motivating the selection of a flyby trajectory. We follow these with in-depth descriptions of the subsystems and overall system designed We close the paper with details of the system cost risk mitigation strategies and de-scope options Although a mission to the Neptunian system is not feasible until the late 2020s due to trajectory constraints, we show that compelling science can be undertaken at this target under constrained budgets and urge that the study of this system be considered in future mission proposals A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The 2013 Planetary Science Summer School was held at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology, under government contract to NASA We would also like to thank members of the JPL education office specifically Trisha Steltzner and Leslie Lowes for coordinating the summer school.
