Language Modeling for Spoken Dialogue System based on Sentence Transformation and Filtering using Predicate-Argument Structures Koichiro Yoshino 003 and Shinsuke Mori 003 and Tatsuya Kawahara 003 003 School of Informatics Kyoto University Sakyo-ku Kyoto 606-8501 Japan Abstract 227We present a novel scheme of language modeling for a spoken dialogue system by effectively exploiting the backend documents the system uses for information navigation The proposed method 002rst converts sentences in the document which are written and plain style into spoken question-style queries which are expected in spoken dialogue In this process we conduct dependency analysis to extract verbs and relevant phrases to generate natural sentences by applying transformation rules Then we select sentences which have useful information relevant to the target domain and thus are more likely to be queried For this purpose we de\002ne predicate-argument P-A templates based on a statistical measure in the target document An experimental evaluation shows that the proposed method outperforms the conventional method in ASR performance and the sentence selection based on the P-A templates is effective I I NTRODUCTION The task of spoken dialogue systems has been extended from simple transactions to general information navigation based upon users requests It is also desired to handle not only simple keyword-based queries which current voice search systems respond to but also users vague and complex requests such as tourist guide and news brie\002ng In these tasks there may be no or many answers to users questions e.g 224what is the best spot?\224 but the system should provide the most relevant information through interaction with the users These kinds of applications can be realized through document retrieval in the corresponding domain For example we can turn to tourist guidebooks or relevant Wikipedia entries for tourist domain Note that an intelligent dialogue system can be realized by limiting the domain and using the knowledge on the domain W e ha v e been de v eloping an interacti v e news navigator which makes dialogue based on the news article archives The system not only responds to users queries e.g 224Did Seattle Mariners win last night?\224 but also proactively presents a piece of news which will attract users interest The automatic speech recognition ASR module for spoken dialogue systems SDS needs an appropriate language model LM adapted to the task domain and query style Even a very large-vocabulary ASR system cannot cover proper nouns or named entities NEs which are critical in information retrieval Ideally LM should be trained with a largescale matched corpus but this assumption does not hold in many realistic cases Therefore two approaches are commonly adopted The 002rst approach is mixing document texts of the target domain with a dialogue corpus of spoken-style expressions The other is collecting relevant texts possibly in spoken-style sentences from Web 11 8 1 These approaches try to cover the target domain and spoken-style in an indirect way but the resultant model will inevitably contain a large amount of irrelevant texts We investigate a direct approach that generates spoken-style sentences from the written-style document texts of the target domain A naive method would be to transform sentences in the document to spoken question-style which are expected for spoken dialogue systems Ho we v er  e v ery sentence in the document will not correspond to queries or questions and every phrase of the relevant sentences may not be useful In fact the useful information structure is dependent on the domain and information extraction techniques have been investigated Con v entionally  the templates for information extraction were hand-crafted b ut this heuristic process is so costly that it cannot be applied to a variety of domains on the web We have proposed a method to automatically de\002ne domain-dependent templates for information extraction which are used for a 003exible information navigation system In this paper we extend this approach to generate an appropriate LM for a spoken dialogue system Speci\002cally we propose a method of two sequential processes First document texts are transformed to spoken question-style sentences by using dependency and predicate-argument P-A structures Second these sentences are 002ltered with domain-dependent P-A templates In this way we can predict sentences used for information extraction and navigation which are matched to the domain and style The proposed scheme is applied to a domain of baseball news navigation and we use a newspaper article database as a back-end document set II O VERVIEW OF P ROPOSED M ETHOD The overall 003ow of the proposed method is depicted in Fig 1  First sentences of the newspaper articles documents are parsed by JUMAN 1 and KNP 2 to generate dependency and P-A structures Here we focus on dependencies to verbs A P-A structure represents a sentence with a predicate and 1 http://nlp.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nl-resource/juman.html 2 http://nlp.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/nl-resource/knp.html

B Sentence Generation After the transformation sentences are generated by using sub-trees of the predicate In the example shown in Fig 2 the sub-trees of 223hit\224 are 223Ichiro\224 223a home-run\224 and 223On the third inning\224 Thus they are used to make respective sentences The phrase 223on the third inning\224 can be used for both questions because it is shared with the predicates 223hit\224 and 223pull away\224 IV S ENTENCE S ELECTION WITH P-A T EMPLATES We use P-A templates to de\002ne a useful information structure from the target document They are used to 002lter the sentences generated in the previous section A Extraction of Domain Dependent P-A Templates The P-A structure automatically generated by the semantic parser provides a useful information structure However every P-A pair is not meaningful in information navigation actually only a fraction of the patterns are useful and they are domaindependent For example in the baseball domain key patterns include 223[A agent beat B object and 223[A agent hit B object and in the b usiness domain 223[A agent sell B object and 223[A agent acquire B object W e ha v e proposed an automatic extraction method of P-A templates  In the previous study the extraction method based on Naive Bayes classi\002er was shown to be effective In this method probability of domain t e.g baseball given word w i is de\002ned as P  t j w i   C  w i  t   D t 015 C  w i   015  1 Here C  w i  is a count of word w i  and C  w i  t  is a count of word w i in domain t  015 is a smoothing factor which is estimated with a dirichlet prior and D t is a normalization coef\002cient of the corpus size of the domain t  D t  P j C  w j  t  P k C  w k   2 The evaluation score of a P-A template is calculated as a mean of the scores of its components predicate  p  argument  a  and its semantic case  s  We de\002ne two ways of this calculation One uses a pair of a predicate and a semantic case as one word the other uses an argument and a semantic case as one word 032 N B ps a  t j P A i   p P  t j w ps  002 P  t j w a  N B p sa  t j P A i   p P  t j w p  002 P  t j w sa  3 The statistical method often encounters the problem of data sparseness due to mismatch between the training set and the test set especially in the named entities NEs To solve this problem we conduct clustering to NEs which appear in the training set Fig 3 Example of Scoring B Filtering with P-A templates For each sentence generated by the method described in Section III we calculate an evaluation score  N B s  by taking an average for constitute P-A pairs N B s  P n i 1 N B  t j P A i  n  4 An example of the scoring is shown in Fig 3  The input sentence s has four P-As We calculate an average of their scores which are given by the corresponding P-A templates Then the sentences are sorted with N B s  and we make selection of the sentences of high scores for training of LM With this method we can select sentences which are more relevant to the target domain and more likely to be asked by users V E XPERIMENTAL E VALUATION We evaluate the LM constructed by the proposed method We prepared 201 questions The target document set is a collection of the Mainichi Newspaper articles of ten years 2000-2009 There are 176,852 sentences which are tagged with the Japanese professional baseball domain As a result of parsing 500,523 predicates are extracted from these sentences 342,322 in\003ected words and 158,201 event-noun Test-set word perplexity and word error rate WER are used as evaluation measures We use adjusted perplexity to fairly compare LMs which have different sizes of vocabulary To de\002ne the adjusted perplexity we 002xed the vocabulary size to 16,239 This is derived from the entire training corpus with cut-off 5 For reference we construct an LM with the conventional mixing method We use the above newspaper corpus and 481,243 question-style sentences categorized as baseball in Yahoo QA corpus 3  which is a set of queries collected through a web site 3 This corpus is provided by Yahoo!JAPAN and National Institute of Informatics Japan 


Fig 4 Test-set word perplexity Fig 5 Word error rate WER of ASR To evaluate the effectiveness of 002ltering we experiment by using sentences that rank in 50 25 12.5 and 6.25 of all We show the graph of the perplexity in Fig 4 and WER in Fig 5  In these graphs PS A and P SA correspond to the methods for calculating the evaluation score N B s which are de\002ned in formula 3 The horizontal axis shows the quantity of the training data The left-most case text=1/1 applies the transformation only The 002gures show that the proposed method outperforms the reference method and reduces the WER by 16.9 and perplexity by 18.0 at an optimal point Compared with the no-\002ltering case text=1/1 the proposed sentence selection method reduces perplexity by 5.2 and WER by 7.8 Thus the proposed method is shown to be effective for LM construction for the domain-speci\002c information navigation system VI C ONCLUSION We have proposed a novel scheme of language modeling for the information navigation system It consists of two processes sentence transformation based on dependency analysis and simple rules and sentence 002ltering based on P-A templates This proposed method performs better than the conventional method without using a spoken question-style corpus It is also shown that the sentence selection based on the P-A templates is effective We plan to apply the method to a variety of domains in a large scale R EFERENCES  Ivan Bulyko Mari Ostendorf Manhung Siu Tim Ng Andreas Stolcke and 250 Ozg 250 ur C\270 etin Web resources for language modeling in conversational speech recognition ACM Trans Speech Lang Process  5\(1 2007  Jane Grimshaw Argument structure MIT Press  1990  Ralph Grishman Discovery methods for information extraction In Proc ISCA  IEEE Workshop on Spontaneous Speech Processing and Recognition  pages 243\226247 2003  Varga Istvan Kiyonori Otake Kentaro Torisawa Stijn De Saeger Teruhisa Misu Shigeki Matsuda and Jun'ichi Kazama Similarity based language model construction for voice activated open-domain question answering In Proc IJCNLP2011  2011  Tatsuya Kawahara New perspectives on spoken language understanding Does machine need to fully understand speech In Proc IEEE-ASRU  pages 46\22650 2009  Mamoru Komachi Ryu Iida Kentaro Inui and Yuji Matsumoto Learning based argument structure analysis of event-nouns in japanese In Proc of the PACLING  pages 120\226128 2007  L.Ramshaw and R.M.Weischedel Information extraction In IEEEICASSP  volume 5 pages 969\226972 2005  Teruhisa Misu and Tatsuya Kawahara A bootstrapping approach for developing language model of new spoken dialogue system by selecting web texts In INTERSPEECH  pages 9\22613 2006  Teruhisa Misu and Tatsuya Kawahara Bayes risk-based dialogue management for document retrieval system with speech interface Speech Communication  52\(1 2010  Ruhi Sarikaya Agustin Gravano and Yuqing Gao Rapid language model development using external resources for new spoken dialog domains In Proc ICASSP  volume 1 pages 573\226576 2005  Abhinav Sethy Panayiotis G Georgiou and Shrikanth Narayanan Building Topic Speci\002c Language Models from Webdata Using Competitive Models In Proc Interspeech  pages 1293\2261296 2005  Yee Whye Teh Michael I Jordan Matthew J Beal and David M Blei Hierarchical dirichlet processes Journal of the American Statistical Association  101:1566\2261581 2006  Koichiro Yoshino Shinsuke Mori and Tatsuya Kawahara Spoken dialogue system based on information extraction using similarity of predicate argument structures In Proc of SIGDIAL  pages 59\22666 2011

method extends previous work by considering combined cause factors and the identi“ed combined causal rules can be potentially useful in a wide range of areas To cope with the computational complexity of partial association tests we have proposed to use QuickSort in the algorithm which has signi“cantly improved the ef“ciency When applying our approach to a set of real-world diagnostic data the algorithm is able to ef“ciently produce both single and combined causal rules In the future we plan to evaluate the performance of this algorithm with a wider range of large scale data sets In addition we will conduct further comparisons of our approach with other causality discovery methods The algorithm proposed aims at discovering causality from observed binary data with known target so we intend to extend the algorithm to make it adapt for various data types and discover causal relationship effectively from more complex cases R EFERENCES  J Pearl and T  S V erma  A theory of inferred causation

The system scales very well with dataset size because the SPARQL graph patterns are mostly evaluated with index-based nested loop joins, which tend to have execution times proportional to result size. Q5 shows the worst scalability because the execution cost is dominated by the regular expression filter on the unselective triple pattern, and the number of intermediate results that must be scanned for the regular expression filter grows significantly as the dataset size increases B  Computing SEM_CONTAINS_COUNT This experiment studied the overhead of computing sem_contains_count by executing two variations of the five sem_contains queries \(Table V\ against the LA130 dataset: \(1 sem_contains only and \(2 sem_contains  sem_contains_count The results of the experiment are shown in Figure 4. As expected, computing sem_contains_count adds some overhead. This overhead is proportional to the result s et size because the count has to be computed once for each document in the result set The overhead required to compute the count value is reasonable. For example, the overhead ranged from 0.001 sec Q2\ to 0.081 sec \(Q3\. The larger overhead observed for queries Q1 and Q3 can be attributed to the larger result size The overhead of computing sem_contains_count is relatively small for Q2, Q4, and Q5, which can be attributed to the fact that the result set size is small for these queries 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Query Number Execution Time \(sec sem_contains sem_contains + sem_contains_count  Fig. 4 Overhead for sem_contains_count on LA130 dataset C  Ordering Results by SEM_CONTAINS_COUNT This experiment tested the scalability of computing and sorting results by sem_contains_count as the query result set size increases.

0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 12345678 Partitions Accessed Execution Time \(sec Partitioned Non-Partitioned  Fig. 6 Benefit of partition pruning on LA130 dataset The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 6. As expected, partition pruning shows a significant speedup in query execution time when only a few partitions are accessed The speedup ranged from 2.8 times faster when one partition is accessed to 1.2 times faster when three partitions are accessed. Not surprisingly, the benefit of partition pruning is reduced as more partitions are qu eried.  This can be attributed to two opposing factors in play In our implementation, each semantic index partition results in a single RDF model, so the non-partitioned index yields one large RDF model, and the partitioned index yields eight small RDF models. The single B  tree index structure, in case of non-partitioned table, is organized independently of the partitioning key pubdate and hence does not benefit from locality of reference when the query is selective requiring access to one or a few partitions. However, for the partitioned index case, the local indexes have triples grouped by pubdate which tends to perform better for selective queries. These benefits start to diminish as the number of partitions to be accessed by the query goes up and eventually the non-partitioned index starts to perform better. When all eight partitions are accessed, the query using the \(local partitioned index runs 1.4 times slower VI  C ONCLUSIONS  The paper presented the semantic indexing feature of Oracle Database, which allows indexing unstructured text columns to generate RDF content that can subsequently be searched with a SPARQL query pattern. It described a model of a semantic index that can be incrementally composed by a combination of base extractor policies, knowledge bases, and entailments. A model for querying semantic index was discussed that allows both searching for matching documents and/or matching triples. An experimental study involving TREC documents demonstrated the feasibility of our approach The proposed semantic indexing framework is intended to create a synergy between the database, semantic web, and information extraction communities. Specifically, the integration and inference benefits of semantic technologies become available for use against unstructured data in the databases. The semantic web community benefits as large volumes of RDF data, hitherto residing as unstructured text can now drive the development of semantic applications Information extraction community benefits as their technologies are put to immediate use by the database and semantic web communities Although extracted data, stored in standard RDF format, is amenable to querying, it tends to be verbose. Further work is needed, in conjunction with the information extraction community, to come up with levels of summarization that will also result in compact and efficient SPARQL query formulation. A more complete realization of the semantic indexing framework would involve work in several areas including optimized processing of blocking queries involving ancillary operators, devising s ophisticated ranking measures for capturing document r elevance, and incremental maintenance of entailments at the document \(named graph level A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Zhe Wu and Vlad Kolovski for providing support for named graph inferencing R EFERENCES  1  S G.
