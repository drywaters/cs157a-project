2 Registries in Windows Windows registry can be thought of as a central repository of information about all aspects of the computer hardware applications operating system and users The information in the registry is centralized easy to access hierarchical and tree-structured  The hierarchical tree structure of the registry is divided into registry hives that contain keys sub-keys and items corresponding to hardware software and system components Sections whose names begin with HKEY_ are called root keys  Each root key contains sub-keys  which in turn might contain further subkeys and so on The lowest level keys leaves along a given branch are associated with values Keysandvalues both hold data and the data can be either binary or ASCII strings At the leaves the binary data are speci\336ed with the types REG_BINARY  REG_BINARY\(truncated and REG_DWORD whereas the ASCII data has as its type any one of REG_SZ  REG_MULTI_SZ and REG_EXPAND_SZ  The keys and values can be id enti\336ed by specifying its path along the branch The registry is divided into six and 336ve sections on Windows 9x and NT respectively The 336ve sections correspond to i HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT  ii HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE iii HKEY_USERS iv HKEY_CURRENT_USER v HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG Among the 336ve mentioned above only two root keys viz HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and HKEY_USERS stand on their own and the rest are pseudonyms for other parts of the tree e.g HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT is a pseudonym of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Classes The pseudonym root keys are not duplicates but provide an alternate view of the same information 2  W e u s e HKLM to represent HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE for the rest of the paper 3 Motivation Almost all the proposed approaches for fault diagnosis dealing with registries 8 6 7 b asically rely o n 336n d ing the differences between a previously recorded goodstate snapshot of a registry with that of the current badstate snapshot the one captured on occurrence of a fault This approach though might id entify accurate differences when applied on a single machine however suffers badly for cross-machine diagnosis This is due to the inherent con\336guration differences be tween machines Consider the following simple example Let 000 002 and 000 004 be two machines whose registry entri es we wish to compare Further assume that on 000 002  all the softwares has been installed on drive C while on 000 004  they are installed on drive D A naive comparison would differ even in entries like the HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Perl\\BinDir whose values could be C:\\Program Files\\Perl\\bin\\perl.exe and D:\\Perl\\bin\\perl.exe for machines 000 002 and 000 004 respectively The differences in registry entries which is expected to help would now turn out to be a disaster for the diagnostic engine This is due to the lack of intelligence in identifying the relevant differences An intelligent diagnoser can take into consideration the semantics of the keys and values and shouldn\325t report entries like the one above The registry entries have associations and dependencies An abstract representation of the registry capturing these associations is required to build better diagnostic systems Redstone et al 4 a l s o obs erv e t h at di agnos t i c s y s t ems can be simpler when we have a struct ured representation These factors motivate us to explore a representation mRegistry  meta-Registry  that captures dependencies more explicitly 4 mRegistry The aim is to discover hidden previously unknown knowledge and potentially useful information from registry data A few examples include extracting repeated patterns unexpected patterns asso ciations and new rules from the data mRegistry is a representation of registry that is concept-based and captures the dependencies among the registry entries in multiple stages mRegistry achieves this by exploiting the hierarchical design of the registry 4.1 Pre-Processing mRegistry requires the following preprocessing steps 1 Block-Based Representation Fig 1 depicts the general and block-based tree repr esentation of the registry The block-based represen tation is just a matter of convenience to present and explain the algorithms The difference between the two is that all the leaf node keys and values for a hive are combined together as an entity and is made the only leaf node of the corresponding parent Let us call this entity a block Bythis we can refer to all leaf keys of a parent of the original representation as keys within the block  Also in the modi\336ed representation the neighboring nodes at a leaf level belong to different parents whereas it might belong either to the same parent or a different one in the general representation 2 Discount Binary Values We concentrate only on keys that have ASCII string values so that the dependencies learned would be valid across all the registries from different machines We feel that the keys in the registry the values of which are binary/numeric valued and speci\336c to a machine provide less information in identifying the dependencies/concepts that would be valid over the registries from various machines For example the values of hardwareID ClassGUID etc for a registry hive will de\336nitely be different when we compare registries from two machines We also ignore all branches in the registry tree that has a sub-key with a binary value We mean a 324key with binary value\325 to Proceedings of the 2005 5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications \(ISDA\22205

The rule above says that for any application XYZ under App Paths the No Name key has the value Path>\\$&XYZ where Path corresponds to the value of the subsumed key Path  The use is described below Fault Diagnosis Fault diagnosis of Windows systems based on registries viz the Change and Con\336guration Management CCM is one of the prominent applications of the proposed approach Section 3 described a few drawbacks of the current registry model for CCM studies mRegistry helps in retrieving relev ant differences thereby reducing the number of differences between cross-machine registry snapshots This is evident as Algorithm 1 captures the relationships within a hive and replaces them with pattern variables For the example described above in 1 as a rule for registries across different machines irrespective of the location an application is installed the No Name key\325s value remains the same  Path\\$&XYZ for an application XYZ  and so they do not differ The location is captured in Path and we create derived keys for the location and have the Path value equal to the derived key  Few other applications include Conceptualization Conceptualization is key to understanding and refers to the process of learning meaningful concepts/explanations from data Rule 1 above says that the No Name key of an application has the value equal to the application located in Path  This rule holds true on all the 20 registry snapshots that we explored Many such rules have been learned using the proposed approach Compression Another important application of the proposed approach considering the large size of registry databases is that of compression Compression is achieved as follows by the creation of derived keys at a parent node we just substitute the derived key in the leaves The size of the derived key being much smaller than that of the actual value results in compression Another source of compression is conceptualization As discussed in section 4 by forming rules and generalized descriptions using regular expressions we can remove those entries corresponding to the consequents of rules from the registry and use the rules instead Thi s results in the removal of a lot of registry entries And while comparison between registries we can use the rule s/concepts We can call this as semantic compression  For the 20 registry snapshots we experimented we noticed a compression ratio between 000 001 002 and 000 001 003  Prediction However large our databases may be with users constantly installing new softwares it might be possible that we may come across a registry hive/entry that is not present in our database In such cases prediction of the entries depending on the rules formulated would provide some clue For example for any new legacy driver we know that the Class e would e LegacyDriver and the Service e would e the XYZ for a driver keyed LEGACY_$&XYZ 6 Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we proposed a novel representation of registries called mRegistry that is concept-based capturing the intra-block inter-block and ancestor-child dependencies among the registry entries Algorithms for 336nding these associations are presented and discussed mRegistry depicts the dependencies using pattern variables and rules With its compact representation mRegistry achieves some compression and results in ef\336cie nt comparison between crossmachine registry snapshots mRegistry is also applicable in fault diagnosis and in the prediction of certain unforeseen entries in the registry based on the concepts learned mRegistry is designed considering only the ASCII string entries in the registry It might be possible that there exist meaningful semantic relationships between some binary entries We would like to extend the current work to incorporate the ignored entries with complementary usage of domain knowledge and explore new representations as future work References 1 A  G anapat hi  Y  M W a ng N L a o and J  R  W

allelizing Dualminer 16 the authors sho wed that by mining relatively small sparse datasets consisting of 10K transactions and 100K items the sequential version of Dualminer took an excessive amount of time Unfortunately the original authors of Dualminer did not show any single experiment to depict the execution time of their algorithm but only the reduction in predicate executions A recent strate gy dealing with monotone and anti-monotone constraints suggests reducing the transactional database input via pre-processing by successively eliminating transactions that violate the constraints and then applying any frequent itemset mining algorithm on the reduced transaction set 4 The main drawback of this approach is that it is highly I/O bound due to the iterative process needed in rewriting the reduced dataset to disk This algorithm is also sensitive to the results of the initial monotone constraint checking which is applied to full transactions In other words if a whole transaction satisìes the monotone constraint then no pruning is applied and consequently no gains are achieved even if parts of this transaction do not satisfy the same monotone constraint To overcome some of the issues in the same approach has been tested against the FP-Growth approach in with ne w effective pruning heuristics 7 Conclusion Since the introduction of association rules a decade ago and the launch of the research in efìcient frequent itemset mining the development of effective approaches for mining large transactional databases has been the focus of many research studies Furthermore it is widely recognized that mining for frequent items or association rules regardless of its efìciency usually yields an overwhelming crushing number of patterns This is one of the reasons it is argued that the integration of data mining and database management technologies is required These large sets of discovered patterns could be queried Expressing constraints using a query language could indeed help sift through the large pattern set to identify the useful ones We argue that pushing the consideration of these constraints at the mining process before discovering the patterns is an efìcient and effective way to solve the problem This does not exclude the integration of data mining and database systems but suggests the need for data mining query languages intricately integrated with the data mining process In this paper we address the issue of early consideration of monotone and anti-monotone constraints in the case of frequent itemset mining We propose a leap traversal approach BifoldLeap  that traverses the search space by jumping from relevant node to relevant node and simultaneously checking for constraint violations The approach we propose uses existing data structures FP-tree and COFI-tree but introduces new pruning techniques to reduce the search costs We conducted a battery of experiments to evaluate our constraint-based search and report a fraction of them herein for lack of space The experiments show the advantages of pushing both monotone and anti-monotone constraints as early as possible in the mining process despite the overhead of constraint checking We also compared our algorithm to Dualminer a state-of-the-art algorithm in constraint-based frequent itemset mining and showed how our algorithm outperforms it and can nd all frequent itemsets the closed and the maximal patterns that satisfy constraints along with their exact supports References  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A Sw ami Mining

on the intention to use self- and e-assessment center as well as the influence of PQI, PCS and PTS on PU it might represent a single example for a specific economy, country or cultural region . There might be differences for the intention of different informnation systems with different settings. Future research should discuss this issue more detailed  Furthermore our questionnaire was just answered by large-scale corporations in Germany. So our results might not be directly transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises  In addition, as we collected our data from participants at the same time using the same survey our results may be affected by common method varian  6. Conclusion  Self-assessment and e-assessment as online games in staff recruiting are a valuable solution for companies to support on the one side their employer branding activities and on the other side the selection of the favored candidate. The case study of our papers shows that companies can generate more qualified applications and concurrently save time and money. Based on these findings our empirical research with 191 of the Top-1000 companies of Germany provide statistical evidence that perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings are the main reasons beside perceived usefulness and ease of use why companies intend to use self- and e-assessment in their recruiting processes  References   Bago zzi  R  P   T h e Ro l e  of M easu r e m en t i n T h eo ry Construction and Hypothesis Testing: Toward a Holistic Model", in: Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, O.C.

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
