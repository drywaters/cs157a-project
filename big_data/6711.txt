I I NTRODUCTION As we all know, geographic Information Databases is an important style of spatial database in spatial data mining mining spatial association rules from Geographic Information Databases is one important part of spatial data mining and knowledge discovery \(SDMKD\, which is also known as spatial co-location pattern as in [1  S p at ial c o l oc ati on  pa tte rn  are some implicit rules expressing construct and association of spatial objects in Geographic Information Databases, and also expressing hierarchy and correlation of different subsets of spatial association or spatial data in Geographic Information Databases as in [2 N o w a d a y s in  res ea rch o f sp ati al  d a ta  mining, there are mainly three kinds approaches of mining 
spatial association rules as in [3 s u ch as l a y e r c o v e re d bas e d  on clustering as in [3 i n i ng app ro ac h ba sed o n s p at i a l  transaction as in [2, 4, 5, and 6  a n d  m i ni ng a ppro a c h b a sed o n  non-spatial transaction as in [3  T h e  f i rst tw o  m e th o d s  m a y b e  also used to mining frequent neighboring class set, The spatial association as in [4, 5, and  i s qu ite  s i n g l e be cau s e  th ey on ly  express spatial association among these objects which are all close to objective. However, neighboring class set expresses another spatial association among these objects which are close to each other. MFNCS as in us e s t h e s i m i l a r m e t hod o f  Apriori to search frequent neighboring class set, which gains some right instance of \(k+1\-neighboring class set only through connecting right instance of k-neighboring class set according 
to down-top strategy, and so this algorithm is only suitable for mining short frequent neighboring class set according to character of Apriori. Hence, this paper proposes an algorithm of complementation mining frequent neighboring class set denoted by CMFNCS, which is suitable for mining any frequent neighboring class set according to top-down search and complementation mining strategy II PRELIMINARY KNOWLEDGE According to these representations as in [2   ev e r y ob ject in  spatial domain forms a spatial data set, which is expressed as this data structure, denoted by <Object Identify, Class Identify and Spatial Location>. Here, identify of different class in spatial data set is denoted by Class Identify, identify of different object instance in the same class is denoted by Object 
Identify, location coordinate of object is denoted by Spatial Location. We regard an object as an instance of corresponding class, and so spatial data set is made up of these instances of spatial Class Identify. Sets of Class Identify are thought as spatial class set, denoted by C = {C 1 C 2 203C m means there are m different classes

Definition 4 Right Instance of Neighboring Class Set, let I i t1 i t2 i tk be an instance of NCS, if  i p and i q i p i q  I and distance \(i p i q  d, and then we think I be an right instance of NCS. Here, d is the minimal distance used by deciding two spatial objects are close to each other, Euclidean distance is expressed as distance \(i p i q  Definition 5 Neighboring Class Set Support, it is equal to the sum of right instance of neighboring class set, which is denoted by support \(NCS Definition 6 Frequent Neighboring Class Set, its support is not less than the minimal support given by user Property 1 Let k-NCS is not frequent neighboring class sets, and \(k+1\-NCS is not also frequent neighboring class set Here, k-NCS  k+1\NCS Property 2 Let \(k+1\-NCS is frequent neighboring class set, and k-NCS is also frequent neighboring class set. Here, kNCS  k+1\NCS B Problem Description According to above definition, property and these representations as in [2 e de scr i b e freq ue nt ne i ghbor i ng class set mining as follows Input 1\ Class set is denoted by C = {C 1 C 2 C m instance set is denoted by I = {i 1 i 2 i n each i k i k  I\ is expressed as above defined data structure 2\Minimal distance is denoted by d 3\inimal support is denoted by s Output Frequent neighboring class set III THE ALGORITHM OF COMPLEMENTATION MINING FREQUENT NEIGHBORING CLASS SET A Building  Digital NCS Database In order to build digital database of neighboring class set we need find corresponding NCS of every right instance, and turn NCS into a digit. The course of turning used by the algorithm is expressed as follows Step1, we define the order of class as C = {C 1 C 2  C j C m and so each class existing in right instance has order denoted by No j  Step2, and then, we use weight denote every class, if the order of this class is denoted by No j and then 1 2  j No is defined as weight of class Step3, we let 1 1 2  No  1 2 2  No  1 2  L No be defined as weight sets, here L is equal to Neighboring Class Set Length and namely, it is the sum of class existing in this neighboring class set. We compute this expression   L j No j 1 1 2 to gain a digit We use this method to gain a digit by scanning every right instance and this digit also expresses this corresponding NCS of right instance In order to save these digits, we use this data structure expressed as follows Structure neighboring class set Int Digit; // saving digit expressed as NCS of right instance Int Count; // saving the sum of same digit expressed as NCS} NCS Example, here class set is expressed as C = {V, W, X, Y Z}, the first three right instances are express as I 1 W 1 X 3  Y 4 Z 2 I 2 V 3 W 4 Y 5 I 3 W 2 X 4 Y 2 Z 1  Now we use the above introductive method to build digital NCS database, this course is expressed as follows NCS of I 1 is expressed as {W, X, Y, Z}, and these orders are expressed as {2, 3, 4, 5}, weight sets is expressed as {2 2-1  2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 and then, we will gain this digit 30, NCS [0   Digit =30, NCS [0 Co unt  1  NCS of I 2 is expressed as {V, W, Y}, and these orders are expressed as {1, 2, 4}, weight sets is expressed as {2 1-1 2 2-1  2 4-1 and then, we will gain this digit 11, NCS [1  Dig i t   1 1   NC  C o unt 1  NCS of I 3 is expressed as {W, X, Y, Z}, weight sets is expressed as {2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 and then, we will gain this digit 30, because NC s a l r e a d y sa ved t h i s  information, and only NC Co unt N C S 0  C o unt   1 2   B The method of generating candidate frequent NCS The algorithm generates candidate frequent neighboring class set according to top-down search and complementation mining strategy. Hence, this course includes two parts as follows Firstly, it uses digit logical operation to generate kcandidate frequent item sets of digit formed by \(k+1\-digit nonfrequent item sets. The algorithm adopts search strategy which is similar to B_UDMA as in a nd IT D A S N a s i n  8   Secondly, it uses computing complementary set of above kcandidate frequent item sets to generate candidate frequent item sets of digit. The strategy is similar to ATCM as in [4  The example of generating is expressed as follows Suppose spatial class set is expressed as C = {V, W, X, Y Z}, and it is Neighboring Class Universal Set according to definition 2, here it is not frequent neighboring class set Step1, the algorithm generates 4-candidate frequent item sets according to top-down search strategy, and then computes their support There are three non-frequent neighboring class sets as follows 1\NCS 1 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 5-1 23 


2\NCS 2 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 15 3\NCS 3 2 1-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 29 There are two frequent neighboring class sets as follows 1\S 1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 30 2\S 2 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 27 Step2, the algorithm computes these complementary sets of 4-candidate frequent item sets according to complementation mining strategy as follows Complementary set of NFNCS 1 is 2 4-1 8 Complementary set of NFNCS 2 is 2 5-1 16 Complementary set of NFNCS 3 is 2 2-1 2 Complementary set of FNCS 1 is 2 1-1 1 Complementary set of FNCS 2 is 2 3-1 4 These complementary sets are all subsets of frequent neighboring class sets FNCS 1 or FNCS 2 and so the algorithm need not compute their support Step3, the algorithm generates 3-candidate frequent neighboring class set, and gains frequent neighboring class set as step1 Step4, the algorithm computes these complementary sets of 3-candidate frequent item sets as step2  C The method of computing support Accordingly to chapter A of III and digit logical operation we may gain this property as follows Property Let digit p and q express two right instances, let C p be a NCS denoted by p, let C q be a NCS denoted by q, then C p  C q  p & q=p This algorithm uses logical operation to compute support according to this property. The process is expressed as follows Suppose class set is expressed as C = {V, W, X, Y, Z there are 5 instances of neighboring class sets as follows No.1 right instance of NCS = {V 1 X 2 Y 3 Z 4  No.2 right instance of NCS = {V 2 X 3 Z 5  No.3 right instance of NCS = {W 1 X 5 Y 4 Z 3  No.4 right instance of NCS = {V 5 Y 2 Z 2  No.5 right instance of NCS = {X 4 Y 3 Z 1  Their digits denoting neighboring class set of right instance are expressed as {29, 21, 30, 25 and 28}. Suppose a candidate is 24 which is denoted by C-NCS = {Y, Z}, and then 29&24 24, 21&24  24, 30&24=24, 25&24=24, 28&24=24. Because of this, we write 4 to support \(C-NCS D The process of mining frequent neighboring class set Input 1\patial class set is denoted by C = {C 1 C 2  C m  2\ Instance set is denoted by I = {i 1 i 2  i n  3\The minimal distance is denoted by d 4\The minimal support is denoted by s Output: Frequent neighboring class set Step1, firstly, the algorithm computes the entire right instances denoted by Iê from instance set in spatial database as I by the minimal distance as d Step2, and then, building neighboring class set database as NCS after scanning once right instance set as Iê via the introductory method in chapter A of III Step3, using top-down search and complementation mining strategy to generate candidate frequent NCS according to this chapter B of III. Namely, there are two parts as follows Firstly, if a k-candidate is not subset of FNCS which saves frequent neighboring class set, and it is not superset of NFNCS which saves non-frequent neighboring class set, the algorithm will compute its support. If it is frequent neighboring class set and it is written to FNCS, otherwise, the algorithm will compute \(k-1\subset of k-candidate Secondly, the algorithm computes complementary set of kcandidate, if the complementary set is not subset of FNCS, and it is not superset of NFNCS, the algorithm will compute its support. If it is frequent neighboring class set, and it is written to FNCS, otherwise, it will be written to NFNCS Step4, repeating to execute step3 until search all frequent neighboring class set Step5, the algorithm outputs FNCS according to chapter A of III IV T HE A NALYSIS AND C OMPARING OF C APABILITY At present, there are very little documents of research frequent neighboring class set. Here we compare MFNCS as with CMFNCS which is introduced by this paper as follows A The Analysis of Capability MFNCS: this algorithm uses idea of Apriori to find frequent neighboring class set, which is made of three stages firstly, computing all the frequent 1-NCS, secondly, generating all the 2-NCS by range query, and generating all the k-NCS k>2\by iteration. The algorithm has some repeated computing and superfluous candidate frequent neighboring class set which gains some right instance of \(k+1\-neighboring class set only through connecting right instance of k-neighboring class set. As this algorithm adopts down-top strategy to generate candidate frequent neighboring class set, it is only suitable for mining short frequent neighboring class set CMFNCS: this algorithm uses top-down search and complementation mining strategy, which is suitable for mining not only short frequent neighboring class set, but also long frequent neighboring class set. The algorithm gains candidate frequent item sets not only by computing k-subset of \(k+1\-non 


frequent neighboring class set, but also by computing their complementary set. The mining algorithm computes support of candidate frequent neighboring class set by digit logical çand operation. The algorithm improves mining efficiency through these methods B The comparing of experimental result Now we use experiment to testify above analyses and comparison. Two mining algorithms are used to generate frequent neighboring class set from 12267 right instances whose class sets are expressed as digit from 3 to 8191 neighboring class set does not include any simple class, namely it has two classes at least, the number of spatial class set is denoted by m=13, the number of right instance included by these neighboring class set observe the discipline which is expressed as follows NCS of digit denoted by 8191 has one right instance NCS of digit denoted by 8190 has two right instances NCS of digit denoted by 8189 has one right instance NCS of digit denoted by 8188 has two right instances  Our experimental circumstances are expressed as follow Intel\(R\ Celeron\(R\ M CPU 420 1.60 GHz, 1GB, language of the procedure is Visual C# 2005.NET, OS is Windows XP Professional The experimental result of two algorithms is expressed as Fig.1, where support is absolute. The runtime of two algorithms is expressed as Fig.2 as support and length of neighboring class set change Figure 1 The experimental result      Figure 2 The comparing of runtime V C ONCLUSION This paper proposes an algorithm of complementation mining frequent neighboring class set, which is suitable for mining any frequent neighboring class set according to topdown search and complementation mining strategy. The result of experiment indicates that the algorithm is faster and more efficient than present algorithms when mining frequent neighboring class set in large spatial data A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was fully supported by science and technology research projects of Chongqing Education Commission Project No. KJ091108\nd it was also fully supported by science and technology research projects of Chongqing Three Gorges University \(Project No. 10QN-22, 24 and 30 R EFERENCES 1 M A  R.H P U Y  X  M a X  D   G I S S p at ial A sso ciat io n P a tte r n M i ng   Science Press, 2007 Beijing 2 M A  R.H H E Z  Y   Mi ni ng Co m p l e te and Co r r e c t F r e que nt  Neighboring Class Sets from Spatial Databases.

V C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have proposed an improved approach to extract frequent itemsets involving rare items to discover rare association rules In the proposed approach the minimum support for each item is calculated using the notion of 322support difference\323 The proposed approach dynamically assigns appropriate minimum support to each item so that frequent itemsets involving rare items can be extracted in a more ef\336cient manner as compared to the existing approaches Most important the proposed approach ensures that the difference between the support of an item and the corresponding minimum support remains constant for all items including rare items As a result it ef\336ciently reduces the explosion of frequent itemsets involving frequent items without affecting the extraction of frequent itemsets involving rare items We have evaluated the performance of the proposed approach by conducting experimental results on both synthetic and real world datasets The results show that as compared to existing approaches the proposed approach prunes frequent itemsets involving frequent items in a more ef\336cient manner and without missing the frequent itemsets involving rare items As a part of future work we are planning to investigate the following 200 200 The existing approaches extract frequent itemsets involving rare items by assigning minimum support to each item and employing an iterative process to discover frequent itemsets We are going to investigate how popular non-iterative approaches like frequent-pattern growth FPgrowth approaches can be extended to assign minimum support to each item to extract frequent itemsets involving rare items A CKNOWLEDGEMENT This work is supported by 322Nokia\323 Findland and 322Media Lab Asia\323 India The authors are thankful to the anonymous referees for their useful comments R EFERENCES  Melli G Osmar  R Z and Kitts B 322Introduction to the Special Issue on Successful Real-World Data Mining Applications.\323 SIGKDD Explorations Volume 8 Issue 1 2006  Agra w al R Imielinski T  and Sw ami A 322Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases.\323 SIGMOD 1993 pp 207-216  Agra w al R and Srikanth R 322F ast algorithms for mining association rules.\323 VLDB 1994  Xu R 322Surv e y of Clustering Algorithms 323 IEEE T ransactions on Neural Networks Volume 16 Number 3 May 2005  W eiss S and K ulik o wski C A 322Computer Systems that Learn Classi\336cation and Prediction Methods from Statistics Neural Nets Machine Learning and Expert Systems.\323 Morgan Kaufmann 1991  W eiss G M 322Mining W ith Rarity A Unifying Frame w ork 323 SIGKDD Explorations 2004 Vol 6 Issue 1 pp 7 19  J ia wei H Jian P  Y iwen Y  and Run ying M 322Mining Frequent Patterns without Candidate Generation A Frequent-Pattern Tree Approach*.\323 DMKD 2004 pp 53-87  Rajanish D and Amb uj M 322F ast Frequent P attern Mining in RealTime.\323 CSI 2005 pp 156 167  Mannila H 322Methods and Problems in Data Mining 323 ICDT  1997  Liu B Hsu W  and Ma Y  322Mining Association Rules with Multiple Minimum Supports.\323 SIGKDD Explorations 1999  Y un H Ha D Hw ang B and Ryu K H 322Mining association rules on signi\336cant rare data using relative support.\323 The Journal of Systems and Software 67 2003 pp 181-191  Hahsler  M 322 A Model-Based Frequenc y Constraint for Mining Associations from Transaction Data.\323 DMKD Springer Science and Business Media 2006 pp 137-166  Zhou L and Y au S 322 Association Rule and Quantitati v e Association Rule Mining among Infrequent Items.\323 MDM 2007 pp 156-167  Hipp J Guntzer  U Nakhaeizadeh G 322 Algorithms for Association Rule Mining A General Survey and Comparision.\323 SIGKDD 2000 Volume 2 Issue 1 pp 50-64.\325  Lee W  Stolfo S and Mok K W  322Mining audit data to b uild intrusion detection models.\323 SIGKDD 1998  T an P  and K umar  V  322Interestingness Measures for Association Patterns  A Perspective\323 SIGKDD 2002  Ross S M 322Introductory Statistics\323 Second Edition Mor g an kaufmann publishers 2005 In this paper we have investigated how to improve the performance of extracting frequent itemsets involving rare items After extracting frequent itemsets association rules are discovered by 336xing the same minimum con\336dence value for all the rules As a part of future work we are going to investigate appropriate methodology for assigning con\336dence values in a dynamic manner to generate rare association rules in an ef\336cient manner 


on the number of lters the total cost is dominated by the candidate ltering cost which explains the latter increase Among all of the tested cases the total cost is the smallest when f is 3  conﬁrming our derivation in Section IV-D C Effect of Data Skewness We conduct experiments to evaluate the effect of data skewness on the performance of netFilter Figure 7\(a and b show the results under different 003 values data skewness with n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We adopt the optimal setting for netFilter obtained from similar experiments as in the above two subsections the lter size is set to 100 and the number of lters is set to 3 and 5 under n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We include the communication cost incurred by the naive approach for comparison For readability the y-axis is on log scale From these gures we can see that the cost incurred by netFilter is much smaller than that incurred by the naive approach For instance with n as 10 6 thecost incurred by netFilter is only 2  5 of that incurred by the naive approach In addition the cost incurred by both netFilter and the naive approach decreases with the data skewness For netFilter this is explained by the improved ltering performance under very skewed data For the naive approach as the data skewness increases the average number of distinct items that a peer propagates along the hierarchy is reduced resulting in reduced communication cost 1000 10000 100000 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness 001  netFilter  naive  1000 10000 100000 1e+06 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness

Figure 8 shows the results with 002 set to 0  1  0  01 and 0  001  Again we adopt the optimal setting for netFilter the size of lter and number of lters are set to 10 6 under 002  0.1 100 5 under 002  0.01 and 1000 2 under 002 0  001  From this gure we can see when the threshold ratio incr eases the communication cost decreases This is as expected since larger threshold implies less number of items satisﬁes the threshold condition VI C ONCLUSION The need of identifying frequent items IFI appears in a variety of P2P applications In this study we investigate the problem of IFI in unstructured P2P

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
