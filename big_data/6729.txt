  New Application of Association Rules in Teaching Evaluation System  Lanfang Lou, Qingxian Pan, Xiuqin Qiu Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Yantai University Yantai, China, 264006 Loulanfang@126.COM pqx@ytu.edu.cn  Abstract Data mining is the process of finding correlations or patterns among dozens of fields in large relational databases In this paper we propose a novel association rules for data mining to improve the famous algorithm Apriori. The proposed approach uses the intersection operation to generate frequent item sets. It is different from the existing algorithm as it scans the database only one time and then uses the database to mine association rules. The proposed technique has been implemented in a teaching evaluation system, to enhance the foundation in performance evaluation for staff in teaching issues Keyword-data dining, association rules; Apriori algorithm teaching evaluation I   I NTRODUCTION  Data mining is a kind of process of decision support. It gets the potential and useful information and acknowledges from practical application data which is large, incomplete noisy, ambiguous and random. Data mining relates to extracting a large of data from database, transforming analyzing and modeling handling these data, and withdrawing the critical data to aid decision making. Mining association rules is an important issue in data mining R Agrawal et al in 1993 proposed the famous the Apriori algorithm based on frequent item set [2, 3 th en the m o s t  algorithms are all based on the basic algorithm for improvements or derivative variant of  the algorithm [4 , 5  An improved association rule is proposed in this paper which uses the intersection operation to generate frequent item sets. The method can be easily realized using SQL language, which lays the basis of enhancing the performance of mining algorithm based on association rules This algorithm only needs to scan the database one time and then uses it to mine association rules in teaching evaluation system, which provides effective foundation to the scientificity of the teaching evaluation II  DATA  MINING  ANALYSIS  METHOD  BASED  ON  ASSOCIATIONRULE A  Association Rules The mining of association rules is the important research direction of data mining area. Association rules reflect the inherent correlation among data. To find the inherent correlation of data is helpful to maker to make correct and reasonable decision. Association rules model belongs to description model, and using the algorithm to find association rules belongs to unsupervised learning methods The data mining of association can be formal described, as shown in the follows Let I={i1, i2,ƒ, im}, which is a collection consisting of of m different items. Given a transaction database D, and among it, every transaction T is a collection of a group items of I, namely T I, T has the unique identifier TID. An association rule is an implication formula such as X=>Y and X I, Y I, XY=. The conditions of association rules to set up are It has the support degree S, namely at least there are S transactions in transaction database which contain X Y  It has confidence level C, namely in all the transactions containing X of transaction database D, there are at least C% transactions which contain Y too The basic task of association rules is to mine the strong rules \(rules with high support degree and confidence level which are called strong rules\t mining association rules can be divided into two phases [6   1  m i ning bi g ite m  collection, the transaction support degree S is higher than the pre-determined minimum threshold item. \(2\ using big item collection to produce the association rules whose confidence level C is higher than the pre-determined minimum threshold item in the database. The whole performance of mining association rules is decided by the first phase. After determining a big item collection, the corresponding association rules can be derived. So the key to improve association rule for data mining algorithm is to effectively calculate big item collection B  Apriori Algorithm Apriori [7, 8 i s an algorith m to calc ul at e the sp eci f i c  length of item collection of the given database. Apriori calculates the frequent item sets in the database iteratively level by level, the calculation in i-th iteration provides all the i-item frequent item sets  An improved Apriori is proposed in this paper. It needs to scan the database only one time and create a logo for each data item list. The support of frequent item sets is obtained I nternational Conference on Computer and Information Application ICCIA 2010 13  C 978-1-4244-8598-7 /10/$26.00      2010 IEEE 


  by logo list intersection. This can reduce the scanning times The method can be easily realized by using SQL language III  IMPROVED  APRIORI  ALGORITHM The improved algorithm is mainly improved when generating frequent item sets. The main idea is based on the intersection operation Definition 1 Lk*Lk={p q, and p q  Lk,p.item1 q.item1,ƒ, p.itemk-1 = q.itemk-1, p.itemk<q.itemk}         \(1 When k=1, the operator expresses single connection For example :suppose L2={BC,BD},Support set of itemset {BC} is{002,003,004,006}, Support set of itemset BD} is {002,003,004,006},According to according  to definition 1 we can get L2*L2={002,003,004} without scanning database A  Description of Improved Apriori Algorithm[10  L 1 large 1-sets  L 1 is made up of itemset , tset set and support  for  k 2 Lk 1     k  do   Ck gen Lk 1  k length frequent itemsets are generated  end Answer k Lk   Function gen\(\ is Lk-1 as input, and the results can be directly generated k-item frequent item sets. Function Gen  is as follows  Function Gen Lk 1   Ck  Lk 1.Itemset Lk 1.Itemset candidates are generate according  to definition 1  Tk  Lk 1.Tset Lk 1.Tset for all candidates c   Ck  do   c support=Count c  Tk  If c support < minsup then  delete c  end  end  B  Applications We use table I as an example to illustrate the algorithm TABLE I  A SIMPLE  TRANSACTION  DATABASE Tran saction ID Itemset 001 A, C, D 002 A, B, C, D, E 003 B, C, D 004 A, B, C, F 005 D, E, F 006 B, C, D, F  This algorithm only needs to scan the database once then create the following database tables II According to table II, we can calculate the elements number of each row \(that is transaction support number then delete those itemsets whose support number are less than that of a given threshold support of items set. And thus 1-item frequent itemsets are got. In table II, itemset {E} is canceled because of its support number is 2,which is less than the given threshold TABLE II  N EW  CREATION  DATABASE  Itemset Support Set A  001,002,004  B  002,003,004,006  C  001,002,003,004,006  D  001,002,003,005,006  E  002,005  F  004,005,006  According to the one length of large itemsets, support set of itemset uses intersection operation between each other and calculate the row number of elements, then delete those whose support are less than a given threshold support of items set. And two length of large itemsets are got TABLE III  O NE LENGTH OF LARGE ITEM SETS  Itemset Support Set Support A  001,002,004  3 B  002,003,004,006  4 C  001,002,003,004,006  5 D  001,002,003,005,006  5 F  004,005,006  3 TABLE IV  T WO  LENGTH  OF  LARGE ITEMSETS  Itemset Support Set Support A,C  001,002,004  3 B,C  002,003,004,006  4 B,D  002,003,006  3 C,D  001,002,003 006  4 According to the two length of large itemsets, we can get three length of large itemsets TABLE V  T HREE  LENGTH  OF  LARGE  ITEM SETS  Itemset Support Set Support B,C,D  002,003 006  3 There is only one three length of large item sets, so algorithm ends IV  THE  APPLICATION  OF  IMPROVED  ALGORITHM  IN  THE  TEACHING  EVALUATION  SYSTEM   Teaching evaluation is a process of value judgment and improvement to teaching effect and the realization degree of teaching target according to the teaching target and teaching I nternational Conference on Computer and Information Application ICCIA 2010 14

5.3 Hybrid Counting Plugging together the Monte Carlo framework with the Markov chains M F  001  we already have an approximation algorithm As indicated in Section 5.1 we have to count a starting factor 026 s exhaustively It remains to decide to what value s should be set—a decision that requires some analysis of the involved time complexities For that we regard one frequency check as unit step We will drop 017 from the parameter lists of trials  001  and steps  001  for ease of notation as it is constant throughout one call of the algorithm Estimating 026 i requires at most trials  s  steps  i  frequency checks On the other hand counting jF s j exhaustively can take up to 2 s frequency checks in case all subsets of E s are frequent This rough bound can be used to make an initial choice for s by choosing it such that it minimizes the estimated overall running time 2 s  T apx  s  with T apx  s   trials  s  n X i  s 1 steps  i  denoting the expected time for approximating all remaining factors Clearly more knowledge about the used implementations—in particular that of the exhaustive miner—is likely to lead to an improvement of this choice Additionally we can further improve our choice of the starting index s  Denote the index found by the considerations above as s 003  The loose a priori bound used there can be improved once we have counted F s 003  We know that jF s 003 1 n F s 003 j 024 jF s 003 j see Equation 3 Thus in case jF s 003 j  T apx  s 003  000 T apx  s 003  1 we can increase s to s 003  1 and add jF s 003 1 n F s 003 j counted exhaustively to jF s j  Clearly as long as the above condition remains true for the new s it amortizes to repeat this step The resulting algorithm counts F s for the 002nal s chunkwise as jF s j  jF s 003 j  jF s 003 1 n F s 003 j  001 001 001  jF s n F s 000 1 j  For the exhaustive counting tasks it is desirable to use one of the existing highly optimized frequent set listing algorithm Let Dj i denote the dataset in which all transactions have been restricted to the 002rst i items Observe that jF  D  f e s g  j s 000 1  j is equal to jF s  D  n F s 000 1  D  j  Thus one external call of the exhaustive miner with the dataset D  f e s g  j s 000 1 suf\002ces to compute the latter quantity This concludes the presentation of techniques used in our counting procedure A 002nal pseudocode incorporating all ideas is given with Algorithm 1 Using the heuristic steps  k   017 000 1 k ln k it performs O 000 017 000 3 n 2 ln n 001 frequency checks Algorithm 1 Hybrid Frequent Set Counting Input  dataset D on items E  f e 1      e n g  frequency threshold f 2 f 1      jDjg  accuracy 017 2 0   Require M F k mixes in steps  k  Output  q with P 1 000 017  jFj 024 q 024 1 017  jFj  025 3  4 1 exhaustive phase 2 s  argmin s 0 024 n 2 s 0  T apx  s 0  3 S  exhaustive  Dj s  f  4 while S  T apx  s  000 T apx  s  1 do 5 S  S  exhaustive  D  f e s 1 g  j s  f  6 s  s  1 7 approximative phase 8 for k  s  1      n do 9 026 k  0 10 for i  1      trials  s 017  do 11 F  M steps  k  F k    12 if e k 62 F then 026 k  026 k  1 13 026 k  026 k  trials  s 017  14 return S Q n i  s 026 000 1 i 6 Evaluation In this section we present experiments contrasting the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm with counting via exhaustive enumeration The experiments are performed with respect to performance as well as accuracy  017  0  5 was used throughout all experiments As a representative exhaustive miner we used the modi\002ed FPgrowth algorithm by Grahne and Zhu whose C implementation is publicly available This implementation has shown to rank among the fastest exhaustive miners in the competitive workshop FIMI In the follo wing we will refer to this implementation as F P Z HU  The benchmark datasets are also taken from the FIMI repository supplemented by synthetic datasets generated according to the beginner's guide process Example 2 with different choices for the probabilities p a and p c  For Algorithm 1 we used a Java implementation that is available online together with the arti\002cial datasets  http://www-kd.iai.unibonn.de/index.php?page=people details&id=16 or corresponding main page The experiments were performed on an Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 with 3 GB of RAM running Windows XP All 002gures below use relative frequency thresholds 6.1 A Note on the Implementation The central part of Algorithm 1 is a large number of Markov chain simulations As a 002rst optimization it is possible to do better than just simulating M F k for k

s  1      n naively Instead we 002rst buffer the required number steps  k  of random item indices for a single random walk Since the result of each random walk F is only used to evaluate the Bernoulli experiment of whether item e k is an element of F  we can simply stop the Markov chain simulation after the last occurrence of k in the buffer Similar if e k was put into F due to the next to last occurrence of k we can also stop the chain simulation at that point Since in this case the last occurrence of k will surely cause the item e k to be removed from F again we can directly report that result The really dominant operation however is the test of whether a set I  F  f e g that is an augmentation of a frequent set F with a single item e remains frequent This corresponds to step 4 of the Markov chain see Section 5.2 Since this test has to be performed roughly every second step of each random walk it is crucial for the overall performance of our algorithm In order to decrease the cost of this operation our implementation makes use of FP-trees  Basically  an FP-t ree is a compact representation of the dataset where the transactions in the original dataset are represented as paths in a pre\002x-tree Since overlapping transactions share a branch-pre\002x this usually achieves a signi\002cant compression In addition there are node lists connecting all nodes representing the same item The frequency test for a set is done by selecting its least frequent item and following its node list in the FP-tree adding the counts of all nodes whose parent nodes include all items in the set I  As a minor optimization we have stored at each node a hash set containing the items in the parent nodes While this information is redundant it allows to ef\002ciently determine if a node contributes to the frequency of I  6.2 Accuracy We now report a series of accuracy experiments that are summarized in Figure 2 Our algorithm was applied 100 dataset median low quart max dev failed BMS-POS 0.004 0.004 0.05 0 BMW-Web 0.003 0.003 0.109 0 chess 0.106 0.159 0.56 0.0025 connect 0.092 0.169 0.49 0 mushroom 0.061 0.089 0.24 0 pumsb 0.139 0.297 1.05 0.07 pumsb-star 0.044 0.146 0.372 0 PC60PA13 0.029 0.043 0.139 0 Figure 2 deviation from exact solution times to each combination of one of eight test datasets with one of four frequency thresholds resulting in a total of 3200 runs per dataset A run fails if the reported result deviates from the true number of frequent sets by more than 50 as we used 017  0  5 as accuracy parameter If the overall approximation guarantee holds we expect the fraction of failed runs to be below 1  4 Equation 1 As desired this was the case on all of the eight test datasets In fact in our experiments the highest ratio of failed runs was 0  07 for the pumsb dataset Thus the observed success rate was consistent with the probabilistic approximation guarantee for all datasets and in fact we experienced much better error bounds The table also shows median median lower quartile low quart and maximum max dev of the experienced relative deviation Figure 3 accuracy on chess Figure 3 shows accuracy results on chess in more detail For different frequency thresholds it shows on a logarithmic scale the exact number of sets exact count computed exhaustively the upper and lower 50 deviation limits upper limit and lower limit as well as the result of the randomized algorithm in a series of 16 runs mcmc count The 002gure shows that in most randomized runs the approximated result lies in the desired deviation interval The 002gure does not contain the exact number of sets for the lowest thresholds because these could not be computed by the exhaustive miner We close this subsection by presenting an approximated frequency plot computed for a dataset generated by the example process from Section 2 We refer to this dataset as PC60PA10  because it is an instantiation of this general process with probabilities p c  0  6 and p a  0  1  The result is shown in Figure 4 together with the exact curve and illustrates that the randomized algorithm provides an adequate approximation of the exact plot 6.3 Runtime Next we compare the runtime of our randomized algorithm with that of F P Z HU on several datasets We start with

Figure 4 frequency plot for PC60PA10 counting is infeasible That said on sparse datasets it is hard to compete with the sophisticated and highly ef\002cient frequent set mining algorithm and implementations the data mining community has emerged during the last decade Future Work There are several possible optimizations for Algorithm 1 we did not investigate in this paper For instance in order to speed up frequency tests in subsequent Markov chain simulations it appears to be promising to store maximal frequent sets as well as minimal infrequent sets as they are visited Furthermore the method proposed in this work is not directly optimized towards drawing a frequency-plot i.e it does not bene\002t from the situation when there is more than one frequency threshold for which FREQUENT SETS has to be solved This setting has room for extensive performance improvements that should be explored in future research Some straightforward observations are Exhaustive miners clearly do bene\002t from this situation as they can build up the whole plot by just one run with the lowest involved frequency threshold Similar the Monte Carlo algorithm can acquire a lower bound for F i  f   F i 1  f  already while sampling from F i 1  f 000 1 during the run for threshold f 000 1  Improved lower bounds can then be used to reduce the number of trials for their corresponding factor 026 i  There is another possible speed-up along these lines that is applicable in the single threshold case as well Deriving empirical bounds on the variance of each factor would also allow to reduce the required number of trials On a more global scale an important next step is to investigate whether the randomized counting approach can be extended to other pattern classes like closed sets or graph mining This extension promises to be both challenging and bene\002cial as the cost of exhaustive mining generally increases with the pattern complexity Acknowledgment The authors wish to thank Thomas G  artner for the helpful insights he provided them into Markov chains References  R Bayardo B Goethals and M J Zaki editors Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations 2004  volume 126 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings  CEUR-WS.org 2004  A Bernstein F  Pro v ost and S Hill T o w ard intelligent assistance for a data mining process An ontology-based approach for cost-sensitive classi\002cation IEEE Trans on Knowl and Data Eng  17\(4 2005  M Bole y  On approximating minimum infrequent and maximum frequent sets In Discovery Science  pages 68–77 2007  F  Geerts B Goethals and J V  D Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans Database Syst  30\(2 2005  G Grahne and J Zhu Ef 002ciently using pre\002x-trees in mining frequent itemsets In FIMI'03 Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  2003  D Gunopulos R Khardon H Mannila S Saluja H T oi v onen and R S Sharma Discovering all most speci\002c sentences ACM Trans Database Syst  28\(2 2003  J Han and M Kam ber  Data Mining Concepts and Techniques  Morgan Kaufmann 2000  M Jerrum and A Sinclair  The mark o v chain monte carlo method an approach to approximate counting and integration In Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems  pages 482–520 PWS Publishing Co Boston MA USA 1997  M R Jerrum  L G V aliant and V  V  V azirani Random generation of combinatorial structures from a uniform distribution Theor Comput Sci  43\(2-3 1986  R M Karp M Luby  and N Madras Monte-carlo approximation algorithms for enumeration problems J Algorithms  10\(3 1989  S Khot Ruling out ptas for graph min-bisecti on densest subgraph and bipartite clique In Foundations of Computer Science  pages 136–145 Washington DC USA 2004 IEEE Computer Society  K Morik and M  Scholz The miningmart approach In GI Jahrestagung  pages 811–818 2002  J Pei and J Han Can we push more constraints into frequent pattern mining In KDD  pages 350–354 2000  D Randall Rapidly mixing mark o v chains with applications in computer science and physics Computing in Science and Engineering  8\(2 2006  L G V aliant The comple xity of computing the permanent Theor Comput Sci  8:189–201 1979  J W ang J Han Y  Lu and P  Tzv etk o v  TFP An ef 002cient algorithm for mining top-k frequent closed itemsets IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng  17\(5 2005  D Zuck erman On unapproximable v ersi ons of np-complete problems SIAM J Comput  25\(6 1996

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con“gurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con“gure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef“ciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/˜manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
