4/3 and 5/1 of Sa school located in Nan province, Thailand during the first semester of 2011. We applied both statistics and data mining techniques for data analysis to determine the effects of Facebook usages for education on students' learning skills Statistics was used to evaluate the correlation between students Facebook usage and grade point averages, and a data mining technique was used to learn association rules from data. This project has helped us learn the effects of using social media web 
applications \(i.e., Facebook applications\ for education on student-learning performance. We found that examining the ratio of number of Facebook posts and comments for educational purposes to the one for non-educational purposes could help us draw a conclusion that Facebook usage does have an impact on students' learning performances.  Specifically, we found that students who spent more time on education-related posting and commenting earned better grades than the ones who did the 
opposite. Furthermore, as we have to group data to change numerical data to nominal data, we found that data grouping play an important role on the number of rules and their associated confidence values. Too loose and too tight data grouping might be the reason the Association Rule algorithm derives few rules with high confidence values. We hope the results can help learners and teachers realize the advantages disadvantages and effects of using social media web application

I NTRODUCTION  Driven by the advancement of the Internet and mobile computing, social media is a popular communication form that allows accesses to and from users throughout the world Facebook, by providing easy-to-use web services \(such as posting news, sharing knowledge and entertaining media\and a very convenient way to reach other users, is considered one of the top social networking technologies. As of October 4 th  2012, it had registered 1 billion users [1 2013, th ere are  18.2 million Facebook users in Thailand, 43% of which are 
students at ages between 6 and 24 Due to Facebook\222s popularity and its service varieties including seemingly instant access to its users, many attempt to utilize Facebook to serve their certain interest, especially in academic areas. Many instructors apply Facebook as a tool for communicating with their students. To the best of our knowledge, there is no research study on quantitative effects of using Facebook in classes. Altho ugh Face book appears useful for connecting with students, it can result in an adverse effect. This is due to the same fact that Facebook provides various types of web applications including games and others for entertainments. These services could easily distract students from their studies. If students are unaware of this unfavorable side and are obsessed with using Facebook for only non-academic purposes, Facebook usage in class could worsen their studying performance instead In this paper, we studied the effects of using Facebook as 
a supplemental educational tool on students\222 learning performances. We investigated relationships between various Facebook activities and students\222 performance s in classes Related work is discussed in Section II. We describe our research method, including collecting, preparing, and analyzing data, in Section III. We discuss our findings from a simple correlation method and an association rule method in Section IV. In Section V, we conclude our paper and suggest future work II.

questionnaire analysis. Bunloet [9 aly zed F acebook us a g e by college students in Thailand There were many previous works discussing how teachers could utilize specific new technologies for educations. Block 10 su gg ested u s ing T w itter i n cla ssroo m s  P h illl ips et al 1 1   suggested 7 ways educators could use Facebook for their students. Ractham and Firpo [12 su gg ested a  w a y to e n h a nce learning by using Facebook as a learning resource for learners to share and generate tacit knowledge within a small group environment. Saikaew et al. [13 stated th at Faceb o o k co u l d b e  used as an educational tool for both formal and informal education. They studied the Facebook usage among undergraduate and graduate students in Khon Kaen University, Thailand, and a group of mothers sharing breast feeding information. As a tool for formal education instructors usually create a Facebook group for learners to share class information, questi ons, and answers, while document management is usually done by other means, such as Moodle or Google Drive services. Similarly, as a tool for informal education, Facebook users may create a special learning group sharing a common interest, e.g., a group to share information related to breast feeding of Thai mothers The paper found that by using Facebook as a learning tool learners were more enthusiastic about learning and more comfortable to ask questions and share knowledge. Moreover instructors could quickly provide answers and feedbacks to learners. The work demonstrated that Facebook had a great potential to supplement other learning tools Although the works [11-13 m e n tio n e d ab ov e h a v e  studied the effects of using Facebook on learners\222  performance, their conclusions were based only on subjective perceptions of students via qu estionnaire, not a quantitative metric such as a Grade Point Aver age \(GPA\ this paper, we extended their works to examine relationships between students\222 class performance \(GPA\ and using Facebook as an educational tool. This is to provide numerical evidences on how Facebook usage, as a learning tool, affects learners\222  performance in a formal education III. R ESEARCH M ETHOD  In order to find the effects of using Facebook on students\222 learning performance, we divided our tasks into three steps 1  We collected data from classes that actually adopted Facebook as a supplementary tool 2  We prepared data for analysis by cleaning data interpreting and converting messages into numerical values, and converting numerical values to nominal ones 3  We analyzed data to find relationships using two methods: simple correlation and association rule learning We describe each step in details in the following subsections A  Data Collection We collected Facebook usage data from Facebook groups used for classes in a high school in Nan province, Thailand during the first semester of 2011. Facebook groups were used for class discussions by instructors and students in grade 10 and 11. We collected data from 98 students in three classrooms: room 4/1, room 4 3 and room 5/1. Each data instance consists of a stu dent\222s GPA and several attributes related to Facebook activities described in Table I From the table, the important attributes are posts comments, average duration in which a student replied to a post, and a student\222s GPA. A post is an initiative message published on a Facebook group, while a comment is a reply to a post. We read and interpreted each post and comment and categorized it as related to class or not related to class. We collected 757 posts \(490 class-related and 267 non-classrelated\d 1984 comments \(800 class-related and 1184 nonclass-related\ total B  Data Preparation We prepared data for analysis as follows. From collected data, we filtered out posts and comments from teachers and students who did not enroll in a class. Because we were interested in studying the relationships between a student\222s  GPA and the student\222s Facebook activities, we only selected posts and comments from students whom we had access to their GPA information For data analysis, we aimed to use simple correlation and Association Rule learning techniques to learn of relationships in our data. Both techniques require data that are non-text Therefore, we needed to transform text data into quantitative data, i.e. numbers of activities and durations between activities. As mentioned earlier, we did this by first reading each post and comment, and then categorizing it as related to class or not related to class. Then we gathered counts of posts and comments in the corresponding categories for further analysis T ABLE I: A TTRIBUTE DESCRIPTION FOR COLLECTED DATA FROM CLASSES  Attributes Descriptions ID Student ID Post \(PT Number of total posts made by a student Post_Yes \(PY Number of posts related to classes made by a student Post_No \(PN Number of posts NOT related to classes made by a student Comment \(CT Number of total comments made by a student Comment_Yes \(CY Number of comments related to classes made by a student Comment_No \(CN Number of comments NOT related to classes made by a student PC_Total \(PCT Number of total posts and comments Avg_Comment \(ACD Average duration \(in seconds\ of comments made by a student after someone\222s posts GPA Student\222s Grade Point Average \(GPA  88 


For the simple correlation method, we removed the attributes ID, Post, and Comment. A student ID does not contribute to a student\222s GPA. Post is a sum of Post_Yes and Post_No, while Comment is the sum of Comment_Yes and Comment_No; including Post and Comment would be redundant to the other attributes In order to apply an Association Rule algorithm, we needed to transform numerical values into nominal ones ranges of numbers of posts and comments and ranges of GPAs\for each attribute. As there were several alternatives for dividing our numerical data into ranges \(or groups\we experimented with three clustering methods: K-mean, T-score and Normalized-T. We applied these methods to determine groups of values in each attribute and compared sets of association rules obtained from these different attribute groupings. We would prefer using a method producing ranges of values, which can reveal association rules with the highest confidence. The results of this experiment will be discussed in section IV We proposed a Clustering Index \(CI\ metric to measure the quality of our ranges produced from the above three clustering methods. A CI value indicates how well data are grouped together. It is defi ned as the ratio of the average distances among group centroids to the average distances between group members and their associated centroid. The higher a CI, the closer group members are and the further a group is away from each other. Intuitively, we would prefer groups with a higher CI beca use there is a clear cut between groups. However, we found in our preliminary results that grouping with low CIs sometimes provides association rules with higher confidence values. To see the effects of CI levels on confidence values of association rules, we also studied the differences in confidence values of association rules derived from data groups with different CI levels We defined four sets of CIs: lower, low, high, and higher CIs, for each attribute. For ex ample, we may cluster PCT data into one, two, three, four, or five value ranges \(or groups Clustering the data into 3 groups yields the highest CI, while clustering the data into only one group yields a lowest one Therefore, for attribute PCT, clustering data into three groups would belong to the higher CI s et, and clustering data into one group would belong to the lower CI set \(as shown in Table 2 Then we calculated the Average Clustering Index \(ACI\over all attributes of each CI set, yielding the ACIs of 2.82, 3.64 5.52, and 6.03. For example, in a set with ACI equals to 2.82 there are two groups for the attribute PY_PN, three groups for CY_CN, one group for PC_Total \(PCT\ree groups for Avg_Comment \(ACD\he ACI of a nominal value set lower, low, high, or higher\e sum of CIs for each attribute divided by the number of attribute as in the equation below    1 In this equation, D is the number of attributes in the data set and CI is a Clustering Index va lue of a given clustering of an attribute. For each data set with a corresponding CI level in Table 2, we learn a ssociation rules and compares overall rules\222 confidence values. We would prefer the ACI group that yields more rules with higher confidence. The experiment results are discussed in section IV C  Data Analysis As mentioned before, we analyze data using two methods simple correlation and association rule. In the simple correlation method, we calculated correlation coefficients between pairs of students\222 GPAs and each activity attribute For example, we found correlation coefficients between GPA and Post_Yes, GPA and Comment_No, and GPA and Avg_Comment. Simple correlation coefficient can be calculated by using the following equation   2 Denote r as a correlation coefficient, N as the number of instances, and X and Y are data points of two attributes. We were looking for correlation coefficient values higher than 0.6 or lower than -0.6 in order to indicate a strong relationship between GPA and other attributes In the association rule derivation, we ran the Apriori algorithm on our nominal data to obtain association rules with the minimum rule support of 10% and the minimum confidence of 60%. An exam ple of an association rule obtained by the algorithm is below  A = 0 20\& \(B = 0 C = 3.00 4.00  3  We interpret the above rule as follows. If A is between 0 and 20, and B is between 0 and 30, then C is between 3.00 and 4.00. A rule support is a proportion of instances in a data set in which the A part is true and the B part is true. We can find a rule support by using the following equation  Support\(A,B Instances in which A and B parts are both true All Instances 4  T ABLE II  N UMBERS OF GROUPS OF ATTRIBUTE VALUES YIELDING THE GIVEN A VERAGE C LUSTERING I NDEX ACI Attributes Number of  value ranges \(or groups Lower ACI 2.82 Low ACI 3.64 High ACI   5.52   Higher A CI  6.03 PY_PN 2 2 3 3 CY_CN 3 3 2 2 PCT  1 4 5 3 ACD  3 4 5 2  89 


Confidence tells how firm the rule is supported by the data Higher confidence indicates that given a set of rule support there are a higher proportion of instances in the support set matching the rule. Therefore, we would prefer rules with high confidence \(close to 1\. Confidence of a rule is defined as follows  Confidence\(A,B=>C Instances in which A, B, C parts are all true Instances in which A and B parts are both true 5 After obtaining rules, we examined the rules with corresponding confidence values to see whether they are meaningful. The discussion abou t the derived rules is in the next section IV. R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSIONS  We discuss results of our experiments and analysis in this section. We begin with the results of the simple correlation Then we discuss results of the association rule experiments which include the clustering experiments D  Simple Correlation We found that correlations between individual Facebook activities and GPAs are quite weak. In Table III, we can see that the highest correlation value is 0.414, which is the correlation value between the number of Post_Yes \(PY\ and GPAs of student in Room 4/3 as well as the correlation value between the Average_Comment \(ACD\ and GPAs of student in Room 4/1. Most correlation values are around 0.2 or below Therefore, we conclude that an individual attribute does not correlate with GPA: an individual Facebook activity cannot be used to reflect student\222 learning performance  As the simple correlation method considers only an effect from a single attribute, we then study further to see how more Facebook activity attributes jointly affect students\222 GPAs Next, we experimented with the Association Rule method which can learn of relationships among several data attributes E  Association Rules 1  Data Clustering Before we derived association rules, we needed to convert numerical data into nominal data as explained in section III We experimented with 3 grouping methods: K-Mean, T-score and Normalized-T. We found that top rules from K-means achieved the confidence of 1 although rules from the two other grouping methods also achieved relatively high confidence Table IV illustrates these confidence values We can see that the top ten rules of K-means can all achieve the confidence value of 1. The top ten rules from the Normalized-T method can achieve the confidence values of 0.77 or more, while those from the T-score method can achieve little lesser confidence values of 0.67 or more. Since association rules generated from attribute values grouped by the K-means method can achieve the highest confidence values, and K-means is relatively simple to work with, we used the nominal data set obtained by using the K-means clustering method for the remaining experiments To choose an appropriate CI, we examined confidence values of rules obtained by applying the Apriori algorithm on each associated ACI set \(shown in Table II\ Fig. 1 illustrates the cumulative distribution function \(CDF\ these confidence values of different ACI sets. We plot the CDF on the y-axis and rule confidence on X-axis. If a graph slowly rises, there are a high proportion of rules with high confidence values. In contrast, if a graph quickly rises at low confidence values, there are a high proportion of rules with low confidence values  T ABLE III  S IMPLE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN F ACEBOOK ACTIVITIES AND GPA S  Classroom PY PN CY CN PCT ACD Room 4/1 0.027 0.015 0.071 0.182 0.018 0.414 Room 4/3 0.414 0.338 0.309 0.272 0.332 0.017 Room 5/1 0.383 0.292 0.101 0.030 0.112 0.034 Room_All 0.268 0.044 0.193 0.208 0.049 0.057  T ABLE IV  C ONFIDENCE VALUES OF RULES LEARNED FROM DATA GROUPED USING THREE CLUSTERING METHODS  Confidence Value K-means  T-score  NormalizedT 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0.83  0.79  0.79  0.77  0.73  0.73  0.68  0.67  0.67  0.67  0.92 0.92 0.92 0.91 0.91 0.85 0.79 0.78 0.77 0.77   Fig. 1  CDF of confidence values of rules learned from data set of different ACIs  0.00 20.00 40.00 60.00 80.00 100.00 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 CDF Confidence values ACI on confidence values Lower ACI Low ACI High ACI Higher ACI 90 


As we can see, grouping sets of higher and lower ACIs generate a higher proportion of rules with low confidence compared to those of low and hi gh ACIs. Grouping set of high ACI yields a rule set with the highest portion of rules with high confidence, since its graph rises the slowest. Therefore using the data set with the high ACIs is suitable for our purpose 2  Associate Rules using No n-Ratio Attributes The top five rules are shown in Table V. For example, rule 1 says that if the number of Post is between 0 and 5, then a GPA will be between 2.20 and 2.89. Rule 2 says that if the number of Post_Yes is between 0 and 9, then a GPA will be between 2.20 and 2.89. We can see that, in this rule list, there is only one group of GPAs associating with Facebook activity attributes, GPA = 2.20-2.89. This could mislead us that students with higher or lower GPA ranges might not have Facebook activity patterns with high confidence. For these top rules, we investigated the data and observed that the levels of Facebook activities \(the number of posts and comments\are low. So it could mean that students with GPAs in the range of 2.20-2.89 generally have low activities on Facebook Additionally, we noticed that there is only one attribute associated with each top rule. Rules with combined attributes start to appear after the eighth rule \(not shown in the table We were wondering whether these rules were too simple. In any case, after examining our data set more closely, we found that students with higher GPAs tends to have roughly higher numbers of posts and comments related to classes than not related to classes. As a result, we conducted more experiment with a new set of attributes: ratios of posts and comments related to classes over those no t related to classes, namely PY_PN and CY_CN 3  Association Rules usin g Ratio Attributes Interestingly, after we replaced attributes \(i.e., PY, PN CY, and CN\with the ratio attributes \(i.e., PY_PN and CY_CN\he Apriori algorithm, output rules were changed considerably. In Table VI most rules are for students in the highest-grade group, GPA = 2.90-4.00. We can see that our prior observation was confirmed; the ratios of activities related to classes over those no t related to classes do matter Note that if CY_CN is more than 1, it means that a student wrote more comments about classes than those not about classes. The higher the ratio, the more comments about classes relative to those not about classes are there. Rule 1 in Table VI indicates that if CY_CN is high, students tend to get high GPAs \(2.90-4.00\Rule 2-4 say that if a student has no post and/or comment that are not related to classes, the student\222s GPA tends to be high \(2.90-4.00\ with a confidence of 0.640.79. Rules 1-4 can then be interpreted as some students who got high GPAs tend to focus on using classes\222 Facebook groups for studying purposes since they had high ratio of class-related activities to non-class related ones In contrast, rule 5 in Table VI says that if CY_CN is low 0-1.67\hile there were so me posts and comments \(0-34 posts or comments\ Facebook groups, a student tended to get low GPAs \(2.2-2.89\ This means that although a student participated in Facebook groups, the student might get low GPAs if they did not focus on class-related discussion in the groups According to results obtained from our experiments this section, we can conclude that a  Each activity in classes\222 Facebook groups did not individually correlate with students\222 GPAs  b  A student who had low Facebook activities related to classes tended to have a low GPA c  A student, who had a high ratio of activities related to classes over ones not related to classes, tended to achieve a high GPA. In contrast, a student who had a lower ratio although with some activities in groups, tended to have a low GPA The data used in our experiments were obtained from students in three units in only one high school. At this point we may not be able to generalize the results to students elsewhere just yet. We need to obtain more data from various schools/universities in variou s locations and examine the trends of relationships between Facebook activities and students\222 academic perf ormance. We then could observe similarities and compare differences of students\222 behaviors in using Facebook for classes. Moreover, we could include other attributes that may relate to students\222 performance, such as time spent on Facebook, the use of other Facebook activities such as Liking, Sharing, Messaging, Polling, and activities on Timelines, in order to have deeper and more complete understanding of how Facebook affects students\222 academic performance.

Facebook on academic world. As discussed in this section, we actually saw some positive trends of using Facebook as a supplementary tool in formal education. Therefore, we would encourage instructors and students to adopt Facebook and other social networking tools, in a right way, to aid in a learning process appropriately V. C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  After quantitatively studying how using Facebook as a supplemental learning tool affects students\222 a cademic performance, we can see positive effects on students\222 learning Specifically, we examined the relationships between Facebook activities and GPAs of students in a high school in the northern part of Thailand, who joined Facebook groups for class discussions. We investigated Facebook activities, namely frequencies of posts and comme nts, durations that comments are made after each associated post, and ratios of class-related posts/comments to non-class-related ones. We found that an individual activity attribute is not linearly correlated with students\222 GPAs. However, when we applied an Apriori algorithm to learn association rules from our data, we found that students who had class-related activities more than nonclass related activities tended to have high GPAs. In contrast students who had lower ratios of class-related activities or low activities on Facebook groups tended to get lower GPAs Lastly, we found that data grouping play an important role on the number of rules with high confidence values In the future, we plan to explore this issue further by examining other Facebook activities such as Liking, Sharing Messaging, Polling, Seen indicator and activities on Timelines. This will give us the better understanding of students\222 behaviors on Facebook. Moreover, we need to expand our data collection to various schools to be able to generalize the results A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We would like to thank Chutharat Moonna for collecting data preparing data, and providing some analysis in the early stage of this work R EFERENCES  1  V a nce   2 0 1 2 M a r c h 8  Facebook: the making of 1 billion users  Onlin  A v a i la b le: h t tp   w ww  b u s in es s w eek  c om  a r ti c les  201 2 1 0 0 4 facebook-the-making-of-1-billion-users 2 S  W a s s e r m a n a n d K  F a us t   Social Network Analysis: Methods and Applications \(Structural Analysis in the Social Sciences 1 st ed.

169 The decline increases starting from the Technical subject then Religion, Social Studies and First Language and finally Science and Mathematics; emphasizing the importance of good grades in Mathematics and Science at the G.C.E. Oílevel examination to become success at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination in Physical Science stream. The difference between the percentage that passes the G.C.E. Aílevel after obtaining an A grade in all seven Oílevel subjects and a B grade in Mathematics and A grades in the remaining six Oílevel subjects is quite high. This is however quite small with respect to the other six subjects. Yet, it should be noted that all these facts are true only for those who sat the 2007 G.C.E Aílevel examination in the Physical Science stream Figure 12 depicts the same information with respect to the 2010 G.C.E. Aílevel examination results in Physical Science stream. This figure clearly shows that approximately 80 percent of students who obtained A passes in all seven main subjects in G.C.E. Oílevel examination have passed the G.C.E. Aílevel examination, which is considerably high. However only 60 percent of those who obtained a B pass in Science and A passes in all other main subjects, were successful at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination held in 2010. When G.C.E Oílevel Mathematics is Figure 12 Comparison of the impact of G.C.E. Oílevel subject results on 2010 G.C.E. Aílevel results in the Physical Science stream, when the results of a single subject vary considered, this rate reduces to less than 50 percent. This decline is considerably low. Further, only 30 percent of those who had a C pass for Oílevel Science and A passes for the remaining six subjects were successful at the 2010 G.C.E Aílevel examination.  This rate is also considerably low. This highlights the importance of the G.C.E. Oílevel Science and Mathematics results for success at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination. When other subjects are considered, English language seems to be the least important subject as the decrement is very marginal.  The other four subjects too show marginal decrements which are not significant in comparison to Mathematics.  However the order has changed slightly from the 2007 results. In 2007, next to Mathematics and Science Religion was the most important subject.  But in 2010, the importance of this subject has reduced slightly Despite the differences, these two graphs clearly indicate the importance of G.C.E. Oílevel Mathematics and Science to become success at the G.C.E. Aílevel.  They both pointed out the lack of importance of the English language. It should be noted here that these confidence values have been obtained using the association rules generated with a minimum support value. Therefore the impact of a C pass for some of the other subjects has not been considered as the accuracy of the confidence value for these subjects would be minimal due to the insufficient number of records IV D ISCUSSION This study has been conducted with the intention of identifying any prevailing relationship between a studentís G.C.E. Oílevel result and his/her G.C.E. Aílevel result in Physical Science stream. Initially, the study focused on identifying whether the students selected to the Physical Science stream were those with the correct knowledge and capabilities. Thus the study was restricted to the students who did Physical Science at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination. The only method available was to compare the G.C.E. Aílevel results with the corresponding G.C.E. Oílevel results, to identify any existing patterns From the analysis carried out, it was observed that the G.C.E. Oílevel Science and Mathematics results of a student have a direct impact on his/her G.C.E. Aílevel result, for those in Physical Science stream. Further it was evident that a student had to perform at the highest level with regard to these two subjects in order to do well at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination In other words, better the performance in these two subjects higher the probability of passing the G.C.E. Aílevel examination. This was clear from the computed confidence and support values too. Moreover, it was found out that there are a few other subjects that a student should focus on if he/she is planning on follow G.C.E. Aílevel in Physical Science stream namely Religion, First Language, Social Studies and the Technical subject. This combination was identified with respect to the 2007 G.C.E. Aílevel results and corresponding G.C.E Oílevel results. From this study, the fact that G.C.E. Oílevel Mathematics and Science were the most important subjects behind the success at the G.C.E. Aílevel was highlighted Although the analysis revealed the above results, it was observed that some students with A grades in all subjects at the G.C.E. Oílevel examination have failed the G.C.E. Aílevel 


170 examination. This may be due to some other factors which cannot be captured through an analysis which was purely based on examination results. There were also very rare students who had not obtained an A grade for any of the G.C.E. Oílevel papers, but were successful at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination These were extreme cases. There were also a quite a few students who have performed extremely well at the G.C.E Aílevel examination but those do not satisfy the above criterion.  However from the study it can be concluded that a student who fulfills the identified requirements has a higher chance of passing the G.C.E. Aílevel examination in Physical Science stream V L IMITATIONS OF THE S TUDY A few limitations had to overcome during this study. A major limitation was the lack of knowledge on other factors that influence the performance at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination. In this study the main focus was on identifying any relationship between G.C.E. Oílevel examination result and G.C.E. Aílevel examination result of students. However there could be other external factors that affect a studentís performance at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination It should be further pointed out that the standard of the Oílevel and Aílevel examinations can vary from year to year Hence one may argue that comparing the results of students who sat the examination in different years is not practical VI S UGGESTIONS FOR F URTHER W ORK Other factors that may have an effect on the G.C.E. Aílevel results of students could be considered. Provided that data for some other factors are available, a logistic model could be fitted to identify the determinants of a studentís G.C.E. Aílevel results. A clearer understanding could also be obtained if results of a longer period were available for the analysis R EFERENCES 1  20 11 A p r i l  E d uca tio n F o r  A l l N atio nal A c tio n P l a n S r i L a nk a  Onlin  A va i l a b le  http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Sri%20Lanka/Sri%20Lanka%20 EFA%20NAP.pdf 2  20 11 A p r i l  T h e E duc at io nal S y s t e m  o f S r i L a nka.

show the similar phenomenon Figure 8 shows the running time of all algorithms with min sup 3 and min conf 0  5 on all context logs From this gure we can see that the running time of BP-Growth BPGrowth-P is dramatically less than BP-Growth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R on all context logs Summary  by comprehensively analyzing the experimental results for running time we summarize the observations as follows a BP-Growth BP-Growth-P dramatically outperform BPGrowth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R in terms of running time It implies that the strategy of removing redundant data plays a more important role in reducing the running time for behavior pattern mining than the strategy of data set partition and the improvement for data set partition based algorithms is more dramatic b GCPM-H-R is roughly comparable to GCPM-H in terms of running time It implies that applying the strategy of removing redundant data to an Apriori-like algorithm only leads to very limited improvement of running time c BP-Growth-P is roughly comparable to BP-Growth in terms of running time It implies that the pseudo projection technology only has very limited effect on reducing the running time of BP-Growth VII CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we studied several strategies which may be used for improving the efìciency of behavior pattern mining in terms of computing efìciency and memory cost To be speciìc we searched some typical optimizing strategies for association rule mining and discuss the feasibility of applying them to behavior pattern mining since the two problems are similar in many aspects Moreover we proposed a novel and efìcient algorithm named BP-Growth for behavior pattern mining by combining two promising strategies The extensive experiments in a practical mobile computing environment clearly show that BP-Growth and its optimization signiìcantly outperform GCPM and other two baselines which adopt one of the two promising strategies in terms of both running time and memory cost One challenge of utilizing behavior patterns is that there usually exists thousands of behavior patterns for an individual mobile user Usually many of them are semantically similar or related and may be summarized by several representative patterns As for future work we plan to study the effective approaches to summarize lots of behavior patterns for easing the representation of user habits while maintaining as much information as possible VIII A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research was supported by grants from Nokia Research Center China Natural Science Foundation of China Grant

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
