Memory Hierarchy Aware Parallel Priority Based Data Structures Dinesh Agarwal Department of Computer Science Georgia State University Atlanta Georgia 30303 dinwal@gsu.edu Abstract With the proliferation of multicore and manycore architectures memory hierarchy plays an important role in realizing expected performance of memory intensive scienti\002c applications A vast majority of scienti\002c applications require a priority based data structure to discriminate among available data elements for instance a priority based data structure is 
imperative for extracting the earliest events in a discrete event simulation identifying urgent tasks in a parallel scheduler or exploring most promising sub-problems in a state-space search Traditional priority based data structures are tree-based that makes them cache unfriendly due to the exponentially increasing distance between parent and child nodes Fine grained largescale applications further cause excessive contention among competing processors due to frequent updates In this dissertation we propose a priority based data structure that adapts to the memory hierarchy of the underlying computer system The top priority items are aggregated and kept into a working subset of 
data items that is readily accessible for processing I I NTRODUCTION With the proliferation of multicore and manycore architectures memory hierarchy plays an important role in realizing expected performance of memory intensive scienti\002c applications The availability of multiple levels of cache hierarchy presents a challenge for the programmers and researchers to redesign their applications and algorithms to utilize these machines ef\002ciently Parallel computing community excels at utilizing multicore architectures for regular memory intensive applications such as stencil kernels Researchers have 
proposed auto tuners and auto optimizers that can take a traditional stencil kernel and convert it into a stencil kernel optimized for underlying multicore architecture Such applications and frameworks were relatively easier to explore due to the apriori knowledge of data access patterns In this dissertation we are exploring priority based data structures needed by applications where data access patterns can not be predicted at compile time There is a wide variety of such applications including discrete event simulation state space search and parallel scheduler etc II R ELATED 
W ORK Priority based data structures are not a new area of research Many variations of priority queues were proposed during 90  s to cater to the needs of almost all scienti\002c applications that require priority based data structures These data structures can be categorized by the following two approaches reported in literature to parallelize them The 002rst one is to speed up the individual queue operations known from the sequential setting using a small number of processors 2 The other approach is to support insertion and deletion of 
k items where k is a constant 4 5 g a v e an ef 002ci ent implementation of Parallel Heap on bus-based shared memory machines such as sequent balance and SGI power and later on SGI Origin systems which are NUMA shared machines With the advent of multicore and manycore architectures in CPU design it has become essential to revisit these data structures Research has also reported effective techniques to make use of multicore computers and memory hierarchy for memory intensive scienti\002c applications such as sparse matrix vector multiplication Matrix Reduction 7 and di vide 
and conquer algorithms among others Ne v ertheless these problems are regular in nature thereby exploiting data level blocking and/or thread level blocking are suf\002cient to exploit memory hierarchy III R ESEARCH G OALS In modern CPU designs each processor has multiple cores on the same chip Additionally each core has its small fast private cache as well as there is a larger cache shared among all of the cores on a chip The latest chips such as Intel Nehalem and 
AM D Phenom have 3 levels of cache hierarchy As correctly predicted by Yale Patt in 2001 modern CPUs were supposed to have three or more levels of caches which means we can safely expect chip manufactures to add one or more levels of caches in the future architectures However unlike some manycore architectures such as GPUs multicores do not provide researchers with explicit software control over data allocation to these different levels of available cache

memories An application that performs ideally on a multicore simulator may not show even half as good performance on a real multicore chip due to factors that cannot be controlled by the application For instance in order to control the allocation of data to a speci\002c level of cache hierarchy the only way is to exploit the memory replacement policy On a computer system that uses LRU replacement policy the thread af\002nity to a processor can be controlled in such a manner that CPU stalls due to memory latency can be reduced signi\002cantly Nevertheless it is challenging because the cache coherency protocols v ary among dif ferent manuf acturers Therefore the goals of our research are 1  To study existing priority based data structures to assess their capabilities to leverage memory hierarchy on multicore processors 2  To create a framework to control thread and memory af\002nity 3  To employ prefetching to help reduce memory latency and 4  To implement memory hierarchy aware parallel priority-based data structures IV C URRENT P ROGRESS We have successfully engineered Parallel Priority Queue PPQ data structure for multicore architecture to understand the behavior of traditional priority based data structures on newer chips with multiple levels of memory hierarchy For this study we chose PPQ over other similar priority queues because its wide-node structure makes it easier to exploit the spatial locality in a cache memory Based on the amount of concurrency afforded by a parallel application it can yield hundreds to thousands of top-priority items at a time As shown in 1 for extremely 002ne-grained applications it is 2-3 times faster than a sequential heap For larger grain it scales quickly to linear speedups Fig 1 represents the absolute speedup for PPQ The size of heap was 2 26 and the node size was 2 13  We had a total of 256 cycles of insertion and deletion processes For large grain sizes it can be seen that we achieve an absolute speedup of 12.65 using 16 processors Interestingly for p  7 and p  8 processors we have super linear speed up This is due to the better cache locality afforded by PPQ over serial heap V R EMAINING O BJECTIVES AND C HALLENGES Although the memory throughput depends on the application employing our data structure we haven't seen satisfying results with PPQ PPQ demonstrates poor performance in terms of memory throughput when compared with the results of the memory benchmarking tools on the underlying system The reason for this is the inherent dif\002culty of load balancing among available processors Since PPQ is a tree-based data Fig 1 Overall performance of PPQ for varying granularity heapsize  2 26  k  2 13 stricture the cores handling the levels away from root have considerably more load than those handling the levels closer to the root Moreover the number of levels do not increase linearly with increasing heap size PPQ currently does not support allocation of a level to multiple processor therefore it is dif\002cult to employ a large number of processors We are going to explore and extend other priority based data structures on multicores to analyze their behavior on these newer chips Learning from this experience we will know the fundamental properties of priority based data structures that adapts well to multicore For instance the wide-node data structures appear to work well on multicores compared to single node priority queues Such properties will guide the design of a new parallel priority based data structure Our implementation code for PPQ is available online 1  R EFERENCES   G Brodal Priority queues on parallel machines Parallel Computing  vol 25 no 8 pp 987ñ1011 September 1999 A v ailable http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167819199000320   G C Hunt M M Michael S Parthasarathy and M L Scott An ef\002cient algorithm for concurrent priority queue heaps Inf Process Lett  vol 60 pp 151ñ157 November 1996 A v ailable http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0020-0190\(96   N Deo and S Prasad Parallel heap An optimal parallel priority queue The Journal of Supercomputing  vol 6 no 1 pp 87ñ98 March 1992 A v ailable http://www.springerlink.com/index/10.1007/BF00128644   S Das F Sarkar and M Pinotti Distributed priority queues on hypercube architectures  IEEE Comput Soc Press 1996 A v ailable http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=508013   S Prasad and S Sawant Parallel heap A practical priority queue for 002ne-to-medium-grained applications on small multiprocessors October 1995 pp 328 335 1 http://code.google.com/p/parallelpriorityqueues

Each mapper node takes one partition of the database and generates all local frequent itemsets for that partition using the algorithm of Section III C Then a set of key-value pairs likes F 1> is emitted, where F is a local frequent itemset for that partition. The value is always 1 and is useless, only indicating that F is a frequent itemset for that partition Because of the MapReduce frameworkês shuffle and sort utility, pairs with the same key, i.e., the local frequent itemset itself, are always sent to the same reducer node. Each reducer node emits to a file in DFS one and only one keyvalue pair like F 1> for an itemset F it receives. Merging the pairs in all these files gives us the global candidate itemsets Figure 1 illustrates the first MapReduce process 2  The second MapReduce job Before the second MapReduce job is started, each node is given a full duplicate of the global candidate itemsets generated by the first MapReduce job, which is feasible considering its relatively small size. Thus each mapper node has a partition of the database and a full duplicate of the global candidate itemsets. Each mapper node counts the number of occurrence of each global candidate itemset in the partition the mapper is assigned and then emits a set of keyvalue pairs like C  v where C is one of the global candidate sets and v is the number of occurrences of C in that partition Each reducer node receives some global candidate itemsets as keys and sums the associated values for each of them. The result is the number of occurrences of these global candidate itemsets in the entire database. Since the number of transactions in the entire database can be known easily, it is easy for each reducer node to identify which of these global candidate itemsets it receives are actual frequent Only the actual frequent itemsets are emitted out finally Figure 2 illustrates the second MapReduce job process   Figure 1: The first MapReduce job process   Figure 2: The second MapReduce job process V  I MPROVEMENT AND O PTIMIZATION  The section above describes the main steps of how to implement the PSON algorithm in a MapReduce paradigm without implementation details. Actually, some factors can have significant impacts on the performance of PSON, for example, how to choose the number of partitions, how to prune the global candidate itemsets and what buffer strategy to adopt to achieve a tradeoff between I/O and performance 1   1  Choosing the number of partitions The number of non-global-frequent itemsets contained in the global candidate itemsets should be as small as possible Otherwise much effort would be wasted in counting global supports for them. As the number of partitions increases the number of false candidates also increases and hence the global candidate size also increases. The chunk size of transaction database in DFS, such as HDFS can be set manually, thus the number of partitions can reach an optimal value through setting an appropriate chunk size. This partially depends on the characteristics of the transaction database itself and we have not found a generally optimal answer to all kinds of database 2  Counting for global candidate itemsets According to our design, for each of the global candidate itemsets, its number of occurrences in each partition should be counted during Phase II. Actually when an itemset appears as local frequent in all partitions in Phase I, we can determine whether it is global frequent immediately, since we can get its number of occurrences in the entire database Of course, we need to adjust our design slightly, e.g., make the mapper node emit each local frequent itemset with its number of occurrences in that partition, instead of only an integer of 1 3  Buffer strategy It is ideal that the size of main memory of each node is large enough so that each partition can be handled in main memory without any additional I/O. This can be achieved easily by dividing the entire database into more partitions such that each partition is small enough to be handled in the main memory. However, as described as above, too many partitions can lead to too many false candidates which will

waste efforts for counting. A solution is to set the partitions size to an intermediate level and resort to some DFS I/O as buffer strategy when the entire partition cannot be handled in the main memory, which has been proved to be a good tradeoff by our experiments VI  I MPLEMENTATION  AND  E XPERIMENTAL  R ESULTS We have implemented our PSON algorithm in Hadoop 0.21.0, where Hadoop short for Apache Hadoop s a software framework that support s data-intensi ve distributed applications under a free license. Inspired by Googleês MapReduce and Google File System  GFS paper [12 i t  enables applications to work with thousands of nodes and petabytes of data [11   A c tu a ll y  it im p lem en ts alm o st  all th e  utilities described in MapReduce. Our PSON algorithm runs on a cluster consisting of 21 nodes, where each node has two quad-core processors running at 2.8 GHz, 24 GB memory and a 4TB disk. Two of these nodes act as namenodes, which only do some administrative and coordinating work, while the remaining 19 nodes perform the role of computing and storing data We analyze the performance through evaluation of scaleup and speed-up, which are the most fundamental and important factors to evaluate a parallel algorithm. In our experiments, we used IBM Quest Market-Basket Synthetic Data Generator 1  t o ge ne ra t e t h e i n i t i a l da t a s e t s  After generated, these data need to be transferred into standard form as TID  i 1  i 2  i m and then stored into HDFS. The average length of transactions for all datasets is 15. The support threshold is set to 0.075 The first experimental result explains why PSON is superior to the traditional SON algorithm in the context of very large database. From figure 3 we can see that as the size of the database increases, the time cost by SON increases much faster than PSON. When the size of the database reaches a threshold of hundreds of GB, SON cannot finish running in an acceptable period of time, but PSON can The second experimental result we want to observe is how the size of the local frequent itemsets and the global candidate itemsets changes as the number of partitions varies In this experiment, the size of the database is 50GB. It can be seen from table 2 that as the number of partitions increases the numbers of both local frequent itemsets and global candidate itemsets increase as well. However, it should be noted that there is a large overlap among local frequent itemset  T h e re a s o n i s obvi o u s  a l o ca l f r eq ue nt  i t e m s e t  may exist in several of these partitions. This will not affect the correctness of PSON, because after the shuffle and sort phase, all the duplicates of a local frequent itemset will be sent to only one reducer node Next we evaluate the scale-up performance of the PSON algorithm in the third experiment by varying the number of transactions from 1 million to 500 billion, with sizes ranging from 6GB to 440GB respectively. We can see from figure 4 that the time cost increases almost linearly with the size of the datasets. From this result we can conclude that PSON can achieve a good performance in scale-up  Figure 3: Comparison on time costs of SON and PSON   Table 2: Variation of local frequent itemsets and global candidate itemsets against the number of partitions Number of Partitions Size of Largest p L  Size of G C  2 45004 56802 4 53803 64045 8 89118 90418 14 111653 129467 20 174273 183643 30 218891 229493    Figure 4: Performance of Scale-up  Figure 5 presents the results of the fourth experiment which aims to evaluate the performance of speed-up. This experiment tries to find all frequent itemsets contained in an 80GB dataset on different number of running nodes in a cluster. We can see that as the number of running nodes increases, the time cost shows an approximately linear decrease. This result indicates that the PSON algorithm can achieve a good performance in speed-up. The reason why the time cost increases more than the proportion to the number of running nodes is that more running nodes would involve more network overheads

 Figure 5: Performance of Speed-up VII  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we proposed PSON, a parallelized SON algorithm implemented with MapReduce in Hadoop, to mine frequent itemsets from a very large transaction database. The major contribution of our work is that PSON makes it possible to mine frequent sets in a very large transaction database with an acceptable time cost. Further we have discussed several optimizing schemes that should be concerned when implementing PSON, for example, how to choose the number of partitions, how to prune the global candidate itemsets and what buffer strategy to adopt in order to achieve a tradeoff between I/O and performance. From experimental results we conclude that PSON can achieve a good performance in both scalability and speed-up, and is particularly meaningful and useful when dealing with huge amount of data in clusters, whereas it is almost impossible to fulfill such a big challenge with an acceptable time cost in a single node For our future work, we plan to optimize the PSON implementation in Hadoop, for example, reducing I/O and network overhead further, and achieving a better tradeoff between the number of partitions and performance R EFERENCES  1  A.

Park Driving Park  VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  We have proposed a framework for mining interesting chronicles or narratives from multi-year consumer media collections, including themes related to the calendar date. The media in the collection is analyzed by a variety of algorithms to generate metadata of different types. We use metadata based on camera capture information, low-level image processing semantic image understanding, facial processing and event clustering to gather a large set of diverse metadata. The media and associated metadata are represented as a transaction database, and frequent itemset mining is employed to detect frequently occurring groups of images that share several meta             Figure 7. An example of temporal recurring groups detected data in common. A confidence and interest measure relevant to the consumer domain is used to determine the quality of the frequent itemsets, and create a  list of the top "themes" within the collection. Since a variety of metadata types are included for every media in the collection, we are able to capture a broad variety of recurring themes without a priori knowledge of the themes in a given collection. Because the system also discovers frequent patterns that the user may be unaware of, the system seems to display çintelligenté behavior by providing unexpected groupings that could not have been extracted by merely searching We also detect calendar-related recurring themes in multiyear collections. We define collections in terms of events, and represent them in an appropriate two-dimensional temporal space. We use density-based clustering followed by filtering to reduce the number of false matches in a group. Our approach detects personal special dates such as birthdays and anniversaries, seasonal activities and holidays celebrated. Since both the calendar-based groups and feature-based thematic groups detected are strictly data-driven \(with no a priori assumptions about a userês collection\ they are customized to the type of content in specific userês collections Further work in this area includes a user study to evaluate user reaction to these automatically generated narratives from their collection. Some of the user studies will focus on using the output of our method for slideshow-based reliving of a collection. We also plan to gather more collections with people and location metadata. Another direction of exploration is in improving the performance of scene, material and object classifiers by incorporating contextual information from seemingly unrelated metadata, as suggested by the frequent itemsets detected by our system. Also, further improvement of the precision of detecting recurrent themes can be obtained by incorporating the discrimination power of different features into the confidence score to avoid making groups based on generic features R EFERENCES  1  N.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
