Q-ball imaging \(QBI\ use Funk-Radon conversion rather than diffusion spectrum imag ing \(DSI\and because this method to retrieve only the surface of the sphere of sampling points, which can also improve the shortcomings of the sampling time is too long, its schematic shown in Figure 3 Fig. 3  Q-Ball Imaging sampling Although QBI technology can effectively improve the diffusion hypothesis motion to solve complex situations voxels inside the multi-directio nal, so more complex render their neural structures in the brain, but it still takes time like a relatively long tradition of technology and establish the orientation distribution function \(Orientation Distribution Function, ODF\n spherical harmonics caused by consuming relatively much computing phenomenon \(Time Consuming on  the huge amount of information generated by computation Thus, using the Graphic Processing Unit \(GPU accelerate the reconstruction of  imaging, analysis analysis arithmetic operations, and so the application has become the trend, especially in the massive analysis\(Big data\, super computer, geography mining and so requires a lot of numerical analysis, GPU rather than the CPU has obvious advantages, there is no need to spend on its power-consuming too many resources, GPU use more transistors as the execution unit, Figure 4 shows two schematic comparison of those Fig. 4  CPU and GPU crystal structure chart The current mainstream of computer is that mainly logical CPU, and with the GPU's massively parallel computation to be developed, that the use of such CPU and GPU architecture to achieve heter ogeneous parallel computing Compute Unified Device Architecture \(CUDA\ which NVIDIA launched after t i s ope n s  u p t h e  w a v e  of  high-performance computing, th e transmission characteristics of its parallel computing can effectively improve their performance computing and analysis, a significant reduction in the time required for its operation, related applications in the field of data mining, earth science, geography, etc. have been planning to enhance its actual performance, and the use of GPU computing to accelerate tracking technique of nerve fibers have also been proposed in 2007 by scholars and obtain substantially enhance the operational effectiveness [5  These are based on the CUDA architecture shown in Figure 5, the programming model are run with this framework CPU and GPU are both owned their independent memory CUDA is same as the C on the handling the memory, but if you want to manipulate the display, then you need to be provide by the CUDA API to manage, which includes the release of the establishment, initialize memory and so on Fig. 5  CUDA architecture Since running GPU parallel co mputing needs to achieve through transfer between differ ent memory to achieve, which is complex and need careful processing, and therefore developers need to run the hardware architecture to its decision to develop parallel algorithms and regulatory control memory, so that each core on GPU in the process of reading the data, and the remaining core of the work is also being shared running, making parallel computing optimization hardware developers need to have a certain degree of understanding before research and development can be the most efficient writing, Figure 5 is the internal memory of the multi-GPU architecture diagram CUDA does not need the graphics API, which uses a Cextended language to develop so that developers do not need to spend too much time in the familiar with the new structure

In this study, we propose and implement a parallel computing framework to improve the efficiency of the ODF reconstruction using the modern graphic processing unit \(GPU\hich has a notable computing performance over the conventional central processing unit \(CPU\ terms of floating-point computing and memory bandwidth . For our implementation, we apply the Compute Unified Device Architecture \(CUDA programming model [8 and w e  e v al u ate t h e perf or m a n c e on  three computers to verify our algorithm Fig. 6  CUDA architecture II M ATERIALS AND M ETHODS First, we obtained the data from Yang Ming University 3T MRI and obtain T1-weighted images and  QBI images and reconstruct the data Table 1 is the  QBI's image parameters In vivo human brain QBI data were acquired on a 3T MRI scanner \(Siemens, Germany\ng a SE-EPI diffusion sequence with the following parameters: TR =9500 ms, TE 123 ms, voxel size = 2 ◊ 2 ◊ 2 mm3, and b-value = 3000 s/mm2. The DW gradient scheme consisted of 162 directions generated by 4-folds tessellated icosahedrons. Sixty transverse slices were acquired parallel to the line defined by the connection between the anterior and posterior commissures. In this study, we used SH=4 for QBI reconstruction Table 1.

number of output ODF orientations, and the SH order, is computed in prior in the spherical coordinate system using the Moore-Penrose pseudo inverse approach. The SH function is then transferred from CPU to every SP units. Each SP uses multiple threads to perform par allel matrix operation, and then the output ODFs are transferred from the GPU shared memory to the CPU memory. The utilization of the shared memory can reduce the time and number of access to the global memory and our algorithm can help to avoid the risk of data hazard caused by overloading of the shared memory in CUDA architecture. In addition, our algorithm allows us to define the number of threads for computation, which determines the computing block size shown in Fig. 8 Each thread in the block is responsible for the ca lculation of a matrix \(i.e. the block\ment Evaluation: We examined the performance of our algorithm on three machines for comparison: The Machine I is equipped with a NVIDIA T esla C2075 graphic card \(448 cores, 1030 Gigaflops for single-precision floating-point performance and 575 MHz core clock\d an Intel\(R\ E51607 CPU. The Machine II has a NVIDIA GTX 560 graphic card \(192 cores, 595.2 Gigaflops for single-precision floatingpoint performance and 775 MHz core clock\d an Intel\(R i7-3770 CPU The Machine III is equipped with a NVIDIA GEFORCE 610M graphic card \(48 cores, 142.08 Gigaflops for singleprecision floating-point performance and 900 MHz core clock and an Intel\(R\ i5-2450M CPU Fig. 8  The diagram of matrix operation using the multithreading technique in the SP unit III DISCUSSION AND C ONCLUSIONS We demonstrate that using the modern GPU technique can remarkably improve the computing performance, and the GPU computing architecture developed in this study can significantly increase the efficiency of SHB-QBI reconstruction by a factor up to 500. This should therefore be beneficial to clinical applications since the results of ODFs and the relative quanti ties can be obtained for diagnosis right after QBI acquisition. In addition, we expect that our GPU framework would be particularly helpful to accelerate data analysis for massive groups such as those in the Human Connectome Project [6 th e n e ar f u tu re w e  w i l l co m b in e and optimize this framework with our GPU-based probabilistic fiber tracking algorithm as well as the visualization toolbox. Although our current computing algorithm relies on the CUDA environment, we will soon extend it to be cross-platform using the Open CL standard A CKNOWLEDGMENT This study is supported in part by Taiwan National Science Council:  NSC 101-2218-E-182-005 and NSC 1022221-E-182-004 R EFERENCES 1  M.

                         Fig 5 Sequence diagram demonstrates the interaction between a sensor and the SmartLink tool However interaction sequence may varied depend on how the sensor is programmed between sensor and the SmartLink application occurs We measure the average amount of time taken by each step average of 30 sensor conìgurations Figure 6 illustrates the results and the following steps are considered Time taken to 1 set up the sensor 2 initiate connection between the sensor and SmartLink  3 initiate communication between sensor and SmartLink  4 extract sensor identiìcation information 5 retrieve the complete proìle of the sensor 6 conìgure the sampling rate 7 conìgure the communication frequency 8 conìgure the sensing schedule 9 conìgure the network and authentication details so the sensor can directly connect to the cloud 10 connect to the secure network using the provided authentication details VI E VALUATION According to Figure 6 the actual conìguration tasks take less that one second There is a slight variation in completion time in conìguration steps 4 to 9 This is due to storage access and differences in conìguration command processing Despite the protocol we use sensors takes 5 to 15 seconds to boot and set-up themselves self The setup stage consists of activities such as reading default conìguration from storage switch-on necessary modules and components communication modules real-time clock SD card sensor broads and so on According to the results it is evident that a single sensor can be conìgured in less than 12 seconds i.e assuming sensors are already booted which takes additional 5 to 15 seconds depending on the communication protocol Additionally SmartLink can conìgure multiple sensors at given time in parallel This is a signiìcant improvement over a manual labour intensive sensor conìguration approaches       Fig 6 Time taken to conìgure a sensor in step-by-step Experiments are conducted using TCP UDP and Bluetooth VII R ELATED W ORK In this section we review some of the state-of-the-art solutions developed by in academia as well as commercial business entities Our review covers both mature and immature solutions proposed by start-up initiatives as well as largescale projects The proposed CADDOT model as well as the SmartLink tool help to overcome some of the weaknesses in existing solutions There are commercial solutions available in the market that have been developed by start-up IoT companies and the research divisions of leading corporations These solutions are either still under development or have completed only limited deployments in specialized environments e.g demos We discuss some of the selected solutions based on their popularity Ninja Blocks ninjablocks.com Smart-Things smartthings.com and Twine supermechanical.com are commercial products that aim at building smart environments The y use their own standards and protocols open or closed to communicate between their own software systems and sensor hardware components The hardware sensors they use in their solutions can only be discovered by their own software systems In contrast our pluggable architecture can accommodate virtually any sensor Further our proposed model facilitates different domains e.g indoor outdoor using different communication protocols and sequences In addition the CADDOT model can facilitate very high dynamicity and mobility HomeOS  is a home automation operating system that simpliìes the process of connecting devices together Similar to our plugin architecture HomeOS is based on applications and drivers which are expected to be distributed via an on-line store called HomeStore in the future However HomeOS does not perform additional conìguration tasks e.g scheduling sampling rate communication frequency depending on the user requirements and context information Further our objective is to develop a model that can accommodate a wider range of domains by providing multiple alternative mechanisms as discussed in section IV Hu et al ha v e proposed a sensor conìguration mechanism that uses the information stored in TEDS and SensorML speciìcations Due to the una v ailability and unpopularity of TEDS among sensor manufacturers we use TEDS-like mechanism by establishing a standard communication message formats to extract information from a give sensors in phase 2 of the CADDOT model Actinium is a RESTful runtime container that pro vides Web-like scripting for low-end devices through a cloud It encapsulates a given sensor device using a container that handles the communication between the sensor device and the software system by offering a set of standard interfaces for sensor conìguration and life-cycle management The Constrained Application Protocol CoAP has been used for communication Pereira et al ha v e also used CoAP and it pro vides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints It also supports built-in discovery of services and resources However for discovery to work both the client e.g a sensor and the server e.g the IoT platform should support CoAP However most of the sensor manufacturers do not

alone application that tries to understand new environments using pluggable context discovery and reasoning mechanisms Context discovery is the main functionality in Dynamix In contrast our solution is focused on dynamic discovery and conìguration of sensors in order to support a sensing as a service model in the IoT domain We employ a pluggable architecture which is similar to the approach used in Dynamix  in order to increase the scalability and rapid extension development by third party developers The Electronic Product Code EPC is designed as a uni v ersal identiìer that pro vides a unique identity for every physical object anywhere in the world EPC is supported by the CADDOT model as one way of identifying a given sensor Sensor integration using IPv6 in building automation systems is discussed in Cubo et al  ha v e used a D e vices Proìle for W e b Services 5 DPWS to encapsulate both devices and services DPWS deìnes a minimal set of implementation constraints to enable secure web service messaging discovery description and eventing on resource-constrained devices However discovery is only possible if both ends client and server are DPWS-enabled VIII C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK We explored the barriers in deploying IoT solutions in order to build smart environments We understood that sensor conìguration is one of the major challenges To address this we presented the CADDOT model an approach that automates the sensor discovery and conìguration process in smart environments efìciently by considering key factors such as growing number of sensors heterogeneity on-demand schedules and sampling rates data acquisition methods and dynamicity CADDOT also encourages non-technical users to adopt IoT solutions with ease towards building their own smart environments In this work we evaluated sensor conìguration using three popular communication protocols We validate the CADDOT model by deploying it in an ofìce environment As CADDOT required minimum user involvement and technical expertise it signiìcantly reduces the time and cost involved in sensor discovery and conìguration In the future we will explore the possibilities of developing an efìcient technique to identify a given sensor using context information and probabilistic techniques in circumstances where information extracted in step 2 in CADDOT model is not adequate

Figure 6 Memory hierarchy behaviors among different workloads DataBench is higher than in the traditional workloads The average L2 cache MPKI of BigDataBench is 21 while that for HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 4.8 5.1 14 and 16 respectively Among BigDataBench  most of the online service workloads have the higher L2 cache MPKI on the average 40 except Nutch server 4.1 while most of the of\003ine and realtime analytics workloads have the lower L2 cache MPKI on the average 13 except BFS 56 Third the average L3 cache MPKI of BigDataBench is 1.5 while the average number of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 2.4 2.3 1.4 and 1.9 respectively This observation shows that the LLC L3 caches of the processors Xeon E5645 on our testbed are ef\002cient for the big data workloads corroborating the observation in DCBench  The ef\002ciency of L3 caches also can explain why the 003oating point intensity of BigDataBench on the Xeon E5645 is higher than on the Xeon E5310 only two levels of caches The TLB behaviors are shown in Figure 6-2 First the average number of ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench is higher than in the traditional workloads The average number of ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench is 0.54 while that of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 0.006 0.005 0.06 and 0.08 respectively The more ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench may be caused by the complex third party libraries and deep software stacks of the big data workloads Second the average number of DTLB MPKI of BigDataBench is also higher than in the traditional workloads The average number of DTLB MPKI of BigDataBench is 2.5 while that of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 1.2 0.7 2 and 2.1 respectively And we can also 002nd that the numbers of DTLB MPKI of the big data workloads range from 0.2  Nutch server  to 14  BFS  The diversity of DTLB behaviors re\003ects the data access patterns are diverse in big data workloads which proves that diverse workloads should be included in big data benchmarks  Lessons Learned  On a typical state-of-practice processor Intel Xeon E5645 we 002nd that L3 caches of the processor are ef\002cient for the big data workloads which indicates multi-core CPU design should pay more attention to area and energy ef\002ciency of caches for the big data applications The high number of L1I cache MPKI implies that better L1I cache performance is demanded for the big data workloads We conjecture that the deep software stacks of the big data workloads are the root causes of high frond-end stalls We are planning further investigation into this phenomenon by changing the software stacks under test e.g replacing MapReduce with MPI 7 Conclusion In this paper we presented our joint research efforts with several industrial partners on big data benchmarking Our methodology is from real systems covering not only broad application scenarios but also diverse and representative real-world data sets We proposed an innovative data generation methodology and tool to generate scalable volumes of big data keeping the 4 V properties Last we chose and developed nineteen big data benchmarks from dimensions of application scenarios operations algorithms data types data sources software stacks and application types Also we reported the workloads characterization results of big data as follows 002rst in comparison with the traditional benchmarks the big data workloads have very low 


operation intensity Second the volume of data input has non-negligible impact on micro-architecture characteristics of big data workloads so architecture research using only simple applications and small data sets is not suf\002cient for big data scenarios Last but not least on a typical state-ofpractice processor Intel Xeon E5645 we 002nd that for the big data workloads the LLC of the processor is effective and better L1I cache performance is demanded as the big data workloads suffer high L1I cache MPKI 8 Acknowledgements We are very grateful to the anonymous reviewers and our shepherd Dr

  Paper 2581 Version 2  14   Flight i nformation and processing   Presentation and projection of flight profiles   Real time operational information   Managing both pilot operator and air traffic controller workloads   Procedural processes supported by enhanced automation capabilities   Control sector complexity and management   Separation a ssurance   Airspace d esign and p rocedures   Investment in resolving these constraints  will drive the rate of adoption in civil UAS operations in the NAS One p art of the investment will be driven by the FAA\222s \223F acilities and Equipment\224 F&E Budget over  the next ten years Another part will be driven by defense and federal investment  in R&D  The remaining part will be driven by private investment seeking to develop profitable supplie r s and manufacturing firms of UAS Unfortunately   private investment will not fully launch until there is a clear indication of the public investment into implementing the requisite air traffic management  and air traffic control  ATM/ATC changes into the NAS infrastructure and there i s a common  approach through avionic standards in UA V  equipage   It is expected that avionic standards would lower the end user costs The impact on NAS infrastructure is the outline in the following subsection  Today\222s Air Traffic Control System  Today\222s air traffic control system is built around four basic pillars. These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
