Ef田iently Handling Skew in Outer Joins on Distributed Systems

Abstract 
joins in large parallel systems is particularly challenging as real world datasets are characterized by data skew leading to performance issues Although skew handling techniques have been extensively studied for inner joins there is little published work solving the corresponding problem for parallel outer joins Conventional approaches to this problem such as ones based on hash redistribution often lead to load balancing problems while duplication-based approaches incurs signi田ant overhead in terms of network communication In this paper we propose a new algorithm query with counters QC for directly handling skew in outer joins on distributed architectures We present an ef田ient implementation of our 
approach based on the asynchronous partitioned global address space APGAS parallel programming model We evaluate the performance of our approach on a cluster of 192 cores 16 nodes and datasets of 1 billion tuples with different skew Experimental results show that our method is scalable and in cases of high skew faster than the state-of-the-art

 which facilitate the combination of records based on a common key are particularly costly and ef田ient implementation of such operations can have a signi田ant impact in improving the performance on a wide range of workloads ranging from databases to decision support and Big Data analytics The study of parallel joins on shared-memory systems has already achieved signi田ant performance speedups through improvements in architecture at the hardware-level of modern processors 2 Ne v ertheless as applications gro w in scale the associated scalability is bounded by the limit on the number of threads per processor and the availability 
Joins 
of specialized hardware predicates Though GPU computing has become a well-accepted high performance parallel programming paradigm and there are many reports on implementations of parallel joins 4 as in shared-memory architectures when the data reaches very large scale the memory and I/O eventually will become the bottleneck As a consequence ef田ient parallelisation of joins on distributed memory machines becomes increasingly desirable Although distributed join algorithms have been widely studied 6 7 there has been relati v ely little done on the topic of outer joins a surprising fact given that outer joins are common in complex queries and widely used such as in 
OLAP applications In contrast to inner joins outer joins do not lose any tuples from one or both table\(s that do not match with any tuple in the other table As a result the nal join contains not only the matched part but also the non-matched part As data skew occurs naturally in various applications it is important for practical data systems to perform ef田iently in such contexts Similarly to inner joins the conventional hash-based and duplication-based methods when used for outer joins precipitates performance degradation when data skew is encountered as follows 1 the former method suffers from poor load balancing and 2 the latter induces costly network communication While many algorithms have 
been designed for handling skew for inner joins 10 11 little research has been done on outer joins The reason for this may be the assumption that inner join techniques can be simply applied to outer joins Ho we v er  as shown in our evaluations later in this manuscript applying such techniques for outer joins directly may lead to poor performance Although many systems can convert outer joins to inner joins pro viding an opportunity then to use inner join techniques this approach necessitates rewriting mechanisms which may prove complex and costly Finally methods which have been designed speci田ally for outer joins achieve signi田ant performance improvements 
over the aforementioned approaches We will later see though that these state-of-the-art methods are design variations of the two conventional approaches described earlier namely hash distribution and duplication making them only applicable in small-large table outer joins In this paper we propose a new approach which we have called 
QC to directly and ef田iently handle data skew in massively parallel outer joins on distributed systems We implement our method using

The duplication-based distributed outer join approach is shown in Figure 2 Its implementation includes two main stages which makes the approach signi田antly different from that for inner joins 1 The inner join between and  It includes three phases  and  The replication phase just duplicates broadcast at each node to all other nodes This means that after the replication the relation will be equal to the full input  namely  The following two phases are the same as for sequential inner joins i.e local lookups for will commence once the in-memory hash table of is created and consequently outputs the results  2 The outer join between and the intermediate join results  This process is the same as the hash-based method described above Since every step for the two approaches above is implemented in parallel across the computing nodes and the number of execution units can be increased by deploying additional nodes both distributed schemes show the potential for scalability in terms of processing massively parallel outer joins However there are signi田ant performance issues with both approaches While researchers have shown that implementations of the hash-based scheme can achieve near linear speed-up on parallel systems under ideal balancing conditions when the data to be processed has signi田ant skew the performance of such parallel algorithms is dramatically decreased This performance hit arises from the redistribution of tuples in relation and through the hashing function and all the tuples having the same join attribute will be transferred to the same remote node When the input is skew the popular keys will ood into a small number of nodes and cause hot spots These result in performance bottlenecks due to two reasons 1 the high time-cost of communication large numbers of tuples are transferred to hot spots through the network and 2 load imbalance a large number of hash table lookups are implemented at hot spots in the probing phase Such issues impact system scalability which will be reduced as employing new nodes cannot yield improvements the skew tuples will still be distributed to the same nodes In contrast duplication-based methods can reduce hot spots nevertheless when is large the broadcast of every to all the nodes is time-cost heavy and the building of a large hash table based on at each node during the rst stage impacts performance as well due to the associated memoryand lookup-cost Further even if is small the cardinality of the intermediate join results will be large when is high skewed which makes the second stage costly and consequently decreases the whole performance As there are no speci田 methods for handling skew in single parallel outer join here we just discuss two typical techniques used for inner joins one implements load assignment by  and the other is the stateof-art PRPD  method W e will apply the later approach in outer joins and evaluate its performance later Hassan et al emplo y a method based on distributed histograms which can be divided into two parts 1 histograms for  and are built at each node in either local or global view or both and 2 based on the complete knowledge of the distribution and join information of the relations a redistribution plan to balance the workload for each node is formulated As the primary innovation in that work is the improvement of the redistribution plan to process data skew this method has the potential to be used for outer joins While their experimental results demonstrate that this method is ef田ient and scalable in the presence of data skew there are still two weak points 1 histograms are built based on the redistribution of all the keys of and  which leads to high network communication and 2 though only the tuples participating in the join are extracted for redistribution which reduces part of the network communication this operation is based on the pre-join of the distributed keys which incurs a signi田ant time cost Xu et al propose an algorithm named PRPD   for inner joins For a single skew relation assuming is uniformly distributed is partitioned into two parts 1 a locallyretained part  which comprises high skew items and which is not involved in the redistribution phase and 2 the redistributed part which comprises the tuples with low frequency of occurrence and is redistributed using a common hash-based implementation The relation is also divided into two parts 1 the duplicated part  which contain the keys in  which will be broadcast to all other nodes and 2 the redistributed part the remaining part of that is to be redistributed as normal After the duplication and the redistribution operations the nal join can be composed by and at each node This method illustrates an ef田ient way to process the high skew tuples keys are highly repetitive All these tuples of are not redistributed at all instead a small number of tuples containing the same keys from are broadcast The results for this approach show signi田ant speedup in the presence of data skew In fact PRPD is a hybrid method combining both the hash-based and duplication-based join scheme Therefore we can simply use the and to replace the corresponding inner joins in the scenarios of outer joins Even so we notice that 1 this algorithm is based on the assumption that they have knowledge of the data skew which requires global statistical operations for R and S are required initially and 2 the cardinality of the intermediate results in will be large because the here is high skewed and this will

bring in signi田ant time-costs We will exam this in our evaluations in Section V Xu et al propose another algorithm called DER   which is the state-of-the-art method for optimization of outer joins The method comprises two stages 1 They duplicate to all the nodes and then implement the inner joins In contrast to the conventional approach they record the ids of all nonmatched rows of at this stage 2 They do not redistribute any tuples in the second stage instead they just redistribute the recorded ids according to their hash values and then simply organize the non-match join results on that basis The nal output is the union of the inner join results in the rst stage and the non-matched ones in the second stage In fact this method shows an ef田ient way to extract non-matched results Notice that the in the rst stage of the conventional duplication-based method is a inner join but not a outer join the reason is that the outer join brings either redundant or erroneous non-matched output For a two-node system for example if the output of the duplicated tuple 1,a is 1,a,null on both nodes there is no match for this tuple in and there is a redundant output In the meantime if the 1,a,null appears only on one node there is a match on the other node output 1,a,null will result in error The conventional approach to alleviate this problem is by redistributing the intermediate results We can also use another naive way to solve this problem by outputting the non-matched results and then redistribute them Regardless DER uses a more ingenious way in that each tuple can be indicated by a row-id from the table  which is redistributed Consequently the network communication and the workload can be greatly reduced and their experimental results demonstrate that the DER algorithm can achieve signi田ant speedups over competing methods As DER must broadcast  it is designed to work best for small-large table outer joins In this scenario since is small the redistributed part in the second stage will remain small even when is skew This is because DER only processes the non-matched part the number of which is always less than at each node In contrast with the PRPD algorithm the broadcast part is typically small and we expect that integrating DER into PRPD can x the skew problem as described for previously Accordingly this hybrid method can be applied to handle skew in common large-large outer joins We refer to this approach as PRPD+DER and we will exam its performance in Section V as well For outer joins implemented directly by PRPD namely the part is implemented by the conventional duplication-based outer join method we refer to this approach as PRPD+Dup approach and its detailed work ow Then we analyze how this scheme can and handle data skew in outer joins We also present an account of the advantages and disadvantages of the approach compared to current techniques in this domain Assuming the input relations are and  where is skew there are computing nodes and before the join operations the th node has a subset of both relations and  As shown in Figure 3 our approach has two different communication patterns distribution and query which occur between local and remote nodes This distinguishes the method from the conventional hash-based and duplicationbased outer joins We divide its detailed work ow into the following four steps The relation is processed the same way as the hash-based implementations in that each is partitioned into chunks and each tuple is assigned according to the hash value of its key by a hash function  After that all the chunks will be transferred to the th node In this phase we scan each tuple in the relation at each node and insert them in a set of local hash tables the number of hash tables is  The tuple assignment is according to as well such that the tuples having the hash value are put into the th hash table  The structure of the hash tables are shown as Figure 4\(a It supports the mappings such that tuples with the same keys will be stored in the same bucket After that iterations on each hash table commence and all keys in each hash table are picked up and kept sequentially in memory Finally we push the keys from the hash table to the node where these keys are called the of the node in our approach In this step we rst build a local hash table with the data structure

at each node in which the and are the received tuples from the rst phase while the is an integer and initialized as 0 After that we look up each of the received query keys in and output either a matched value or  All these values are also kept sequentially as well as the corresponding query keys and we called them  because we push these values back to the nodes where the query keys originally come from after nishing the lookups The detailed process can be seen in Figure 4\(b 1 If a match exists the returned value will be the matched value meanwhile we also increase the corresponding by one 2 If there is no match in  the returned value will be set to  After receiving sets of returned values from remote nodes we can formulate the nal join results We divide this process into two kinds of lookup 1 matched result lookup through scanning the received values at each node Take a node for example for the returned values from th node we rst check whether the value is null If the value is null we continue scanning the next value If it is not it means that there is a match between and  The reason is that each query key is extracted from  and a nonnull returned value means that this key exists in as well Therefore we look up the corresponding query key in the corresponding hash table and output the join results 2 non-matched result lookup through checking whether the is 0 We iterate all the keys in the hash table and check the corresponding  For each  we output the non-matched result of the corresponding key directly The reasons are 1 the query is based on the hashbased implementation and 2 the key in with means that this key has never been matched with the query keys also means it has no match in  The join operation ends with the output of all the results Though is skewed we do not transfer any tuples of this relation in our framework Instead we just transfer the keys of  More exactly we only distribute the unique keys of on the basis of structure of hash tables  Assuming that there exist skew tuples which have the same key  and appear large number times in the relation  Using the conventional hash-based method all these tuples will be transferred to the th node which results a hot spot both in communication and the following lookup operations By comparison our method ef田iently addresses this problem in two aspects 1 each node will receive only one key or maximum keys if these tuples are distributed on the nodes and 2 each query key is treated as the same in the following look up operations In addition to ef田ient handling of data skew compared with the conventional approaches our scheme still has two other advantages 1 network communication can be highly reduced because we only transferred the unique keys of  and their corresponding returned values and 2 computation can be decreased when is high skew because a though we have two lookup operations on and  the hash tables in will be very small b skew tuples will be looked up only once instead of checking all of them and c lookup operations for the tuples that are not participating in the join results are removed by just checking whether the returned value is null or not Taking a higher level comparison with the  and the two PRPD-based methods as described in Section II there are two other advantages to our approach in aspect of handling skew 1 we do not need any global knowledge of the relations in the presence of skew while and 10 require a global statistic to quantify the skew and 2 our approach does not involve redundancy of join or lookup operations while the other two have because each node in our method is just  while and 10 ha v e  such that some nodes may receive some tuples what they do not really need Furthermore by using a local query counter we can directly identify the non-matched results while and 10 needs more complex pre-distribution or redistribution operations In the meantime although the DER algorithm has done speci兎d optimization for the inner implementation of outer joins it still needs to redistribute the row-ids All of these highlight that our approach is more straightforward on processing outer joins In our method we have to build local hash tables for at each node which could be time-costly Additionally when the skew is low the number of query keys will be large as well and the two-sided communication will decrease the performance We assess the balance of these advantages and disadvantages through evaluation with real-world datasets and an appropriate parallel implementation in Section V

IV I MPLEMENTATION We present a detailed implementation of the QC algorithm using the X10 framework We compare our method with the conventional hash-based algorithm as well as the two PRPD-based algorithms The latter two do not provide any code-level information therefore we have also implemented the PRPD+Dup and PRPD+DER algorithms in X10 X10 is a ne w multi-paradigm programming language developed by IBM It supports the asynchronous partitioned global address space APGAS model and is speci田ally designed to increase programmer productivity while being amenable to programming shared memory and distributed memory supercomputers It uses the concepts of and as the kernel notions to exploit parallelism in the available hardware A place is a logical abstraction of the underlying heterogeneous processing element in the hardware such as cores in a multi-core architecture GPUs or a whole physical machine Activities are light-weight threads that run on places X10 schedules activities on places to best utilize the available parallelism The number of places is constant through the life-time of an X10 program and is initialized at program startup Activities on the other hand can be forked at program execution time Forking an activity can be blocking wherein the parent returns after the forked activity completes execution or non-blocking wherein the parent returns instantaneously after forking an activity Furthermore these activities can be forked locally or on a remote place X10 provides a data structure called distributed array   for programming parallel algorithms One or more elements in the can be mapped to a single place using the concept of points The following three X10 primitives are critical in understanding the pseudocode given in the following sections  this construct executes statement at a speci田 place  The current activity is blocked until nishes executing on   a child activity is forked by this construct The current activity returns immediately non-blocking after forking   this construct is used to block the current activity and wait for all activities forked by to terminate There are a number of advantages using the X10 language and in turn the APGAS model to implement our algorithm 1 exible and ef田ient scheduling APGAS like PGAS separates tasks from the underlying concurrency model thereby allowing one to implement an ef田ient scheduling strategy irrespective of the number of tasks forked using  2 APGAS being derived from both MPI and OpenMP programming models extracts parallelism at R Distribution 1  2 Initialize    3 _ _ hash  5 to to at place Push Query Keys 1  2 Initialize array[hashmap[key,ArrayList\(value   3 _ _ hash  5 to i 13 Serialize to to at place i 15 We are interested in high performance distributed memory join algorithms therefore we rst read all the tuples in at each node and commence the distribution of  The pseudocode of this process is given in Algorithm 1 The array is used to collect the grouped tuples and its size is initialized to the number of computing nodes  Then each thread reads the arraylist of R and groups the tuples according to the hash values of their keys After that the grouped items are serialized and sent to the corresponding remote place This process is done in parallel and we use the predicate to guarantee the completion of the tuple transfer in each place before pushing query keys The detailed implementation of the second step is given in Algorithm 2 A set of is initialized at each place Each collects tuples of

according to their hash values If the key of a tuple has already been in the  then only the value part of the tuple will be added in the hash table After processing all the tuples the keys in each hash table will be extracted by an iteration on its  These keys will be kept in  and then serialized and pushed to the assigned place for further processing Both the and are objects which are kept in memory for the subsequent result lookups as mentioned in Section III-A The serialization/deserialization process is used only when the push array objects are neither  nor  otherwise we directly deploy the method to transfer the data We use the operation in this part to guarantee the completion of the data transfer at each place before the next phase commences This phase starts after the grouped query keys have been transferred to the appropriate remote places The implementation at each place is similar to a sequential hash join The received serialized tuple and key arrays representing the distributed and grouped query keys respectively are deserialized For the tuples all the   pairs and the an initialized counter are placed in the local hash table  The query keys are used to access this hash table sequentially to get their values In this process if the mapping of a key already exists its value is retrieved and the counter is increment by one otherwise the value will be considered as  In both cases the value of the query key is added into a temporary array so that it can be sent back to the requester\(s All these processes take place in parallel at each place and we use the operation for synchronization The details of the algorithm are given in Algorithm 3 The join results at each place can be looked up after all the values of the query keys have been pushed back Since the query keys and their respective values are held in order inside arrays we can easily look up the keys in the corresponding hash tables to organize the matched join results as shown in Algorithm 4 In the meantime we scan the of each key in the local hash table and output the corresponding non-matched results The entire outer join process terminates when all individual activities terminate For our purposes the X10 implementation of the two algorithms PRPD+Dup and PRPD+DER are as described in the previous section Additionally for the part of PRPD implementation we add a process on to measure the skew wherein we use a counter with two parameters 1  namely the ratio of the tuples to be sampled and 2  namely the number of occurrences of a key in the sample after which the corresponding tuples are considered as skew tuples Count Matches and Return Queried Values 1  2 Initialize hashmap array[v 3 to tuples 5 Put all into to to at place Results Lookups 1  2 to in Our evaluation platform is the in IBM Research Ireland Each computation unit of this cluster is an iDataPlex node with two 6-core Intel Xeon X5679 processors running at 2.93 GHz resulting in a total of 12 cores per physical node Each node has 128GB of RAM and a single 1TB SATA hard-drive and nodes are connected by Gigabit Ethernet The operating

system is Linux kernel version 2.6.32-220 and the software stack consists of X10 version 2.3 compiling to C and gcc version 4.4.6 The evaluation is implemented on two relations and  which are both two-column tables that are populated with random data The key and payload are both set to 8-byte integers The cardinality of R is set to 64M tuples 1 and S to 1B tuples Joins with such characteristics are common in data warehouses column-oriented architectures and nonrelational stores Three key distributions are examined in our tests uniform low skew and high skew Skew is only present on and follows a Zipf distribution The skew tuples are evenly distributed on each computing node and the skew factor is set to 1 for the low skew top ten popular keys appear 14 of the time and 1.4 for the high skew dataset top ten popular keys appear 68 of the time For the two skewed two datasets the selectivity factor for joins is set to 100 as default We set the to the number of cores and to 1 namely one place for a single activity which avoids the overhead of context switching at runtime The parameter is set to 10 and the is set to a reasonable number 100 based on preliminary results In all experiments we only count the number of join results but do not actually output them Moreover we record the mean value based on ve measurements and we empty the le system cache between tests to minimize the effects of caching by the operating system We examined the runtime of four algorithms the basic hash-based algorithm referred as Hash PRPD+Dup PRPD+DER and our QC approach We implement these tests using 16 nodes 192 cores of the cluster on the default datasets with different skew The results in Figure 5 show that 1 when is uniform the rst three algorithms perform nearly the same and much better than our QC implementation 2 with low skew PRPD+DER becomes the fastest and our approach is better than the other two methods and 3 with high skew our approach outperforms the other three In this process the method PRPD+DER performs very well under skew which con途ms our expectation in Section II-D At the same time the PRPD+Dup implementation shows the worst poor performance under skew even worse than Hash which means that skew handling techniques designed for inner joins can not always be applied for outer joins directly 1 Throughout this paper when referring to tuples M and methods the runtime of PRPD+Dup increases even more sharply than Hash while PRPD+DER decreases with skew and shows its robustness against skew This con途ms that state-of-theart optimization for outer joins can bring in signi田ant performance improvements QC performs the best under high skew conditions where conventional methods fail As such our method can be considered as a supplement for the existing schemes In fact the optimizer in a system could pick the correct implementation based on the skew of the input so as to minimize runtime We also examine how join selectivity affects the performance for each algorithm For both the low skew and high skew distributions we created two different that have the same cardinality as the default dataset but only 50 and 0 of the tuples join with a tuple in  The results for the low skew dataset are presented in Figure 6 There the PRPD+Dup algorithm shows lower runtime with decreasing selectivity and the runtime of the other three methods does not change or slightly decreases This is reasonable 1 PRPD+Dup has to process the intermediate matched join results the number of which depends on the join selectivity 2 the transfer and join operations in Hash remain the same with different selectivity 3 though the number of the non-matched results increases with decreasing selectivity PRPD+DER only needs to redistribute the non-matching row-ids for  which remains small because is always small and 4 the number of operations on and the nal decreases with decreasing selectivity leading to slightly performance

Performance regarding communication costs is evaluated by measuring the number of received tuples We implement our test on 192 cores and collect the received tuples keys at each place by inserting counters The results of the average number of received tuples for each place are shown in Figure 8 We can see that all the four algorithms receive the same number of tuples when the dataset is uniform This is reasonable since all tuples in Hash PRPD+Dup and PRPD+DER are processed only by redistribution as there is no skew and the number of query keys is equal to the number of total keys in our QC algorithm With the increase in skew the received tuples in Hash and PRPD+Dup does not change In contrast PRPD+DER and our method show a signi田ant decrease demonstrating they can handle the skew We analyze the load balancing of each algorithm based on the metric  The reason is that this number can indicate both the communication and computation time cost The more tuples a place receives the more time will be spent on data transfer and join build and probe operations at this place Though we have to push the values back and implement the in our QC algorithm the number of returned values is the same as the received keys which has the same effect for load balancing As the place that receives the maximum number of tuples dominates the nal runtime we just report results of the maximum and average numbers for this metric which is shown in Table I We can see that all four algorithms achieves perfect load balancing when the dataset is uniform As the skew increases the load balancing of the hash-based algorithm and PRPD+Dup becomes much worse In the meantime though PRPD+DER shows much improvement for that condition our QC approach still much better than PRPD+DER We test the scalability of our implementation by varying number of processing cores under skew from 24 cores 2

and the number of looked up elements returned values at each place is very small in our tests resulting in a nal lookup cost in the order of seconds VI C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we have introduced a new outer joins algorithm  which speci田ally targets processing outer joins with high skew We have presented an implementation of our approach using the X10 system Our experimental results show that our implementation is scalable and can ef田iently handle skew Compared to the state-of-art PRPD+DER techniques 12 our algorithm is faster with less network communication under high skew We will combine our method with approaches that partition data according to key skew in the future so as to achieve more robustness and higher performance on outer joins Moreover we intend to apply our approach in the semantic web domain where workloads present very high skew A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is supported by Irish Research Council and IBM Research Ireland R EFERENCES  C Kim T  Kalde we y  V  W  Lee E Sedlar  A D Nguyen N Satish J Chhugani A Di Blas and P Dubey Sort vs hash revisited fast join implementation on modern multi-core cpus

Figure 9 The runtime breakdown of the QC algorithm under skews by varying number of cores with selectivity factor  nodes up to 192 The results are shown in Figure 9 Each phase is consistent with the implementation explained in Section IV-B We can see that the implementation generally scales well with the number of cores Doubling number of cores brings in 1.30x 1.44x speedup for the low skew dataset and 1.68x 1.92x for high skew In detail phases 1 2 and 4 scale well and phase 3 is slightly affected by increasing number of cores The reason would be that the number of received query keys at each place does not obviously change with increasing number of cores in phase 3 This leads in little change in the time cost on the corresponding operations such as hash table lookups and pushing returned values For example if there are 2M skew tuples with the same key 1 at each place over 48 cores then the rst place will receive 48 keys 1 in phase 3 Although the number of tuples with key 1 decreases to 1M at each place when using 96 cores the received query key 1 at the rst place will increase to 96 greater than the previously 48 And such increase will be leveraged by the decrease of the non-skewed query keys received at this node Finally we note that cost of the fourth phase is very small under high skew The reason is that both the size of hash tables in

  15   module Trade studies of performance with respect to required delta chief orbit and the cost of ground operations support form important considerations in the design of the cluster architectures, and will be studied. Global designs will also need to consider the biome spread of the Earth so that the clusters are in optimal configuration when they fly over the appropriate biomes Finally this work can be extended to calculate many geophysical parameters beyond snow albedo such as vegetation GPP and radiative forcing of clouds to demonstrate the impact of improved BRDF using clusters on critical science application s  7  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   The authors are grateful to the following people for very useful discussions on the topics presented in this paper Warren Wiscombe  Jacqueline LeMoigne Alexis Lyapustin and Ralph Kahn from NASA GSFC Marco Sabatini from Universit\340 degli Studi di Trento in Italy David Miller from MIT and Thomas Hilker from Oregon State University   R EFERENCES   1   autonomous and distributed scatter manoeuvres for  Acta Astronaut vol. 82, no. 1, pp 95 109, Jan. 2013 2    System F6 Program Value-Centric Design  Proceedings of the AIAA Space Conference Anaheim, California, 2010 3  S Nag    crowdsourcing spaceflight software and STEM  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2012 4  S Nag   J   G  Katz   a n d  A   Saen z Oter o    STEM ed  Acta Astronaut  vol 83 no 0 pp 145 174 Feb 2013  5   spacecraft reorientation for earth orbiting clusters  Acta Astronaut vol. 53 no. 11, pp. 863 877, Dec. 2003 6   satellite systems for Multi-angular Multi-spectral  Proceedings of the 64th International Astronautical Congress  Beijing China, 2013 7   of Nano-satellite Cluster Formations for Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function  AIAAUSU Conf.
