I INTRODUCTION With the increasing popularity of multimedia applications over wireless links Quality of Service QoS support has become a critical demand for next generation Wireless Local Area Networks WLANs 
The recent IEEE 802.11e Enhanced Distributed Channel Access EDCA 1 provides service differentiation with a priority-based medium access control MAC mechanism A link layer Automatic Repeat reQuest ARQ scheme is used to retransmit the corrupted packets due to channel errors or collisions Retries will continue until either the corresponding acknowledgement is received or the retry count reaches a predefined limit However this scheme may not be effective under a fading channel with correlated errors where there is a high probability that bad channel condition continues for a certain period when a transmission error occurs In that case the channel may stay in a deep fade on the 
order of multiple frame transmission durations The frame drop rate and delay will considerably increase due to consecutive retransmission failures and the bandwidth is wasted from a system point of view as useless messages occupy the channel Cooperative communication is becoming a promising technology for wireless networks 2 by exploiting multipath fading instead of mitigating its impact Single antenna devices can share their antennas in a cooperative manner to emulate a Multi-Input Multi-Output MIMO system and exploit the 978-1-4244-2644-7/08/$25.00 2512008 IEEE spatial diversity benefits traditionally realized by an antenna array hosted on a single device Inspired by this 
A 
idea cooperative retransmission has been shown to be an effective technology to improve the reliability of wireless links 3][4][5 A retransmission could be initiated from a relay node that overheard the information packet instead of the original source Since signals from different locations undergo independent fading gains the retransmission success probability can be greatly increased by exploiting this spatial diversity In 3 a simple but effective ARQ scheme called Node-Cooperative Stop and Wait NCSW is proposed to reduce the average duration of retransmission trials Significant gain has been shown for a single sender-receiver pair by an analytical model cross-layer 
relaying protocol based on hybrid-ARQ with incremental redundancy termed Hybrid-ARQ-Based INtra\255 cluster GEographic Relaying HARBINGER is proposed in 4 The nodes decoding the data use Global Positioning System GPS to identify their positions relative to the destination and the one closest to the destination will relay the frame In 5 a Cooperative communication MAC CMAC is proposed to improve link reliability for WLANs Two transmission queues are maintained in each node One is the data queue for its own outgoing data and another is the partner queue to buffer the copies of the overheard frames A higher 
priority is given to the partner queue such that the cooperative retransmission can occur before the original source retransmits To the best of our knowledge there is no scheme considering the QoS support with differentiated services Furthermore a practical and effective protocol and a system-level investigation are lack in the literature From a system perspective retransmissions from relays may equivalently increase the number of competing nodes in a system and thus may degrade the system performance if inappropriately employed In addition a distributed coordination mechanism is needed to solve the relay collision problem since there may be several nodes that 
can serve as relays In this paper we propose a novel Differentiated Cooperative MAC called DC-MAC for QoS enhancement in WLANs based on the IEEE 802.11 e architecture Retransmission priority is introduced at relays for different traffic classes A channel-aware feedback mechanism is proposed to make cooperative retransmission employed only when necessary and only by competent nodes The rest of this paper is organized as follows The details of our proposed protocol are presented in Section II In Section III simulation model and performance evaluation are discussed Conclusions are given in Section IV 


In IEEE 802.11 e EDCA 1 traffic with different priorities is mapped into several Access Categories ACs at each station Each AC has an associated transmission queue and contends for the transmission opportunity using a set of EDCA parameters the Arbitration InterFrame Space AIFS[AC minimum Contention Window size CWmin[AC maximum Contention Window size CW max  AC and maximum retry limit M retry  AC By appropriately setting access parameters for each AC service differentiation can be achieved Based on this architecture our new transmission queue model is shown in Fig 1 There are two queues at each station for its own best-effort Own Classl and real-time traffic Own Class 2 respectively In addition there is a Partner Queue PQ for each traffic category To support cooperative retransmission each partner queue should be assigned to a higher priority than its corresponding own queue for retransmissions in order to avoid wasting the bandwidth by useless retransmission from the original source and reduce the retransmission delay To support the QoS of real-time traffic the priority of the partner queue for best-effort traffic should be set between the ones of two own queues By this way the benefit of cooperative retransmission can be exploited and meanwhile service differentiation is supported Each queue has a set of its own medium access parameters and all the original regulations in the 802.11 e EDCA are inherited e.g internal collision resolution Therefore our scheme can be easily integrated into the current deployed 802.11e WLANs Higher Priority Transmission queues Per-queue EDCA functions with internal collision resolution MAC Header a Data frame b ACKINAK frame Figure 2 Proposed MAC frame formats in DC-MAC AC2 AC3 Partner Class 2 OlNtl Class 1 A CO Partner Class 1 Class 2 ACt OlNtl Since retransmissions from the partners may cause increased network load and thus intensify the station competition they should be employed only when necessary The missing of an Acknowledgement ACK frame may be caused by either a collision with other frames or a transmission Lower Priority A Transmission Queue Model B Loss Distinguishing and Channel Estimation Figure 1 Transmission queue model in OC-MAC error over wireless link A loss-distinguishing mechanism is essential for the system performance The partners should not retransmit the lost frame due to collision since this will further intensify the competition The original source has the capability of taking care of the retransmission by itself In addition up-to\255 date Channel State Information CSI between the destination and itself is needed by a partner to determine if it has the capability to help retransmission Without this information a useless retransmission from a partner may intensify the relay competition and waste the bandwidth A novel Negative AcKnowledgement NAK control frame is proposed here to solve the above two problems all at once In 802.11e each data frame consists of three basic components a MAC header a frame body and a Frame Check Sequence FCS The MAC header comprises frame control duration address sequence control and QoS control information The FCS is calculated over all the fields of the MAC header and the frame body to determine if a received frame has been successfully decoded Since the MAC header alone is much shorter than the whole frame it has a higher probability to be decoded In addition the MAC header can be transmitted at a lower rate compared to the frame body to further improve its reliability In a WLAN scenario without hidden nodes where a collision occurs only when more than one node sends data in the same slot both the header and the frame body will be corrupted due to a frame collision This observation has been used to design a loss-distinguishable MAC in 6 As in 6 a Header Check Sequence HCS is added immediately after a MAC header to verify the correctness of the MAC header as shown in Fig 2a A NAK frame is proposed to indicate the occurrence of an unsuccessful transmission due to fading II PROPOSED PROCOTOL Our proposed protocol is based on the IEEE 802.11e EDCA architecture and thus can be easily integrated into current systems Without changing the original stop-and-wait ARQ scheme in a source the neighbouring nodes overhearing the frames will help in retransmissions and thus our scheme falls into the category of decode-andforward transmission 2 Without loss of generality we consider two traffic classes in this paper one is best-effort data traffic and the other is real\255 time multimedia traffic  


denotes the SNR threshold to support a data rate Note that NAK will not waste additional bandwidth as channel has been reserved by the data frame for possible ACK transmission according to the 802.11 e standard C An example of frame transmission sequence is shown in Fig 4 When a source transmits a data frame to a destination some neighbour nodes may overhear this frame thanks to the broadcast nature of wireless medium Based on the regulation in Section n.B the destination will respond with an ACK or NAK frame or keep silent which respectively indicates the occurrence of a successful frame transmission an unsuccessful transmission due to fading channel or an unsuccessful transmission due to frame collision The neighbour nodes will help in retransmissions only if a NAK frame with good enough SNR is received The overheard data frame including its original head information will be buffered in the corresponding partner queue based on its priority If the backoff counter of one partner queue reaches 0 the frame at the head of this queue will be transmitted with the original source address in the MAC header The destination will treat the frame from a relay as the one from the original source and respond with an ACK or a NAK frame destined to the original source or keep silent The queue statuses at each node are updated in a real-time manner on hearing the ACK or NAK frames Any node receiving the ACK will check its corresponding queue own queue for the source and partner queue for the neighbour nodes and flush out the corresponding data Any node except the source receiving the NAK will capture its SNR and flush out the corresponding data in the corresponding partner queue if the SNR is no longer good enough If neither an ACK nor a NAK is received by current node in relaying it will double its contention window and enter another backoff as a frame collision occurs The number of retry attempts for a frame in a partner queue should be small to avoid burdening the network load Figure 4 An example of frame transmission sequence in DC-MAC denotes the sensed Signal\255 to-Noise Ratio SNR of the NAK frame and D 0 267\267 O       seq a Due to the distributed nature of the protocol an efficient and reliable mechanism is needed to keep the information in each node up to date avoid redundant retransmissions and enable duplicate detection For instance some relay nodes may still try to transmit the out-of-date frames that have been received by the destination due to the loss of the ACK frame The source may inappropriately drop the data frame on receiving the out-of-date ACK frame In the IEEE 802.11 e standard each data frame is assigned a sequence number from a receiver and priority specific counter This number remains constant in all the retransmissions and increments by 1 for the next frame belonging to the same priority/receiver pair The receiver will determine the received frame to be a duplicate if its sequence information matches the most recent cached entry In DC-MAC a sender may receive an ACK at its own backoff stage and thus it has to be aware of the validity and the object to be acknowledged of this ACK frame Two new fields are included in an ACK frame as shown in Fig 2b acknowledged QoS control and sequence control field which are used to identify the traffic priority and the sequence control information of the data frame to be acknowledged respectively The total overhead due to the extra frame fields including HCS field in data frame is much smaller compared to the total overhead of one data transmission When a node receives an ACK frame destined to it it will check the cached sequence number of the data frame in the corresponding transmission queue If the sequence number in ACK matches the cached one the corresponding data frame is acknowledged Otherwise the ACK is determined to be out of date and dropped To avoid redundant retransmission each partner will replace the old frame with the new one if a data frame with the latest sequence number is overheard from the same sender In practical implementation a sequence number is produced from a single module-4096 counter A small window

channel The Partner Class 1 AC 1 2 CW  1 mis 38 frames are dropped in 802.11e due to exceeded retransmission threshold A transmitter can only see a single realization of the channel within its retransmission duration and thus ARQ scheme based on time diversity cannot help DC\255 MAC solves this problem by exploiting spatial diversity Facilitated by real-time channel estimation in DC-MAC a very high retransmission successful probability can be achieved by retransmitting the frames from a competent relay To clarify the effects of retransmission priorities at relays we investigate a mixed traffic scenario where four stations with uplink background UDP traffic and one station with uplink video traffic are symmetrically placed on the circle Idle stations move continuously and randomly within the circle at a constant speed of 1 mls To clearly show the performance differences each flow is saturated Le it always has a frame awaiting transmission We can see in Fig 6 that the sizes of CW min at relays for different traffic classes can significantly affect the relative performance ratio of these traffic classes When CW 2 is fixed the performance of video flow is improved as CW 1

III SIMULATION RESULTS AND ANALYSIS We implement the proposed protocol in OPNET 11.5 7 and compare it with the original 802.11e EDCA The effects of the key parameters of DC-MAC are identified We simulate an 802.11 b WLAN consisting of an Access Point AP several stations with uplink traffic and 20 idle stations which may potentially act as relays All the idle stations are randomly distributed within a circle of radius 120m while the AP is located at the centre of this circle We have assumed two types of traffic flows video streams and background UDP traffic which are transmitted from own queue 2 AC2 and own queue 1 ACO respectively The set of prioritized access parameters used in simulations are shown in Table I For purpose of comparison the default parameters defined in OPNET are used for both own queues The basic 802.11 parameters used are shown in Table II The channel simulation model proposed in 8 is incorporated into OPNET to simulate a the average period of time for which

metrics are evaluated 225 Throughput Total data traffic in bits/sec successfully received and forwarded to the higher layer by each AC 225 MAC Delay From the time a frame arrives at the head of the transmission queue to the time it is successfully transmitted or dropped by the MAC We first evaluate the impact of the channel coherence time that is inversely proportional to the maximum Doppler shift and determined by the maximum velocity of objects in environment To clarify the effects of different aspects separately we only consider one station with uplink video traffic travelling along a straight line to and from the AP at a constant speed of mls in an oscillatory motion The distance between them varies between 80m and 120m The traffic is generated at a rate of 400 Kbps with a frame

 back then visit those pages in the log with IECaptureViewer, our tool to view and scrub through the data logs and screenshots.  \(See Figure 5 for the log viewing tool used.\happened, all participants but one had searches on days 2, 4 and 6.  In the one missing case, the next prior search event was used \(substituting day 3 for day 4 For each of the days in question, the experimenter would jump to the first search query made on that day and show it to the participant.  \(Note that jumping to the screen image in question was important, as to avoid showing the participant later screen images that would have shown them the sequence of events The experimenter then asked the participant to describe what happened next in the search process  The participant was instructed to describe the next event if they felt reasonably confident that they knew what happened While the participant was not prompted for a particular kind of answer, we noted possible variations on their answer. Was the search successful with this query alone?  Did the participant have to continue searching after this point in time? If they continued, did they have to continue refining the current query or do something else entirely?  This free form question made it easy to assess whether or not the participant could recall the situation at all If the participant could not recall, then the experimenter would go forward in time, replaying one event image after another until the participant could recollect what was going on and was able to predict what the next search event would be We were measuring the participant s ability to speak accurately about the next major event in their search process.  That is, having cued their retrospective memory of an event, we measured their ability to recall the next step in the process.  In nearly all cases, the judgment by the research was clear and evident: either the participant could accurately predict what was coming up in the log, or they just couldn t say.  Rarely did a participant guess and feel confident Results For each participant we had two measures the number of correct predictions based on a cued recall, and the number of times they had to go to the next-page before they could recollect what was going on in the search As can be seen in Figure 3, seven of the eight participants could accurately predict the next search event after two days.  That s not terribly surprising given that searches are relatively infrequent \(in this participant pool, the average number of searches / week was 11\ search done two days ago is relatively recent and stands out by its relative rarity among the total number of web events However, as we tested farther into the past \(4 days and 6 days out\t recall was still quite good Even after nearly a week, participants were able to recall the next search event correctly 75% of the time With the additional prompting of advancing to the next page in their cached screenshots using the IE Capture Viewer, participants can recall accurately after seeing only 3 additional screen images taken from the log/screen files   Figure 3. The number of correct next event predictions drops after 2 days, but is still at 75 correct It was clear during the interviews that participants really could recollect not just the next event, but also how this search fit into the larger story of what was going on at the time.  Even after 6 days, participants were able to not just make a prediction about the next event, but also complete the story and say whether or not the entire task \(of which search was just a part\was successful or not 6.  DISCUSSION In Study #1 we discovered that the use of IE Capture enabled our participants to richly and confidently talk about events that happened in the course of their web use.  Even the absence of certain kinds of events, such as the diminution in the use of a particular feature, was available for discussion and introspection Intriguingly, during the interviews, participants seemed able to speak with assurance about what had happened even quite a while ago.  But questions about the accuracy of the recalled memories kept worrying us That concern led to Study #2 and an attempt to measure the accuracy of the recollections  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


 Figure 4. As the time since last search increases, the average number of next-pages needed to correctly recall the next search event increases Note that even after 6 days, only 3 next-pages are needed to get to completely accurate recall  As became quickly clear, participants were not only able to make accurate predictions about particular events for which they had not been pre-conditioned to attend, but that it was the presence of the cueing screen images that was causing the effect.  More than one participant commented on the inclusiveness of the screen images: because they could often see other windows in the background \(the corner of the Excel spreadsheet, say\ those tiny peripheral context cues would give them a distinct sense of time, activity and place.  [1  A particularly difficult part of the protocol described here is that the recollection process begins on the first query in a search session.  While beginning on the initial query makes the questions unambiguous, it also requires that the participant remember the context that leads up to the query as cued by that single instance.  In our next trials, we plan on backing up two or three pages in order to give our participants a bit more of the temporal context as a way of improving recall even more One possible confound that we noted \(but were luckily able to avoid in this study\ was the potential for confusion over repeated searches.  As others have noted  repeate d s earch es are f a irl y co m m o n W h en  w e  were selecting queries from the participant s log, we took care to avoid queries that had been repeated, as it would be difficult for the participant to reconstruct what happened on that particular instance of the search \(as opposed to other instances within the past few days In the course of our studies, we have actually run many more participants than we tested for this paper.  To date, we now have experience with more than 30 participants, and have been struck both by how well people remember their previous search history when retrospectively cued.  Without cueing or just by cueing with web log history entries, recollection is very low after one day We have also been impressed by the discovery in Study #2 that participants seem to forget about the presence of the IE Capture logger after about four days As we noted in Study #1, people do seem to slightly modify their behavior within the first 3 to 4 days after installation.  There is also compensatory behavior after being reminded of its presence, as when the participant manually causes an upload event to occur Few people disabled IE Capture after it was initially turned on.  This suggests both that participants did not find it to be invasive and that its performance did not affect machine behavior substantially.  In fact, in one memorable instance, we discovered IE Capture was still running in the background of one participant s computer 90 days after the experiment.  Before turning it off, we took advantage of the situation to do a study of 30, 60 and 90 day post recollections and then going through the same protocol as before.  We repeated the experimental design from above, locating searches done 30, 60 and 90 days in the past.  Surprisingly, we found that our participant could recall many of the search events from as long as 90 days ago, albeit with many more next-page looks at the surrounding context.  In each case, after looking at a few surrounding pages, the participant would exclaim oh yes that search and then proceed to describe the rest of the session fairly accurately This unexpected anecdote gives us confidence that memories for the relatively recent past, say within the past week or two as measured in our studies can be relied upon as a source of correct behavioral information 7.  CONCLUSION Using a lightweight, passive longitudinal study method for capturing screenshots with log data, then conducting later interviews using the screenshots as retrospective cues, we were able to collect accurate contextual information from participants with little effort on their part. Participant dropout rates also seem to be lower than traditional longitudinal studies. From a researcher perspective, the data analysis can be completed more quickly and the recollections of the participants are fairly certain to be accurate While the results of this logging method are promising, privacy concerns for participants make it a bit more difficult to recruit for studies. While we have had reasonably good experience in recruiting participants, we have had to be very clear in explaining what is happening and the data retention policies.  These privacy concerns must be kept in consideration when recruiting participants to ensure proper lead team for recruitment and that any potential participants are properly briefed on the data being collected Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


 Once explained clearly, the use of the screenshot logger and the retrospective cued recall method seems promising as a way of quietly collecting longitudinal behavioral data accurately 8.

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
