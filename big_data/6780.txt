MapReduce and workîows static scheduling strategies fall short for continuous dataîows due to the variations in the input data rates and the need for sustained throughput The elastic resource provisioning of cloud infrastructure is valuable to meet the changing resource needs of such continuous applications However multi-tenant cloud resources introduce yet another dimension of performance variability that impacts the applicationês throughput In this paper we propose 
PLAStiCC 
 an adaptive scheduling algorithm that balances resource cost and application throughput using a prediction-based lookahead approach It not only addresses variations in the input data rates but also the underlying cloud infrastructure In 
addition we also propose several simpler static scheduling heuristics that operate in the absence of accurate performance prediction model These static and adaptive heuristics are evaluated through extensive simulations using performance traces obtained from Amazon AWS IaaS public cloud Our results show an improvement of up to 20 in the overall proìt as compared to the reactive adaptation algorithm

I I NTRODUCTION There has been a tremendous rise in the capability to collect data  pervasively and continuously  for a wide 
range of application domains such as nancial trading social networks and cyber-physical systems CPS like Smart Power Grids and Smart Transportation Consequently there is increasing attention on data analytics frameworks that perform continuous data processing with low latency and guaranteed throughput Batch processing 2 that deal with high volumes of slow changing data abound In contrast continuous applications are characterized by data streaming with high velocity and at variable rates on which multiple stages of information integration and analytics are performed They offer online insight to domain experts or their digital agents to help detect and prevent frauds power outages or security situations as may be the case Runtime environments for such applications demand 
 to meet the userês quality of service QoS requirements Cloud computing platforms especially Infrastructure-asa-Service IaaS provide exible on-demand resources Their elastic resource provisioning is well suited to scale resources at runtime in response to changing needs of continuous applications Several stream processing framew  5 and adapti v e pro visioning algorithms[6 7 8 utilize this online elasticity to balance resource cost against application performance in response to changing data rates However cloud infrastructure exhibit 
continuous adaptation of user logic and dynamic scaling of resources under changing stream workloads performance variability 
for virtualized resources e.g CPU disk network as well as services e.g NoSQL store message queues both over time and space These variations may be caused by factors including shared resources and multi-tenancy changing workloads in the data center as well as diversity and placement of commodity hardw F or time sensiti v e continuous dataîow applications it becomes imperative to address such uctuations in performance to ensure that the desired QoS is maintained Strategies may range from simple over-provisioning and replication to dynamic application re and pre-empti v e migration[10 Proactive management of application and resource mapping is possible with predictive models that can forecast resource behavior Several performance models have been 
proposed for computational Grid infrastructure that also exhibit similar performance v These models use the network topology and workload characterization to estimate the behavior of speciìc Grid 13 Similar models have also been developed for short and medium term predictions of performance metrics for virtual machines with varying degrees of prediction conìdence using techniques such as discrete-time Markov Given the ability to elastically control Cloud resources and the existence of resource performance prediction models the question arises 
How can we re-plan the allocation of elastic resources for dynamic continuous applications at runtime to mitigate the impact of resource and workload variability 
In answering this question we consider continuous dataîows as the abstraction used to compose these continuous applications In our previous w we proposed adaptive scheduling heuristics for online task re-composition of dynamic and continuous dataîows as well as allocation and scaling of cloud resources However these strategies to changes in workloads and resource variations to ensure QoS targets were met In this paper we leverage the knowledge of future resource and workload behavior to plan resource allocation and thus limit costly and

frequent runtime adaptation We propose a new Predictive Look-Ahead Scheduling algorithm for Continuous dataîows on Clouds   that uses short term workload and infrastructure performance predictions to actively manage resource mapping for continuous dataîows to meet QoS goals while limiting resource costs We also offer as alternatives simpler scheduling heuristics that enhance the reactive strategy from our prior work The speciìc contributions of the paper are as follows 1 We analyze performance traces for public and private Cloud VMs to highlight spatio-temporal variations  II These motivate our problem while offering insights to build resource forecasting models however the modeling itself is beyond the scope of this paper 2 We build upon our prior continuous dataîow abstraction  III to formalize look-ahead scheduling on Clouds as an optimization problem  IV 3 We propose several scheduling heuristics for elastic resources including PLAStiCC that leverage short and medium term performance predictions  V 4 The proposed heuristics are evaluated through extensive simulations that use real performance traces from AWS public cloud VMs for a representative synthetic continuous dataîow with different workloads VI II A NALYSIS OF C LOUD P ERFORMANCE V ARIABILITY Performance variations present in virtualized and multitenant infrastructures like Clouds make it challenging to run time-sensitive applications such as continuous dataîows Several studies have observed such variations both within and across Their cause is attrib uted to f actors including multi-tenancy evolving hardware generations in the data center placement of VMs on the physical infrastructure hardware and software maintenance cycles and so on In this section further empirical evidence of such performance variation both on public and on private clouds is offered that motivates the need for our proposed predictive lookahead scheduling algorithm Two Cloud providers are considered  a private academic IaaS Cloud running and Clouds supporting over 150 research projects 1  and  a popular public commercial IaaS Cloud The experimental setup consists of running three groups of VMs 20 Eucalyptus and 10 OpenStack VMs on FutureGrid and 10 EC2 VMs on Amazon over 1Ö26 day period Each VMês class was equivalent to Amazonês  with one dedicated virtual CPU core and 1024 MB of memory Standard CPU disk and memory benchmarks are run on each VM every 2 mins and a peerto-peer network benchmark between the VMs measure TCP connection time packet latency and bandwidth Here we focus only on the CPU and network performance metrics since our proposed algorithms only account for these 1 https://portal.futuregrid.org/projects-statistics In our analysis we focus on two speciìc aspects First we analyze the overall average performance deviation over a period of time relative to the performance and second we analyze the performance uctuations observed between two consecutive time slots of 2 mins each The former motivates the need for dynamic adaptations in general while the latter motivates the need for proactive look-ahead scheduling to minimize the thrashing phenomenon i.e reversal of resource provisioning decisions observed in the reactive versions The observed instantaneous performance for a VM in each of these group i.e eucalyptus openstack or AWS is normalized to by dividing it by the best observed rated performance for that metric in that particular group Although the absolute performance for each of the VM groups differ we do not consider that in our analysis since we assume single cloud deployment for an application First we analyze the overall average performance across different VMs Figure 1\(a shows the cumulative distribution function for the normalized average CPU core performance across all VMs in each of the three VM groups The Y axis shows the cumulative fraction of the number of VMs whose observed performance is less than the normalized performance on the X axis We see that all three VM groups show signiìcant variations in performance with the EC2 VMs on Amazonês public Cloud showing the highest variations possibly due to greater data center diversity and high multi-tenancy and utilization of physical resources Speciìcally of EC2 VMs have a normalized core performance of  while of the FutureGrid VMs exhibit this shortfall possibly due to more uniform physical resources Similar variations are also seen in the network performance measures when considering all VM pairs over time we do not plot this in the interests of space In brief we see a high deviation in normalized packet latency with more than of the VM pairs exhibiting less than  and of VMs have a normalized bandwidth of less than  These can punitively impact the exchange of small messages by streaming applications Second we also analyze the transient and sharp uctuations in performance i.e high amplitude of  small duration both in CPU as well as network performance for the same VM Figure 1\(b shows the percentage change unsigned in average normalized CPU performance between two consecutive time slots Larger the  value of the X Axis Left greater the variation in performance between consecutive periods and more pronounced are the performance uctuations For example in of the observations the performance changes by across consecutive time slots for an EC2 VM We see similar performance uctuations for future grid eucalyptus and openstack deployments Further the extent of variations is different across VMs Figure 1\(c shows a box-and-whiskers plot with the Y axis representing the average normalized CPU performance for each time slot and the X axis representing different

and quartiles and the indicates outliers   We also observe signiìcant uctuations in network characteristics as shown in gure 2 A detailed discussion is omitted for brevity Such performance uctuations and outliers mean that the immediate past performance of a resource may not be sustained in the immediate future and assuming so will cause sub-optimal resource allocation strate In particular such transient performance changes can cause decisions that need to be unrolled soon after Thus a look ahead adaptation strategy that not only accounts for the performance variations across VMs but is also resilient to such short term uctuations is warranted III P RELIMINARIES B ACKGROUND We introduce the abstraction of continuous and dynamic dataîows and summarize our existing work on reactive scheduling of such dataîows on Clouds with infrastructure v W e b uild upon this for our current contrib ution on pro-active scheduling with look ahead A is a directed acyclic graph  where is a set of  a dataîow edge between and is a set of dataîow between the PEs and and are the sets of input PEs without an incident channel and output PEs without an outgoing channel respectively Each PE is a long-running compute unit processing data messages from the incoming channels and producing data messages on the outgoing channels This DAG-based application composition model prevalent in various domains provides a exible abstraction to build complex continuous dataîow Continuous dataîows are extended to dynamic dataîows that allow run-time application re-composition in response to the domain triggers They also provide an additional dimension of control to schedule the dataîow to balance application QoS resource cost and application value The main characteristic of a is the set of a v ailable for indi vidual PEs This lets the user deìne more than one alternate implementation for each PE All alternates for a PE perform the same logical operation but with a different trade-off between the domain perceived value and the resource needs Only one alternate is active for a PE and the choice of an alternate does not impact the dataîow correctness nor does changing it while the continuous dataîow is executing Each alternate of a PE   has as associated relative domain value  resource requirement  and selectivity  The   is the domain perceived relative beneìt of activating that alternate for a given PE relative to its best available alternate where is a user-deìned positive valued function e.g the statistical measure In a timestep  the for the entire dataîow is the aggregation of all active alternates values one for each PE in that duration The   is the number of coreseconds required to process a single incoming message by an alternate on a reference CPU core The is an infrastructure speciìc unit of computing in a heterogeneous Cloud environment This allow us to use a simple linear scaling to obtain the processing requirements for that alternate on other benchmarked CPUs For e.g given an alternate with for a reference 1 Ghz core the processing latency on another CPU core x benchmarked at 1.8 Ghz is given by    is the ratio of the number of messages by the alternate to the number of messages by it to complete a logical unit of operation by that alternate Selectivity determines the message load on the downstream PEs in the dataîow The impact of an alternate on overall dataîow cost is thus its own resource cost and its contribution to the cost of downstream PEs The dataîow application is deployed in a distributed en One alternate is acti v e for each PE at deployment and the scheduler can switch between alternates during the applicationês runtime Several of an alternate can run in parallel across independent cores while instances may inter-communicate through some persistence

core The QoS of the application is measured by the   which is the ratio of observed output throughput to the maximum achievable output throughput given the incoming data rate to the dataîow The observed throughput depends on the number of instances of each PE and the resources assigned to them The dataîowês lifetime is divided into of duration  and the user speciìes as a QoS constraint the relative throughput  to be met for each  The   for the application deployment is deìned as  where is the normalized application value and is the dollar cost incurred by the application both deìned over each optimization period  and is the deìned as Value Value Cost Cost where and are the maximum and minimum application values while and represents acceptable costs at those maximum and minimum values respectively The user or administrator speciìes the acceptable cost parameters while the application values are obtained by selecting different alternates for the dynamic dataîow The optimization goal for scheduling dynamic continuous dataîows thus is to maximize the overall proìt  while meeting the user deìned QoS constraint for each optimization period To achieve the optimization goal the scheduler can at runtime 1 switch the alternate for a PE 2 change the number of instances for an alternate and 3 select the Cloud VMs on which instances are deployed These can be in response i.e reactive to changes in the incoming data rates and variability in infrastructure behavior or even the schedulerês prior sub-optimal decision that cause a deviation from the goal Our prior work on a reactive scheduling discussed in brief here forms the basis for the proposed PLAStiCC algorithm V The scheduling algorithm has two In the  the algorithm uses the rated performance for the Cloud resources and estimated data rate suggested by the user and allocates resources to each PE This determines the initial alternates that are active the number of data parallel instances of each the number and size of VMs to be launched and the mapping of PE instances to these VMs In the  the scheduler continuously monitors the dataîow and infrastructure measuring the current relative throughput incoming data rates and the CPU performance for and bandwidth between different VMs Based on these performance metrics it can decide to change the active alternates and scale up/down the number of VMs and PE instances to balance the QoS against resource cost and the application value The reactive has tw o independent stages and  The former selects feasible alternates for each PE such that they do not require any changes to the resources required This depends not only on the active alternates but also on the current resource performance It then picks the alternate for a PE with the highest value relative to its cumulative cost i.e the sum of its own resource needs and resources needed by downstream PEs due to its selectivity Resource re-deployment on the other hand preserves the active alternates while it scales up/down the number of instances of the alternates and launches/releases VMs Here the heuristic makes several decisions   and These decisions affect the overall application QoS its value the resource cost The reactiveness is because the scheduler assumes that the observed data rates and resource performance will sustain in the future Although this reactive algorithm mitigates the effects of variations in workload and infrastructure performance due to its myopic nature is susceptible to spikes and short term uctuations in the VMs performance This leads to adaptation decisions e.g launching a new VM in response to a performance drop that need to be reversed in the near future once the VMês performance is regained Besides adding to the scheduling overhead it increases the cost of Cloud resources that are billed by the hour

IV P ROBLEM F ORMULATION Reactive scheduling can be mapped to a constrained utility maximization problem applied to continuous dataîo We deìne the pro-active as a reìnement of this by including predictions for the incoming data rates and performance of the underlying infrastructure In contrast the reactive problem only has access to the current snapshot of the behavior We deìne a xed optimization period over which the application schedule is to be optimized while satisfying the QoS constraint may be the duration of the application lifetime or some large time duration is divided into a number of xed length timesteps  The initial deployment decision based on the rated infrastructure performance and user estimated data rates is done at the start of timestep  the system is monitored during and runtime decisions performed at the start of timestep  Figure 3\(a shows the deìned over an optimization period  The proìt i.e utility function to maximize  is deìned over the normalized application value and the total resource cost over the entire period  Similarly the application throughput constraint is deìned over the average throughput observed over  Consequently the instantaneous at a given time may not satisfy the given constraint though the average is satisìed by the end of  This problem is modiìed for pro-active as follows Since prediction algorithms are often accurate only over short horizons i.e near future and to reduce the time complexity of the problem we reduce the above global optimization to a set of smaller local optimization problems Figure 3\(b First the optimization period is divided into  each of size equal to the length of the prediction horizon given by the prediction model oracle As before we divide each interval into timesteps atthe start of which the adaptation decisions are made Next a stricter version of the application constraint is deìned requiring it be satisìed for each prediction interval  i.e  It is evident that if this constraint is satisìed for each interval it will be satisìed over the optimization period however the converse may not hold Further we cannot deìne for each interval since it is cumulative over the resource cost and the VM provisioning may span multiple prediction intervals Rather we optimize the proìt calculated so far given as the cumulative average over each of the previous intervals i.e  where is the cumulative cost till prediction interval  While conciseness precludes a formal proof it can be shown by contradiction that the global proìt function deìned earlier is equivalent to  where is the last prediction interval in the optimization period  The look-ahead optimization problem described above assumes a prediction oracle that can predict into the  002  002 003 002 004 002 005 002

only at the start of each prediction interval Further anytime a new improved prediction is available we slide the prediction interval window to that point and re-plan actions for the all its timesteps retracting the prior planned actions This sliding window of replanning does not change the optimization problem except that the optimization decisions planed in one interval may be altered in the succeeding interval if improved predictions are available However note that this is different from the reversal of decisions in the reactive version since the decisions there are enacted immediately for the next timestep whereas in the look-ahead version the replanning may just change a future planned action and hence not incur any resource penalty V S CHEDULING H EURISTICS As with reactive scheduling  III-B the look-ahead scheduling consists of two phases the which maps the application to VMs in the Cloud assuming rated performance and estimated incoming data rate and the which alters the resource allocation and alternates to account for the observed and predicted behavior In this paper we retain our earlier initial deployment and focus on the latter  As such the impact of the initial deployment is amortized by the runtime adaptation for long running dataîows We propose a look-ahead algorithm  which uses the predicted resource performance and data rates to generate the adaptation plan for a near future Further we propose several heuristics that use simpler averaging models to estimate performance and data rates These while out-performing reactive scheduling in some cases offer different trade-offs than PLAStiCC VI

The PLAStiCC algorithm is run at the start of each prediction interval It plans a set of adaptation actions for timesteps in that interval to maximize the cumulative proìt while meeting the constraint for that interval The key intuition is to identify the farthest timestep in the current interval for which the existing deployment meets the QoS constraint for messages expected in that interval given the performance and data rate predictions The timestep indicates the future timestep beyond which the current deployment fails to meet the QoS Once identiìed we replan the deployment starting at the cross-over timestep and recursively repeat the process till the last timestep of the interval The result of this algorithm is zero or more cross-over timesteps identiìed in the interval where the QoS constraint fails and the planned adaptation action to be taken at that timestep Algorithm 1 shows the PLAStiCC runtime adaptation algorithm It takes as input the continuous dataîow DAG  the predicted data rate for each input PE as a time series for timesteps in the interval and the predicted VM performance time series for each  which includes CPU and inter-VM network behavior The algorithm outputs a plan of actions to be taken at timesteps in the prediction interval  PLAStiCC is called as and when new predictions are made It is run before the rst timestep  of the prediction interval and tries to identify the farthest cross-over timestep The algorithm maintains two pointers  which is the last-known cross-over timestep in the interval initially blank and  the last timestep of the interval set to  It tries to locate the last timestep when the aggregate constraint is met lines 5Ö13 Starting at the last timestep it calculates the aggregated throughput   by computing the processing capacity available to each PE   the cumulative incoming data messages at each PE using the predicted data rates and the network behavior   and the aggregated relative throughput resulting from these values If this aggregate throughput is not within we try the previous timestep line 12 If it is met have found the cross-over boundary between constraint being satisìed and not line 10 If the constraint is met in the rst iteration i.e at the intervalês end no adaptation is needed line 15 Once the cross-over is identiìed is set to this timestep and is reset to for the next iteration We then decide the action to be taken at the cross-over to meet the constraint For this replanning we get the aggregated values for the available resources the incoming messages and the relative throughput for the rest of the interval lines 18Ö20 Since the expected throughput is deviating for this period we either  or   lines 21Ö27 Both the S CALE U P and the S CALE D OWN functions try to balance the overall application value Sec III-A and the total application cost  The S CALE U P function rst identiìes the bottleneck PE with minimum relative throughput lying on the critical path from the input to output  It can then either switch to an alternate for this PE with lower processing needs and potentially decrease the application value or increase the number of instances and possibly increase the resource cost for the bottleneck PE This choice is based on the local optimization of the proìt function which uses the user speciìed coefìcient that determines the acceptable value:cost ratio Speciìcally the cost of increasing an instance is zero if a VM has spare cores or else is equal to the cost of a new VM Then the change in application value from switching to the alternate with next lower processing needs is calculated The change in from either of these actions is calculated and the adaptation that results in higher proìt is selected Similarly the S CALE D OWN function identiìes an overprovisioned PE and makes a choice between switching to an alternate with higher value or decreasing the number of instances whichever leads to higher proìt Once such incremental action is planned for the crossover timestep we resume evaluating the planned deployment ensure it satisìes the constraint for the rest of the interval lines 5 13 The replanning is incrementally done till all cross-over timesteps and adaptations are identiìed for the interval and the resulting plan satisìes the constraint for the entire interval Finally the algorithm performs a repacking of VMs to collocate neighboring PEs as well as shuts down those that are unused line 30 Rather than use ne-grained predictions PLAStiCC or assume that the most recent observed values will sustain reactive we develop several heuristics that use simple but intuitive estimates of future behavior and use it as a representative in the reactive algorithm This also addresses PLAStiCCês susceptibility to prediction errors since it overìts the schedule to the predictions Similar to the reactive scheduler these heuristics are executed only when the application QoS deviates from the constraint This chooses observed value in the most recent timestep as the estimated behavior for remaining timesteps This is same as the classic reactive This reacts after the-f act to the observ ed resource and data rate changes This uses the average seen over several recent timesteps as the estimated behavior This smooths out spikes while accounting for the recently observed trends that might last in the near future This averages the values predicted for all timesteps by the advanced prediction model used by PLAStiCC and uses the single average value in all timesteps in the interval This mitigates the

PLAStiCC Runtime Adaptation Heuristic 1 This too uses the advanced prediction model of PLAStiCC but picks the most favorable infrastructure performance highest and data rate lowest from among all timesteps predicted for and uses that single value for all timesteps This offsets the impact of prediction algorithm with under-prediction This heuristic usually leads to low relative throughput since it tends to under-provision resources This is similar to WPO except it picks the least favorable performance and data rate prediction as the single value This handles prediction algorithms with over-prediction This heuristic usually gives the best relative throughput since it tends to over-provision resources VI E VALUATION We evaluate PLAStiCC and other heuristics through a simulations study We extend the  data center simulator to simulates the execution of the Floe stream processing 2 http://github.com/usc-cloud/IaasSimulator  on top of IaaSSim with support for continuous dataîows alternates distributed deployment dynamic instance scaling and plugins for different schedulers For each simulation experiment we deploy a dataîow to the Cloud using FloeSim run it for 12 hours simulated using Amazon EC2ês performance traces   II  which is also the optimization period  T 12 hrs  and repeat it at least three times to get an average We use a timestep duration of t 5 mins and the prediction intervals between P 10  30 mins  We evaluate the adaptation algorithms using a synthetic dataîow in Figure 4 with 10 stages of 3 PEs each and 3 input and output data streams The dataîow is randomly perturbed to generate between 1 3 alternates each with different cost value and selectivity This gives us a total of 30 PEs and 010 45 alternates Each of the three input data streams are independently generated based on observations in domains like Smart Power Starting from a base stream with sinusoidal data rates whose peak and trough range from 75  2 messages and with wave length of 24 hrs  we add random noise every 1 min that varies the rate by up to  20  002 002 002 003\004\005\006\007\010\011\012\006\005\013\014\005\015\005\016\017\006\005\012\010\020\021 002 002 002 003\004\005\006\007\010\011\012\005\007\010\013\004\005\011\010\004\014\010\012\010\011\005\007\010\015\004\016\017\011\004 010\005\020\021\004\022\023\024\004\025\026\007\021\004\015\026\016\016\010\011\010\012\007\004\027\010\021\005\030\026\017\011\031 002 003\032\022\023\013\004\005\012\015\004\033\034\035\004\005\006\007\010\011\012\005\007\010\013\004\026\012\004\005\006\006\031 002 003\004\026\012\036\037\007\004\013\007\011\010\005 \013\004\025\026\007\021\004\013\026\012\037\013\017\026\015\005\006\004 013\007\011\010\005 \004\011\005\007\010\013\004\025\026\007\021\004\036\010\011\026\017\015\026\020\004\012\017\026\013\010\031 We evaluate the heuristics using following metrics The overall application relative throughput  003  the overall application proìt  004  and the Heuristic Stability  005  Speciìcally we verify if the heuristic satisìes the QoS constraint 003 006 004 003  A higher value of 003 beyond 004 003 is not necessarily good unless it also gives a higher overall proìt Further given two heuristics which satisfy the QoS constraint the one with a higher overall proìt is considered better Note that proìt is and can only be compared relatively chi is the frequency of deviation in instantaneous relative throughput 003 t from the 004 003  004 during the optimization period and a smaller value indicates a more stable heuristic The proposed heuristics are evaluated under different prediction oracle models First we evaluate different heuristics under a perfect oracle model that gives accurate predictions over the prediction interval We also run experiments where the predicted performance and data rate values include bounded errors 032 e  to simulate shortcomings of real world prediction models The predictions have smaller error for near timesteps and larger ones for farther timesteps First we linearly scale the error from for the current timestep  e 0 othe 2  032 e for the last timestep  e n  in the prediction interval to give a mean close to 032 e

degrading performance as the error rate increases to  We make two observations First for a given prediction interval length the performance decreases as expected as prediction error increases Second with high error values  the performance of the algorithm for a given error rate initially increases with the prediction interval length and then falls with further increase in the interval length inverse bell curve The reason for such behavior is that as we predict farther into the future the error increases But as we move into the future more accurate results are obtained and hence they lead us to reverse actions While most of these are planned actions some enacted ones may be reversed too As the error increases only prediction very close to the current time will prove accurate and hence the PLAStiCC degenerates to the reactive version Finally we compare PLAStiCC against the reactive versions which aggregate predicted values and are potentially affected by the prediction error CAF and WAAF are unaffected by prediction errors and hence skipped Figure 7 shows the overall proìt for WPA WPO WPP and PLAStiCC for different error rates and prediction biases   As seen in the gures PLAStiCC out-perform the others for smaller errors irrespective of the prediction bias while its performance degrades as the error increases since it tries to over-ìt to the predicted values WPA on the other hand performs consistently with different error rates and for different biases While the WPO algorithm which assumes an optimistic infrastructure behavior performs poorly when the prediction errors are unbiased However it performs better than WPA with under-biased predictor With lower predicted values the best performance values over the interval tend to be closer to the real performance value than the average On the other hand WPP performs poorly under all scenarios because it assumes pessimistic infrastructure behavior and hence a single dip in the predicted performance causes it to over-provision resources VII R ELATED W ORK Continuous dataîows have emerged as an extension to the Data Stream Managements systems which were focused on continuous queries over the data streams These have evolved into a general purpose abstraction that provides strong composition tools for building large scale stream processing applications Several such stream processing systems have been recently proposed such as IBM InfoSphere D-Streams[5 Storm[24 and T ime  While these systems are b uilt for lar ge scale stream processing applications and provide distributed deployment and runtime most of these with the exception of Time Stream do not provide automatic dynamic adaptations to changing data rates or performance variability of the underlying infrastructure over the applicationês lifetime The notion of alternates is similar to exible workîo It also dra ws inspiration from dynamic tasks deìned in heterogeneous where a task is composed of one or more alternatives with different characteristics such as resource requirements and dependencies However unlike these systems where the alternate to be executed is selected in advance in our dynamic continuous dataîow abstraction such decisions are made at periodic intervals based on the changing execution characteristics Time supports similar dynamic reconìguration called  which allows replacing a subgraph with another in response to the changing load This requires dependency tracking and introduces inefìciencies In contrast we restrict dynamic adaptation to single processing elements making the process of dynamic reconìguration independent for each PE and hence allow more exibility in dynamic adaptation while restricting the application composition model Our earlier work has discussed consistency models for enacting such runtime The predictive scheduling approach proposed in the paper follow the generic scheduler monitor comparator resolver approach proposed by Nof et Se v eral such predictive scheduling techniques have been studied on computation 12 ho we v er in the conte xt of batch task scheduling instead of continuous dataîows Further several performance prediction models for the Grid have been proposed to proìle workloads as well as infrastructure v Although we do not pro vide models for performance prediction in the Clouds we envision that similar performance models may be applicable is one such system which uses signature driven prediction for variations with periodic patterns and a discrete-time Markov chain based model for short-term predictions for VMs They achieve high prediction accuracy with less than 5 over-estimation error and close to zero under-prediction error We presume existence of such monitoring and prediction algorithm to be used as the basis for our look-ahead scheduling algorithm VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we analyzed the temporal and spatial performance variations observed in public and private IaaS Clouds We proposed PLAStiCC a predictive look-ahead scheduling heuristic for dynamic adaptation of continuous dataîows that responds to uctuations in stream data rates as well as variations in Cloud VM performance Through simulations we showed that the proposed PLAStiCC heuristic results in a higher overall throughput up to 20 as compared to the reactive version of the scheduling heuristic we proposed earlier and improved here which performs adaptation actions after observing the effects of these variations on the application We also studied the effect of realistic prediction models with different error bounds and biases on the proposed heuristic and identiìed scenarios where the look-ahead algorithm falls short of the reactive one

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
