Network Topology Optimization For Data Aggregation 
In this paper we show that the problem of conìguring the topology of a data center network to optimize data aggregation is NP-hard even when the number of aggregators is 1 Further the approximation ratio of the algorithm proposed by Wang Ng and Shaikh f or the case of a single aggregator is k+1 where k is the degree of ToR top-of-rack switches and this algorithm also exhibits an anomalous behaviorincrease in the switch degree may result in an increase in the aggregation time By comparison if topology conìguration is done using the longest processing time LPT scheduling rule the approximation ratio is 4/3-1/\(3k We show that for every instance of the single aggregator topology conìguration problem the time required to aggregate using the LPT conìguration is no more than that using the Wang et al rule By coupling the LPT rule with the rule of Wang et al we achieve a better throughput as promised by LPT and at the same time reduce the total network trafìc Experimental results

show that the LPT rule reduces aggregation time by up to 90 compared to the Wang et al rule The reduction in aggregation time afforded by a known improvement COMBINE of LPT relative to Wang et al is up to 90.5 More interestingly when either of the LPT rule or COMBINE is augmented with the Wang et al rule total network trafìc is reduced by up to 90 relative to using LPT and COMBINE with chains

Figure 1 Aggregation Tree prototype the one used by an earlier application In this paper we focus on network topology optimization for the data aggregation task common to many big data applications In the data aggregation problem data residing in several racks of a data center are to be aggregated into a single speciìed rack called the aggregator In general we may have several aggregators with each aggregating data 
from some subset of the racks However in this paper we limit ourselves to the case of a single aggregator Figure 1\(a shows an example aggregator tree In this gure the root   denotes the aggregator rack the remaining nodes      and  denote racks from which data is to be aggregated into the root and the edges denote optical links The shown aggregator tree requires as node uses three optical links to connect to nodes   and  To accomplish the required data aggregation each node sends its data to its parent who then sends the received data to its parent and so on until all data reach the root Suppose that node has 2Gb of data to send to the root and that nodes and each

single aggregator network topology optimization SANTO problem we are to determine a tree topology that minimizes the aggregation time subject to the constraint that the degree of every node ToR is at most  where is the number of optical links at each node ToR SANTO-NT is an extension of SANTO in which we seek a topology that minimizes total network trafìc subject to the constraint that aggregation time is minimized That is from among the topologies that minimize aggregation time obtain one with least total network trafìc In this paper we study the SANTO and SANTO-NT problems and obtain the following results SANTO is NP-hard for  From this it follows that SANTO-NT is also NP-hard for  The approximation ratio for the algorithm proposed by Wang et al for SANT O is and this bound is tight The SANTO algorithm of Wang et al may result in an increased aggregation time when the number of optical links per rack is increased SANTO may be solved by using any of the approximation algorithms proposed for minimum nish time scheduling of identical machines When the popular LPT Longest Processing Time scheduling rule  is used the approximation ratio for SANT O is  Further for every SANTO instance the aggregation time of the constructed LPT topology is no more than that of the topology constructed by the algorithm of Wang et al The COMBINE scheduling rule can also be used to solve every SANTO instance and it has an approximation ratio of  which is proved for two machines in Once again the constructed topologies always have at least as short an aggregation time as those obtained by the algorithm of Wang et al For SANTO-NT we propose using either LPT or COMBINE to partition the nodes ToRs into sets and then using the algorithm of Wang et al to arrange the nodes in each partition into a tree topology We show that this algorithm minimizes total network trafìc subject to the partitioning obtained by LPT or COMBINE We show via experimentation that LPT and COMBINE can reduce aggregation time as well as total network trafìc by up to 90 relative to the algorithm of Wang et al The remainder of this paper is organized as follows In Section II we brieîy review related work SANTO is shown to be NP-hard in Section III The approximation ratio for the SANTO algorithm of Wang et al is deri v ed in Section IV and its anomalous behavior i.e possible increase in aggregation time with increase in the number of optical links per rack is demonstrated in Section V In Section VI we show how the scheduling algorithms LPT and COMBINE may be used to obtain a tree topology for SANTO The approximation ratio for this use of the algorithms stays the same as for their native use in scheduling In Section VII we show that using the algorithm of Wang et al to obtain a tree topology for a given partitioning of nodes minimizes the total network trafìc for that partitioning Our experimental results are presented in Section VIII and we summarize our conclusions in Section IX II R ELATED W ORK Customizing data center network topology to better suit the needs of an application and thereby enhancing performance has been the focus of intense recent research For example Greenberg et al ha v e proposed the use of programmable commodity switches to reduce network cost and enhance performance through the use of Valiant Load Balancing Al-Fares et al propose using commodity Ethernet switches to support the full aggregate bandwidth of large clusters Guo et al use serv ers as nodes in the interconnect Das et al e xplore the use of OpenFlo w to control routing according to application need and Webb et al propose to isolate applications and use dif ferent routing mechanisms for them in fat-tree based data-centers The ow of big data trafìc in data center networks has also been studied For example Kavulya et al ha v e analyzed 10-months of Map-Reduce logs from the M45 supercomputing cluster at Yahoo and Benson et al have conducted an empirical study of the network trafìc in data centers that include university enterprise and cloud data centers Our work is most closely related to the work of Wang Ng and Shaikh who describe an inte grated netw ork control for big data applications that comprises OpenFlowenabled top-of-rack ToR switches Wang et al propose an algorithm for SANTO as well as for the more general case of multiple aggregators Their algorithm for SANTO has two steps In the rst step the racks are sorted into decreasing order of the amount of data they need to send to the aggregator and in the second step the racks are placed into the tree topology in this order The objective is to place racks with higher demand closer to the aggregator Consequently the tree topology used is necessarily a tree in which the root has degree and every other non-leaf node with the exception of possibly one such non-leaf has degree  III SANTO IS NPHARD An instance of SANTO is characterized by  which is the number of optical links in a ToR switch  which is the number of racks from which data is to be aggregated into the aggregator and  which is the amount of data in rack   that is to be aggregated We shall prove

Generalizing this proof to arbitrary weget So  The tightness of this bound is established by demonstrating an instance for each for which this bound is achieved Figure 2 gives these instances for  The shown instances are easily generalized to higher values of  V A NOMALOUS B EHAVIOR OF SANTO A LGORITHM O F  A surprising observation regarding the behavior of the algorithm in is that the aggre gation time may increase with increase in the number of optical links  per rack To see this consider the SANTO instance with racks and  Figure 3 shows the constructed aggregation tree for  3 and 4 The aggregation time assuming s when and when  When all s are the same and  the aggregation time for the case is 25 more than when  nodes are placed in the leftmost subtree when compared to when   where is the amount of data to be transmitted to the aggregator by the racks in subtree   of the root of the aggregator tree So to minimize the aggregation time we can use any of the many heuristics developed to partition a multiset of numbers into subsets so that the size of the largest subset is minimum This partitioning problem is identical to the well studied problem of scheduling identical and independent machines so as to minimize the nish time In this paper we focus on the LPT longest processing time rule and the COMBINE algorithm whose approximation ratios have been derived in  A Longest Processing Time First LPT The LPT rule 5 assigns jobs to machines one job at a time Jobs are assigned in decreasing order of their length i.e processing time When a job is considered for assignment it is assigned to that machine on which it will nish earliest i.e the machine for which the sum of the processing times of the jobs so far assigned is least In the context of SANTO the LPT rule becomes a assign racks to the subtrees of the aggregator one at a time b assign racks to subtrees in decreasing order of  c when a rack is considered for assignment assign it to the subtree for which the sum of the s of the racks already assigned to it is least Once the partitioning into subtrees has been done the racks assigned to individual trees may be organized using any topology for that subtree The approximation ratio for the LPT rule is and this bound is tight  Note that this bound applies not only to the machine scheduling problem for which it was originally developed but also to SANTO Comparing the performance of the LPT rule and that of the algorithm of Wang et al we see that when  the LPT rule may generate aggregator trees whose aggregation time is at most 16.7 more than optimal while the aggregation time using the algorithm of Wang et al may be as much as 50 more than optimal When  these percentages become 30 and 450 Interestingly there is no SANTO instance for which the algorithm of Wang et al results in a smaller aggre gation time than obtained using the LPT rule This is established below Lemma 1 Let We use induction on  Induction Base and are added to using the LPT rule We have the following cases 1 At least one subtree of  Let be the value of for one of the subtrees of to which none of the s are assigned by LPT Since LPT assigned no new rack to this subtree it follows that 2 Each subtree of  Since there are subtrees and new racks each subtree gets assigned

COMBINE Algorithm racks with data and  A topology of the aggregation tree that minimizes aggregation time 1 Apply LPT and let be the aggregation time 2 and  schedules the machines by using the rst-ìt-decreasing FFD heuristic for bin packing This is done by attempting to pack the jobs into bins of size using FFD Note that represents the target nish time of the schedule To nd the smallest for which such a packing is possible using FFD a binary search for the smallest is done in the interval and  where is the duration of job and  Coffman et al have shown that the approximation ratio of Multiìt is and that in practice 7 iterations of the binary search are sufìcient We describe COMBINE in Algorithm 1 By its very nature COMBINE guarantees schedules at least as good as those produced by LPT From Theorem 3 it follows that the aggregation topologies obtained by COMBINE when used to solve SANTO are at least as good as those obtained by the algorithm of Wang et al The approximation ratio of COMBINE is proved to be for two machines in Hence using COMBINE in place of LPT gives us a better approximation ratio for SANTO at the expense of increased run time Note that when Multiìt is limited to 7 iterations its asymptotic complexity is the same as that of LPT but the actual run time is larger by a constant factor VII SANTO-NT In SANTO-NT the primary objective is to minimize aggregation time and the secondary objective is to minimize total network trafìc We propose using Algorithm 2 for SANTO-NT This algorithm rst obtains a partition of the racks using either LPT or COMBINE The use of this good partition guarantees an aggregation time with an approximation ratio corresponding to that of either LPT or COMBINE Next for each partition the aggregation subtree is obtained by placing racks with more data closer to the root as is done by the algorithm of Wang et al The total network trafìc is  where is the data to be sent by rack to the aggregator and is the number of hops from rack to the root of the aggregation Algorithm for SANTO-NT racks with data and  A topology of the aggregation tree that minimizes aggregation time and total network trafìc 1 Use either LPT or COMBINE to partition the racks 2 Use the SANTO algorithm of Wang et al to arrange the racks in each partition into a tree of degree  3 Make the constructed trees the subtrees of the aggregator tree Within each partition the algorithm of Wang et al places the maximum possible number of racks at level 1 then the maximum possible number at level 2 and so on Further the placement is done in decreasing order of A proof by induction on the number of racks in a partition establishes the minimality of the network trafìc generated by the tree constructed for that partition We note that the proof of Theorem 4 also establishes the optimality of the algorithm of Wang et al for minimizing total network trafìc Consequently the total network trafìc of the aggregation tree generated by Algorithm 2 cannot be less than that of the aggregation tree generated by the algorithm of This is not a concern as our primary objective is to minimize aggregation time and not total network trafìc As an example consider the SANTO-NT instance  and  Figure 4\(a shows the aggregation tree generated using the algorithm of Wang et al The node labeled i.e the root is the aggregator Its aggregation time is and the total network trafìc is units A possible 3-partition obtained by LPT is we say possible because different partitions are possible depending on how we implement the tie breaker   and  No matter how the 3 subtrees of the aggregation tree are conìgured the aggregation time is so long as the racks are assigned to the subtrees using this partition Conìguring the subtrees as chains with racks assigned in decreasing order of top-to-bottom gives us the aggregation tree of Figure 4\(b for which the total network trafìc is  When the subtrees are conìgured according to the algorithm of Wang et al the aggre gation tree is as in Figure 4\(c The total network trafìc for this aggregation tree is  VIII E XPERIMENTS We conducted experiments to assess the reduction in aggregation time that could be expected in practice using either LPT or COMBINE instead of the algorithm of Wang et al W e also assessed the reduction in the total netw ork trafìc when we use the Wangês algorithm in combination with LPT and COMBINE Depending on the application the data distribution among the racks could range from fairly uniform to widely variable For example when the racks are reporting the frequency of

The graphs for the other 10 satellites are phase shifted versions      Figure 11 also shows a distinct oscillatory pattern of the BRDF RMS errors with 6 oscillations per orbit short term\ and 1 oscillation per orbit \(long term\. The insets in Figure 11 show the measurement angles corresponding to select crests and troughs The present of 6 satellites per ring ensures a wide azimuthal coverage and taps into the different quarters of the BRDF polar plot in spite of the orbital dynamics causing the satellites to rotate about the center The patterns seem to indicate that crests correspond to maximum sampling along principal plane 0 180 line/plane contains the sun while the troughs correspond to the times when the satellites have all 


  11   rotated out of the principal plane. If the cluster is expected to encounter snow in X% of its orbit, we should phase the satellites such that the first or last X% of the orbit \(least error seen in Figure 11 corresponds to the flight over snow   Figure 11  insets show the advantage that clusters with equally spaced satellites in azimuth have on sampling specific angles The measurement spread remains almost the same over orbits because as one satellite rotates out of a given view zenith and relative azimuth angle another one moves in to fill its space Thus if the cluster is designed such that some combination of angles is captured, equal azimuths will ensure that they are always captured  with more efficiency as number of satellites increases. This is all the more useful when changing solar azimuth angles are taken into account because the satellites rotate even faster because of it. Drift does cause some degradation in the view zenith angle and we discussed mitigation earlier in this section Sun and drift caused dynamics are best assessed in the global STK frame, which is the highest level of frameworks we use     Figure 11  BRDF RMS error with respect to the CAR data for the cluster shown in Figure 10  when propagated for 1 orbit top and 15 orbits bottom Insets show the measurement angles achieved at specific points in time marked   Snow BRDF vs. Vegetation BRDF  In the third case study, we plugged the Free Orbit Ellipse FOE configuration in the curvature corrected HCW frame to the science evaluation model for estimating vegetation BRDF in Southern Africa 51   T h e s tu d y  i s  essentially the same as the first case study except for a very different biome, with the intent of understanding the difference between the results caused by changing biomes A full factorial analysis is done with the same variables and constraints as the first case study Results are presented in Figure 12  for best blue left and worst red right error configurations using 4 5 9 and 13 satellites The respective errors are noted on the first column as e  minimum RMS error maximum RMS error   Figure 13 shows the dependence of these errors on the number of satellites  As earlier the worst errors occur when all the satellites are bunched toward near nadir i.e N  4 or 5 satellites second red column in Figure 12  These configurations fail to capture the azimuthal variation of BRDF and, more importantly, the hotspot as seen in Figure 3 b which is the peak reflection on the principal plane that occurs at view zenith angle equal to solar zenith angle with the sun behind the sensors Worst case errors show a big drop between 5 to 9 satellites since the 9 satellites are forced to symmetrically arrange themselves on either side of nadir While the worst case still occurs due to lack of azimuthal coverage errors are improved because of the ability to  configuration except at much restricted zenith range as before The worst case in 13 satellites captures the full zenith variation of BRDF but not the hotspot at all, hence only a slight improvement in errors red curve in Figure 13 The best case errors are seen \(blue dots in Figure 12  when at least a part of the hotspot is captured measurements are made in the upper hemisphere to capture the anti-hotspot and the zenith variation of BRDF is sampled  The best case error for one time instant does not seem to depend on the number of satellites at all green curve in Figure 13  For example, the best configuration in the 4 and 5 satellite case exploit the symmetry of the left and right hemisphere and achieve the same errors as the 9, 13 satellites with full zenith and azimuthal spread. However the propagated over the whole orbit the latter will do much better because the azimuthal sampling will compensate for the cluster rotating about the nadir. The 4 satellite case will be demonstrated in the STK frame to 


  12   show its drawback over time. The saturation could also be attributed to model errors and spherical harmonics models will be tested instead of RLTS to assess the difference   Least error Config   Most error Config   N = 4 satellites    0.0135, 0.0831    N = 5 satellites    0.0135, 0.0763    N = 9 satellites     0.0135, 0.0266    N 13  satellites   0.0135, 0.0192    Figure 12 Measurement angles obtained with clusters with increasing number of satellites rows that gave the minimum blue column 1 and maximum red column 2 RMS error with respect to true BRDF of savannah vegetation measured by CAR where E  min Error max Erro   I n  t he po la r plo t s   ra diu s    view zenith angle polar azimuth  relative azimuth with respect to the Sun  The vegetation results are not extremely different from the snow results except a critical one Snow needs more azimuthal sampling than vegetation. Vegetation produces the same and least error with a straight line sampling across the BRDF polar plot N=4 satellites blue dots in Figure 12  snow produces near maximum and never minimum errors in such a configuration N=9 satellites red dots in Figure 8 Vegetation errors shoot up when the sampling is not available for t op and bottom hemispheres This difference explains why the MISR sensor which its 9 forward aft sensors does much better for vegetation than for snow These results also agree very closely with an simulated annealing and genetic algorithm optimization to find the best and worst sampling points for vegetation and snow for 5, 9, 13 satellites   Figure 13  BRDF RMS error with respect to CAR data for the best green and worst red configurations as a function of number of satellites in the informed full factorial simulation in Figure 12   Global STK Framework and Vegetation   In the fourth and final case study, we plugged the differential Keplerian element propagation in the global orbits frame using AGI STK to the science evaluation model for estimating vegetation BRDF as the cluster flies over Southern Africa 51   T h e s t u d y  r eq u ir e m e n t s  w er e  considered in concurrence with current launch and funding opportunities: 4 satellites in a cluster with at least 1 nadir pointing satellite that are launched into a typical orbit using commonly available secondary launches Individual spacecrafts are assumed to be 6U cubesats with no propulsion module on board. Requirements govern the flexibility in varying the differential Keplerian elements for the cluster satellites with respect to the reference satellite The reference orbit was chosen at a 650 km altitude at 51.6 o  inclination to correspond to typical launch availabilities at near ISS orientations. Semi major axis \(SMA\ has to be the same for all satellites to prevent the formation from breaking. Lack of onboard propulsion restricts the variation of inclination perigee and eccentricity because the cluster orbits cannot be initialized without propulsion Differential inclination will also cause a tumbling effect which coupled with drift will eventually break the formation in the absence of active maintenance as seen in Figure 6 c Therefore the only free variables available are differential true anomaly \(TA 


  13   and differential RAAN   Differential variation of TA and RAAN cause a cross-track scan in HCW frame pattern which is more limited in azimuthal coverage than the FOE configuration  a  b  Figure 14 AGI-STK Astrogator propagated image of the satellite cluster as Config #6 \(a\ and Config #3 \(b  as they fly over Southern Africa   The very reduced full factorial analysis comprised of 6 cluster configurations where 4 of the 6 orbital elements were the same across all satellites: SMA = 6378+650 km i  51.6 o    0 e 0 and the RAAN and TA were perturbed by small amounts as listed in Table 2  Two of the configurations have been shown in an Astrogator propagated STK image as they fly over Southern Africa  Table 2  RAAN and TA in the form of osculating Keplerian elements for 4 satellites in the cluster when arranged in different 6 configurations as part of a reduced full factorial case study The other Keplerian elements are the same for all satellites SMA  6378+650 km, i = 51.6 o  0, e= 0  RAAN::TA of the foll. satellites in degrees   Sat #1  Sat #2  Sat #3  Sat #4  Config #1  0::0  0 5  5::0  5 5  Config #2  0::0  0 5  5::0  5 5  Config #3  0::0  0 5  5 5  5 5  Config #4  0::0  0 5  5 3  5 5  Config #5  0::0  0 5  5 3  3 3  Config #6  0::0  0 3  3::0  3 3    All clusters using their initial osculating elements and the MISR sensor using TLEs from an online database were simulated on STK starting October 13, 2013. A 20minute time window when the cluster flies over southern Africa was identified on the same when the solar zenith angle is ~ 30 o to match with the true CAR data available for Savannah vegetation  Figure 3 b  crossing time window is less than an hour ahead of the  instant over 20 minutes the RMS error between the BRDF estimated by the cluster using Figure 7  methodology and true BRDF is calculated and plotted in Figure 15  as different colors All of vegetated Africa is assumed to possess the BRDF signature shown in Figure 3 b  True solar azimuth angle variation is considered and used to calculate relative azimuth angles The same is repeated for MISR and plotted as black asterisks. Config 6 shows the highest RMS error and Config #3 the least   Figure 15  BRDF error over time as the 4 satellite cluster different colors represent different architectures or configurations flies over Southern Africa, assuming true BRDF to be as shown in Figure 3 b all through The black stars represent simulated BRDF errors by MISR \(from TLE data\, half an hour before in time. Measurement angles at the boxed times are shown in Figure 16   Figure 16  shows the measurement angles sampled by Config 6 Config 3 and MISR for 3 instants of time boxed in Figure 15  corresponding to medium low and high errors The intent is to identify the cluster orientations that caused the errors to change over time Since Config 6 has only two different RAANs  Figure 14 a it is not able to cover both top and bottom hemispheres of the BRDF polar plot simultaneously  which was established as a chief error driver for vegetation in the previous section 2-14 minutes after entering Africa Config 6 shows relatively low errors because it samples the hotspot region however later the errors rise significantly because the samples rote to the anti hotspot hemisphere as seen in the first row of Figure 16 On the other hand, since Config #3 has three different RAANs  Figure 14 b it does a better job in at least partially covering both top and bottom hemispheres of the BRDF polar plot simultaneously as seen in the second row of Figure 16 It exhibits lowest errors between 212 minutes after entering Africa because it samples the hot spot and anti hotspot hemispheres very close to their 


  14   exact positions on the BRDF polar plot. Later in time, the error rises slightly \(not as much as Config #6\ because the samples move out from near the hot spot but are still azimuthally spread   T0+2 minutes  T0+10 minutes  T0+20 minutes  Config #6     Config #3     MISR     Figure 16  Sampling achieved of the BRDF polar plot for the best Config  3  and worst Config 6 configuration and MISR, as averaged over 22 minutes T0 represents the time when the spacecraft \(TERRA or cluster each Southern Africa subsequent times correspond to those boxed in Figure 15  and configurations \(colors\correspond to Figure 15   The rise of error with time for all configurations can be further avoided by placing additional satellites with positive true anomaly with respect to the reference satellite so that both hemispheres are covered at any given time. This option has not been studied or shown because it causes more differential drag and in the absence of propulsion increases the risk of inter-satellite collisions  is clearly deduced by comparing its configuration change second row of Figure 16  and RMS error change \(black asterisks in Figure 15  over time with the 4 satellite clusters in best or worst configuration Since it samples the entire BRDF plot across in a straight line it always covers both the hot spot and anti hotspot hemispheres and at a variety of view zenith angles to capture the hotspot irrespective of solar zenith angle. The only time the error rises slightly is when the samples are perpendicular to the principal plane third row third column in Figure 16  Nonetheless cluster configurations have shown to produce errors equivalent to MISR therefore establishing their value in BRDF estimations 5  C ONCLUSIONS    We identify an important gap in the sampling abilities of earth observation missions angular sampling quantified by the BRDF metric and propose nanosatellite clusters in formation flight FF to make measurements to fill this gap    In this paper we demonstrated the science performance impact of such an approach using a comprehensive systems engineering model tightly coupled with a science evaluation model and tested it using stateof the-art  heritage golden standard Both snow and vegetation environments were studied to understand the impact of biome selection of cluster designs. The BRDF model used to fit over the data was selected to be RLTS based on its heritage with snow and vegetation Formation flight solutions in the linearized frames with and without perturbation forces and the global orbits frame using  compared with existing satellite solutions using their TLEs  The coupled model was applied to different models and architectures of FF  solutions which simulated angular sampling, and used to calculate errors with respect to the golden standard Specifically four case studies were studied coupling different FF solutions with different biomes and applications e g, albedo\. Insights on cluster design for BRDF learned from the case studies are presented and angular performance comparable to or better than current BRDF instruments demonstrated Clusters can serve as a powerful complement to current flagship missions by providing 3D angular coverage of the Earth at acceptable signal to noise ratios such that their angular data products can be combined with the high quality images from the larger missions. As small satellite technologies for imaging and platform stability advance further, they are likely to become critical tools at reduced costs for a new paradigm in Earth Observation capability 6  F UTURE WORK    There is much work to be done to evaluate the performance variation of FF clusters over time due to perturbation and other such effects details of Box I in Figure 2  These are likely to cause performance degradation and will require precise maintenance maneuvers over time using an onboard propulsion 


  15   module Trade studies of performance with respect to required delta chief orbit and the cost of ground operations support form important considerations in the design of the cluster architectures, and will be studied. Global designs will also need to consider the biome spread of the Earth so that the clusters are in optimal configuration when they fly over the appropriate biomes Finally this work can be extended to calculate many geophysical parameters beyond snow albedo such as vegetation GPP and radiative forcing of clouds to demonstrate the impact of improved BRDF using clusters on critical science application s  7  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   The authors are grateful to the following people for very useful discussions on the topics presented in this paper Warren Wiscombe  Jacqueline LeMoigne Alexis Lyapustin and Ralph Kahn from NASA GSFC Marco Sabatini from Universit\340 degli Studi di Trento in Italy David Miller from MIT and Thomas Hilker from Oregon State University   R EFERENCES   1   autonomous and distributed scatter manoeuvres for  Acta Astronaut vol. 82, no. 1, pp 95 109, Jan. 2013 2    System F6 Program Value-Centric Design  Proceedings of the AIAA Space Conference Anaheim, California, 2010 3  S Nag    crowdsourcing spaceflight software and STEM  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2012 4  S Nag   J   G  Katz   a n d  A   Saen z Oter o    STEM ed  Acta Astronaut  vol 83 no 0 pp 145 174 Feb 2013  5   spacecraft reorientation for earth orbiting clusters  Acta Astronaut vol. 53 no. 11, pp. 863 877, Dec. 2003 6   satellite systems for Multi-angular Multi-spectral  Proceedings of the 64th International Astronautical Congress  Beijing China, 2013 7   of Nano-satellite Cluster Formations for Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function  AIAAUSU Conf.
