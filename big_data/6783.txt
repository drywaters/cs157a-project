system consists of multiple data nodes and provides reliability and availability by holding multiple replicas of data Due to system failure or maintenance a data node may be removed from the system and the data blocks the removed data node held are lost If data blocks are missing the access load of the other data nodes that hold the lost data blocks increases and as a result the performance of data processing over the distributed le system decreases Therefore replica reconstruction is an important issue to reallocate the missing data blocks in order to prevent such performance degradation The Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS is a widely used 
distributed le system In the HDFS replica reconstruction process source and destination data nodes for replication are selected randomly We found that this replica reconstruction scheme is inefcient because data transfer is biased Therefore we propose two more effective replica reconstruction schemes that aim to balance the workloads of replication processes Our proposed replication scheduling strategy assumes that nodes are arranged in a ring and data blocks are transferred based on this one-directional ring structure to minimize the difference of the amount of transfer data of each node Based on this strategy we propose two replica reconstruction schemes

NTRODUCTION Large amounts of data generated from high quality sensor networks social network services and high performance scientic experimental tools such as genome sequencers require efcient Big Data management and processing in various elds of commerce and scientic computing such as high-energy physics and life information sciences Distributed le systems which manage large amounts of data over multiple commercially available machines are widely used for such Big Data processing In order to achieve high scalability and availability a distributed le system consists of multiple data nodes each depending on 
different system requirements and each data node manages blocks of the data and their individual replicas However it is difcult to operate all of these data nodes without any failures Some data nodes may be unstable due to system failure or maintenance In a distributed le system data are replicated and the data including their replicas are divided into data blocks and separately stored for reliability and availability When a data node failure has been detected the data blocks stored in the data node are lost and the access load of other data nodes which hold the lost data blocks increases so that 
the performance of data processing over the distributed le system decreases Therefore an important issue is effective replica reconstruction that reallocates the missing data blocks to other stable data nodes in order to prevent such performance degradation The Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS which is a part of the Apache Hadoop project has been a widely used open source distributed le system In the HDFS replica reconstruction process source and destination data nodes used to send and receive a missing data block are

chosen at random respectively As a result sending and receiving processes concentrate on a certain data node To perform replica reconstruction effectively it is necessary to balance the process workloads of each data node by choosing suitable source and destination data nodes To address this issue we propose effective replica reconstruction schemes which aim to balance workloads of copying processes between source and destination data nodes Our proposed schemes applies to a basic strategy based on a one-directional ring structure that each data node receives data blocks from the previous data node and sends data blocks to the next data node Based on this strategy the proposed schemes optimization and heuristic aim to minimize the difference of the amount of transfer data of each data node and select a source data node which holds a missing data block In the optimization scheme we dene this replica reconstruction problem as 0-1 integer programming and solve the problem with an optimization solver In the heuristic scheme we select the source data node in a heuristic manner We have implemented the two proposed schemes in HDFS and evaluate our proposed schemes in an actual HDFS cluster composed of seven nodes From the experiments we conrm that the replica reconstruction throughput of the proposed schemes improves by 45 compared to that of the default scheme and the load of each data node can be balanced by eliminating the bias of data transfer We also verify that the performance of the heuristic and optimization schemes are comparable We conrm that the heuristic scheme is very effective because it can be more scalable than the optimization scheme This paper is organized as follows Section 2 describes the HDFS replica reconstruction scheme and its problems Section 3 explains our proposed replica reconstruction schemes an optimization scheme and a heuristic scheme Section 4 evaluates our proposed schemes on an actual HDFS cluster Section 5 discusses the problems to be addressed in the future Section 6 introduces related work Finally we conclude in Section 7 II R EPLICA R ECONSTRUCTION FOR HDFS HDFS is a clone of the Google File System GFS developed by Google HDFS is based on a master and worker architecture and consists of a single NameNode and multiple DataNodes The NameNode stores the metadata of les and manages all the nodes in the cluster and the DataNodes store data and perform MapReduce-based data processing Each le is divided into blocks which is the minimum unit and the blocks are replicated Their replicas are separately stored on the other DataNodes for reliability and availability When a DataNode is removed from a cluster HDFS keeps the number of replicas specied in a replication factor by replicating missing blocks from the DataNode to the other remaining DataNodes There are two ways of removing nodes from a cluster for HDFS One is node decommission and the other is node deletion Node decommission is the way that a DataNode is removed from a cluster after replica reconstruction The decommissioned node itself participates in the replica reconstruction process This would be the case in which nodes are removed from a cluster intentionally For example to shrink a cluster scale and initiate the shutdown of an unstable DataNode that causes errors frequently Node deletion is the way that a DataNode is removed from a cluster before replica reconstruction The DataNode itself must not participate in the replica reconstruction process This would be the case in which a DataNode is removed from a cluster unexpectedly For example due to node failure or trouble with a network connection When node decommission or deletion is detected HDFS performs replica reconstruction which copies the data the DataNode holds to the other DataNodes The process proceeds by unit of blocks NameNode makes all decisions regarding this block replication scheduling NameNode chooses source and destination DataNodes for replications and periodically transfers replication instructions to each source DataNode The source DataNode transfers the blocks to the specied destination DataNode based on the instructions The destination DataNode sends an acknowledgement to the source DataNode after nishing the copying of the block and then the source DataNode sends an acknowledgement to the NameNode This phase continues repeatedly until all of the blocks that are missing are replicated The number of instructions which the NameNode transfers to the DataNodes equals the product of the number of active DataNodes in the cluster and the parameter We call this parameter in this paper The NameNode cannot provide instructions totalling more than this value This scheduling process and the data transmission process are performed in parallel The number of data blocks that each DataNode can transfer to the destination DataNode without receiving an acknowledgement equals the parameter We call this parameter in this paper is a hard-coded parameter in FSNamesystem.java of the ReplicationMonitor package is a property we can specify explicitly The default values of these parameters are shown in Table I When all DataNodes belong to the same rack NameNode selects a source DataNode from the DataNodes which hold a copy of the missing blocks at random and a destination

B Optimization Scheme 
described in section II-B We formulate the replica reconstruction problem as 0-1 integer programming in the replication scheduling strategy we proposed in section III-A As described in section III-A all DataNodes are arranged in a one-directional ring structure with transfer of missing blocks to the next DataNode The object of this replica reconstruction problem is to equalize the number of blocks that each DataNode sends that is to minimize the difference in the number of blocks that each DataNode sends We dene the symbols The sets of DataNode and the sets of block which are required to be replicated are denoted by and respectively The total number of DataNodes the total number of blocks which are required to be replicated and the replication factor are denoted by   and  2 respectively The average number of blocks  which each DataNode sends equals   The current block positions are represented by the matrix    If DataNode holds the block  equals  otherwise equals  The adjacency of DataNodes is represented by the matrix   If DataNode can send to DataNode  equals  otherwise equals  The scheduling results of replica reconstruction is denoted by the variable  If DataNode sends a block to DataNode for replication becomes 1 otherwise becomes  is the variable that is used to minimize the difference in the number 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 of blocks that each DataNode sends Now replica reconstruction scheduling based on one-directional ring structure is formulated as follows It is the optimization scheme that solves satisfying the above formulation and employs the result for replica reconstruction scheduling Objective function 1 minimizes the difference of the number of blocks that each source DataNode transfers Equation 2 denes  that is the placement of all blocks after transfer Constraint 3 states that the same block must not be arranged in the same DataNode in the placement of blocks after transfer Constraint 4 states the total number of replicas of each block must equal  Constraint 5 states is 0 or 1 Constraint 6 states the source DataNode has the block to transfer Constraint 7 states DataNode and DataNode are in the adjacency which DataNode can transfer to DataNode in the one-directional ring If there is no adjacency between DataNode and DataNode  the number of blocks which DataNode can transfer to DataNode is 0 otherwise it is a positive value is a sufciently large value which does not exceed the total number of blocks so we set to here Constraints 8 9 state the lower bound and the upper bound of the difference between the number of blocks and 
Figure 3 DataNodes arranged in a one-directional ring structure is sending and receiving even if the transfer timing of each block is different Further because of the ring structure the destination DataNode is determined uniquely by determining the source DataNode Therefore when choosing the source DataNode from which to send the missing blocks our proposed scheme only requires the number of blocks which each DataNode sends to be equal in order to eliminate the bias of the sending and receiving process In replica reconstruction with the HDFS default scheme the scheduling and data transfer are carried out in parallel In our replica reconstruction with our proposed scheme data transfer is carried out after the scheduling of all of replicas that are missing is completed This can be realized by specifying a sufciently large value to

the average number of blocks  respectively Constraint 10 states is greater than or equal to 0 Because it is impractical to implement the optimization scheme since it generally takes a long time to nd the optimal solution we propose a heuristic scheme to obtain replica reconstruction scheduling results The heuristic scheme aims to equalize the number of blocks that each DataNode transfers We describe the procedure below 1 DataNodes which hold the block to be replicated are the candidates to be designated as the source DataNode However if the next DataNode in the ring structure already holds the same block the DataNode is excluded from the candidates 2 Give the priority to the blocks to be replicated For each replicated block the priority 0 replication factor-2 is calculated is the number of source DataNode candidates excluded in 1 Then the replicated blocks are grouped by  3 Execute the following process for each group in descending order of priority  For each block in each group choose the source DataNode from the candidates Here the total number of times a DataNode has been chosen as the source DataNode is counted and the DataNode with the minimum total number is selected as the source DataNode After step 1 step 2 is executed for all of the replicated blocks and then step 3 is executed In step 3 the number of times each DataNode has been chosen as the source DataNode is balanced by scheduling the blocks whose number of candidates is fewer at rst For example when the replication factor is set to three the number of candidates is two for each block However if the next DataNode in the ring structure holds the block already the DataNode is excluded from the candidates so that the number of the candidates equals one and the source DataNode is determined uniquely If such blocks are scheduled later in the scheduling process it may happen that the DataNode as the source is chosen too often To avoid the case we dene the priority for each block IV E VALUATION E XPERIMENTS We implemented both the optimization scheme and the heuristic scheme into the replica reconstruction module in HDFS In order to evaluate the performance of the replica reconstruction with each scheme we measure the following 1 Replica reconstruction throughput 2 The number of blocks each DataNode transfers 3 The computation time needed to nd the optimal solution 1 indicates the data transfer rate among DataNodes for the reconstruction 2 examines and evaluates the bias of the Table II HDFS CLUSTER NODE SPECIFICATIONS OS Linux 2.6.32-5-amd64 Debian GNU/Linux 6.0.4 CPU Quad-Core Intel R Xeon R CPU  1.60GHz Main Memory 2GByte HDD 73GByte SASx2 RAID0 RAID Controller SAS5/iR Network Gigabit Ethernet Table III M EASUREMENT PARAMETERS Block size 16 32 64 128 256 MByte The number of DataNodes six including the deleted one Replication factor 3 The amount of data in HDFS 50 GByte  3 replication factor volume of processing for sending and receiving 3 examines and evaluates if the optimization scheme is practical We used seven nodes on which we installed Hadoop1.0.3 on an actual cluster One of them is designated as a NameNode and the rest are DataNodes Table II shows the specications of the nodes we used for the measurements All nodes are connected by a Gigabit Ethernet and belong to a single rack With respect to IV-1 2 mentioned above for each scheme that is the default scheme heuristic scheme and optimization scheme we examined the performance of replica reconstruction at node deletion for block sizes 16 32 64 128 256 MByte We dene the replica reconstruction throughput as follows Replica reconstruction throughput option in each trial The replication factor is set to three so the total amount of data including replicas in HDFS is approximately 150 GByte which corresponds to about 25 of the capacity of the entire cluster Table III shows the parameters we used for the measurements The amount of data each DataNode holds is balanced by a balancer which is implemented as a Hadoop daemon before each trial Therefore in each trial the amount of data each DataNode holds is almost the same but the placement of each data item differs With respect to IV-3 we examined the computation time required to nd the optimal solution of this 0-1 integer programming problem by changing the number of DataNodes and Blocks in the simulation Table IV shows the number of DataNodes and Blocks we used 800 blocks corresponds to

Figure 4 shows the replica reconstruction throughput at node deletion with each scheme The vertical axis represents the replica reconstruction throughput in MByte/sec and the horizontal axis represents the block size When the block size is more than 64 MByte the throughput is improved by the proposed schemes The throughput of the heuristic scheme shows a 44 improvement compared to that of the default scheme and that of the optimization scheme shows a 45 improvement When the block size is smaller such as 16 and 32 MByte the throughput of each scheme does not differ As we mentioned in section II-B this is because the amount of data that each DataNode can transfer without receiving an acknowledgement from the destination DataNodes is limited by the number of blocks  Therefore in the case where block size is smaller the amount of data to be processed at one time is less In such a case the DataNodes nish the processing instructed from the NameNode sooner and are in the idle state waiting for the instructions of the replica reconstruction to be sent periodically from the NameNode That is there is still available disk bandwidth In order to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes in the case where the processing load is heavy even though block size is small we examined the replica reconstruction at node deletion by changing as shown in Table V The replica reconstruction throughput of the experiments is shown in Figure 5 The vertical axis represents the replica reconstruction throughput in MByte/sec and the horizontal axis represents the block size and the value of  In the case where the process load is heavy even though block size is small the throughput of the proposed schemes also show improvement as shown in Figure 5 It can be seen from Figures 4 and 5 the replica reconstruction throughput of the heuristic scheme is comparable to that of the optimization scheme Therefore the heuristic scheme is shown to be effective enough in this experiment environment Figures 6 and 7 show the time series data of the disk I/O

Table VI shows the number of blocks that each DataNode transfers and the standard deviation in the replica reconstruction at node deletion with each scheme As an example we pick up a single trial with a block size 64 MByte here Because the data placement is different in each trial the number of blocks that each DataNode transferred and the standard deviation are also different slightly in each trial Table VII shows the average standard deviation of each trial with each scheme It can be seen from Table VII that the number of blocks that each DataNode transfers is balanced and the bias of volume of processing for sending and receiving is eliminated by our proposed schemes The heuristic scheme is also comparable to the optimization scheme in terms of the bias of sending and receiving processing and therefore we conrmed that the heuristic scheme is effective Table VI T HE NUMBER OF BLOCKS THAT EACH D ATA N ODE TRANSFERS AND THE STANDARD DEVIATION  Default scheme Heuristic scheme Optimization scheme DataNode1 78 78 78 DataNode2 79 79 79 DataNode3 84 78 79 DataNode4 85 79 79 DataNode5 67 79 78 Standard deviation 7.162 0.548 0.548 Table VII A VERAGE STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS THAT EACH D ATA N ODE TRANSFERS  Default scheme Heuristic scheme Optimization scheme Average standard deviation 8.337 0.697 0.481 We evaluate by simulation the computation time needed to nd the optimal solution of the 0-1 integer programming problem formulated Figure 8 shows the computation time when the number of nodes changes but the number of blocks is xed Figure 9 shows the computation time when the number of blocks changes but the number of nodes is xed From Figures 8 and 9 we conrm that the computation time needed to nd the optimal solution increases exponentially with the increase of the number of nodes and linearly with the increase of the number of blocks Here we dene the number of nodes as and the number of blocks as  The complexity of the optimization scheme is onthe other hand the complexity of the default scheme and the heuristic scheme is  In practice because HDFS is used in large-scale environment such as terabyte and petabyte scale the number of nodes and the number of blocks is also huge Therefore it is found that the optimization scheme cannot scale On the other hand the heuristic scheme is very efcient because it is possible to achieve replica reconstruction throughput comparable to the optimization scheme with a calculation complexity of  V D ISCUSSION In this study we have focused on eliminating the bias of data transfer and tackled the challenge of nding effective replica reconstruction schemes However in practice the replica reconstruction process is performed in the background so it is necessary to avoid the situation that this process occupies the bandwidth and reduces the performance of the foreground process Therefore as future work we are going to attempt to perform the replica reconstruction effectively while minimizing the inuence on the foreground

A lot of replication strategies for replica management have been proposed In general data are replicated and their replicas are stored on different data nodes for reliability and availability And it is important to decide the replication factor properly as well as where to place each replica Rahman et al W ang et al 6 and Sato et al 7 proposed replication strategies based on le clustering for Grid le systems In the clustering strategy described in les are grouped according to each data processing based on the notion that the clustered les will be simultaneously used by another data processing Then replication times for each le are minimized under given storage capacity limitations From the experiments they showed the proposed strategy was more efcient than a strategy that did not group related les Sashi et al proposed a replication strate gy for a re gionbased framework based on the popularity of les over a geographically distributed Grid environment By calculating the access frequency of each le they determine in which region the replicas have to be placed and how many replicas have to be placed based on network bandwidth and response time between regions When le is created the access frequency is calculated for each region and replicas are placed in the regions with the large in a descending order of the access frequency Furthermore in which site within the region the le has to be placed is determined by considering the number of requests and the response time Therefore their strategy increases the data availability and also reduces the number of unnecessary replications Tjioe et al proposed a replication strate gy based on a dynamic le assignment according to access load First they assign les which are sorted according to le size to disks in a round-robin fashion so as to distribute the load of all les evenly across all disks Then creation and deletion of replicas are occurred according to the load of all les and the load on each disk From the experiments load balancing can be achieved in an environment where user access patterns change signicantly Wenfeng et al proposed a replication strate gy based on a response time of each request It determines replica allocation and the number of replicas for each data in order to satisfy the requirement of response time acquiring each replica from every node and minimize the replica degree the number of replica for each data at the same time From the experiments compared to other strategies the proposed strategy could meet with every nodes response time requirements of a single request and also reduced the number of replica degree Moreover it reduced the total

request response time at most and improved the overall system performance As described above most of replication strategies mainly consider an access time a storage capacity and a replication time However an overhead of a replication process on each node itself is not considered well Felix et al in v estig ated distrib uting an OS image to all machines efciently in a large scale cluster They investigated three logical network topologies a star topology an n-ary spanning tree and a multi-drop-chain Figure shows each network topology The blue nodes indicate the source of each data transfer and the green nodes denote a switch a connection point between all nodes The above pictures of each topology show a logical connectivity of all nodes From the evaluation experiments the star topology suffered from heavy link congestion at the server link in the case of increasing the number of nodes And the n-ary spanning tree could not replicate data into multiple streams efciently enough because of the limitation of network bandwidth On the other hand the multi-drop-chain could replicate data regardless of increasing nodes and network bandwidth Therefore they concluded the multi-drop-chain topology was efcient to adopt a large-scale cluster Therefore it is assumed that data transfer based on the one-directional ring structure we applied is effective

Figure 10 Network topologies described in VII C ONCLUSION In replica reconstruction with the default scheme for HDFS it is an issue that inefcient processing occurs during the replica reconstruction because the processing is concentrated on some of the DataNodes even if source and destination DataNodes are chosen at random To address this issue we proposed two effective replica reconstruction schemes intended to balance the workloads of each DataNode by choosing source and destination DataNodes properly Our proposed replication scheduling strategy requires that DataNodes are assumed to be arranged in a ring and data blocks are transferred based on a one-directional ring structure to minimize the difference of the amount of transfer data of each DataNode Based on this strategy we proposed two replica reconstruction schemes an optimization scheme and a heuristic scheme We have implemented the proposed schemes in HDFS and evaluated them on an actual HDFS cluster From the experiments we conrmed that the replica reconstruction throughput of the proposed schemes showed a 45 improvement compared to that of the default scheme and the load of each DataNode can be balanced by eliminating the bias of data transfer We also veried that the heuristic scheme was comparable to the optimization scheme with respect to the replica reconstruction throughput and balancing the load of each DataNode Furthermore we conrmed that the heuristic scheme was very effective because it can be more scalable than the optimization scheme R EFERENCES  Dhruba Borthakur  HDFS Architecture  2008 The Apache Software Foundation  T om White Hadoop The deniti v e guide trans Ryuji T amagawa OReilly JAPAN 2010  Sanjay Ghema w at Ho w ard Gobiof f and Shun-T ak Leung October 2003 The Google File System 19th Symposium on Operating Systems Principles conference Lake George NY The Association for Computing Machinery CiteSeerX 10.1.1.125.789 retrieved 2012-07-12  GLPK http://www gnu.or g/softw are/glpk  Rashedur M.Rahman K en Bark er  Reda Alhajj Study of Different Replica Placement and Maintenance Strategies in Data Grid In Proceedings of the Seventh IEEE International Symposium on Cluster Computing and the Grid pp.171-178 2007  Y  W ang and D Kaeli Load balancing using grid-based peer to-peer parallel I/O In Proceedings of IEEE International Conference on Cluster Computing pp.1-10 2005  Hitoshi Sato Satoshi Matsuoka and T oshio Endo File Clustering Based Replication Algorithm in a Grid Environment In Proceedings of the 9th IEEE International Symposium on Computing and the Grid CCGrid2009 pp.204-211 Shanghai China May 2009  K Sashi Anton y Selv adoss Thanamani A Ne w Replica Creation and Placement Algorithm for Data Grid Environment International Conference on Data Storage and Data Engineering pp.265-269 2010  J Tjioe R W idjaja A Lee and T Xie DORA:A Dynamic File Assignment Strategy with Replication International Conference on Parallel Processing 2009  W F  W ang W H W ei A Dynamic Replica Placement Mechanism Based-on Response Time Measure Proc of IEEE International Conf on Communications and Mobile Computing pp.169-173 2010
