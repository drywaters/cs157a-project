Touch is an essential channel in interpersonal and affective communication, yet most social agents currently lack the capability to touch the user.

is that this is also possible through mediated \(virtual\uch and the third is that social agents can use the same mediated touch technology as effectively as humans. Based on a literature review, we also formulate ten design rules as guidance for the development of social agents that can touch These rules concern parameters that regulate the meaning of touch cues like context and familiarity, the implicit and explicit meanings of touch, user characteristics, and parameters that can be communicated through affective touch

 Social agents \(avatars and robots alike\re designed to display social behavior and communicate emotions. In this paper we plead for giving social agents the capability to touch users and we provide ten important design rules In interpersonal communication, touch is a very important channel to communicate emotions, even to the extent that the sense of touch has a distinct neurophysiological channel for affective touch in addition to the channels for discriminative touch [1   W e t h er e f o re argue that providing social agents with the ability to touch a user can make them more effective. Currently, the vast majority of social agents rely solely on the visual and auditory channels for communication. However, we foresee

that over the coming years social agents will increasingly use touch as affective communication channel, similar to the introduction of haptic displays in Human Computer Interaction \(HCI\over the past two decades \(starting with the introduction of a vibration function on mobile phones\. To substantiate this prediction, we argue along the following three premises people are able to communicate affect and emotions solely by touch this interpersonal communication does not have to be direct, but can also be mediated by technology; and social agents can use the 
same mediated technology to communicate affect 
A The sense of touch in interpersonal interaction 
 
The sense of touch is the earliest sense to develop in a human embryo [3 I t is  cri tic al f o r ou r ea rly s o ci a l  development a nd t h r o ugho ut t h e  r e st o f  o u r l i f e t he se ns e of touch remains important in social interaction [5 i n  greetings \(shaking hands, embr acing, kissing, backslapping and cheek-tweaking\, in intimate communication \(holding hands, cuddling, stroking, back scratching, massaging\, in corrections \(punishment, spank on the bottom\d of course in sexual relationships. Touch is also an effective and important non-verbal means of communication in 
psychotherapy [6 a n d nur si n g  7 T he i m p o r t a n ce  o f to uch is reflected in language: the finishing touch, rubbing people the wrong way or stroking them the right way, someoneês happy, soft, or human touch, oneês thick or thin skin, etc The sense of touch can be used to communicate distinct emotions as we will discuss later, but also to elicit and modulate human emotion. Interpersonal touch therefore provides an effective means of influencing peopleês social behaviors \(such as modulating their tendency to comply with requests [8   9 in af f ec tin g peo p l e s atti tu d es tow ard  specific services, in creating bonds between couples or groups, and in strengthening romantic relationships \(see [1 
for an excellent overview\ clinical and professional situations, interpersonal touch can increase information flow and causes people to evaluate communication partners more favorably [11   I nt e r pe r s o nal  t o uc h i s t h e m o st c o m m o nl y used method of comforting   I n nur sing c a re  hum a n  touch is an essential instrument to promote physical emotional, social and spiritual wellbeing [13 14 1 5   s ee also [5  In daily life we use touch to communicate our feelings with others, and to enhance the meaning of other forms of verbal and non-verbal communication. Touch amplifies the intensity of emotional displays from our face and voice [16  and can communicate distinct emotions in a robust fashion

visual and other cues. Even under these restricted touch conditions, anger, fear, disgust, love, gratitude, sympathy happiness and sadness can be communicated above chance and with the same accuracy as facially and vocally displayed emotions In summary: the above data confirm our first premise that people can communicate emotions through touch Our second premise is that interpersonal communication can also be established through technology mediated touch or virtual touch Tactile or kinesthetic interfaces in principle enable haptic communication between people who are physically apart and may provide the experiences of connection and engagement, with all the physical, emotional and intellectual feedback it supplies  S e v e ra l co nc ep t s h a ve be e n sho w n  recently of which some are also empirically validated. For instance, the vibration function on a mobile phone has been used  to render emotional information for blind users [21 and a similar interface can convey emotional content in instant messaging [2 More sop hi st i ca t ed  de vi c e s l i ke a  haptic-jacket system enable distant loversê communication and remote child caring, and can enhance Second Life to enable the communication of touch cues like encouraging pats and comforting hugs  U s ing the s e ty p e o f sy ste m s people can not only exchange messages but also emotionally and physically feel the social presence of the communication partner [24 Smith and MacLean [25  pe r f o rm ed an ex ten s iv e s t u d y  into the possibilities and the design space of an interpersonal haptic link and concluded that emotion can indeed be communicated through this medium. It appears that virtual interfaces can effectively transmit emotion even with touch cues that are extremely degraded \(e.g. a handshake that is lacking grip, temperature, dryness, and texture: [26   Finally, it has been shown that a mediated touch on the upper arm increases peopleês altrui stic behavior and willingness to comply with a request \(the Midas Touch effect\o the same extent as a direct touch a nd t ha t ha pt i c t e l e communication affects the quality of a shared experience and increases the intimacy felt towards the other person [28   There are also many similarities between the ways people use, experience and react to direct and mediated touch [29   For instance, the use of mediated touch is only considered appropriate as a means of communication  between people in close personal relationships [30 T h e  in te r p r et ati on  o f  mediated touch depends on the type of interrelationship between sender and receiver [3 s i m ilar t o di re ct t o u c h   32  E v e n m e d i a t ed t ouc h c o mm u n i c a t i o n b e t w e e n  strangers can cause discomfort [25 A f f ectiv e t e l e t ou ch c a n  reduce heart rate of participants that experienced a sad event   Although it is not clear to what extent mediated touch can replace real touch, the reports above show that it has the potential to communicate affect and emotions. This supports our second premise Our third and last premise is that social agents can use the same mediated touch technology as effectively as humans. In this case the touch cue is not only mediated, but produced by an electronic system instead of a human. Let us first look at the use of touching systems in general. The number of systems that include the sense of touch has increased over the past decade, but they are still not very common. An important reason is the supposed low bandwidth of the touch channel. One of the first large-scale applications was the vibration function on mobile phones communicating the 1-bit message of an incoming call Although often underestimated, our touch sense is also able to process large amounts of abstract information. For instance, blind people who are trained in Braille reading can actually read with their fingertips. This information processing capabilities are increasingly applied in our interaction with systems, and more complex information is being displayed, e.g. to reduce the risk of visual and auditory overload in car driving, to make us feel more immersed in virtual environments or to realistically train certain medical   Apart from presenting abstract or pictorial information there are also several examples of systems that provide affective touch cues. For example, [3 d ev el o pe d a f r ic ti o n based horizontally rotating fingertip stimulator to investigate emotional experiences and behavioral responses to haptic stimulation and showed that people can rate these kind of stimuli as less or more unpleasant, arousing, avoidable, and dominating. Wang et al. [36 w e d t h a t vi r t u a l t o uch reinforces the meaning of a symbolic channel reducing sadness and reinforcing joviality. Finally [37 test ed tac til e  jackets \(and later blankets\to increase emotional experiences while watching movies and reported quite strong effects of well-designed vibration patterns Taken together, these studies show that our third premise is also credible: mediated touch also enables emotion communication from systems to humans In the previous sections, we argued that touch not only provides valuable information that is complementary to visual and auditory information, but is also essential in affective communication. This holds even more so for social\ robots and avatars than for general HCI. Empathic communication may serve in general to establish and improve affective relations with social agents [38 an d is  a  fundamental requirement for social agents \(whether physically embodied as robots or on-screen agents\that are designed to function as social companions and therapists 39 H o w e v e r, th e in te rac ti o n  w ith social ag en ts cu r r en tl y  still relies almost entirely on vision and audition with just a few exceptions The physical embodiment of robots gives them a direct capability to touch users, while avatars may use the technology designed for other HCI applications to virtually touch their user. Several devices have been proposed that enable haptic interaction with virtual characters 4 0

A Rule 1: Donêt hurt the user B Rule 2: Touch for information processing is not the same as touch for emotion C Rule 3: The meaning of touch depends on social cultural and individual differences D Rule 4: Touch has both explicit and implicit meanings 
 
    
Only few studies investigated autonomous systems that touch users for affective or therapeutic purposes [41 o r  t o  communicate the affective state of artificial creatures [42  If we look at applications in robots and avatars, the first applications including touch facilitated information from user to system only, e.g. in the form of a touch screen or through specific touch sensors in a tangible display. Social agents that can touch the user are of much more recent date The examples are still very few, and there has been hardly any real formal evaluation. Evers et al. [4   4 4  l o ok e d a t  human responses to robots and found that people experience robots that interact by touch as less machine-like. Yohanan et al. [42  4 5 m o re s p e cif ic ally stu die d th e c o m m un icati on o f  emotions. They designed several haptic creatures to study a robotês communication of emotional state and concluded that participants experienced a broader range of affect when haptic renderings were applied. Participants were able to recognize the emotional renderings, but the state of arousal is communicated better than its valence. Basori et al. [46  showed the feasibility of using vibration in combination with sound and facial expression in avatars to communicate emotion strength. Whether touch assisted in building a relationship with a social actor was the topic of studies by  who sho w e d t ha t t o uc h \(sq ue ez e s  d e l i ve red t hro ugh a n airbladder\an improve the relation with a virtual agent and  w h o i nve st i g a t e d t h e favo ra bl e e ffe ct s o f a hum a n o i d robot using touch in building trust. Kotranza et al 5 0 describe a virtual patient as medical studentês training tool that is able to be touched and to touch back. These touch enabled virtual patients were treated more like real humans than virtual patients without touch capabilities \(students expressed more empathy and used touch more frequently to comfort and reassure the virtual patient\.The authors concluded that by adding haptic interaction to the virtual patient, the bandwidth of the student-virtual patient communication increases and approaches that of humanhuman communication. Fin ally, [5 crea te d a situat io n in  which a robot requested participants to perform a repetitive monotonous task. This request was accompanied with an active touch, a passive touch, or no touch. The result showed that the active touch increased peopleês motivation to continue performing the monotonous task. This confirms the earlier conclusion of [27 th a t th e ef f ect of th e v i rtu al Mi da s  touch is in the same order of magnitude as the real Midas touch effect We foresee that there will be an increase in touching agents because we see the same evolution in other HCI domains and because it fulfills the need for technology that allows more intuitive, interpersonal communication. In the next section we will present ten design rules that can guide the future implementation of social agents that can touch II T HE T EN R ULES OF T OUCH  Before we list specific rules of touch, we urge the system designer to apply to International Standards for haptic and tactile interactio 5 3  Also  it is w o r t hw hile to study general guidelines like listed in  An i m p o r ta nt gro und rule is of course that touch produced by the agent should never be harmful to the user in any way The majority of touch application in user-system interaction is designed for information transfer and not for the communication of emotions. Although the design for information transfer can be intuitive \(e.g. see [55  is is n o t  a strict requirement as abstract or symbolic representations can also be applied \(as in any other sense\. This is not the case for affective communication where touch cues should be as natural and intuitive as possible [36 an d pr ef er a b ly  mimic interpersonal touch \(to be effective a mediated affective touch should not create any more cognitive load than a real touch [56 As we mentioned in the introduction, a recent finding shows that the neurophysiology of affective, pleasant touch differs from that of discriminative touch. Although certainly not all affective touch applications are using this specific processing system, it means that a virtual touch that is able to tap into this affective system may result in direct and strong emotional responses. Although we have only limited knowledge yet on this affective touch system [1  it s eem s  that it is closely linked to hairy \(but not glabrous\in sensitive to strokes within a specific speed range \(about 6-20 cm/s\d terminates in important emotional brain areas Like interpersonal touch, virtual touch does not necessarily have a universal meaning. The meaning of interpersonal touch depends on parameters like culture familiarity, relationship between touchers, and gender Cranny-Francis e ve n st a t e d t hat o ne o f t he fi r s t t hi ngs  people need to learn in order to live comfortably within a society or culture different from that in which they grew up is its tactile regime; the consequence of failure is not only that one is rejected as alien \(connection denied\ but one may also seriously offend other members.é This also holds for touch by social agents: if they donêt conform to the rules and expectations of the users they may be considered as offensive and will appear like aliens. Furthermore, there are also individual differences, both in the attitude towards being touched [47 as in p e r c e p t u al a b il iti es \(f o r  in st an ce a s  function of age\. The virtual touch should always be designed for and tested with the intended user population Interpersonal touch can be accidental \(with no intent to communicate\, instrumental  \(deliberate contact necessary to perform a care task\ affective \(to give support or show appreciation\ontrolling \(to obtain compliance or attention ritualistic \(greeting and departure touches such as handshakes, having no personal meaning\, or playful [5 However, the same touch may either be symbolic or also be full of emotional, intellectual and even spiritual meanings and may therefore have unwanted or unforeseen behavioral consequences 
782 


      
E Rule 5: The meaning of a touch depends on the context F Rule 6: Touch is especially good for intimate emotions G Rule 7: Touch suits proactive agents better than reactive agents H Rule 8: Touch can communi cate multiple dimensions of emotion I Rule 9: Touch is also related to team performance and bonding J Rule 10: Touch is not always profitable 1 2 3 
 
Although touch usually clearly signals the intent to communicate, its meaning is inherently ambiguous  Touch by social agents may therefore become more effective when combined with disambiguating visual and or auditory information. An additional benefit will be that congruent visual and auditory information enhances the perceived naturalness of mediated social touch [5 60  I n a stu d y b y  Chen et al. [4 a n a ut o n o mo us nur se robo t t o uc hed a n d moved her hand along a personês forearm. The robot either informed the participant that she was going to clean the arm instrumental touch\ or she spoke a comforting text \(affective touch\. The appraisal of the robot-initiated touch depended on the perceived intent: instrumental touch was perceived more favorably than affective touch, although both types of touch were positively appraised Hence, the design and application of virtual touch should account for its possible meaning and interpretations and avoid potential ambiguities The meaning of touch depends strongly on the context in which it is deployed [20  61   T h e re is n o on et o o n e  correspondence between meaning and touch: similar touches may have different meanings while similar meanings can lead to different touches [62  A s a resu lt th e ef f ec t s of tou c h  applied during social interaction are also highly context dependent. For instance, in a supportive setting interpersonal touch increases altruistic behavior and willingness to comply to a request [6 64  65 66  67 68   w h i l e  i t  red uc e s  helping behavior in a competitive setting [6 In  ad di ti on   the affective appraisal of touch between dyads depends on gender \(same-opposite sex\, familiarity \(the toucher is either a stranger or familiar\, their relationship \(friends competitors or unrelated\, and the degree of touch receptivity of the receiver [47  T h e m ean in g of tou ch can be c l a r if ie d  by coupling with other sensory channels [3 H o w e ve r  t h e information in the individual sensory channels should be congruent to guarantee that the perceived gestures and resulting haptic sensations support a common interaction metaphor reflecting real touch  Donêt use touch cues if the context is missing, ambiguous or wrong \(see also rule 2\. A tap on the shoulder may be experienced as giving comfort or as punishment depending on other \(sensory\formation presented by the social agent Other cues also help to interpret a touch as incidental, or turn it into an intentional one In the Introduction, we showed that touch can effectively convey emotions. But some emotions are better communicated than others. Also, some emotions are better conveyed via vision or audition. Generally, anger, fear disgust, love, gratitude, sympathy, happiness and sadness can all be communicated, but touch is the preferred nonverbal communication channel for conveying intimate emotions like love and sympathy [71  A g ain g en d er an d f am iliar ity  play a role, for instance, romantic couples are even able to communicate the self-focused emotions envy and pride [32 An appropriate etiquette for touch interaction of social agents \(or physical interaction in general\as not yet been established. Cramer et al. [43 m e nt i o n t h a t user s fo und touch more appropriate for proactive than for reactive agents People trust a proactive robot \(higher autonomy\ more and a reactive robot \(lower autonomy\when it touches the user [44  T h is m a tch es w ith th e o b s erv a ti o n s th at g r e a te r  intensity of sensory and emotional responses are experienced when participants passively as opposed to actively receive stimuli [7  an d th at p eo p l e att ri bu te m o r e cr ed it t o  r o bo ts  that are more autonomous and proactive [73  T hus  i t see m s  that people donêt object to being touched by proactive agents, especially when it is in an active sense In addition to conveying a specific emotion touch can also communicate its level \(valence and arousal\. Ways to communicate intensity or level include repeating the touch or increasing the strength or intensity, but more data on effective rendering of multiple dimensions is needed. \(In this context it is interesting to note that, in interpersonal touch the Midas touch effects are larger after two than after only one touch on the arm [7   Social agents may also be part of a group or intended to interact with groups. However, it is still unknown how touch should be used in interaction with groups. From interpersonal touch, we know that touching has positive effects on group performance and bonding \(often seen in sports teams, e  Inappropriate use of touch interaction may have null or even negative effects on the interaction [75  B u t ev en m o re  important is that inappropriate touch can provoke anxiety or worse, especially for people with a touch aversion  III S UMMARY AND C ONCLUSIONS  Touching is an important aspect of social interaction and is critical in forming bonds, building trust, and developing personality. These are all characteristics we expect from social agents as well. Based on the known and welldescribed effects of affective touch on interpersonal communication, social behavior and even wellbeing, we argue that giving social agents touch capabilities could be a great improvement. We showed the credibility of three premises emotions can be communicated using touch only without any other cue interpersonal communication can also be accomplished with mediated touch and is not only restricted to direct physical contact, and not only humans but also systems can use mediated touch to communicate emotions. Despite the potential of touch for social agents and the increasing application of touch

interaction in other HCI domains, there are not yet a lot of social agents with touch capabilities developed let alone be formally tested. Therefore, we argue that the time is right to develop a framework and a set of guidelines for the development and application of social agents with touch capabilities. The ten rules of touch presented in this paper concerning amongst others parameters affecting meaning and individual characteristics\ are a first step, but there is much more knowledge needed. Important topics include how to haptically render valence and arousal, how a touch etiquette for social agents should look, which multisensory interactions are relevant, and how to incorporate social cultural and individual differences with respect to acceptance and meaning of a social agentês touch R EFERENCES    L  S  L  k e n  M   E v er t and  J  W e ssb erg  P leasantn es s of t o uch  in human glabrous and hairy skin: Order effects on affective ratings

Fig 8 respectively The simulation parameters are still the same as those for Fig 4 In all parts of Fig 10 the major pulse power is distributed on the cross-port side with varying wavefronts From b and c we can see that the output beam is expected to tilt toward the bar-port side  In c particularly in b we can see the power left on the bar-port side This part of the signal is essentially focusing after it leaves the SOA see the solid curve of part b V D ISCUSSIONS AND C ONCLUSION With regard to the effect of 014lter offset our simulations not shown here indicate that if the 014lter offset is small most of the bar-port energy including weak and intense parts is fed into the laser ring cavity This then leads to the deterioration of pulse compression On the other hand if the pulse is passed through a window far from the center of the MMI SOA i.e with a large 014lter offset it is easier to achieve pulse compression This may result from better discrimination between the weak and intense portions of the pulse Although the single-mode passive waveguide section at the input end also provides a 014ltering effect diffraction may mix the weak and intense parts of the pulse during the propagation in the ring cavity resulting in dif\014cult discrimination between them Therefore the spatial 014lter near the output end is important in pulse compression However the drawback of this arrangement is that less energy remains inside the ring cavity and hence a higher injection current is required for maintaining laser operation We also move the lateral position of the single-mode passive waveguide which corresponds to the incident point on the lateral dimension of the MMI SOA Numerical results not shown here reveal that mode locking can be achieved with several lateral positions of the passive waveguide say with shifting toward the cross-port side by 0.5 1 or 1.5 m Therefore our simulation results imply that a certain range of cavity alignment for achieving mode locking is allowed This broad tolerance in the lateral direction should be helpful in implementing such a mode-locked laser In implementing a passively mode-locked laser realistically the pulse grows from a noise burst rather than from an incident long pulse as our simulations However pulse compression into a steady state is the most important condition for passive mode-locking Actually the steady state of a passive mode-locked laser depends on the properties of the gain medium and cavity It is independent of the initial pulse condition Therefore like those in literature our study started with the simulation of pulse compression from an incident long pulse During the pulse compression process ampli\014ed spontaneous emission ASE may cause random 015uctuations of the wave 014eld and the induced gain saturation and hence refractive index variation Such random 015uctuations would lead to random variations of width and position of pulse during pulse evolution Although such effects would slow down the net effect of pulse compression the passive mode-locking mechanism is still expected Ampli\014ed spontaneous emission actually represents one of the effects causing instability of a mode-locked laser The growth of a pulse from a noise burst and the effect of ASE on mode locking will be discussed in another publication In our laser cavity we circulate the optical signal emerging from the bar-port side of the MMI Therefore the leading side of the pulse is clipped through linear coupling of the weak leading-edge part into the cross-port side Meanwhile the trailing side of the pulsed signal is effectively suppressed through gain saturation The combined effect leads to pulse compression In a real laser system the pulse compression will be eventually balanced by pulse broadening due to groupvelocity dispersion GVD Hence a steady-state pulse train can be obtained However in our simulations we have not taken the effect of GVD into account yet We can still obtain steady-state pulse trains The results can be attributed to the following two reasons First as the pulse becomes narrower its leading side becomes steeper Therefore the gain saturation effect occurs at an earlier time This leads to a shorter linear-coupling part and hence a weaker clipping effect Asymptotically the pulse compression effect on the leading side disappears The shorter linear-coupling part also explains the narrowing trend of the pulsed signal emerging from the cross-port side Second on the trailing side the effective signal suppression due to gain saturation also diminishes as the pulsewidth becomes narrower This phenomenon can be understood from 7 In this equation because the 014rst term on the right-hand side is much smaller than the second term the temporal gain variation i.e is determined

LAI et al  SEMICONDUCTOR LASER MODE LOCKING IN MMI WAVEGUIDE AMPLIFIERS 1639 less effective The combination of the two reasons mentioned above explains the steady-state pulse train without considering the effect of GVD Regarding the observed stabilization of pulse position we have the following explanation Typically a pulse shifts forward with the effect of gain saturation However this forward shift counteracts against the clipping effect due to linear coupling The balance between these two effects would lead to pulse position stabilization In fact as the pulse becomes narrower and its leading edge becomes steeper the effects of both forward shift and clipping are gradually weakened Typically in a mode-locked laser the formation of a short pulse train may be caused by more than one pulse compression mechanism Recently the concept of self-bending was proposed to explain the passive mode locking of an external-cavity semiconductor laser The self-bending effect implies that the propagation direction of an optical signal depends on the power level when it emerges from the semiconductor optical ampli\014er This self-bending effect is strongly related to the nonlinear coupling phenomenon discussed in this paper The connection between these two mechanisms of mode locking is another issue of continuing study Pulse compression may start with a transient signal of nanoseconds in width In this situation it may be necessary to consider carrier diffusion Carrier diffusion will blur the lateral carrier distribution which is the key to the nonlinear refractive index variation and hence the nonlinear coupling mechanism Therefore carrier diffusion may have an effect of slowing down the pulse compression in our laser system In summary using the beam-propagation method we have numerically analyzed the operation of a nonlinear coupling mode-locked semiconductor laser with an MMI SOA The nonlinear coupling mechanism is induced by gain saturation and associated refractive index change in the SOA Attention has been particularly paid to the variation of the lateral wave 014eld distribution which is important in the design of the modelocked laser It has been shown that a pulse of several hundred picoseconds can be compressed down to several picoseconds along the circulation of a ring cavity This compression process implies the feasibility of passive mode locking The frequency chirping and lateral distribution of the compressed pulsed beam have been numerically analyzed in detail Our simulations also show that mode locking can be achieved in broad ranges of parameter values and with simple alignment Future work also includes the simulation of the operation of such a mode-locked laser with a linear cavity R EFERENCES  H G W inful and D T W alton

Figure 6 is not as signiìcant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
