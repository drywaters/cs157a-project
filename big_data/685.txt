While pre vious w ork has considered randomly mobile nodes we consider controlled mobile agents Randomly mobile agents are not a v ailable in man y netw ork scenarios such as embedded sensor netw ork deplo yments and the use of controllably mobile agents has been considered for such netw orks W e deri v e results for the w orst case delay  throughput and goodput with controllably mobile relays Our analysis indicates that this scenario dif fers fundamentally from the random mobility case This scenario could ho we v er  be used in defense applications for better communications yield Further  our results are guaranteed to be achie v ed in a particular topology  as opposed to pre

Updated 05 January 2008 functionality to allo w mobile users 1 2 3 4 More recently  ho we v er  mobility has been found to be useful for wireless ad hoc netw orks for increasing their throughput capacity 5 6 7 8 These adv antages are accrued by utilizing the mobility of the nodes for transferring data Mobility pro vides additional capacity to the netw ork o v er and abo v e the wireless channel amongst static nodes alone Mobility can be classied as follo ws 1 Random Mobility  The nodes are assumed to mo v e in an arbitrarily random pattern typically modelled as uniform Bro wnian motion for analytical con v enience Throughput has been studied for 
the cases when all nodes mo v e 5 8 7 and when only a subset of the nodes mo v e 6 9 2 Pr edictable Mobility  This model assumes that the pattern of mobility of the mobile nodes is kno wn and this kno wledge can be e xploited to route data 10 11 12 The mobile agents are not mo ving for the purpose of data transfer and hence their paths may not coincide with the routing requirements 3 Contr olled Mobility  Here the mobility pattern of the mobiles is completely under the control of the netw ork Prototypes of such netw orks ha v e been considered 13 14 15 W e consider the third cate gory  
the netw ork with controlled mobile agents and characterize its delay and goodput proper ties Further  attainable throughput for such a netw ork is also discussed Our analysis sho ws that there are fundamental differences in these properties when the mobility is controlled as opposed to when the mobility is random or predictable Also note that using controlled mobility  we are able to ensure per formance for an y arbitrary topology  The results deri v ed for random models only pro vide the e xpected throughput and delay considered o v er multiple topologies and not what w ould be achie v ed in a particular deplo yment nor what could be guaranteed in the w orst case 1 


The Need for Contr olled Mobility Random mobility is not a v alid model in all classes of wireless ad hoc netw orks In particular  sensor netw orks are autonomous embedded systems and do not in v olv e user carried nodes Most of their nodes are either static or mounted on robots which can be controlled as per application requirements Further  the use of controlled mobility has se v eral adv antages in wireless ad hoc and sensor netw orks Example of such a scenarios is Netw ork ed Infomechanical System NIMS as sho wn in Figure 1 In NIMS the mobile sensor nodes are loaded on a trolle y and hence pro viding infrastructure for the mobility  These mobile sensor nodes are used to collect the data such as en vironmental habitat etc from the static nodes deplo yed on the ground Figur e 1  Example of Controlled Mobility Netw ork ed Infomechanical System NIMS First the mobile nodes can help sa v e ener gy in static embedded nodes This is because if the mobile nodes are used for carrying data then the static nodes need not relay data from other nodes o v er multi-hop wireless routes The e xtra ener gy o v erhead of mobility is not a major concern as these nodes are mobile and can thus periodically rechar ge themselv es Self rechar ging robots ha v e been prototyped such as the robot tor toise described in 16 and the commercially a v ailable Son y Aibo 17 Second mobile agents can be used to connect sparse and disjoint netw orks P articular netw ork components can get disconnected due to deterioration in channel conditions and these can be connected using mobile components Third the number of wireless hops tra v elled by a data pack et is reduced and this reduces the possibility of pack et error  helping enhance goodput performance and delays due to retransmission There are other adv antages of using mobile components for impro ving netw ork sustainability  It w as sho wn in 18 that time synchronization error increases with increasing number of hops between tw o nodes Using the mobiles for time synchronization reduces the hop distance between nodes and hence much ner time synchronization is possible than in a multi-hop case Controlled mobility also helps impro v e the performance of localization systems 19 Mobile components can support other system acti vities such as deli v ering required resources 20 21 Thus the used of control mobility is helpful in se v eral situations and it is w orthwhile to study the performance consider ations for such a scenario The paper is or g anized as follo ws Section 2 states the problem setup and analyzes the achie v able goodput and delay  Along with the discussion on throughput some special cases and comparisons with other mobility models are also presented Practical methods for routing the mobile agents are discussed in section 3 The paper is concluded in section 4 Related W ork The capacity of wireless netw orks w as rst e v aluated in 22 The y assumed a netw ork of n randomly deplo yed nodes in a unit area disc and found the a v erage throughput if sources and destinations are chosen randomly across the netw ork The throughput per node w as found to be   1  p n log n  1  F or the model considered in 22 if the traf c pattern is such that the a v erage distance between source and destination nodes remains small as the netw ork gro ws then the throughput per node w as deri v ed to be O 1 in 23 The use of mobility w as considered in 5 The y assumed all nodes to be randomly mobile within a unit disc area Data traf c pattern w as assumed to be random as in 22 Data tra v eled o v er only tw o wireless hops from the source node to a mobile node which acted as relay and then from the relay to the destination W ith this model the throughput w as found to be 1  Later  8 sho wed that if the mobility w as restricted to one dimension only  the constant order throughout can still be achie v ed The delay for the abo v e scenarios w as found in 7 The y also discussed algorithms for impro ving throughput at the cost of delay and vice v ersa The y found the delay D  n  to be related to the throughput T  n  as D  n    nT  n  for the wireless netw ork scenario of 22 F or the model in 5 when the nodes are randomly mobile with a v erage v elocity v  n   the y found the delay to scale as  p n v  n   Ho we v er  it should be noted that this is for one particular scheme Another scenario for a netw ork with mobile nodes w as considered in 6 The netw ork consisted of n static nodes which acted as sources and destinations for data Ho we v er  the netw ork also had m randomly mobile nodes which were used as relays F or this model using the routing scheme proposed in 6 the throughout is O  m=n log 3 n  with an a v erage delay of 2 d=v where d is the diameter of the netw ork and v is the v elocity of the mobile nodes W e consider a similar model 1 W e use the usual notation f  n   O  g  n  means that there e xists a constant c and an inte ger N such that f  n   cg  n  for n  N  f  n    g  n  means that f  n   O  g  n  and g  n   O  f  n   2 


with n static and m mobile nodes b ut the mobility is controlled instead of random The problem is dened in greater detail in the ne xt section 2  C A P A C I T Y O F T H E M O B I L E C H A N N E L W I T H C O N T R O L L E D M O B I L E A G E N T S Let us rst consider the netw ork scenario as considered in 5 where all nodes are mobile e xcept that instead of considering the nodes to be randomly mobile we assume their motion is controlled F or this case an ob vious communication strate gy is for each source to mo v e to its destination and communicate at almost zero range Hence interference among simultaneous transmissions is zero and each sender recei v er pair could utilize the full a v ailable bandwidth W  The per node throughput is W with constant delay  The delay here depends on the tra veling time of mobile nodes to reach their destinations which is constant as netw ork area is constant This is signicantly better than the w orst case delay in 5 which is innite Clearly  controlled mobility has the potential to yield fundamentally dif ferent goodput throughput and delay limits compared to those achie v ed with random mobility in 5 6 W e no w consider a more practical scenario wherein all nodes are not mobile b ut a small number of controllably mobile agents are a v ailable for routing data Pr oblem Statement Assume n nodes deplo yed randomly in a unit area disc An y node in the netw ork may ha v e data to be sent to an y other node Further  m mobile agents are a v ailable whose paths can be controlled as per the data requirements Here m could potentially be much smaller than n  The mobile tra v els close to the source location collects its data o v er a wireless link and then tra v els to the destination location and deli v ers the data to the destination node ag ain using a wireless link The path from the source to destination may not be direct b ut may inv olv e servicing other data transfer requests in between This is because using one mobile to serv e only one source destination pair at one time does not necessarily yield optimal path planning for the mobiles and we allo w the mobiles to collect data from multiple sources for multiple destinations depending on the node locations Figure 2 sho ws the problem scenario The bandwidth of communication on the wireless channel is W  Note that W could potentially be v ery high as the mobile node can tra v el v ery close to the static node Ho we v er  we perform the analysis for an y a v ailable W  The v elocity of the mobile nodes is denoted by v meters/sec  F or ease of e xposition we assume that each source has k bits for its destination Some nodes may ha v e less than k bits ho we v er using k for all nodes suf ces for e v aluating w orst case limits W e consider the problem of determining the achie v able goodput and delay e xperienced by an y data pack et in the abo v e netw ork scenario in the w orst case W e later also discuss the problem of allotting the optimal paths to the mobile nodes for routing data and throughput that could be obtained from such Source Destination Figur e 2  Netw ork with mobile and static nodes The diamond shaped nodes in red represent the mobile nodes and the circular nodes in blue are the static nodes netw orks The netw ork model described abo v e could be implemented for defense applications F or instance sensors or an y nodes with the controlled mobility could be used to collect the surv eillance data from the deplo yed static nodes This approach as sho wn ne xt is the most ef cient for delay sensiti v e data and pro viding high goodput and throughput Solution Let us calculate the delay suf fered by a k bit pack et in tra v elling from its source to destination after it is ready to be transmitted at the source F or calculating the w orst case achie vable delay  we assume that each mobile serv es n=m sender recei v er pairs Depending on what metric is used for optimizing the paths of the mobile nodes the actual allocation may de viate from this equitable allotment we consider practical methods for such allotment in Section 3 The delay and goodput deri v ed belo w are denitely achie v able using the potentially sub-optimal equitable allotment The sender recei v er pairs need not be addressed one after the other  rather multiple such pairs will be simultaneously serv ed Instead of calculating the w orst case delay indi vidually  we e v aluate the delay and goodput for a group of n=m nodes serv ed by a single mobile Since not all pack ets suf fer the w orst case delay  this method allo ws us to calculate the achie v ed goodput for all the data rather than just for the node which happens to get the w orst case delay  This total delay in serving n=m requests is also the w orst case delay suf fered by a pack et since the w orst case pack et w ould be the one which is serv ed last in the group The delay can be calculated as follo ws 1 Mobile collects data from source:This time is the summation of follo wing terms a Contention near source When the mobile arri v es at a source there may be other mobiles too at this node deli v ering 3 


data destined for this node Assume that the traf c pattern is such that at most  nodes could send data to a particular node Then the maximum number of mobiles which can be present at a node   to deli v er can be   min    m  1 Hence the time spent w aiting for these transmissions becomes d 1   k W  where W is the bandwidth used for communication among static and mobile nodes This communication occurs at v ery small range and does not interfere with other communication in the netw ork b W ireless data communication delay The time tak en to send k bits from the source to the mobile agent will be d 2  k W  c Motion delay The distance to a source from the previous node serv ed can be at most 1   the diameter of the netw ork with unit area Hence this delay is d 3  1    v  where v is the speed of the mobile 2 T ime to tra v el from a serv ed node to a destination This can be at most d 4  1    v  as e xplained for the tra v el time tak en to reach a source The delay  d 4  needs to be added in addition to d 3 since d 3 only calculates the time tak en to arri v e at sources and not at destinations Adding these will gi v e the per request tra v el time 3 Contention at destination This is d 5   k W as w as the contention at source 4 T ime to deli v er at destination The transmission time at destination is d 6  k W  Thus the total delay  D  for the w orst case pack et among the n=m sender recei v er pairs serv ed by one mobile agent is the summation of the delays e v aluated abo v e D  n m  d 1  d 2  d 3  d 4  d 5  d 6  2 Substituting the v alues of f d i g 6 i 1 and simplifying we obtain D  2 n m  k W   1  1  v  3 The goodput per node can be dened as the bits transmitted by a node di vided by the time tak en for those bits Thus the goodput G  for the node with the w orst case delay is G  k D  mk W  v 2 n  k  v   1  W  4 The total goodput for the group of n=m nodes is nG=m as the total data transferred within the delay  D  w as nk m  Thus the netw ork goodput is m   nT m  since there are m groups Thus the per node goodput and delay are G  O  m=n  and D  O  n=m  respecti v ely  Thr oughput Discussion In a broad sense netw ork throughput consists of sum of the data rates that are a v ailable to nodes for simultaneous transmission in a netw ork Here we can ha v e m nodes in the netw ork simultaneously transmitting at the data rate of almost W bps considering mobile nodes tra v el v ery close to static nodes That is a v ailable netw ork throughput is f  mW   where f    indicates some real function Hence the throughput per node is T  f  mW n  bps It can be observ ed that as opposed to the pre vious results the netw ork could be made scalable Scalability Concerns Let us study the ef fect of the wireless bandwidth a v ailable among static and mobile nodes This bandwidth can be v ery lar ge as the communication range is small and f ast technologies such as UWB or a contact based transfer may be used W e let W  1 in equations 3 and 4 D W 1  2 n m v 5 T W 1  mk  v 2 n 6 As e xpected the delay and goodput are limited by the mobile v elocity  v m/s in this case While the delay is reduced compared to the case of nite W  the scalability of the netw ork delay is not af fected and hence the in v estment in lar ger bandwidth may not be recommendable if scalability is the k e y concern Ho we v er  the goodput and throughput can be v ery high here as the v alue of k used can be v ery lar ge when W  1  Consider ne xt the case when the number of mobiles used is a linear function of the number of static nodes in the netw ork i.e m  an where a is a positi v e constant potentially much less than 1 In this case   min    m    since we e xpect n and hence an to be much greater than   Here the delay and goodput can be seen to be D m  2 a  k W    1  1  v  7 G m  ak W  v 2 k  v    1  W  8 These are both independent of n and m  Hence we achie v e G  O 1 and D  O 1 for this case In this case e v en per node throughput w ould be O 1  Observ e that compared to the case of random mobility 5 where O 1 throughput is achie v ed when all n nodes are mobile using controlled mobility such throughput can be achie v ed with less than n mobile nodes Also while the w orst case delay in 5 can be innite here the w orst case delay is also O 1  Mobile and W ir eless Channels W e calculated the capacity when data is transferred using only the mobile relays and multihop wireless transmission is 4

Update Control Processor Track Cluster Accept Time Compare Time Stamp Report Figure 13  Hardware Track Clustering Block Diagram dened update rates set by the time threshold Track Cluster A set of smaller modules comprise the track cluster function  The rst module calculates the distance and is designed in a modular fashion so that it can be replaced with diverse metrics implemented in hardware The Manhattan distance calculation is replicated in parallel to evaluate multiple dis tances simultaneously The second component is the cluster table The cluster table maintains a list of current clusters/tracks locally on the F PGA chip The centroids of the clusters represent the projected position of the track for prioritization This projected posi tion determines if an incoming track matches a cluster The calculated parallel distances are passed to the accept module t o make the critical decision to forward the data Accept The accept module compares all parallel distances to a clust er threshold If the distance is less than the cluster threshol d the module will assign the incoming track to the specied cluste r The module will not assign the incoming track if the distance s are greater than the cluster threshold If this occurs the s ystem currently decides the incoming track is a new cluster and will specify that a new entry needs to be added to the cluster table Update After the accept module determines if an assignment is accepted the update module then updates the cluster table Th e update is computed from the velocity information contained in the track data and determines the projected position of th e track The projected position is passed to the cluster table in the track cluster module for storage The accept module determines whether the track is a new track and needs to be added to the set of known clusters The update module will calculate the projection of the track and then send the infor mation to the cluster table to be stored Time Compare The time compare module determines if the track should be dropped or forwarded to downstream modules/systems The module is comprised of a timetable that maintains two time values the last time the cluster/track was reported and the last time a track message was received A time threshold determines if a track message should be sent or aggregated If the difference between the last sent time and the current time is greater than the threshold the data is sent from the node However if the difference is less than the time thresh old the data updates the cluster table however the data is not sent from the node The timetable also contains information regarding the velo city and the accuracy of the incoming track data This data is used in conjunction with the time data to determine whether the system sends or drops the data The velocity information is used to determine the three time categories or priorities of trafc high medium and low 9 C LUSTERING O BSERVATION D ATA The track data is part of the network trafc owing to and from each clustering node Each track observation has a current position and velocity in the xy dimension The clusteri ng system can be expanded into a larger dimensional space although the dimensionality is set to two currently The clustering nodes are interconnected using a network where multiple sensors on different platforms report the sa me track information but may have different accuracies These tracks are similar representations of the same information  but are received at multiple clustering nodes at different t imes due to network traversal The clustering nodes maintain information on the current clusters active tracks and clust er centroids In addition to the position of the track the system uses time stamps to determine the last time a cluster was reported The clustering system uses a modied algorithm similar to K-means In traditional K-means the number of clusters K is set to a specied number We allow the number of clusters to start from zero and expand as new tracks are found The algorithm utilizes two tables to achieve the desired fun ctionality The rst table the cluster table is comprised o f the current clusters that are projections of where the track sho uld be in the next track message As tracks are received they are compared to the clusters using the Manhattan distance If th e distance is less than a threshold cluster threshold the t rack message is assigned to the specied cluster The velocity of the track message updates the projection of the cluster Thi s projection update allows the system to account for tracks th at are not static If the distance from the input track is greate r than the threshold for all the current clusters a new cluste r is added The second table the track time table maintains two times for each cluster the last time a message was sent about that cluster and the last time a message was received about that cluster Since the track data is time stamped when the clus9 


tering system receives the track the system compares the ti me received to the time sent If this time is greater than the tim ing threshold the system will allow the message to pass and update the cluster received time in the table However if th e time is less than the time threshold the system updates the cluster received time and removes the message from the outgoing trafc 10 H ARDWARE F ABRICATION The implementation on the NetFPGA platform was able achieve a clock frequency of 125 MHz The hardware utilization of a track clustering algorithm with four parallel distance metrics is shown in Table 1 With a slice utilization of 44 the number of distance metrics can be increased This increase in parallel distance calculation reduces the late ncy to compare incoming tracks to all known clusters XC2VP50 Utilization Resources Utilization Percentage Slices 10533 out of 23616 44 4-input LUTS 14318 out of 47232 30 Flip Flops 12958 out of 47232 27 Block RAMs 82 out of 232 35 External IOBs 353 out of 692 51 Table 1  Device utilization for XC2VP50 Hardware Track Clustering with four concepts Given our implementation with four parallel distance metri cs with 100 total tracks in the cluster table at any one time we can estimate the total time for clustering an incoming track  The parallel distances can be calculated in four cycles The total number of cycles required to produce all 100 distances would be 100 Since the operation of the clustering circuits are pipelined the accept module would only require three cy cles for determining the correct action to perform The upda te module would require three cycles to perform an update or creation of a new cluster The time table compare takes three cycles Add in an additional four cycles for header processing and we have a total of 113 cycles Since we are running the hardware at 125 Mhz the total time required for distance calculations assignment determination and updates requ ires 0.904  s for each incoming track This gives us an approximate throughput of 1.1 million packets per second 11 C ONCLUSIONS The results show that the real time hardware using the Kmean algorithm for clustering can accurately locate redundant track data for aggregation identify new tracks and se lect the critical tracks to be forwarded to other distributed sen sor nodes for fusing Improvements in the information quality and latency for distributed track fusion were demonstrated using advanced clustering Track data distributed using multicast is shown to generate 2.3 Gigabytes of trafc for large scale 75 nodes fusion Experiments revealed state-of-the-art CPUs could not handle bursts of packets received which resulted in loss of pack ets due to network buffer overow The clustering gateway node was shown to provide an 18 to 48x reduction in bandwidth through eliminating redundant data The results were tested in a distributed environment called Emulab that used a software version of the clustering algorithms State-oftheart Emulab CPUs could not keep up with the track data resulting in network buffer overow and loss of packets This illustrates the need for our special processing solution us ing FPGA technology Real time clustering is implemented in the network layer OS I layer 3 to reduce the bandwidth intelligently while mainta ining high information content Our pipelined hardware desig n calculates four parallel distance metrics for 100 total tra cks in 100 cycles The total time required for distance calculations assignment determination and updates is only 0.904  s for each incoming track The hardware solution is prototyped using the Stanford NetFPGA in the Boeing Center for Intelligent Networked Systems CINS lab Our real time solution preserves Layer 7 resources and decreases latencies The ability to add real time hardware in t he network layer improves MTT performance in bandwidth limited environments ultimately preserving legacy avionic ne twork resources 12 F UTURE W ORK Novel methods to illustrate the increased value of information using clustering over normal queuing methods was constructed based on spatial methods Our use of clustering algorithms was fairly limited with K-means however there are plans to implement solutions based on N-means algorithms in the future We realize selection of the correct clusterin g thresholds must be dynamic based on the separation of target s and is highly dependent on accurately projecting the centro id The relationship between our temporal and spacial clusteri ng algorithms must be integrated into a single solution We pla n to develop dynamic clustering thresholds for more accurate prediction of target paths while selectively reducing the d istribution bandwidth Real time assessment of the information value allows us to dynamically adjust the thresholds fo r preserving the key observations We theorize that changing the update rates proportionally with the target velocity wi ll provide improved information value We also plan to add a weighting factor to take into account proximity sensor acc uracy and threat level will provide a more intelligent soluti on Interconnecting the time increment used in the projection o f the clustering centroid with the temporal target rate will s implify the algorithms and hardware Reliable transfer of data using wireless is available in sev eral avionic systems and will be evaluated as a separate test case Latency will denitely increase if all dropped packet s are transferred as required by reliable transport 10

assumes that around 20% of the attribute and text values are different from the template values Table 3 lists results from this experiment. The third column of the table shows the number of bytes transmitted for each sample document, while the 6 th column shows the time used to construct tokens from the compressed document. The table shows that, under above-described setup, the amount of data transmitted are reduced to 2.6% to 15.7% of the original size second column, listed in KB time is reduced to 5.4% to 11.3% of the Nature mode tokenization time, or 11.5% to 25% of the Swift mode tokenization time 5.5 Discussion Since in our implementations, we make changes to base systems \(KXML and XT changes are required to implement Structure Encoding performance differences demonstrated in this section are caused by differences in techniques rather than differences in implementations Our experiments clearly show that Structure Encoding can, potentially, greatly improve the efficiency of XML processing with relatively low penalty for worst cases. The worst case scenario happens when a receiver uses hash function to identify the structure of a document, only to find out that the document structure is not in cache. The penalty it pays for such worst case scenario, 11.1% for DOM-style parsing and 8.9% for transformation, can easily be compensated by future structure recurrence. Such cache-miss penalty is negligible when sender-assigning scheme is used Systems that are conscious of such client-side penalty can let the sender or anyone in the middle of the transmission path to assign ID without altering the semantics of the message or document Although we didn’t measure the impact of compression on parsing and transformation, it can be inferred from tables 2 and 3. For example, in the book case, with tokenization time reduced from 8.6ms Swift mode\s \(compressed\e will likely be further reduced from 8.8ms to around 1.3ms compared with 24.4ms for KDOM\Similarly transformation time may be further reduced from 11.5ms to around 4.0ms \(compared with 48.3ms for XT\Encoding based XML compression offers additi onal, significant performance improvements for XML parsing and transformation in mobile environments, where closelycoupled proxies commonly exists. With compression turned off, Structure Enc oding is fully compatible with Web specifications and can be used between any two Internet hosts, and it still offer very significant performance improvements when there is structure recurrence Without compression, for documents with recurrent structures, tokenization and structure hashing cost dominates the overall cost for parsing, and is the major part of the cost for transformation. Tokenization and structure hashing however are relatively simple operations that may be implemented in hardware with low cost. \(In fact, some mobile chipsets already have hardware implementation of hash functions such as MD5 for security purposes implementation can reduce tokenization and structure hashing cost to a fifth of the current cost, then there will be additional substantial improvement for the parsing and transformation of most of the documents used in our experiments In our system, a document havi ng a structure slightly different \(e.g., added a new element\from a previous structure will not be able to reuse the structure processing result of the previous structure. However our system pays off as long as this new, slightly different structure recurs in future documents 6 CONCLUSION, LIMITATIONS, AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we motivated exploiting structure recurrence to speedup XML processing in mobile environments, by reduci ng structure related transmission and processing costs. We presented the concept of Structure Encoding, and described approaches to quickly identifying recurring structures including one using collision-resistant hash function We explained in detail how to use structure encoding to speedup XML transmission, tokenization, treebuilding, and transformation. We described our implementation of st ructure encoding based tokenizer DOM parser \(based on kXML\processor \(based on XT\pression scheme. Our experiments conducted on a mobile test-bed demonstrated dramatic performance improvement in the presence of structure recurrence and low overhead otherwise. In ideal cases structure encoding offers speedups of up to 7 for parsing and over 38 for XSL transformation, and up to 97.4% in size reduction when 20% of the text and attribute values change Structure encoding, however, is not applicable to all XML applications. Rather, it is more applicable to data-centric XML processing than to document-centric XML processing. A user randomly browsing Web pages is not likely to have high structure recurrence probabilities

Our current implementa tion does not support documents with “variable-le ngth arrays” – lists of identically structured elements with non-fixed lengths Otherwise identically structured documents with different array lengths are currently considered as having different structure We are currently working on supporting “variablelength arrays” to extend the applicability of Structure Encoding. We are also looking at provide similar, but less aggressive, optimization support for schemaconforming documents REFERENCES  Nokia Web Services – Helping Operators Mobilize the Internet Http://www.projectliberty.org/resources/whitepapers/W S_Operators_A4_0408.pdf  The SAX Project. http://www.saxproject.org  XML Pull Parsing. http://www.xmlpull.org  W3C Document Object Model http://www.w3.org/DOM  WAP Binary XML Content Format http://www.w3.org/TR/wbxml  Efficiency Structured XML. http://www.esxml.org  VTD-XML. http://vtd-xml.sourceforge.net  XSLTC Documentation. http://xml.apache.org/xalanj/xsltc  kXML. http://www.kxml.org  Liefke, H. and D.

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
