hav e b e e n r e c ogni z e d and i n v e s t i gat e d onl y r ecently This paper deals with the problem of limiting disclosure of sensitive rules In particular it is attempted to selectively hide some frequent itemsets from large databases with as little as possible impact on other non-sensitive frequent itemsets Frequent itemsets are sets of items that appear in the database 252frequently enough\272 and identifying them is usually the 256rst step toward association/correlation rule or sequential pattern mining Experimental results are presented along with some theoretical issues related to this 
problem 1 Introduction Securing data against unauthorized accesses has been a long-term goal of the database security research community and the government statistical agencies Solutions to such a problem require combining several techniques and mechanisms In particular it is well known that simply restricting access to sens itive data does not ensure full data protection It may for example be the case that sensitive 003 Portions of this work were supported by sponsors of the Center for 
Education and Research in Information Assurance and Security or 252high\272 data items can be inferred from non-sensitive or 252low\272 data through some inference process based on some knowledge the user has Such a problem known as the 252inference problem\272 has been widely investigated 9 5  and possible solutions have been identi\256ed In general all those approaches address the problem of how to prevent disclosure of sensitive data through the combination of known inference rules with non-sensitive data  E xa m p le s o f inference rules are deductive rules and functional depen 
dencies Those approaches however do not deal with the problem of how to prevent the discovery of the inference rules themselves In other words rules are not considered as sensitive 252knowledge\272 Recent advances in data mining techniques and related applications 6 h av e h o w ev er  i n c r eas ed t h e s ecu r i t y r i s k s one may incur when releasing data The main goal of such techniques is to enable the rapid and ef\256cient discovery of hidden intensional knowledge from a possibly very large set of data items The use of such techniques would therefore enable users to easily acquire not only knowledge that could 
be used to infer sensitive data but also sensitive knowledge Note that knowledge usually acquired through data mining techniques cannot be considered as absolute It can be rather characterized as probabilistic knowledge However even such probabilistic knowledge may provide sensitive information to users 3 Issues related to data mining and security have been recognized and investigated only r ecently So only a few approaches have been devised till now These approaches are discussed in Section 2 However there is still no comprehensive view of those issues and of the possible spectrum 
of solutions There is for example the need of analyzing speci\256c data mining techniques in the light of the security problem which was mentioned previously In this paper a contribution is made towards addressing such a need in the context of a speci\256c type of knowledge Such type of knowledge known as association rules consists of a set of statements of the form 25290 of air-force 


basis having super-secret plane A also have helicopters of type B\272 An association rule is usually characterized by two measures the support and the con\256dence In general algorithms for the discovery of association rules detect only rules whose support is higher than a minimum threshold value We refer to such rules as 252signi\256cant rules\272 The problem that we deal with in this paper is how to modify a given database so that the support of a given set of sensitive rules mined from the database decreases below the minimum support value We would like however to remark that our approach is a simple building block that by itself does not provide a comprehensive solution to the problem of data mining and security However it can be considered as a basic ingredient of such a comprehensive solution The remainder of this paper is organized as follows First we review current approaches addressing data mining and security We then present a formulation of our problem and show that the optimal solution to it is NP-hard We then present some heuristics Finally we outline further work 2 Related Work Security and privacy threats arising from the use of data mining techniques have been 256rst pointed out in an early paper by O Leary 8 an d r ecen t l y i n t h e s emi n al p a p e r b y Clifton and Marks 4  T h e a u th o r s i n  4  o u tlin e p o s s i b l e solutions to prevent data mining of signi\256cant knowledge that include releasing only subsets of the source database fuzzyfying the source database and augmenting the source database They also point out a 252research agenda\272 that includes several issues to be investigated Among those issues a relevant one to our approach is the analysis of mining algorithms which gives the criteria that must be used by the algorithm in order to decide whether or not rules are relevant so that one can prevent the mining of sensitive rules The paper of Clifton and Marks however does not analyze any speci\256c data mining technique or algorithm whereas this paper deals with a speci\256c technique A recent paper by Clifton 3 p r es en t s an i n t e r e s t i n g a p proach to the problem of data mining and security The approach is based on releasing a sample of the source database so that the rules mined from the released sample are not signi\256cant A main result of the paper is to show how to determine the right sample size by using lower bounds from pattern recognition The proposed approach is independent from any speci\256c data mining technique The main difference between such approach and ours is that we aim at a 256ner tuning of the intensional knowledge to be released In other words our aim is on how to reduce the signi\256cance of a given rule or sets of rules by possibly leaving unaltered the signi\256cance of the other rules or by minimally changing it By contrast the approach by Clifton aims at estimating the error which is introduced on the signi\256cance of the rules by reducing the sample sizes It is worth noting however that the two approaches can be used together as part of a comprehensive environment supporting the security administration In addition to work dealing speci\256cally with the issue of data mining and security it is also important to mention work in the area of security for statistical databases 10  Such work deals with the problem of limiting disclosure of individual data items and at the same time ensures that correct statistics can be derived from the released database The main difference between the work on security for statistical databases and the work presented in this paper or more generally in the area of data mining is that in the latter two cases even if individual data items are allowed to be directly accessed the intensional knowledge which is derived can be controlled However techniques used in statistical databases such as data fuzzy\256cation or data swapping could also be used in the other context 3 Association Rules and Sanitization In this section the notion of association rules is precisely de\256ned and a formulation of the problem is given It is then proven that the problem of 256nding an optimal sanitization of the source database is NP-Hard This is done for a number of progressively more realistic notions of what it means to 252sanitize\272 The proofs are based on reductions of the problem addressed in this paper to the Hitting-Set problem 3.1 The Problem The problem of association rule mining was initially presented in 1 T h e a ut hors i n  2 e x t e nde d a nd form a l i z e d the problem as follows Let I  f i 1 i 2 i m g be a set of literals called items Let D be a database of transactions where each transaction T is an itemset such that T 022I Associated with each transaction is a unique identi\256er called its TID A set of items X 032I is called an itemset Atransaction T contains an itemset X if X 022 T An association rule is an implication of the form X  Y where X 032I  Y 032I and X  Y   Therule X  Y holds in the set of transactions D with con\256dence c if j X  Y j j X j 025 c where j A j is the number of occurrences of the set of items A in the set of transactions D Therule X  Y has support s if j X  Y j N 025 s where N is the plurality of the transaction set D  In this paper we focus on the discovery of large/frequent itemsets in order to keep the discussion simple These itemsets have greater support than the minimum support speci\256ed This restriction implies that the only way to hide a rule is by decreasing the support of its corresponding large itemset Exhaustive search of frequent sets is obviously infeasible for all but small itemsets the search space of 2 


potential frequent itemsets increases exponentially with the number of items in the transactions A more ef\256cient method for the discovery of frequent itemsets can be based on the following iterative procedure in each pass the algorithm starts with a seed set of large itemsets called candidate itemsets The support of these itemsets is computed during the pass over the data At the end of the pass it is determined which of the candidate itemsets are actually large and they become the seed for the next phase This process continues until no new large itemsets are found In the 256rst pass the support of individual itemsets is counted in order to be determined which of them are large The speci\256c problem we address can be stated as follows Let D the source database let R be a set of signi\256cant association rules that are mined from D andlet R h beaset of rules in R  How can we transform D into a database D 0 so that all or the maximum number of  rules in R can still be mined from D 0 but for the rules in R h  D 0 then becomes the released database  Therefore our problem is to reduce the support of the rules in R h below the given threshold We refer to such a transformation as sanitization of D In addition to preserve as much knowledge as possible the transformation we seek should also be achieved at as much low cost as possible 3.2 Optimal Sanitization Is NP-Hard Let A be the set of large itemsets that are 252good\272 in the sense that we do not wish to make them small Let B be the set of large itemsets that are 252bad\272 i.e we want to make them small These two goals can be incompatible so the problems we formulate below are based on the notion that we want to make all of B s itemsets small while making as few as possible of A s itemsets small We prove the NP-hardness of three optimization problems based on this notion The 256rst called PROBLEM 1 is really just a 252warmup\272 for PROBLEM 2 because its framework is somewhat unrealistic It assumes that we can remove support for the various individual items independently of one another Its proof is simple and serves as an easy introduction to the more elaborate reduction needed for proving PROBLEM 2 whose framework is realistic 261 more on this below Finally we prove the NP-hardness of PROBLEM 3 which is the problem that we focus on this paper More speci\256cally in PROBLEM 3 we can modify a transaction by deleting some items from it PROBLEM 1 Given two sets A and B of subsets of a 256nite set J  such that no element of B is a subset of any element of A and no element of A is a subset of any element of B  256nd a set of elements R in J such that every subset in B contains at least one of those elements while minimizing the number of subsets of A that contain elements from R  Note The idea is that by removing support from the items in R we make all of B s itemsets small while affecting as few of A s itemsets as possible The framework considered next for PROBLEM 2 below is more realistic in that we now weaken the support for itemsets in B by deleting some transactions from the database Of course there are many ways of doing this some of which have more impact on A than others The goal is to do it in a way that minimizes this impact on A  Note In our formulation of PROBLEM 2 the notion of 252large\272 is stated in terms of the actual number of transactions containing the itemset rather than as a percentage There is no loss of generality in doing so b ecause the number of transactions in the database can easily be kept constant whenever we delete a transaction we can keep the total size of the database constant by replacing the deleted transaction with another transaction that has no effect on either A or B for example the new transaction could contain only items that have very small support in the database possibly zero support i.e 252new\272 items We henceforth call t the threshold for 252largeness\272 i.e an itemset is considered large iff there are at least t transactions containing it PROBLEM 2 We are given a set J of items an integer t  a database D of transactions each of which is a subset of J  sets A and B each of which contains a collection of subsets of J the 252itemsets\272 Each itemset in A or in B has support 025 t in D  The problem is to compute a subset D 0 of D such that deleting D 0 from D results in a database where every itemset in B has support t  and the number of itemsets in A that have support t is minimized PROBLEM 3 We are given a set J of items an integer t  a database D of transactions each of which is a subset of J  sets A and B each of which contains a collection of subsets of J the 252itemsets\272 Each itemset in A or in B has support 025 t in D  What we are allowed to do is at a 256ner granularity than in PROBLEM 2 We can now individually modify a transaction instead of deleting it by deleting some items from it The problem is then to modify some transactions in D such that in the resulting database every itemset in B has support t  and the number of itemsets in A that have support t is minimized The proofs of the NP-hardness of PROBLEM 1 2 and 3 are based on reductions from the NP-hard problem of HITTING SET which we review next HITTING SET page 222 of the book by Garey and Johnson on NP-completeness  G i ve n a s e t C of subsets of a 256nite set S  256nd a smallest subset S 0 of S such that every subset in C contains at least one element in S 0 The problem remains NP-hard even if every subset in C consists of no more than 2 elements of S  Proposition 1 PROBLEM 1 is NP-hard Proof Given an instance of HITTING SET here is how to create an instance of PROBLEM 1 such that a polynomial time solution to the latter implies a polynomial time solution 3 


to the former Let S  f 1 n g for HITTING SET Then for PROBLEM 1 here is what A  B  J look like in terms of the C and S of the HITTING SET problem instance J  S f n  1 g i.e J  f 1 n;n  1 g  A  ff 1 n  1 g  f 2 n  1 g   f n n  1 gg B  C  hence n  1 does not appear anywhere in B  The R that solves the instance of PROBLEM 1 is equal to the S 0 that solves the instance of HITTING SET 2 Theorem 1 PROBLEM 2 is NP-hard Proof A reduction from HITTING SET Let S be f 1 n g and C be the collection of subsets of S for HITTING SET To solve HITTING SET one must 256nd a minimum subset S 0 of S such that every x in C contains at least one element of S 0  Without loss of generality we can assume that S does not contain a redundant element i.e no pair i  j of elements from S is such that 252 x 2 C contains i 272 implies 252 x contains j 272 otherwise i is redundant and we can completely ignore it when solving the problem Also because HITTING SET remains NP-hard if every x in C consists of no more than two elements we assume that this is the case We can also assume that no x in C consists of a single element because such an element surely has to be part of S 0 i.e the problem remains NP-hard if we assume that C is a set of unordered pairs of elements of S  We next explain how the instance of PROBLEM 2 is created First we introduce some notation We use f  i  to denote the set of items that appear with i in one or more x in C including i itself that is f  i  f j  j  i or f i j g2 C g  Note that no f  j  properly contains another f  i  because otherwise i or j is redundant We use g  i  to denote f  i  f n  1 g  The symbols J  t  A  B  D in what follows are as in the de\256nition of PROBLEM 2 that was given earlier in this section The instance of PROBLEM 2 which can easily be created in polynomial time has the following parameters J  S f n  1 g  i.e the items are 1  2 n;n  1 t  2 i.e two occurrences are needed to be considered 252large\272 A  f f  1  f  2    f  n  g  note that item n+1 appears nowhere in A  B  f x f n  1 g  x 2 C g The database D consists of 2 n transactions D  f f  1  g  1  f  2  g  2  f  n  g  n  g  Observe that each itemset f i j n  1 g in B has support of precisely 2 from transactions g  i  and g  j   Each itemset f  i  in A also has support of precisely 2 from transactions f  i  and g  i   A solution to PROBLEM 2 does not delete an f  i  transaction because that would decrease s upport for itemset f  i  in A without decreasing support for any itemset in B because the latter contain item n  1 whereas f  i  does not If the solution deletes transaction g  i  then 1 it decreases the support of every itemset of B that contains i from 2 to 1 i.e it makes that itemset small this corresponds to a solution in HITTING SET that selects i to be in S 0  2 it decreases the support of itemset f  i  in A from 2 to 1 i.e it makes the itemset small minimizing the number of times this happens in the solution to PROBLEM 2 corresponds to minimizing the size of S 0 in HITTING SET The above observations imply that from the set of transactions deleted by the solution to PROBLEM 2 we can obtain the S 0 that solves HITTING SET 2 Theorem 2 PROBLEM 3 is NP-hard Proof A reduction from HITTING SET Let S be f 1 n g and C be the collection of subsets of S for HITTING SET To solve HITTING SET one must 256nd a minimum subset S 0 of S such that every x in C contains at least one element of S 0  As in the proof of Theorem 1 S does not contain a redundant element and every x in C consists of two elements We next explain how the instance of PROBLEM 3 is created The symbols J t;A;B;D in what follows are as in the de\256nition of PROBLEM 3 that we gave earlier J  S f n  1  3 n g  That is the items are f 1  2  4 n g  To improve the readability of our proof we use the notation  i for item n  i  i for item 2 n  i and i for item 3 n  i 1 024 i 024 n  As in the proof of PROBLEM 2 we use f  i  to denote the set of items that appear with i in one or more x in C including i itself that is f  i  f j  j  i or f i j g2 C g  Note that no f  j  properly contains another f  i  because otherwise i or j is redundant We use g  i  to denote f  i  as well as all  j  j and j for which j 2 f  i   i.e g  i  f  i  f  j  j 2 f  i  g[f  j  j 2 f  i  g[f  j  j 2 f  i  g  For every x  f i j g2 C we use p  x  to denote the pair f  i   j g and we use P to denote the set of all such pairs i.e P  f p  x   x 2 C g  4 


For every x  f i j g2 C we use q  x  to denote f  i   j   i   j g and we use Q to denote the set of all such q  x  s i.e Q  f q  x   x 2 C g  For every x  f i j g2 C we use t  x  to denote f  i   j   i   j   i   j g and we use T to denote the set of all such t  x  s i.e T  f t  x   x 2 C g  The other parameters of the instance of PROBLEM 3 which can easily be created in polynomial time are described next t  2 i.e two occurrences are needed to be considered 252large\272 The set A now consists of the f  i  s as well as the p  x  s q  x  s and t  x  s A  f f  1  f  2  f  n  g P  Q  T B  ff i j  i   j g  f i j g2 C g  The database D consists of 2 n transactions D  f f  1  g  1  f  2  g  2  f  n  g  n  g  Observe that each itemset f i j  i   j g in B has support of precisely 2 from transactions g  i  and g  j   Each itemset f  i  in A also has support of precisely 2 from transactions f  i  and g  i   Itemsets f  i   j g  f  i   j   i   j g  and f  i   j   i   j   i   j g in A each have s upport 2 from transactions g  i  and g  j   A solution to PROBLEM 3 does not modify an f  i  transaction because that would decrease s upport for itemset f  i  in A without decreasing support for any itemset in B  Now suppose the solution modi\256es a transaction g  i  The solution surely does not remove a  j or  j from transaction g  i  because that would decrease s upport for itemsets of A without decreasing support for any itemset in B Wealso claim that the solution does not decrease support for B by removing a  j from transaction g  i   i.e that g  i  is always modi\256ed by removing from it item\(s in f 1 n g Tosee that this is so assume to the contrary that g  i  was modi\256ed by removing a  j from it we call this a 252type 1\272 modi\256cation We now show that this leads to a contradiction Comment Observe that deleting j where j 6  i  from g  i  can always be replaced by deleting i from g  i  This is because alt hough both have the same effect on A i.e weakening f  i   deleting i weakens every x 2 B where i 2 x whereas deleting j 6  i weakens only f i j  i   j g2 B  The deletion of  j from transaction g  i  weakens in A the at least three itemsets p  x   q  x   t  x  where j 2 x  On the other hand modifying g  i  by removing from it an item j 2f 1 n g a 252type 2\272 modi\256cation rather than removing a  j  would have the same effect on B but would weaken only f  i  in A  This implies that globally replacing in the solution all of the type 1 modi\256cations by the corresponding type 2 modi\256cations would not make a difference for B but would decrease the number of itemsets of A that are affected implying that the solution could not have been optimal We henceforth assume that the solution contains only type 2 modi\256cations to transactions A type 2 modi\256cation that an item from transaction g  i  corresponds to a solution in HITTING SET that selects i to be in S 0  It also decreases the support of itemset f  i  in A from 2 to 1 i.e it makes the itemset small minimizing the number of times this happens in the solution to PROBLEM 3 corresponds to minimizing the size of S 0 in HITTING SET The above observations imply that from the set of transactions modi\256ed by the solution to PROBLEM 3 we can obtain the S 0 that solves HITTING SET 2 4 Heuristic Approach In this section we describe the heuristic approach that we propose to solve the Optimal Sanitization problem Before the algorithm is presented some preliminary de\256nitions are given and the data structures needed for the algorithm are described with some examples where necessary Some complexity analysis results follow the formal presentation of the algorithm as well as experimental results from the performance evaluation of the proposed heuristic are given 4.1 Preliminary De\256nitions In order to better illustrate how the algorithm works we represent all large itemsets in the database in terms of a graph referred to as the itemset graph  In the remainder of the discussion we use the term 252 i itemset\272 where i is an integer with the meaning of an itemset whose cardinality is i  De\256nition 4.1  Itemset Graph et SLI be a set of large itemsets An Itemset Graph over SLI is de\256ned as follows i there is a node for each itemset in SLI  and ii there is an edge from the node representing itemset i h to the node representing itemset i j if i h 032 i j  An itemset graph is the result of a breadth-\256rst search in the space of potentially large itemsets Each node except from the itemset contains other information that we will introduce later on Assuming the existence of a database like the one shown in Table 1a then the Figure 1 shows the graph for the example database for the large itemsets shown in Table 1b There is an ordering imposed by the itemset graph in each large itemset This ordering implies the level of a large itemset in the itemset graph 5

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con“gurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con“gure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef“ciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/˜manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
