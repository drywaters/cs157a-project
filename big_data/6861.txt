mining With our previous studies on content-based retrieval of visual artifacts we study in this paper the methods for mining content-based associations with recurrent items and with spatial relationships from large visual data repositories A progressive resolution re\002nement approach is proposed in which frequent item-sets at rough resolution levels are mined and progressively 002ner resolutions are mined only on the candidate frequent item-sets derived from mining rough resolution levels Such a multi-resolution mining strategy substantially reduces the overall data mining cost 
without loss of the quality and completeness of the results 1 Introduction Mining knowledge from large databases has been the focus of many recent studies and applications however most of these have emphasized corporate data typically in alphanumeric databases Little research has been conducted on mining multimedia data Nevertheless a few interesting studies and successful applications involving multimedia data mining have been reported For example 12 d escribes the CONQUEST system that combines satellite data with geophysical data to discover patterns in global climate change The SKICAT system 4 i nt e g rat e s t echni ques f or 
image processing and data classi\002cation in order to identify 223sky objects\224 captured in a very large satellite picture set Multimedia data has also been a focal point of our research and we have integrated image processing with database mining techniques and developed a multimedia data mining system prototype MultiMediaMiner 15 14 003 Research is supported in part by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Canadian Networks of Centres of Excellence IRIS-3 The system uses a data cube structure for mining charac 
teristic association and classi\002cation rules However the system does not use image content to the extent we wanted The presence of colours and textures in images was used but not localization of these visual features their spatial relationships their motion in time for video etc In this paper we extend the concept of content-based multimedia association rules using feature localization and introduce the concept of progressive re\002nement in the discovery of patterns in images from coarse to 002ne resolution Two algorithms are developed for mining multimedia asso 
ciation rules with recurrent items and recurrent spatial relationships Our major contribution in this paper is the development of a progressive multi-resolution re\002nement method for mining multimedia associations with recurrent objects and for mining spatial relationships between visual descriptors in large image collections The remainder of the paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we introduce the concept of multimedia association rules In sections 3 and 4 algorithms for mining multimedia multiset associations and associations with spatial relationships are presented Also in Section 4 the progressive 
multi-resolution re\002nement approach is proposed Section 5 brie\003y reports our performance study Finally we conduct a short discussion and conclude our study 2 Multimedia association rules 2.1 Feature localization in multimedia data Feature localization is a new concept of rough image segmentation introduced in Im ag e s e g m e n t atio n i s a process which segments an image into disjoint regions A region consists of a set of pixels that share certain properties e.g similar colour similar texture etc The traditional segmentation algorithms assume 1 regions are 
mostly connected  2 regions are disj oint  R i  R j    for i 6  j  and 3 segmentation is compl ete in that any pixel will be assigned to some region and the union of all 


Figure 1 Example of colour localization for a multi\255level resolution image regions is the entire image   m k 1 R k  I  Segmentation does not give a good representation of image content A more useful and attainable process is feature localization that identi\002es features by their locality and proximity Asde\002nedin[7,13 a locale L x is a local enclosure or locality of feature x  L x has an envelope L x which is a set of tiles to represent the locality of L x  and some geometric parameters mass M  L x  i.e the number of pixels in L x that actually have feature x  centroid C  L x  i.e the centroid of the pixels in L x  variance 033 2  L x  i.e the variance of the Cartesian distance from pixels in L x to the centroid and shape parameters for the locale etc A tile is a square area in an image Its size is arbitrarily chosen as 16 002 16  but could be bigger or smaller The tile is the building-unit for envelopes A tile is red if a suf\002cient number of pixels within the tile are red It follows that a tile can be both red and blue if some of its pixels are red and some are blue While a pixel is the unit for image segmentation a tile is the unit for feature localization Thus feature localization is a kind of rough segmentation where overlap is possible and completeness is not necessary The right columns of Figure 1 show an example of feature localization each image illustrates a different locale for the same image We also de\002ne minimum bounding circles around locales for topological relationship approximation In this study we investigate ef\002cient methods for mining associations in image databases after image segmentation by feature localization 2.2 Multimedia associations with recurrent items Association rule mining has been studied extensively in data mining research community recently 1 6 11 8 10 Many algorithms and approaches have been proposed for mining many types of association rules in large databases However typically the databases relied upon are alphanumerical and often transaction-based While some of the algorithms proposed can be applied to visual data to a certain extent after transforming the data into a form that can be processed new algorithms should be better suited Indeed visual data has some peculiarities proper to images For example some visual features can occur multiple times in an image and the repetition of the feature may carry more information than the existence of the feature itself Previous de\002nitions and usage of association rules have limitations vis-\036 a-vis mining association rules from an image and video collection An image for instance can indeed be modelled by a transaction with items being the visual features in the image and image ID being the transaction ID However items in the antecedent of the rule repeating in the consequent can be an interesting factor in image analysis applications Moreover recurrent objects in images are very common and important as argued above In addition one may be interested in 002nding associations with a coarse-to-\002ne search strategy In other words association rules can 002rst be found at a low resolution then progressively con\002rmed at higher resolutions Thus we can rapidly approximate multimedia association rules at a coarse level then eliminate false positives by verifying them at a higher resolution Moreover the approximation of a locale by a minimum bounding circle can speed up the discovery of association rules at a high conceptual level for spatial topological concepts such as closeness overlap or containment The precision of the rules discovered are improved by eliminating the minimum bounding circle and using the locale envelope with higher image resolutions The main advantages of this approach is that 1 the extraction of locale features can be conducted at multiple often reduced resolutions to save processing time 2 locale intrinsic features can be de\002ned at appropriate resolutions to avoid too much detail/noise or insuf\002cient detail Dominant colours are well preserved at a low resolution but some texture information can be lost when the resolution is too low The coarse-to\002ne search strategy is important for large image and video databases even when the features are extracted and analyzed at pre-processing time The previous studies of association mining assume that the items are unique in I  hence the de\002nition of support  For example with the well-known Apriori algorithm 1 duplicates are n e v er cons idered when the k item candidate sets C k are formed In multimedia mining we would like to mine rules such as 223 2 bl ue cir cl es  hig h textur e density 224 This means that the sole existence of blue does not necessarily imply the consequent That is two occurrences have to co-exist in the image for the rule to be valid In addition the de\002nition of strong rules based on large support is quite inadequate in some imaging applications Features appearing very frequently i.e having a large support in some medical images for example can be normal phenomenon and uninteresting to users A low 


support on the other hand could generate item-sets with extremely rare items While these rare items could either be just meaningless noise or sought for rare phenomenon in medicine applications for example they fall in the realm of outlier analysis and are out of the scope of this study We believe that a range for an acceptable support should be introduced for such applications Hence the de\002nition of the suf\002ciently strong association rule Def 2.3 The above discussion leads to the introduction of two notions of support  Traditionally the support is the percentage of transactions that contain an item or verify a condition It measures how interesting and frequent an item or predicate is in a data set In our model images are represented by transactions but identical objects can repeat in an image therefore the second notion of support re\003ects a count of objects rather than a count of transactions or images It is the user's choice to select an appropriate de\002nition of support depending upon the application This new notion of support is called object-based support  which is distinguished from the 223traditional\224 transaction-based support  Also an association rule that allows items to repeat in the rule is called association rule with recurrent items  De\002nition 2.1 A multimedia association rule with recurrent items is a rule that associates visual object features in images and video frames and is of the form 013P 1  014P 2    015P n  016Q 1  025Q 2    026Q m  c  where c  is the con\002dence of the rule one or more predicates P i i 2 1 n  and Q j j 2 1 m  are predicates instantiated to topological visual kinematics or other descriptors of images and 013 014  015  016 025 and 026 are integers quantifying the occurrence of the object feature or item 013P is true if and only if P has 013 occurrences 2 The predicates P i and Q j in the rules are not just topological visual or kinematics descriptors but can also be other descriptors such as picture size video duration or just related keywords In a medical imaging system for example the physician's diagnosis attached to the image can be extremely bene\002cial in an association rule De\002nition 2.2 The support of a predicate P in a set of images D denoted by 033  P D  is the percentage of objects in all images in D that verify P at a given conceptual level The con\002dence of a multimedia association rule P  Q is the ratio 033  P  Q D  versus 033  P D   which is the probability that Q is veri\002ed by objects in images in D that verify P at the same conceptual level Such support is called object-based support in contrast to transactionbased support  2 De\002nition 2.3 A pattern p is suf\002ciently frequent in a set D at a level  if the support of p is no less than its corresponding minimum support threshold 033 0  and no more than its corresponding maximum support threshold 006 0  2 De\002nition 2.4 A multimedia association rule P  Q in a set of images D is suf\002ciently strong in D if P and Q are suf\002ciently frequent  P and Q 2  033 0  006 0   and the con\002dence of P  Q is greater than  0  2 Note that the strength of a rule and the values of 033 0 and 006 0 depend upon the concept level in which the predicates are applied All attributes such as colour texture motion direction etc are de\002ned on concept hierarchies Depending on the concept level selected by the user and the resolution level of the images 033 0 and 006 0 can be higher or lower Given an image I as a transaction and locales L i or objects as the items in the image I  we envision two types of multimedia association rules association rules based only on atomic visual features that we call content-based multimedia association rules with recurrent visual descriptors  and association rules with spatial relationships that we call multimedia association rules with recurrent spatial relationships  What we call atomic features are descriptors such as colour texture etc They are attributes of an object de\002ned along concept hierarchies Association rules based on atomic visual features are similar to multi-dimensional multi-level association rules emphasizing the presence of values of some attributes at given concept levels The second type of multimedia association rules uses the topological relationships between locales  v-next-to for vertical closeness h-next-to for horizontal closeness overlap and include Each predicate P describes the relationship between two objects O a and O b suchas Overlap O a O b   each object being multi-dimensional Binary predicates involve a join of more than one relation Moreover spatial predicates on the same object values can be recurrent 3 Frequent item-sets with recurrent items Mining a large collection of multimedia artifacts can be very costly The idea of progressive resolution re\002nement presented in Section 4.1 is to mine the artifacts at different resolution levels and reduce the search space at each level The knowledge extraction at each resolution level is similar but the result at each resolution level is used to 002lter out unnecessary features and images to reduce the data collection for the next levels We will discuss in the following subsection the algorithm for enumerating suf\002ciently frequent item-sets with recurrent items at a given resolution level 3.1 A na 250 021ve approach To illustrate our algorithms and test their performance we have generated synthetic images with random locales and random features Tables 1 and 2 are 002lled with the visual feature descriptors of the images and with the spatial relationships between objects in the images

Relationships If the Apriori algorithm  is to b e u s ed to d i scover frequent item-sets in such data sets as the image collections it would miss all item-sets with recurrent items A na\250 021ve way to 002nd all frequent item-sets with recurrent items would be to 002rst 002nd all frequent 1-item-sets check how often they might re-occur in an image maximum occurrence and then for each k-item-set combine these frequent 1-itemsets in sets of k elements where elements can be repeated up to their respective maximum occurrence possible The calculation of the support would 002lter out the infrequent ones This na\250 021ve algorithm which guarantees to 002nd all frequent item-sets with recurrent items could be improved by replacing F 1 as the starting set for enumerating candidates of all k item-sets by a set composed of F 1 and all item-sets with single items twinned to their maximum capacity such as f x 013 g  f x 013 x 013 g  f x 013 x 013 x 013 g  etc where the number of x 013 is smaller or equal to M  x 013   In the next sub-section we present our algorithm MaxOccur  a more ef\002cient algorithm for discovering multimedia association rules with recurrent items 3.2 MaxOccur algorithm A method for enumerating suf\002ciently strong multimedia association rules that are based on recurrent atomic visual features is presented in this section We will give an abstract example and then present the algorithm To simplify our discussion we will use a one-dimension onelevel problem where images are transactions of objects and the same objects can repeat While objects are multidimensional in this discussion we will treat them as items with only one dimension and no concept hierarchy The algorithm can be extrapolated to the multi-level association rules discovery algorithm and the multi-dimensional issue can also be solved by using a data cube Example 3.1 Let us consider the images represented in Table 3\(top by a set of transactions D 1  Each image is a set of objects that can repeat At this point we ignore the descriptors of the objects for simplicity To determine the support of each object a 002rst scan of the database is done and each time a distinct object appears its counter is incremented At the same time a second counter keeps track of the maximum appearances of the same object in an image Table 3\(bottom shows the result of the counting C 1 contains all unique objects with their support and M contains the maximum number of times a given object occurs in an image For simplicity the support is expressed in an absolute value Let the minimum support 033 0 be 2 and the maximum support 006 0 be 5 Frequent k item-sets can be found using 033 0 by 002ltering the non-frequent k-1 item-sets However pruning with 006 0 to 002nd suf\002ciently frequent iten-sets should be left to the end of the process since too frequent k-1 item-sets may endup frequent enough at k level Table 4\(top shows F 1 the list of frequent 1 item-sets Notice that O 2 and O 4 were not eliminated even if they appear too often in the data set  033  O 2  D 1   006 0 and 033  O 4  D 1   006 0  Given F 1  we can 002lter out from D 1 all irrelevant objects and all transactions that do not contain frequent objects present in F 1 Table 4\(bottom shows D 2  the image transactions with only the interesting objects The generation of the candidate 2 itemsets is done by joining F 1 with itself to create all possible pairs with frequent objects It is similar to the apriori-gen in 1 e xcept t hat t he information s tored i n M  regarding replication of objects in images is used to generate new pairs of the same objects that occur in a transaction more than once The 2 item-sets f O 2 O 2 g and f O 4 O 4 g in Table 5\(left are produced that way The candidate 3 item-set list C 3 is produced by joining F 2 elements and eliminating 3 item-sets that contain 2 item-sets not recognized as frequent i.e not in F 2  The counters in M are also used to generate itemsets such as f O 2 O 2 O 2 g in Table 6\(left After 002ltering the infrequent 3 item-sets F 3 is produced The candidate 4 item-sets is produced the same way by joining the frequent 3-item sets and pruning the unnecessary ones For instance f O 2 O 2 O 3 O 4 g and f O 2 O 3 O 4 O 4 g are eliminated since respectively f O 2 O 2 O 3 g and f O 3 O 4 O 4 g are not in F 3  Finally since no 5 item-set can be induced the result is all F i without their item-sets that have a support higher than the maximum support 006 0 Giventhesuf\002ciently frequent item-sets suf\002ciently strong association rules could be found by generating all rules from a k-itemset of the form 223\(k-p item-set  p item-set\224 with 0  k  p and such that the con\002dence of the rule is higher than a given con\002dence threshold With a con\002dence threshold set to 100  only these rules are induced 1 f O 4 O 4 g  f O 2 O 2 g 100 2 f O 2 O 4 O 4 g  f O 2 g 100 3 f O 3 O 4 g  f O 2 g 100 4 f O 3 g  f O 2 O 4 g 100 5 f

A simple scan of these rules can count replicated objects and produce the following rules 2 O 4  2 O 2 100  O 2  2 O 4  O 2 100  O 3  O 4  O 2 100  O 3  O 2  O 4 100  2 O 2  O 4 100  2 O 4  O 2 100  O 3  O 2 100  and O 3  O 4 100  Notice that the rule 223 O 4  O 2 224 is not con\002dent enough while 2232 O 4  2 O 2 224or\2232 O 4  O 2 224 are 100 reliable This would not have been true had the support been based on the number of images rather than on the number of objects Image ID Objects I 1 f O 2 O 2 O 2 O 4 O 5 g I 2 f O 2 O 2 O 4 O 4 g I 3 f O 2 O 3 O 4 g I 4 f O 6 O 7 g I 5 f O 1 O 2 O 2 O 3 O 4 O 4 g Object Support Max Occurrence f O 1 g 1 1 f O 2 g 8 3 f O 3 g 2 1 f O 4 g 6 2 f O 5 g 1 1 f O 6 g 1 1 f O 7 g 1 1 Table 3 Top Image transaction table D 1 Bot\255 tom C 1 and M tables Object Support Max Occurrence f O 2 g 8 3 f O 3 g 2 1 f O 4 g 6 2 Image ID Suf\002ciently Frequent Objects I 1 f O 2 O 2 O 2 O 4 g I 2 f O 2 O 2 O 4 O 4 g I 3 f O 2 O 3 O 4 g I 4 f O 2 O 2 O 3 O 4 O 4 g Table 4 Top F 1 and M tables Bottom Fil\255 tered image transaction table D 2  2 item-sets Support f O 2 O 3 g 2 f O 2 O 4 g 6 f O 3 O 4 g 2 f O 2 O 2 g 3 f O 4 O 4 g 2 2 item-sets Support f O 2 O 3 g 2 f O 2 O 4 g 6 f O 3 O 4 g 2 f O 2 O 2 g 3 f O 4 O 4 g 2 Table 5 Candidate 2 item\255sets C 2 and suf\002\255 ciently frequent 2 item\255sets F 2  The above example and discussion proceed to the following algorithm for mining content-based multimedia association rules Note that the supports used in the example are absolute values for the sake of simplicity Support for a k-item-set should be Coun tk 000 item 000 set in D k P 8 transaction t  j t j k  where  j t j k  are 3 item-sets Support f O 2 O 3 O 4 g 2 f O 2 O 2 O 3 g 1 f O 2 O 2 O 4 g 3 f O 2 O 4 O 4 g 2 f O 3 O 4 O 4 g 1 f O 2 O 2 O 2 g 1 3 item-sets Support f O 2 O 3 O 4 g 2 f O 2 O 2 O 4 g 3 f O 2 O 4 O 4 g 2 Table 6 Candidate 3 item\255sets C 3 and suf\002\255 ciently frequent 3 item\255sets F 3  4 item-sets Support f O 2 O 2 O 4 O 4 g 2 4 item-sets Support f O 2 O 2 O 4 O 4 g 2 Table 7 Candidate 4 item\255sets C 4 and suf\002\255 ciently frequent 4 item\255sets F 4  k-combinations of objects in transaction t without redundancy of unique objects Algorithm 3.1  MaxOccur  Find suf\002ciently frequent item-sets for enumerating content-based multimedia association rules in image collections Input i D 1 a set of transactions representing images with items being the visual and non-visual descriptors of the images ii a set of concept hierarchies for each attribute iii the minimum and maximum support thresholds 033 0 and 006 0 for each conceptual level Output Suf\002ciently frequent item-sets with repetitions Method The pseudo-code for generating suf\002ciently frequent item-sets is as follows begin 1 C 1 f Candidate 1 item-sets and their suppor t g 2 F 1 f S uf f iciently f r eq uent 1 item-sets and their suppor t g 3 M f M aximum occur r ence in an image of f r eq uent 1 item-sets g 4 Count  of k-item-sets total 1 k  5 for  i  2 F i 000 1 6    i  i 1 do f 6 C i   F i 000 1  F i 000 1   f y 010 X j X 2 F i 000 1  y 2 F 1  Count  y X    M  y  000 1 g 7 C i  C i 000f c j  i 000 1 item-set of c 2 F i 000 1 g 8 D i  FilterTable  D i 000 1 F i 000 1  9 foreach image I in D i do f 10 foreach c in C i do f 11 c:suppor t  c:suppor t  Count  c I  12 g 13 g 14 F i f c 2 C i j c:suppor t total i itemset 033 0g 15 g 16 Result  S i f c 2 F i j i 1  c:suppor t  006 0g end Line 1 2 3 and 4 are done in the same initial scan M contains the maximum number of times an object appears in the same image This counter is used later to generate potential k-item-sets The total number of k-item-sets is used for the calculation of the item-set support in line 14 In line 6 and 7 the candidate item-sets are generated by joining i-1 frequent item-sets and the use of M to generate repetitive objects  M  y   1  The pruning process 


line 7 eliminates infrequent item-sets based on the apriori property Line 8 002lters the transactions in D to minimize the data set scanning time In line 14 only the frequent item-sets that are higher than the minimum support 033 0 are kept It is only at the end of the loop line 16 that maximum support 006 0 is used to eliminate item-sets that appear too frequently The calculation of the support for one item-set is based on the occurrence of the item-set in the images Line 11 cumulates this count A particular precaution has to be taken when counting appearances of k-item-set in an image especially that objects and features can be repeated A simple k-permutation  C k n  n  n  n 000 k  where n  j t j  can lead to miscalculations The correct calculation of the repetitions of these item-sets in the transaction requires caution in order not to calculate occurrences more than necessary 13  4 Mining multimedia association rules with spatial relationships While the previously presented content-based multimedia association rules exclusively use visual atomic features such as in Table 1 multimedia association rules with spatial relationships in addition use the extended relation with spatial predicates such as in Table 2 A method for mining multimedia association rules with spatial relationships is introduced in this section The method uses MaxOccur after minimizing predicates Since spatial predicates nextto overlap etc have two arguments the strategy is to 002nd frequent one and two-item-sets combine the spatial predicates with only these frequent item-sets and consider the result as the candidate 1-item-sets of the multimedia association rules with spatial relationship MaxOccur is then used to 002nd the k-item-sets of frequent spatial predicates This strategy is based on the following property for a spatial predicate P  X Y  to be suf\002ciently frequent X and Y have to be suf\002ciently frequent and the 2-item-set f X Y g has to be suf\002ciently frequent  This can be done at any conceptual level starting from the highest concept in the hierarchy to the lowest ones The na\250 021ve method would be to combine all pairs of object attributes at a given conceptual level and join them with all spatial predicates to derive potential 1-item-sets This however would generate a very large number of candidates and even candidates that do not exist in the data set Our modus operandi is to lessen the candidate set to the minimum before computing the frequent spatial predicate k-item-sets To simplify the discussion we will analyze an abstract example with one conceptual level and one dimension shape as follows Example 4.1 Considering the three images in Figure 2 with one dimensional objects we would like to 002nd association rules involving the spatial relationships between the objects in the images For simplicity we are only considering the dimension shape at a given conceptual level but the same can be applied for other dimensions such as colour texture etc with related concept hierarchies Finding suf\002ciently strong association rules with spatial relationships essentially consists of 002nding the suf\002ciently frequent conjunctions of spatial predicates To do so given the transaction-based minimum support threshold 033 0 3 a 002rst scan of the image set reveals only three frequent items 015  4 and  each occurring in the three images and appearing at maximum twice in an image Considering only these three frequent items a second scan of the data set reveals the frequent pairs of items The 002rst table in Tables 8 indicates the support of each of these pairs Only three of them are frequent enough and are coupled with the spatial predicates Notice that if we added a wildcard 003 to the frequent items with a de facto support equal to 033 0  we could combine it with the frequent pairs of items and thus generate association rules with wildcard attributes Since we only have four spatial predicates H-next-to Vnext-to overlap and include this gives us up to 12 possibilities However a scan of the data set would reveal that only 7 combinations are possible and at the same time would also compute their support and maximum occurrence in an image The second table in Tables 8 shows the result of this scan which is the set of frequent 1-item-set found in the 002rst step of the MaxOccur MaxOccur can then be used to discover the following frequent k-itemsets Overlap 015  4  H-Next-to 015  4  Overlap 015  4  H-Next-to 015   H-Next-to 015  4  H-Next-to 015   Overlap 015  4  H-Next-to 015  4  H-Next-to 015   and all

3 to line 16 of MaxOccur end In the process of discovering multimedia association rules with recurrent spatial relationships we have assumed the existence of enumerated spatial relationships such as in Table 2 These relationships are simply processed by comparing the centroid of each locale as well as the radius of the locale's shape approximated to a circle minimum bounding circle The centroids and the radii of locales are suf\002cient to rapidly and ef\002ciently give a good approximation of spatial relationships between objects in an image such as closeness overlap and inclusion There exist other methods for determining more precise spatial relationships However these methods to be effective can be computationally costly The coarse-to-\002ne strategy of the PRR algorithm simpli\002es the process by de facto eliminating in each round the images and objects not leading to interesting rules Ideally we would preprocess once the detailed spatial relationships at a 002ne granularity and lower granularity and have a table such as Table 2 provided to the mining module If this computation is not preprocessed before the discovery of association rules another step could be added to the loop of PRR Algorithm 4.2 to determine rough spatial relationships at the current resolution level and discover association rules with these approximate spatial relationships then the next rounds would re\002ne the spatial relationships for only the frequent item-sets discovered Notice that removing the minimum bounding circles at any resolution level like in Figure 3 assists in removing false positives from enumerated frequent spatial relationships 4.1 A progressive re\002nement methodology For effective and ef\002cient discovery of patterns in multimedia databases we chose a multi-resolution strategy by 002rst 002nding patterns at a low i.e rough resolution and persevering the search at a higher i.e 002ner resolution with only the data selected in lower resolutions This assumes the preservation of the patterns to be discovered in coarse resolutions The basic idea of progressive re\002nement is to quickly approximate patterns at a coarse level then eliminate false positives by verifying them at a higher resolution The re\002nement however has to be done carefully without inadvertently eliminating false negatives For instance by knowing how visual features are preserved in coarse resolutions some visual features can be tested at low resolution such as colours others like edge density could be tested at an intermediate level while 002ne texture should only be tested at a high resolution Spatial relationships are not completely preserved The topological characteristics are not fully retained making the topological features change from one resolution level to the other We discuss later the preservation and the potential changes of topological features when the image resolution is altered or improved The re\002nement of the image resolution can be done in many ways We distinguish three different re\002nements i a cleansing at the pixel level raster re\002nement The pixel based is the traditional de\002nition of resolution for images as in the left column of Figure 1 This re\002nement has many resolution levels ii an approximation with minimum bounding circles This re\002nement has only two resolution levels one that approximates locales to their minimum bounding circles and one that excludes the minimum bounding circles and iii a zooming by changing the size of local tiles tile shrinking This re\002nement has 002ve or more levels with tile sizes 32 002 32  16 002 16  8 002 8  4 002 4  and 2 002 2  The following is the general algorithm of the progressive resolution re\002nement for multimedia data mining Algorithm 4.2  PRR

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
