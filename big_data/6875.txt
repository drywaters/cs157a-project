study and research of KDD points out the shortcoming of classical Apriori's algorithm Our research has put forward the AprioriNEW algorithm based on reducing database and analyses and appraises to this algorithm in progress This algorithm has been applied to mine the Trap's information in the network management Keywords Data mining; Association rule Network; Frequent itemset Transaction database 0 In-efficient utilization of data mining result in each cycle These lead to a serious decrease to the algorithm efficiency Many optimized methods of Apriori's algorithm have 
been put forward recently, most of the algorithms are based on memory optimization this is the limitation of the algorithm. This paper puts forward an improved algorithm on the basis of the database reducing It can reduce the searching space and composing branch It can also improve the efficiency of mining 1 Introduction 2 Basic concept and theory With the fast growing of network technology, especially the techniques in Internet fields, the network infer-structure becomes more and more complicated this leads to an urgent demand of efficient management solution to network Many study and research have been carried out in network  management field recent years 
i.e Neural Networks Artificial Intelligence of which Expert System has been testified as an efficient solution The Knowledge acquisition is the key problem in Expert System. We need a method that can mine knowledge from the Trap's information automatically and effectively KDD Knowledge Discovery in Database in network management is new technology, various methods, theories and tools have been put forward in the data processing fields For example classification clustering sequence pattern mining and association rule etc of which association rule is a very important and active mining method The association rule firstly puts forward by R.Agrawal in 1993"I It was used 
to mine association rule in the customer business transaction database and to discover relationship between the different items The nucleus of R.Agrawal's method is Apriori's algorithm It can find out frequent item set in the power sets on the principle of statistics This algorithm can be divided into two parts first Apriori's algorithm search frequent item sets in database, and then it creates association rules from those frequent item sets The major shortcomings of this algorithm are 0 power sets of items generation is needed cycling search of database occurred In the data mining the database can be transaction databases or relational databases. Relational databases can 
work as transaction databases by using the predicate logic The mining method of association rule in the transaction databases is suitable for relational databases. Here are some narration and definitions of conceptions I which will be used in this article later Definition 1 Let I={il ,i  im  be a set of items, then D c Tid, TA T c I is a transaction database, where Tid is an identifier which be associated with each transaction Definition 2 Let X E I Y 
C_ I and X n Y 4 we called X 3 Y as association rule Definition 3 Suppose c is the percentage of transactions in D containing A that also contain B then the rule XJY has confidence c in D Ifs is percentage of transactions in D that contain A U B then the rule X j Y has support s in D Definition 4 Hypothesis X E I minsup is the smallest support If the frequency of X is greater than 
or equal to minsup then X is called as frequent itemset, otherwise X is called non-frequent itemset Our purpose is searching for association rules with the smallest support degree and the smallest confidence degree The classical algorithms can mine those rules by scanning D repeatedly. Its efficiency is very low if the D is a huge database. Analyzing the process of mining rules we find out many properties of transactions and many transactions which can be deleted from D Those properties, included property 13 of Apriori, can be described as below 0-7803-7508-4/02/$17.00 02002 IEEE 91 5 


Proceedings of the First International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Beijing 4-5 November 2002 Theorem 1 Supposed X c T,Y frequent itemset then X must be a frequent itemset. That is VX VY Y E TA X  Xmunt 2 mincount Where X.count and Y.count stands for X's count and Y's count in the database and mincount is the minimum support degree count Proof Let T tl  t   e tn be records of D According to the definition of the minimum support degree we get the formulation mincount=minsup*IDI Since Y is a frequent itemset there are at least mincount records included Y Since X E Y there are at least mincount records included X from the transitivity of the inclusive relationship.So  X.counter2mincount Theorem 2 Given XET Y cT and XEY If X is a non-frequent itemset then Y muse be a non-frequent itemset. That is VX VY Y c TAX c Y A X.count e min count  Y.count  min count Proof This theorem can be proved using disproof. Suppose Y is a frequent itemset that is Y.count 3 mincount Because of X Y X must be a frequent itemset by theorem 1, that is X.count2mincount This is contradictory with X.count  mincount Therefore if X were a non frequent itemset, Y must be non-frequent itemsets Theorem 3 Suppose we have got Lk and Lk is a set of k itemset If T C I and ITI=k then we can delete T from database Proof The conclusion can be founded obviously. Because the transactions in which the cardinal number is smaller than or equal to k  do not include in c i>k the transaction T is not used for data mining when i is greater than k Therefore, we can delete T from database Theorem 4 Suppose X c T Y C T X E Y and IYI=IXI+l If X is a non-frequent itemset Y is also a non-frequent itemset and can be delete from database Proof The proof can be divided into two steps First, Let's prove Y is a non-frequent itemset. Because X is a non-frequent itemset and XCY Y must be a non frequent itemset by theorem 2 Next proves that Y does not have any unknown frequent itemsets Suppose X til t    t,k  and IXI=k We can get Y=XU trm}, where t any set IYI=k+l The k itemsets of Y are T and X C Y If Y is a Y A Y.count 2 mincount That is,X must be a frequent set bll t,2    tlk 1 t,l tr2   t,k  t X kl 42 9    9 qk-2 tlk 7 t x   9 b12 9 t13 1    9 l1k 9 tIrn 1 Because frequency of Y's subsets has been known in mining Lk  Y does not have any unknown subsets Therefor we can delete itemset Y and its subsets from database Theorem 5  Let X C T and Y C T where IYI=2 and IXI 32 If X and Y are non-frequent XUY and its subsets can be deleted form database Proof  X and Y are non-frequent itemsets  X U Y is a non-frequent itemsets by theorem 2 Let X={tml,tm2,..-,tmk and Y={tnl,tn2},where IXI=k\(k 32 We can get xu Y={tm1 tm2 t t,l tn2 Where IX U YI=k+2 The k+l-itemsets of X U Y are tml 7 tm 9 9tmk 9 tn1}9 tml 9 tm2 9 tml tm td-1 t tu t,l t  tmk-2 9 t 9 t  t 1 9 tmk 9 tn2 tm19 tm2 9'.'9 d-3 9 t&-l 9 tmk 9 tnl 9 tn2},.'*9 itm2 9 tm3 9 9 tmk 9 tnl 9 tn2 1 Because those itemsets are supersets of X or Y According to theorem 2 they are non-frequent itemsets their k-itemsets are known after X has been mined Therefore X U Y and its subsets can delete from database For example suppose a,b,c and d,e are a non frequent itemsets We can get that la,b,c,d,e is a non frequent itemset and can erase a,b,c,d,e a,b,c,dJ,Ia,b,c,e and b,c,d,eJ from database Theorem 6 Suppose XGT Y GT X and Y are non frequent itemsets If all subsets of X \(or Y are non-frequent itemsets we can delete X U Y and its subsets from database Proof  X is a non-frequent itemset  X U Y is also a non-frequent itemset Let VW W C X VZ Z E Y All subsets of XU Y belong to one of following circumstances W U Y Z U X or W U Z Because X Y W and Z are non-frequent itemsets we can get that all subsets of X U Y are non frequent itemsets according to theorem 2 Therefore, they can be deleted from database When we want to delete records from database by this theorem we always judge a element of tree which root is X U Y and high is min{lXl,lYl For example suppose a,b,c,d  e,f,g} and all subsets of e,f,g} are non-frequent itemsets We can get that following subsets are non frequent itemsets a,b,c,d,e,f,gJ a,b,c,d,e,f Because subsets frequency of which the cardinal numbers is equal to 4 is known after a,b,c,d} has been mined it has no influence on the data mining when we f,g b,c,d,e,f,g 91 6 


Proceedings of the First International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Beijing 4-5 November 2002 delete them form database So we can delete  a,b,c,d,e,f,g and its subsets from database Theorems above are the foundation of the new algorithm Taking into consideration of the complicated nature of construction algorithm we implement above theorems exclusive of theorems 6 in this article 3 The algorithm of mining association rules Because Apriori algorithm Scan database repeatedly, its efficiency is very low In recent years some optimization algorithms have been put forward by some scholar For example, Savaseres etc 14 has designed the algorithm based on Divides, Parks etc I has put forward to the algorithm of the Hash, Toivonen etc I has designed the algorithm based on Sampling This article put forward a algorithm by reducing redundancy records of database The reducing norms are based on the theorem 3 theorem 4 and theorem 5,here is a list of the norms Norm 1 The k-itemsets can be deleted from database after Lk has been mined Norm 2 The \(k+l which it include non-frequcnt k-itensets can be deleted from database after Lk has been mined Norm 3 The k+2 which include a non-frequcnt k-itenset and a non-frequcnt 2-itenset can be deleted from database after Lk has been mined According to above norms we design a algorithm which is similar to algorithm designed by R.Agrawa1 etc This algorithm can be divided into two parts 0 Find all frequent itemsets 0 Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets Because second part is simpler then first one we only give the AprioriNEWs algorithm to find all frequent itemsets The AprioriNEWs algorithm is listed as below Algorithm AprioriNEW Input DB minsup Output Result Result  k:=l ck  large 1-itemsets While Ck  do Begin Created a counter for all itemsets for \(i 1 k=IDB I;i begin if I Ti I=k-1 2 can be deleted from database f\(x C Sk-1 2 C DB,I 2 I=k+l q.-X c S2 can be deleted if c DB,X C Sk I 2 I-IXI=O q can be deleted if Ti DB q c ck  Ti counter end Lk tk ck and t.counter>minsup sk tit\200 ck and t.counteruninsup If k==2 s2  sk  The support degree of Lk has no change Result  Result U Lk k=k 1  End Where ck is candidate itemsets 2 is i-th record of database S is non-frequent k-itemsets S2 is non-frequent 2-itemsets 4 The algorithm performance analysis and evaluation Algorithm AprioriNEW can find all frequent itemsets and reduce database with non-frequent itemsets.

We can observe that for different transactions, there is a slight change in the time If we change the minimum support dynamically then we observe a below time than the total time/2 which is shown in table 6 So we can prove that in dynamic minimum support we can achieve higher computation in less time  VII. CONCLUSION  In this paper we proposed an algorithm for data mining in which we proposed a dynamic minimum support concept with subset and superset approach. Our approach provides a greater computation in a less time For this we provide several computation results based on tables. We also show some result analysis in a comparative way, which shows that our approach is better and efficient  REFERENCES  1  A g r a w a l   R    S r i k a n t   R    F a st  A l g o r i t h ms f o r  M i n i n g  A sso c i a t i o n  R u l e s Proceedings of the 20th VLDB Conference Santiago, Chile \(1994  2  H a n   J  P e i   J    Y i n   Y    M i n i n g  F r e q u e n t  P a t t e r n s w i t h o u t  C a n d i d a t e  Generation.

Inserting the term NYTMetro triggers a checkpoint as seen from Line 10 before errors are introduced in the targeted topk result The resulting summaries are shown in Figure 7 003 4 Compaction of Inactive Summaries Summaries can become inactive for two reasons i due to a checkpoint as just described and ii because their time interval ceases to overlap with the current time so that no updates will apply to them As described in the following section only the targeted topk counters are considered during query processing As part of the archiving of inactive summaries we thus remove the counters c j with j  targeted k  This releases memory that is no longer needed In the setting of Example 3 the two last grey counters of the left summary in Figure 7 are removed from the summary before archiving 5 Relaxed Decrement The number of updates that apply to a cell may vary across time The Aggressive Increment procedure effectively handles the case of increasing activity However activity may also decrease causing already allocated counters become unnecessary and resulting in poor memory utilization There is thus a need to be able decrement the number of counters in a summary Care must be taken when decreasing the number of counters since an overly aggressive decrease may lead to more checkpoints  When performing checkpoint too frequently query performance is reduced because more merging of summaries is needed The Relaxed Decrement procedure described in Algorithm 5 is designed to reduce the number of counters in a summary without causing excessive checkpoints  The procedure is invoked after any given time granule has passed As shown in Lines 4\2265 the number of counters is halved if the summary's number of error-free counters is at least double targeted k  Then the summary maintains many more errorfree counters than required Note that if any checkpoint was created during the previous time granule this means that the number of counters has been increasing Therefore the activity level may be expected to remain at the same level or continue to increase Consequently no reduction is performed  Algorithm 5 Summary RelaxedDecrement\(int cp Summary

6 return s   C Query Processing 1 Overview The spatio-temporal range of a query generally covers a number of cells We cover a query region and interval with the fewest possible cells from the multigranularity structure and use the summaries of these cells to produce the query result Speci\002cally any query region can be covered by a unique set of most coarse cells Starting from the coarsest granularity it is checked if each cell is contained in the query region We re\002ne a cell that merely intersects the query range by the cells it covers at the next 002ner granularity until the cells considered are contained in the query region If a query region partially overlaps other cells we 223snap\224 the boundary of the query region to the nearest inclusive border Next as shown in Figure 6 we proceed to 002nd the summaries that overlap with the query time interval This results in a number of summaries that are to be 223merged\224 to produce the query result The summaries of the cells needed to cover the query range are used to produce the result This calls for a technique to merge such summaries into a query result in Line 5 in Algorithm 3 Also if a query region and interval are identical to those of an existing cell the same merging procedure applies to possibly several archived summaries associated with that cell 2 Merging Dynamic Summaries Recall that each summary maintains counters for only the most frequent terms seen in that summary Thus different summaries maintain counters for different sets of terms Figure 5 illustrates how a wrong result can be produced when merging summaries The problem occurs when terms that do not occur in all summaries make it into the merged summary However we can still provide guarantees about the merged summaries Recall that targeted k counters of each summary are without any errors For each summary we maintain targeted k 1 counters to provide guarantees about the merged summary Thus before running Algorithm 4 the value of targeted k is incremented with one more counter Algorithm 6 details the merging procedure for dynamic summaries We can guarantee that a merged summary is correct if no other term can possibly make it into the summary To do this we utilize the extra counter maintained for each summary\227 see Line 4 These extra counters provide information about the best possible counts of terms outside the top targeted k terms The best case for the remaining terms is calculated by adding up the values of these counters in each summary If the resulting value is below the lowest count for a term in the merged summary the terms are not competitive and the summary is correct\227see Line 21 In the example in Figure 8a targeted k is 3 the shading identi\002es the targeted k  1 st counter maintained by a summary and the last grey rows are not stored in the summaries but are only included for illustration In this example the merged summary is correct because no other term can have a count that places it among the top targeted k terms A count that exceeds 3 is needed to enter the merged summary and the best possible count of a term not in the merged summary is 3 We cannot always return a correct merged summary In the example in Figure 8b the merged summary fails to include the term 223Sandy\224 that has a higher count than 223York.\224 The targeted k  1 st counters maintained by the two cells tell that a term not in the merged summary e.g 223Sandy,\224 may be able to gather a score of 2 from each cell The counters guarantee that terms in the merged summary with scores no less than 2  2  4 are correct See Line 27 in the algorithm 154

For the spatial partitioning we use the Military Grid Reference System MGRS Thus w ay  we represent an y location on the surface of the Earth at multiple granularities ranging from 1 002 1 m 2 to 100 002 100 km 2  by an alphanumeric value For temporal partitioning we use the typical temporal hierarchies from data warehousing hour day week month We drop cells with very low activity speci\002cally cells where the most popular term occurs in fewer than 5 messages at the 002nest granularity hour We will shortly describe how we 002x the spatio-temporal hierarchy in AFIA based on the considered workload We perform three sets of experiments The 002rst measures the space and accuracy of the proposed algorithms and compares them with two baselines The second evaluates the throughput memory consumption and number of checkpoints when varying the targeted k parameter The third evaluates the query processing performance when varying the size of the spatio-temporal query range We also show the number of checkpoints created during a time period B Data and Queries We collected all geo-tagged messages from the public Twitter FireHose during May 2013 The dataset contains 110,426,053 tweets yielding an average rate of circa 41 tweet per second Figure 9 provides insight into the workload and helps choose an appropriate spatio-temporal hierarchy Figure 9a shows the total number of cells that receive at least one tweet Thus the graph shows the expected number of active summaries at the given granularities For example every hour the number of 0.1 002 0.1 km 2  1 002 1 km 2  10 002 10 km 2  and 100 002 100 km 2 spatial grid cells that receive at least one tweet is circa 0.5M 200K 40K and 10K respectively i.e the 223Hour\224 curve in the 002gure Figure 9b considers the cells at the 0.1 km 002 0.1 km 002 1 hour granularity The y-axis depicts the number of such cells subject to different loads the number of terms t processed This shows that the number of 223interesting\224 cells with at least 100 terms is quite low barely reaching 100 Therefore we 002x the 002nest temporal granularity at an hour Figure 9c considers the cells at the 100 km 002 100 km 002 1 week granularity The 002gure shows that thousands of such cells have summaries that receive more than 1 thousand terms We 002x k at 25 and generate 2 query sets each consisting of 100 queries Each query in the 002rst set has a temporal extent with a length chosen at random among 1 hour 1 day and 1 week and it has a randomly selected spatial region The spatial granularity of the coarsest cell that is contained in the spatial query region is the query's spatial granularity and the query region is enlarged to cover all the cells at that granularity that it intersects with In visual terms this procedure corresponds to 223snapping\224 the spatial query region to the coarser granularity The underlying rationale for adopting this procedure is that 002ner-granularity cells do not contribute with term counts at the same magnitude as do cells at the granularity of the coarsest fully covered cell Since any rectangle can be created from a number of merged squares we limit the experiments to squares Each cell contains 10 002 10 cells at the next 002ner granularity Thus the largest number of cells any query square can cover is 18 002 18  324 As a result we employ queries that may cover up to 1,800 002 1,800 km 2  While the 002rst query set focuses on variation in the spatial range the second focuses on temporal variation Each of the 100 queries has a spatial region chosen at random from one of the spatial granularities The query resulting in most temporal summary merges is the query that spans from the 002rst hour after midnight on the 002rst day in May until the hour before midnight on the last day of May This query covers 2 002 23 hours 3  5 days and 3 weeks which amounts to 57 temporal summaries To avoid empty results we do not consider regions that only cover empty cells Note that we do not perform compaction on the last active temporal granularities to better re\003ect the real-life scenario where a stream is constantly keeping these summaries active To simplify the experiments the initCounters parameter which determines the initial number of counters is set to the same value as targeted k  C Baselines We consider two baselines for comparison and validation of our proposal SS In each active spatio-temporal summary we aggregate the most frequent items using the SpaceSaving algorithm Active summaries maintain a 002xed number  m  of items and their counts while archived summaries are compacted by keeping only the counters for the k most frequent terms Choosing a value for m represents a trade-off between storage size and result accuracy HT In each active spatio-temporal summary we maintain a full list of terms using a hash table Once the summary becomes inactive and is archived its time granularity passes the list is sorted and cleaned up by discarding all but the counters for the targeted topk terms This approach maintains the exact topk items at all spatio-temporal granularities and serves to measure the accuracy of the other approaches However since HT has excessive storage requirements we do not expect it to scale under the considered workloads D The Space Versus Accuracy Trade-Off In the 002rst set of experiments we evaluate the accuracy of our approach by comparing it with the baselines Since HT maintains the exact counts at all granularities its storage requirements are too high for large scale experiments Similarly SS maintains a 002xed number m of counters at all granularities and m cannot be set too high for large scale experiments Thus we consider only tweets occurring in the spatial region with the 11S grid zone designator a region in the US of size ca 900 002 550 km 2  We use the local machine We consider variants of SS where m is set to 50 100 and 200 In AFIA we set targeted k to 50 The 002rst week four days in May is used for warm-up and only the accuracies of the subsequent summaries are evaluated We perform topk queries on all summaries at each spatio-temporal granularity We compare the topk most frequent terms in each summary produced by AFIA and SS and compare with the corresponding topk items produced by HT We set k  20  156

Fig 14 Checkpoints Over Time V C ONCLUSIONS We present a new framework for the processing of spatiotemporally constrained topk most popular terms queries on streaming spatio-temporally tagged text content such as microblog posts The framework's index extends existing techniques for counting frequent items in summaries to allow the summaries to grow and shrink dynamically to adapt to changes in the incoming data Query processing works by merging relevant summaries To provide guarantees about the query results a new merging algorithm is proposed that supports spatio-temporal query regions Experimental studies with an implementation of the framework offers insight into the accuracy scalability and performance of the processing of incoming data and queries and they demonstrate that the framework is capable of offering very accurate query results at high performance at scale A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported in part by the MADALGO research center and in part by the

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
