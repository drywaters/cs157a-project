Mining Calendar-based Asynchronous Periodical Association Rules with Fuzzy Calendar Constraints Jung-Yi Jiang Wan-Jui Lee and Shie-Jue Lee Dept of Electrical Engineering National Sun Yat-Sen University Taiwan  jungyi  wrlee  leesj  water.ee.nsysu.edu.tw Abstract  We propose a new representation of calendars such that users can specify fuzzy calendar constraints to discover asynchronous periodical association rules embedded in temporal databases We borrow the fuzzy set theory and use the 
conjunction operation to construct fuzzy calendar patterns and each fuzzy calendar pattern represents an asynchronous periodical behavior Moreover different time intervals have different weights corresponding to their matching degrees to the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern An ef\036cient algorithm is also proposed to 036nd association rules with the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern Unlike levelwise Apriori-based approaches our method scans the underlying database at most twice In the 036rst scan frequent 2-itemsets with their weighted counts in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are obtained and then all candidate itemsets are generated from the discovered frequent 2-itemsets Finally all frequent itemsets with their weighted counts in the speci\036ed 
fuzzy calendar pattern are discovered in one shot Asynchronous periodical association rules in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are then obtained I I NTRODUCTION Recently temporal association rules are attracting more and more attention Unlike traditional mining techniques which discover unordered correlations between items from a given database of transactions each of which contains a collection of items activated at a certain time the temporal patterns reveal ordered correlation between transactions For example in a temporal database a kind of periodic behavior like customers might look for chocolates and 037owers together on February 14th every year may be discovered There are 
various forms of periodic temporal patterns e.g periodical association rules c yclic association rules 5 and calendric association rules Both periodical and c yclic patterns are basically in terms of a single time granularity but calendar patterns are based on a framework with multiple time granularities In real world humans usually use multiple time granularities instead of single granularities Therefore system support and reasoning involving calendars with multiple time granularities have been recognized to be an important issue For mining association rules in temporal databases several kinds of approaches to specify periodicities with multiple time granularities have been studied In users could specify the interesting period with multiple time granularities by them 
selves In and 7 tw o dif ferent algorithms are proposed to discover all calendar-based temporal association rules in a speci\036ed calendar schema However all the approaches above are crisp descriptions about their desire periodicities To consider the activities of humans they may often be shifted from original schedules by external factors And in real world humans usually donít act on a certain time interval but during several continuous time intervals Those situations above canít be described successfully with crisp descriptions Therefore a new representation of calendars to specify uncertain periodicities and continuous time intervals of time granularities is necessary To achieve the purposes mentioned above the technique 
using fuzzy set theory is adopted which can describe the uncertainty and can give different weights corresponding to their matching degrees to different time intervals by specifying the calendars In fact an useful fuzzy calendar algebra was developed to allow users to describe desired temporal requirements in fuzzy calendars easily and naturally In this paper  we allow users to describe their desired periodicities with fuzzy calendars of multiple time granularities and combine fuzzy calendars with a conjunction operation to form a fuzzy calendar pattern then each time interval of the fuzzy calendar pattern can have a weight corresponding to its matching degree When the fuzzy calendar pattern is given association 
rules in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern can be discovered For example an association rule in a fuzzy calendar pattern is turkey and pumpkin pie are frequently purchased together near November 25th every year where near November 25th every year is a fuzzy description of periodicities We also propose an ef\036cient algorithm to discover asynchronous periodical association rules with fuzzy calendar constraints Unlike levelwise Apriori-based approaches our method scans the underlying database at most twice In the 036rst scan frequent 2-itemsets with their weighted counts in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are obtained and then all candidate itemsets are generated from the discovered frequent 2-itemsets Finally all frequent itemsets with their weighted 
counts in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are discovered in one shot Asynchronous periodical association rules in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are then obtained The rest of the paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we brie\037y describe the concept of the fuzzy calendar pattern A formal description about calendar-based asynchronous periodical association rules is also given In Section 3 we describe our method in detail Simulation results are presented in Section 4 and 036nally a conclusion is given in Section 5 0-7803-9158-6/05/$20.00 © 2005 IEEE The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 773

E Calendar-based Asynchronous Periodical Association Rules A temporal database D consists of transactions with each transaction t in D being associated with an identi\036er TID and a time information t t which indicates the time when the transaction occurred Let I  i 1 i 2 i n be a set of items and each transaction t in D is a subset of I  that is t 005 I  Given m time granularities i.e U 1 U 2 U m  let D be divided into a sequence of k partitions i.e P 1 P 2 P k  each P i containing a set of transactions occurring in the corresponding time interval T i  Given a user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern FC consisting of m basic fuzzy calendars discovering the calendar-based asynchronous periodical association rules in a temporal database is to 036nd all interesting patterns in FC in the temporal database That is we want to discover all association rules which have an enough weighted average constrained by FC  1 Association rules in time intervals An association rule with respect to a time interval T i  is an implication of the form X 006 T i Y 5 where X 005 I,Y 005 I and X 007 Y  002  Let  P i  J   be the number of transactions containing itemset J in the partition P i where each transaction occurring in T i is included in P i  and  P i  denotes the number of transactions in the partition P i  The association rule X 006 T i Y is said to have support S X 003 Y in the partition P i  where S X 003 Y   P i  X 010 Y    P i   6 and the association rule X 006 T i Y is said to have con\036dence C X 004 T i Y in the partition P i  where C X 004 T i Y   P i  X 010 Y    P i  X   or S X 003 Y S X  7 For a user-given pair of con\036dence and support thresholds c  and s  association rules in a time interval T i are those which have con\036dence and support greater than or equal to c  and s in P i  respectively 2 Calendar-based Asynchronous periodical association rules A calendar-based asynchronous periodical association rule with respect to a user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern FC  is an implication of the form X 006 FC Y 8 The match ratio m  represents the frequency of an association rule in the fuzzy calendar pattern needs to be calculated Intuitively we adopted the weighted average to calculate the match ratio However by taking crisp cycles and fuzzy cycles into the same position the measurement will lose some patterns discovered in only crisp cycles To keep general patterns in crisp cycles and discover patterns in fuzzy cycles we de\036ne two criteria to let the match ratio be more practical The 036rst criterion GM is the general match ratio as in and 7 which measures the frequency of an association rule occurring in crisp periodical time intervals And the second criterion FM is the in\037uence of fuzzy calendars which represents the frequency of an association rule occurring in the time intervals close to crisp periodical time intervals Let an association rule which is included in an user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern FC  then the general match ratio and fuzzy calendar match ratio of the association rule GM and FM  are as follows GM  002  FC  T i   e i 002  FC  T i   for each  CF  T i 1 9 FM  002  FC  T i   e i 002  FC  T i   for each 0  CF  T i   1  10 Where each time interval T i 002 U 1  U 2    U m  and e i is the existence of the association rule in T i  If the association rule exists in T i  e i 1  else e i 0  After the general match ratio and the fuzzy match ratio of the association rule are obtained the match ratio m of the association rule in the fuzzy calendar pattern is obtained as follows m  GM  003F M 11 For emphasizing and ensuring the in\037uence of the certain time intervals of crisp cycles it is necessary to keep the patterns discovered in the general crisp cycles Therefore we suggest keeping the value of the general match ratio GM  We address the fuzzy match ratio as an assistant and propose to give a weight 003  to the fuzzy match ratio FM  where 003 is a value between 0 and 1 Usually we de\036ne the threshold of a match ratio 004  between 0 and 1 To avoid the match ratio being much great than 1 we suggest 003 be assigned as 1  004   That is when the general match ratio of an association rule is equal to 004  we expect that GM  003F M 003 1  when GM  004 12 where FM is at most equal to 1 We expect that the match ratio will be equal to 1 when the fuzzy match ratio is equal to 1 Then the weight of fuzzy match ratio can be calculated as follows GM  003F M 1  003  1  GM FM  1  004 1 1  004 13 If the match ratio m of an association rule is greater then the user-given match ratio threshold 004  we say the association rule is a calendar-based asynchronous periodical association rule in the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern Refer to Example 1 Assume the match ratio threshold 004 0  6  Then the weight 003 1  0  6=0  4 and an association rule A exists in 2001 2 13 2001 2 14 2002 2 14 2002 2 15 2003 2 13 2003 2 15 2004 2,14  and 2005 2 15 The match ratio m A of A can be calculated as follows For simplicity The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 775

rules with an userspeci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern can be divided into three phases i.e discovery of all frequent 2-itemsets which satisfy the match ratio threshold in the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern generation of candidate patterns from frequent 2-itemsets discovered in phase 1 and discovery of all frequent itemsets which satisfy the match ratio threshold in the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern It must be noted that the single-item frequent itemsets are not generated for our method Suppose a fuzzy calendar pattern FC  and a match ratio threshold 004  are given by users Let L  L 2 and L k be the sets of all frequent itemsets frequent 2-itemsets and frequent k-itemsets with their general match ratios GM s  and fuzzy match ratios FMs  in the fuzzy calendar pattern Initially both L and L 2 are empty For each partition P i which has a matching degree d i  to the fuzzy calendar pattern where d i is a real number between 0 and 1 Let G be the sum of all d i  where each d i is equal to 1 and let F be the sum of all d i  where each d i is less than 1 In phase 1 for each partition P i which has a nonzero degree d i  036nd all frequent 2-itemsets l 2  in the partition To count supports of all 2-itemsets we calculate all combinations of any two items of transactions in the partition Then we consider the following cases Case1 The degree of the partition is equal to 1 For each 2-itemset l 002 l 2 if l is not currently in L 2  then itís inserted into L 2 and the general match ratio of l  l.GM  is assigned as 1 If l is currently in L 2  then the general match ratio of l  l.GM  increases by 1 Case2 The degree of the partition is less than 1 For each 2-itemset l 002 l 2 if l is not currently in L 2  then itís inserted into L 2 and the fuzzy match ratio of l  l.F M  is assigned as d i If l is currently in L 2  then the fuzzy match ratio of l  l.F M  increases by d i  When the 036rst scan over the database is done the match ratio of each 2-itemset l 002 l 2  l.m  can be calculated as follows l.m  l.GM G 1  004   l.F M F  14 Then all frequent 2-itemsets which have match ratios greater than the match ratio threshold in the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are obtained where L 2   l 011 l 002 L 2 l.m 012 004   15 Once frequent 2-itemsets have been obtained in phase 1 phase 2 begins Candidate itemsets C k  for k 012 3  are generated as follows C k  003 L 2 005L 2 k 3 C k  1 005C k  1 k  3 16 where 005 is the JOINT operation given in and the generation of candidates will stop when no candidate kitemset could be generated from  k  1 itemsets Initially for each candidate itemset c 002 C k k 012 3  the general match ratio and the fuzzy match ratio of c  c.GM and c.F M  are assigned as 0 Once all candidate itemsets are generated the second scan of the database is performed In the 036nal phase for each partition P i which has nonzero degree d i  we count the supports of candidate itemsets in the partition and for each candidate itemset c 002 C k k 012 3 we consider the following cases Case1 If the degree of the partition is equal to 1 the general match ratio of c c.GM increases by 1 Case2 If the degree of the partition is less than 1 the fuzzy match ratio of c c.F M  increases by d i  When the second scan over the database is done the match ratio of each candidate itemset c 002 C k k 012 3  c.m  can be calculated as follows c.m  c.GM G 1  004   c.F M F  17 Furthermore the itemsets whose match ratios are greater than the match ratio threshold can be obtained as follows L k   c 011 c 002 C k c.m 012 004 k 012 3   After the third phases all frequent itemsets whose match ratios are greater than the match ratio threshold in the userspeci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern can be obtained as follows L  L 2 010 L k k 012 3  19 Therefore all asynchronous periodical association rules in the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are obtained IV E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS We present the results of our algorithm with a fuzzy calendar pattern and with a general calendar pattern to show the effect of fuzzy calendar patterns We also compare the performance of our method with an Apriori-based method proposed in in this section The e xperiments described below are performed on a PC with 2.2 GHz CPU and 1.0G The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 776

the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern FC days close to 15 of every month in every year is shown in Fig 2 The technique introduced in is used to generate synthetic datasets T10.In.D1000K.Ch for n=3 4 5 6 and h  15 25 35 45 where T is the mean size of transactions I is the mean size of potential maximal large itemsets and C is the correlation between patterns We divide the dataset into 1000 partitions where each partition contains 1000 transactions and is corresponding to one basic time interval in the calendar schema In Experiment 1 we insert some target patterns into the dataset T10.I4.D1000K.C25 to design a speci\036c dataset with asynchronous periodical association rules in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern and compare the results discovered by our algorithm with a fuzzy calendar pattern and with a general calendar pattern to show that our algorithm with the fuzzy calendar pattern can discover asynchronous periodical association rules successfully In experiment 2 we compare the performances of our method and the Apriori-based method with a general calendar pattern by using both methods to discover general calendar-based periodical association rules with a speci\036c general calendar pattern in several different datasets In experiment 3 we compare the results discovered by the algorithm with the fuzzy calendar pattern and the algorithm with the general calendar pattern in several synthetic datasets to show the effect of the fuzzy calendar patterns in general cases A Experiment 1 To identify the effect of the fuzzy calendar pattern constraint in discovering the calendar-based asynchronous periodical association rules we insert 240 frequent itemsets as targets into partitions around the 15th day of every month in every year in the dataset T10.I4.D1000K.C25 randomly In this experiment the match ratio threshold is speci\036ed to be 0.5 0.6 0.7 and 0.8 the support threshold is speci\036ed to be 0.07 and the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern FC is days close to 15 of every month in every year as shown in Fig 2 To compare with general calendar patterns we run the same thresholds of match ratio and support with the general calendar pattern 15th of every month in every year where the membership functions of every year and every month are the same as FC and the membership function of 15th is described with a singleton whose function value is equal to 1 only when the day value is 15 In TABLE I the column total is the total number of frequent itemsets discovered with the general calendar pattern and the fuzzy calendar pattern FC and the column target is the number of target patterns discovered by the general calendar pattern and the fuzzy calendar pattern As shown in TABLE I for match ratio thresholds from 0.5 to 0.8 the number of target patterns with the general calendar pattern is zero that means the target patterns are not appeared in the crisp period enough and it is possible to get the target patterns when the match ratio threshold is smaller than 0.5 However the number of target patterns with fuzzy calendar pattern indicates that our method with fuzzy calendar patterns can discover the association rules in asynchronous periodicities successfully while the general calendar pattern canít be used to mine the asynchronous periodical association rules B Experiment 2 In Experiment 2 we use both the Apriori-based method and our method to discover general calendar-based periodical association rules with a general calendar pattern 15th of every month in every year in 16 different datasets on different scales of support thresholds to compare the performances of the Apriori-based method and our method In Fig 3 the average execution time of the Aprori-based method applying to different datasets with support thresholds 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 and 0.07 is drawn in a dotted line while our method is drawn in a solid line From the 036gure we can see that our method has better performance for smaller support thresholds For smaller support thresholds the length of maximal frequent itemsets will be longer Therefore the number of database scans in the Apriori-based method increases when the support threshold decreases but our method always scans the database at most twice As the result our method is ef\036cient in all kinds of support thresholds but the performance of the Apriori-based method varies dramatically for different cases C Experiment 3 To observe the in\037uence of the fuzzy calendar pattern in general cases we use our method with a fuzzy calendar pattern days close to 15 of every month in every year and a general calendar pattern 15th of every month in every year respectively to discover association rules in the fuzzy calendar pattern and the general calendar pattern in 16 different datasets The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 777

An example of temporal recurring groups detected data in common. A confidence and interest measure relevant to the consumer domain is used to determine the quality of the frequent itemsets, and create a  list of the top "themes" within the collection. Since a variety of metadata types are included for every media in the collection, we are able to capture a broad variety of recurring themes without a priori knowledge of the themes in a given collection. Because the system also discovers frequent patterns that the user may be unaware of, the system seems to display çintelligenté behavior by providing unexpected groupings that could not have been extracted by merely searching We also detect calendar-related recurring themes in multiyear collections. We define collections in terms of events, and represent them in an appropriate two-dimensional temporal space. We use density-based clustering followed by filtering to reduce the number of false matches in a group. Our approach detects personal special dates such as birthdays and anniversaries, seasonal activities and holidays celebrated. Since both the calendar-based groups and feature-based thematic groups detected are strictly data-driven \(with no a priori assumptions about a userês collection\ they are customized to the type of content in specific userês collections Further work in this area includes a user study to evaluate user reaction to these automatically generated narratives from their collection. Some of the user studies will focus on using the output of our method for slideshow-based reliving of a collection. We also plan to gather more collections with people and location metadata. Another direction of exploration is in improving the performance of scene, material and object classifiers by incorporating contextual information from seemingly unrelated metadata, as suggested by the frequent itemsets detected by our system. Also, further improvement of the precision of detecting recurrent themes can be obtained by incorporating the discrimination power of different features into the confidence score to avoid making groups based on generic features R EFERENCES  1  N.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
