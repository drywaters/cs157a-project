For the spatial partitioning we use the Military Grid Reference System MGRS Thus w ay  we represent an y location on the surface of the Earth at multiple granularities ranging from 1 002 1 m 2 to 100 002 100 km 2  by an alphanumeric value For temporal partitioning we use the typical temporal hierarchies from data warehousing hour day week month We drop cells with very low activity speci\002cally cells where the most popular term occurs in fewer than 5 messages at the 002nest granularity hour We will shortly describe how we 002x the spatio-temporal hierarchy in AFIA based on the considered workload We perform three sets of experiments The 002rst measures the space and accuracy of the proposed algorithms and compares them with two baselines The second evaluates the throughput memory consumption and number of checkpoints when varying the targeted k parameter The third evaluates the query processing performance when varying the size of the spatio-temporal query range We also show the number of checkpoints created during a time period B Data and Queries We collected all geo-tagged messages from the public Twitter FireHose during May 2013 The dataset contains 110,426,053 tweets yielding an average rate of circa 41 tweet per second Figure 9 provides insight into the workload and helps choose an appropriate spatio-temporal hierarchy Figure 9a shows the total number of cells that receive at least one tweet Thus the graph shows the expected number of active summaries at the given granularities For example every hour the number of 0.1 002 0.1 km 2  1 002 1 km 2  10 002 10 km 2  and 100 002 100 km 2 spatial grid cells that receive at least one tweet is circa 0.5M 200K 40K and 10K respectively i.e the 223Hour\224 curve in the 002gure Figure 9b considers the cells at the 0.1 km 002 0.1 km 002 1 hour granularity The y-axis depicts the number of such cells subject to different loads the number of terms t processed This shows that the number of 223interesting\224 cells with at least 100 terms is quite low barely reaching 100 Therefore we 002x the 002nest temporal granularity at an hour Figure 9c considers the cells at the 100 km 002 100 km 002 1 week granularity The 002gure shows that thousands of such cells have summaries that receive more than 1 thousand terms We 002x k at 25 and generate 2 query sets each consisting of 100 queries Each query in the 002rst set has a temporal extent with a length chosen at random among 1 hour 1 day and 1 week and it has a randomly selected spatial region The spatial granularity of the coarsest cell that is contained in the spatial query region is the query's spatial granularity and the query region is enlarged to cover all the cells at that granularity that it intersects with In visual terms this procedure corresponds to 223snapping\224 the spatial query region to the coarser granularity The underlying rationale for adopting this procedure is that 002ner-granularity cells do not contribute with term counts at the same magnitude as do cells at the granularity of the coarsest fully covered cell Since any rectangle can be created from a number of merged squares we limit the experiments to squares Each cell contains 10 002 10 cells at the next 002ner granularity Thus the largest number of cells any query square can cover is 18 002 18  324 As a result we employ queries that may cover up to 1,800 002 1,800 km 2  While the 002rst query set focuses on variation in the spatial range the second focuses on temporal variation Each of the 100 queries has a spatial region chosen at random from one of the spatial granularities The query resulting in most temporal summary merges is the query that spans from the 002rst hour after midnight on the 002rst day in May until the hour before midnight on the last day of May This query covers 2 002 23 hours 3  5 days and 3 weeks which amounts to 57 temporal summaries To avoid empty results we do not consider regions that only cover empty cells Note that we do not perform compaction on the last active temporal granularities to better re\003ect the real-life scenario where a stream is constantly keeping these summaries active To simplify the experiments the initCounters parameter which determines the initial number of counters is set to the same value as targeted k  C Baselines We consider two baselines for comparison and validation of our proposal SS In each active spatio-temporal summary we aggregate the most frequent items using the SpaceSaving algorithm Active summaries maintain a 002xed number  m  of items and their counts while archived summaries are compacted by keeping only the counters for the k most frequent terms Choosing a value for m represents a trade-off between storage size and result accuracy HT In each active spatio-temporal summary we maintain a full list of terms using a hash table Once the summary becomes inactive and is archived its time granularity passes the list is sorted and cleaned up by discarding all but the counters for the targeted topk terms This approach maintains the exact topk items at all spatio-temporal granularities and serves to measure the accuracy of the other approaches However since HT has excessive storage requirements we do not expect it to scale under the considered workloads D The Space Versus Accuracy Trade-Off In the 002rst set of experiments we evaluate the accuracy of our approach by comparing it with the baselines Since HT maintains the exact counts at all granularities its storage requirements are too high for large scale experiments Similarly SS maintains a 002xed number m of counters at all granularities and m cannot be set too high for large scale experiments Thus we consider only tweets occurring in the spatial region with the 11S grid zone designator a region in the US of size ca 900 002 550 km 2  We use the local machine We consider variants of SS where m is set to 50 100 and 200 In AFIA we set targeted k to 50 The 002rst week four days in May is used for warm-up and only the accuracies of the subsequent summaries are evaluated We perform topk queries on all summaries at each spatio-temporal granularity We compare the topk most frequent terms in each summary produced by AFIA and SS and compare with the corresponding topk items produced by HT We set k  20  156

Fig 14 Checkpoints Over Time V C ONCLUSIONS We present a new framework for the processing of spatiotemporally constrained topk most popular terms queries on streaming spatio-temporally tagged text content such as microblog posts The framework's index extends existing techniques for counting frequent items in summaries to allow the summaries to grow and shrink dynamically to adapt to changes in the incoming data Query processing works by merging relevant summaries To provide guarantees about the query results a new merging algorithm is proposed that supports spatio-temporal query regions Experimental studies with an implementation of the framework offers insight into the accuracy scalability and performance of the processing of incoming data and queries and they demonstrate that the framework is capable of offering very accurate query results at high performance at scale A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported in part by the MADALGO research center and in part by the

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
