Self-healing of operational workîow incidents on distributed computing infrastructures Rafael Ferreira da Silva 002  Tristan Glatard 002 Fr  ed  eric Desprez  002 University of Lyon CNRS INSERM CREATIS Villeurbanne France  INRIA University of Lyon LIP ENS Lyon Lyon France Email  rafael.silva,glatard  creatis.insa-lyon.fr Frederic.Desprez@inria.fr Abstract Distributed computing infrastructures are com 
monly used through scientiìc gateways but operating these gateways requires important human intervention to handle operational incidents This paper presents a self-healing process that quantiìes incident degrees of workîow activities from metrics measuring long-tail effect application efìciency data transfer issues and site-speciìc problems These metrics are simple enough to be computed online and they make little assumptions on the application or resource characteristics Incidents are classiìed in levels and associated to sets of healing actions that are selected based on association rules modeling correlations between incident levels The healing process is parametrized on real application traces acquired in production on the European Grid Infrastructure Implementation and experimental results 
obtained in the Virtual Imaging Platform show that the proposed method speeds up execution up to a factor of 4 and properly detects unrecoverable errors I I NTRODUCTION Distributed computing infrastructures DCI are becoming daily instruments of scientiìc research in particular through scientiìc gateways de v eloped to allo w scientists to transparently run their analyses on large sets of computing resources While these platforms provide important amounts of resources in an almost seamless way their large scale and the number of middleware systems involved lead to many errors and faults Easy-to-use interfaces provided by these gateways exacerbate the need for properly solving operational incidents 
encountered on DCIs since end users expect high reliability and performance with no extra monitoring or parametrization from their side In practice such services are often backed by substantial support staff who monitors running experiments by performing simple yet crucial actions such as rescheduling tasks restarting services killing misbehaving experiments or replicating data les to reliable storage facilities Fair QoS can then be delivered yet with important human intervention For instance the long-tail effect is a common frustration for users who have to wait for a long time to retrieve the last few pieces of their computations Operators may be able to address it by rescheduling tasks that are considered late e.g due to execution on a slow machine low network throughput 
or just loss of contact but detection is very time consuming and still rough Automating such operations is challenging for two reasons First the problem is online by nature because no reliable user activity prediction can be assumed and new workloads may arrive at any time Therefore the considered metrics decisions and actions have to remain simple and to yield results while the application is still executing Second it is non-clairvoyant due to the lack of information about applications and resources in production conditions Computing resources are usually dynamically provisioned from heterogeneous clusters clouds or desktop grids without any reliable estimate of their availability and characteristics Models of application execution times are hardly available either in particular on heterogeneous 
computing resources A scientiìc gateway is considered here as a platform where users can process their own data with predeìned applications workîows Workîows are compositions of activities deìned independently from the processed data and that only consist of a program description At runtime activities receive data and spawn invocations from their input parameter sets Invocations are assumed independent from each other bag of tasks and executed on the DCI as single-core tasks which can be resubmitted in case of failures This model ts several existing gateways such as e-bioinfra P-Grade 4 the V irtual Imaging Platform or D  
ecrypthon W e also consider that les involved in workîow executions are accessed through a single le catalog but storage is distributed Files may be replicated to improve availability and reduce load on servers The gateway may take decisions on le replication resource provisioning and task scheduling on behalf of the user Performance optimization is a target but the main point is to ensure that correctly-deìned executions complete that performance is acceptable and that misbehaving runs e.g failures coming from user errors or unrecoverable infrastructure downtimes are quickly detected and stopped before they consume too many resources Our ultimate goal is to reach a general model of such a scientiìc gateway that could autonomously detect and handle 
operational incidents In this work we propose a healing process for workîow activities only Activities are modeled as Fuzzy Finite State Machines FuSM where state de grees of membership are determined by an external healing process Degrees of membership are computed from metrics assuming that incidents have outlier performance e.g a site or a particular invocation behaves differently than the others Based on incident degrees the healing process determines incident levels from thresholds determined from platform history A speciìc set of actions is then selected from association rules among incident levels Section II presents related work Our approach is described

in section III general healing process section IV metrics used to quantify incident degrees and section V incident levels and associated action sets Experimental results are presented in section VI in production conditions II R ELATED W ORK Managing systems with limited intervention of system administrators is the goal of autonomic computing It has been used to address various problems related to self-healing self-conìguration self-optimization and self-protection of distributed systems For instance provisioning of virtual machines is studied by Nguyen et al and an approach to tackle service overload queue starvation black hole effect and job failures is sketched by Collet et al An autonomic manager consists of monitoring analysis planning execution and knowledge so-called MAPE-K loop Generic software frameworks have been built to wrap legacy applications in such loops with limited intrusiveness For instance Broto et al demonstrates the wrapping of DIET grid services for autonomic deployment and conìguration We consider here that the target gateway can be instrumented to report appropriate events and perform actions Monitoring is broadly studied in distributed systems both at coarse traces archives and ne time scales active monitoring probing Many workload archives are available In particular the grid observatory has been collecting traces for a few years on several grids However as noted by Iosup  Epema most e xisting traces remain at the task le v el and lack information about workîows and activities Application patterns can be retrieved from logs e.g bag of tasks but precise information about workîow activities is bound to be missing Studies on task errors and their distributions are also available 15 b ut the y do not consider operational issues encountered by the gateways submitting these tasks Besides active monitoring using tools such as Nagios cannot be the only monitoring source when substantial workloads are involved Therefore we rely on traces of the target gateway as detailed in section V One issue in this case is to determine the timespan where system behavior can be considered steadystate Although this issue was recently investigated it remains difìcult to identify non-stationarities in an online process and we adopt here a stationary model Analysis consists in computing metrics a.k.a utility functions from monitoring data to characterize the state of the system System state usually distinguishes two regimes properly functioning and misfunctioning Zhang et al assume that incidents lead to non stationarity of the workload statistics and use the Page-Hinkely test to detect them Stehle et al present a method where the convex hull is used instead of hyper-rectangles to classify system states As described in section V we use multiple threshold values for a given metric to use more than two levels to characterize incidents Planning and actions considered in this work deal with task scheduling and le replication In these domains most approaches are clairvoyant meaning that resource task error rate and workload characteristics are precisely known  Heuristics are designed by Casano v a et al 22 for the case where only data transfer costs are known on an ofîine problem though Camarasu-Pop et al propose a dynamic load-balancing strategy proposed to remove the long-tail effect on production heterogeneous systems but it is limited to Monte-Carlo simulations The general task scheduling problem is out of our scope We assume that a scheduler is already in place and we only aim at performing actions when it does not deliver proper performance In particular we focus on site blacklisting and on task replication to avoid long-tail effect Task replication a.k.a redundant requests is commonly used to address nonclairvoyant problems b ut it should be used sparingly to avoid overloading the middleware and degrading fairness among users In this w ork task replication is considered when activities are detected blocked or of low efìciency according to the metric presented in section IV Similarly le replication strategies often assume clairvoyance on the size of produced data le access pattern and infrastructure parameters 26 In practice production systems mostly remain limited to manual replication strategies though III G ENERAL H EALING P ROCESS An activity is modeled as an FuSM with 13 states shown on Fig 1 The activity is initialized in Submitting Invocations where all the tasks are generated and submitted Tasks consist of 4 successive phases initialization inputs download application execution and output upload They are all assumed independent but with similar execution times bag of tasks Running is a state where no particular issue is detected no action is taken and the activity is assumed to behave normally Completed resp Failed  is a terminal state used when all the invocations are successfully completed resp at least one invocation failed These 4 states are crisp not fuzzy and exclusive 1  The 9 other states are fuzzy states corresponding to detected incidents The healing process sets the degree of FuSM states from incident detection metrics and invocation statuses Then it determines the actions to be performed to address the incidents If no action is required then the process waits until an event occurs task status change or a timeout is reached Let I   x i i 1 n  be the set of possible incidents  9 in this work and 002  002 1 002 n  002 0   n their degrees in the FuSM Incident x i can occur at different levels  x i,j j 1 m i  delimited by threshold values 003 i   003 i,j j 1 m i   The level of incident i is determined by j such that 003 i,j 003 002 i 003 i,j 1  A set of actions a i  j  is available to address x i,j  a i 1 m i  004 004  A  j 005 004 a i  j  1 where A is the set of possible actions taken by the healing process and 004  A  is the power set of A  In addition to the incidents themselves incident causes are taken into account Association rules are used to identify 1 Their degree can only be 0 or 1 and if 1 then all the other states have a degree of 0

linear regression slope 002 b 1  a  t  a max  t  where a max  t  is maximal value of a  t  in 0 t   t 0 is the time when the activity is started i.e all the invocations are initialized Note that the maximum degree 002 b 1 is reached when the activity is completely blocked  lim t 003\004 a  t   On the other hand 002 b 0 is reached when a  t  a max  t   Invocations are assumed of identical lengths which is common for a workîow activity b Low Efìciency this happens when the time spent by all the activity invocations in data transfers dominates CPU time It may be due to sites with poor network connectivity or intrinsic to the application The incident degree is deìned from the ratio between the cumulative CPU time C i consumed at time t by all completed invocations and the cumulative execution time at time t of all completed invocations 002 e 1  003 n  t  i 1 C i 003 n  t  i 1  C i  D i  where D i is the time spent by invocation i in data transfers c Input Data Unavailable this happens when a le is registered in the le catalog but the storage resource\(s is\(are unavailable or unreachable The incident degree 002 iu in this state is determined from the input transfer failure rate due to data unavailability Transfers of completed failed and running invocations are considered d Input Data does not Exist this happens when an incorrect data path was speciìed the le was removed by mistake or the le catalog is unavailable or unreachable Again the incident degree 002 ie is directly determined by the input transfer failure rate due to non-existent data Transfers of completed failed and running invocations are considered e Site Misconìgured for Input Data this incident happens when sites have utmost input data transfer failure rate The incident degree 002 is at time t is measured as follows 002 is  max 006 1 006 2 006 k   median 006 1 006 2 006 k  where 006 i denotes the input transfer failure ratio including both input data unavailable and input data does not exist on site i at time t and k is the number of white-listed sites used by the activity at time t  The difference between the maximum rate and the median ensures that the incident degree has high values only when some sites are misconìgured This metric is correlated but not redundant with the two previous ones If some input data le is not available due to site-independent issues with the storage system then 002 iu will grow but 002 is will remain low because all sites fail identically On the contrary 002 is may grow while 002 iu and 002 ie remain low f Output Data Unavailable output data can also be unavailable Unavailability happens due to three main reasons the user did not specify the output path correctly the application did not produce the expected data or the le catalog or storage resource are unavailable or unreachable The incident degree 002 ou is determined by the output transfer failure rate Transfers of completed failed and running invocations are considered g Site Misconìgured for Output Data the incident degree 002 os in this incident is determined as follows 002 os  max 007 1 007 2 007 k   median 007 1 007 2 007 k  where 007 i denotes the output transfer failure ratio on site i at time t and k is the number of white-listed sites used by the activity at time t  h Application Error applications can fail due to a variety of reasons among which the application executable is corrupted dependencies are missing or the executable is not compatible with the execution host The incident degree 002 a in this state is measured by the task failure rate due to application errors Completed failed and running tasks are considered i Site Misconìgured for Application The incident degree 002 as in this state is measured as follows 002 as  max 010 1 010 2 010 k   median 010 1 010 2 010 k  where 010 i denotes the task failure rate due to application errors on site i and k is the number of white-listed sites used by the activity at time t  V I NCIDENT L EVELS AND A CTIONS Incident degrees 002 i are quantiìed in discrete incident levels so that different sets of actions can be used to address different levels of the incident The threshold number and values are determined from observed distributions of 002 i  The number m i of incident levels associated to incident i is set as the number of modes in the distribution of 002 i  Thresholds 003 i,j are determined from mode clustering A Training Dataset We collected traces from the Virtual Imaging Platform gateway between April and August 2011 Applications deployed in this platform are described as workîows executed using the MOTEUR workîow engine Resource pro visioning and task scheduling is provided by DIRAC using so-called pilot jobs Resources are provisioned online with no advance reservations Tasks are executed on the biomed virtual organization VO of the European Grid Infrastructure EGI 2 which has access to some 150 computing sites worldwide and to 120 storage sites providing approximately 4 PB of disk This data set contains 1  082 executions of 36 different workîows executed by 26 users Workîow executions contain 1  838 activity instances corresponding to 92  309 invocations and 123  025 tasks including resubmissions Figure 4 shows the cumulative amount of running activities along this period It shows that the workload is quite uniformly distributed

processing. We call these çfile data sourcesé and çtable data sourcesé respectively. Our data sources pane has functionalities to create either table or file data sources by uploading a chosen CSV file, as shown in Figure 11   Figure 12. View Creation Fu nctionality \(left\ in operation \(right  3  Data Source Attachment Each data attach-point has a specific minimum schema  expectation to be able to make use of the data source attached. The minimum schema expectation makes some attributes mandatory. For example, a demographic data source is required to have a çCustomerIDé attribute that uniquely identifies each customer.  It may have any number of additional attributes; for example, in the unsupervised segmentation workflow, any additional attribute of a customer is used by the clustering algorithm to measure the similarity between customers. Often, the minimum schema attribute names may not exactly match the customerês attribute names. For example, the customer may use CustIDé to uniquely identify a customer whereas the attach-point may be expecting çCustomerIDé. We have incorporated a view creation facility that helps the customer to create a non-materialized view by mapping the attributes in her data source to those expected by the minimum schema. Once such a view is created, it appears as another data source, and can be chosen from the drop down list of data sources. Figure 12 shows how view creation functionality gives the user the option to pick an attribute from her source to the minimum schema attribute, in this case ID, CUSTID, TRANSACTIONDATE, and TOTALPRICE 4  Downloading Results We implemented the workflow execution as an asynchronous operation, where the user finishes the setup uploading data, attaching data sources, choosing the workflow to be executed\d clicks on çsubmité.

Cloud computing provides shared resources, software and information to computing devices as a utility over the network. It has become widely popular over the last few years and has been assessed to be no less influential than any of the previous trendsetting technologies [13   T h o ugh m a n y o b s ta c l e s to the u s a g e o f  cloud computing have been identified in e s a me report emphasizes that the utility of cloud computing is likely to outweigh its disadvantages. Cloud computing provides many advantages such as elasticity and transference of over-provisioning and under-provisioning risks. Forecas u g g e s t th at clou d co m p u t i n g  w oul d  grow at a very fast rate over the next few years.  Cloud computing has been used for a variety of tasks such as parallel data mining d g raph an al y tic s 16   Analytics Services Though popular analytics engines such as SAS, SPSS and R started off as stand-alone applications that need to be installed on a server to be used, recent trends suggest that commercial analytics engines are not far off from delivering full-fledged analytics capabilities on the cloud. Predixion Software 13 and Zementis 14 offer scoring of any PMML 15 model over the cloud, whereas SAS has started to offer many of their functionalities over the cloud  How ev er, to th e bes t of ou r k n o w l edg e, th ere h a s been  a very limited work on providing powerful analytics functionalities over the cloud that can readily be used without requiring considerable expertise in analytics and the specific tool to be used  Workflows for Analytics The main novelty of the solution proposed in this paper rests in the usage of configurable and extensible multi-workflows to make it easy to use analytics despite limited technical know-how. Analytics workflows themselves are not novel and are the primary means of using SPSS \(with the SPSS Modeler component\wever, a typical SPSS workflow is designed to be used by personnel who understand the semantics of typical data mining operations. In particular, SPSS provides a fleet of functionality that is powerful enough to be used across domains, and is not specific to the scenario in which it may be deployed. For example, the semantics of the CustID field is unknown to a generic clustering operator, and under a default setting, the clustering operator would use the CustID field also for clustering leading to the undesirable results of    13  http://www.predixionsoftware.com/predixion  14  http://www.zementis.com  15  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_Model_Markup_Language

grouping customers with numerically close CustIDs together. We eliminate the need to explicitly specify the exclusion of such attributes, by folding in the semantics of attributes such as CustID \(among others\to the prepackaged workflows. In a pre-packaged workflow for customer segmentation, the fact that CustID needs to be excluded in clustering would already be already preconfigured. The customer can thereby focus on configuring other parameters that are likely to affect business such as number of clusters in the outp ut or the rules to use in designating customers as high-value or low-value. The concept of multi-flows, where a single template workflow can instantiate many possible workflows, has not been developed in prior literature to the best of our knowledge VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Analytics, despite its apparent utility in improving business has not been adopted widely. The main deterrents include the large upfront cost of procuring computing infrastructure and the cost of setting up an in-house analytics team of statisticians and business analysts. Such costs are so high that many small and medium businesses cannot afford traditional analytics solutions, especially in the developing regions of the world due to a spectrum of other deterrent factors that we have outlined. Many such deterrents may be effectively eliminated by the delivery of analytics services on the cloud. In this paper, we propose configurable pre-packaged multi-flows flows that span multiple workflows\ to deliver analytics services on the cloud towards helping to improve analytics penetration Multi-flows bundle together related workflows enabling users to explore and exploit related functionality by making minor configuration changes. We illustrate how changes to workflow configurations may be made easily without any in-depth knowledge of the various operators involved. Our multi-flows are easily extensible to non-disruptively include new functionalities in response to the changing needs of a customer \(or a changing customer base We described a survey of Indian retail players that helped us identify \(and validate our assumptions of\e primary obstacles to analytics penetration in the sector; we also analyzed the major analytics needs of such businesses. We illustrated that many such common analytics needs may be effectively captured within a small number of workflows We developed a fully-functional system that implements the chosen multi-flows for the retail sector. We detailed the various features of the system, the multi-ness of the flows in the system, and example configuration settings that can be used to fine tune specific multi-flows. Through generous usage of screenshots, we illustrated the ease of use of our system; we expect that such enhanced convenience of usage will aid penetration of analytics into new customer bases  Future Work We are exploring further enhancements to improve ease of use of analytics solutions on the cloud including an automatic mapping of attributes in data sources to attach-points by exploiting the data type and distribution Also, making analytics widespread would necessarily involve addressing some of the problems that are applicable to cloud computing in general. These include concerns about data privacy in the cloud and the loss of control of the computation elopin g techn iqu es  to eff ecti v el y an d  provably anonymize of data without affecting the results of specific operators such as clustering or classification is an interesting direction to pursue A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Abhishek Subramanian, Neethu Suresh Shubhendu Aggarwal and Varun Srivastava for efforts in implementing the system and performing market surveys VII  R EFERENCES  1  Todd Morrison, çRetail chain uses in-house analytics team to run SAP BusinessObjectsé, TechTarget Search SAP, 4 th March, 2011 http://searchsap.techtarget.com/news/2240033086/Retail-chain-uses-in-houseanalytics-team-to-run-SAP-BusinessObjects  2  Rakesh Agrawal, and Ramakrishnan Srikant, çFast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databasesé,  VLDB 1994, Chile 3  How to structure a business analytics team http://mybusinessanalytics.blogspot.in/2011/09/business-analytics-teamstructure.html Retrived March 2, 2012 4  MA Rappa, çThe utility business model and the future of computing services IBM Systems Journal, 43\(1\ 2004 5  Brian Hayes, çCloud Computingé, Comm.

Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
