Some of the existing methods have either very low or very high pruning, which is the cause of generation of larger or lesser number of frequent patterns. In this paper we have adopted a balanced approach for frequent pattern selection. Our proposed measure weighted support considers association and dissociation among items as well as the impact of null transactions on them for frequent set generation Impact of increasing itemset size on weighted support gives rise to variable threshold  The experimental results obtained after implementation of the proposed algorithm justify the approach Keywords \227 Association rule mining; Dissociation Weighted support; Null transaction impact factor Jaccard similarity coefficient I  I NTRODUCTION  Frequent pattern mining in a large database is one of the interesting research areas in data mining Frequent pattern generation basically depends on the associability of the items \(attributes\ in the database Apriori is the classical algorithm by Agarwal et al. [1 2  a n d  H a n et a l  3 for freque nt i t e m s e t ge ne ra t i o n  Apriori employs an iterative approach known as a level-wise search, where associability of k-itemsets is used to determine k+1-itemsets. Association rule is traditionally measured on two parameters namely support s\d confidence c\. The mathematical formula of support and confidence are  and    respectively, where A and B are any two itemsets and  and AB represents the itemset  and is an association rule which means if an itemset A occurs it is likely that B will also occur. An itemset is considered for mining rule if its support is greater than or equal to a threshold called min_sup and these itemsets are called frequent itemsets Association measured through support is a binary association where in each transaction the presence of all the items of an itemset is only considered. But it does not consider the cases where some items of an itemset are present and the other items are absent or all of them are absent. Frequent pattern generation using traditional support fails to capture this fact. We take a sample data to explain this further. Let T be a database of 15 sample transactions on 4 items A, B, C and D as shown in Table I. The presence and absence of an item in the transaction is denoted by 1 and 0 respectively. We observe that     and  If min_sup 0.3 both AB and BC are frequent being above min_sup  and thus qualify for confidence measurement. Again  0.67, which shows that both and are valid association rules with equal confidence but we cannot conclude which one of these two expresses stronger association. Thus association alone fails to differentiate the one from the other. Let us now examine this further from the angel of dissociation  TABLE I. Sample transactions of a database T  TID A B C D 1110 0 2011 0 3000 1 4111 0 5010 0 6100 0 7011 1 8111 1 9000 1 10 1 1 0 0 11 1 0 0 0 12 0 0 0 1 13 1 1 1 0 14 1 0 1 0 15111 1  Positive association of itemsets measures their joint occurrences. Negative association \(dissociation [4  on  the other hand measures presence of one itemset when the other itemset is absent. High association should naturally imply low dissociation or vice versa and therefore dissociation has an impact in measuring association for confirmation of associativity. If we examine AB and BC in Table I we find, A and B are dissociated in 6 out of 15 transactions or dissociation\(AB\ = 0.4 whereas B and C are dissociated in 4 out of 15 transactions or dissociation\(BC\ = 0.27. We may conclude that BC is preferred to AB because of lesser dissociation other parameters remaining same. This result prompted us to look for a new measure of frequent set generation which is built on both association and dissociation 


 A  Contribution In this paper we have proposed a measure named Weighted Support WS\ We have considered two major types of associations. They are positive association \(A B\ and negative association \(A B or ~A B\. The transaction in which we have A B \(null transaction\ is not considered as positive or negative association. We have found out how positive and negative association rules are affected by this particular transaction and thus have focused on finding the impact of null transactions  over positive association rules. As a matter of fact our proposed method is a composite measure under the consideration of positive association rules, negative association rules and null transaction impact factor B  Related Work Cohen et al.

However the authors did not consider the possibility of defining association through the minimization of dissociation Adaptive Apriori algorithm for frequent set generation in the work of Wang et al.

But the number of frequent sets decreases as the size of itemset increases justifying variable MINSUP The work of Pal et al. [4  m eas u r es as s o ci ati o n  ag ain s t  dissociation. The authors considered togetherness as the measure for frequent itemset generation in lieu of support. By definition, the value of togetherness is 1 for all 1-itemsets and thus all 1-itemsets are frequent in any database irrespective of the transactions and min_sup This implies all 2-itemsets are candidates in 2-items candidate generation and hence qualify for support calculation. Moreover, togetherness of any itemset is always greater than or equal to its support Thus it is very likely that more frequent sets will be generated in 2-itemsets and so on in higher order. In togetherness measure a larger number of higher order itemsets are likely to qualify as frequent itemsets compared to support measure.

Many authors have counted frequent set for positive as well as negative rules generation. Some of the authors have noticed the above fact and tried to develop method which can reduce not only the complexity of calculation, but also filter the rules in a greater degree. The well known weight based algorithms [14, 15, 16, 17, 18 suppor t  weight calculation of positive and negative rules II  ENUMERATION  OF  WEIGHTED  SUPPORT Enumeration of Weighted Support WS\ basically depends on three major factors. They are support of itemsets \(s Jaccard similarity coefficient j\ and Null transaction impact factor   A  Support of itemsets  From the classical Apriori algorithm pro pos ed  by Agarwal and Srikant we get the mathematical structure of support\(s\ follows: Let   be the set of items in the database where each item is a Boolean attribute of the database table. Let D be the set of all transactions in the database, where each transaction  is a set of items such that T I Let represents the set of rows that have 1 in column According to classical Apriori support s of itemset   Table II represents frequency of transactions of two itemsets A and B of a dataset in a 2 x 2 contingency table. The cells of the table corresponding to 4 possible combinations of the binary variables A and B contain their respective frequency Table II. 2 x 2 contingency table of A and B B  A   From Table II we get support s\(AB   B  Jaccard Similarity Coefficient One can say that less dissociation among itemsets may be considered as strong association among those itemsets. So dissociation is an effective reverse process for justification of association. Scientist Jaccard has proposed a technique to find out the similarity among binary variables under the consideration of degree of dissociation along with association. Jaccard similarity coefficient [19 is  defined as the quotient between the intersection and the union of the pair wise compared variables between two objects. Jaccard similarity coefficient [19, 20 of  and      where  and are two itemsets and and represent the set of rows that have 1 in columns and respectively On the basis of Table II data Jaccard similarity coefficient     Incidentally, it is observed that Jaccard coefficient is same as togetherness measure suggested by Pal et al. [4 C  Weighted Support While support tends to ignore the impact of dissociation on association though the effect of null transactions have an impact in the denominator Jaccard coefficient tends to ignore null transactions in measuring association against dissociation. We introduce a measure Weighted Support WS\ to

WS is based on positive association among itemsets, negative association among itemsets and the effects of null transactions on association. The mathematical formula of WS is  205. \(1 where   is the null transaction impact factor s is the support  according to classical Apriori algorithm and is the Jaccard similarity coefficient WS is a weighted linear combination of the two measures s and j. The use of  and its range of values has been discussed in the next Section It can be easily observed from Eq. \(1\at irrespective of the value of   as  Thus the proposed measure will strike a balance between s and j D  Null Transaction Impact Factor  Null transaction refers to those rows of the database where none of the item of the itemset occurs or simply the entry column\(s\ is/are 0 \(zero\.  Though the literature suggests a number of different measures for measuring associability among itemsets, there is no direct impact of null transactions on these measures. As a matter of fact, between association and dissociation which one is more influenced by the all-0 set is a debatable issue. One can argue that since 00 means absence of both items, it is difficult to predict if one of them was present in this transaction what would have happened to the other. In this paper we have basically harped on this point. Experimentally it is clear to us that the null transactions effects the frequent itemset generation deeply. In case of application of classical Apriori algorithm the denominator of support includes the null transaction set. So if its number is high support will be less and thus some practically frequent itemsets who have strong associativity according to Jaccard measure will be left out. On the contrary in the case of togetherness algorithm [4 th e den o m i nato r ex clu d es th e n u l l  transaction set. So the value of denominator become comparatively less and togetherness become larger and thus it passes many itemsets as frequent sets which may include some impractical frequent itemsets having less associativity. So in both the cases effect of null transactions do not seem to have been given due consideration in pruning. To overcome this problem we have introduced an impact factor for null transactions Let D = total number of transactions in the database set of rows that have 1 in column  where is a item or itemset complement of  So the support of null transaction for itemset     On the basis of the above observation we make the following claim Lemma 1 In any database D if the support of null transaction is negligible then its impact on frequent itemset generation is also negligible. If support of null transaction is < 0.5 then it should be upgraded to 0.5 for distribution of its impact on linear combination of support and Jaccard similarity Proof Let s be the support according to Aprioi algorithm and J be Jaccard similarity coefficient Now if we consider Table II, Eq. \(1\ can be expressed as          where       We consider two cases depending on the value of   Case I 0.5 \(i.e. number of null transaction is greater or equal than 50  A significant change in WS in comparison to support \(s\oticed and the value of is accepted in this case  Case II 0.5 \(i.e. number of null transaction is less than 50%\. WS < 1.5s There will not be any significant change of WS in comparison to support\(s\ and at the limiting condition it will be equal to s. This shows that has a negligible impact over itemsets when 0.5. In such case the value of should be upgraded to 0.5. The equation for null transaction impact factor thus becomes     E  Pruning through Minimum Weighted Support MIN_WS To find out the frequent patterns of itemsets a threshold value needs to be set either by the user or the system. The system can even set a default to be overridden by user\222s choice. The itemsets whose Weighted Support \(WS are less than the Minimum Weighted Support \(MIN_WS have to be pruned from the itemsets as non frequent itemsets. As a result the remaining itemsets will be considered as frequent itemsets III  PSEUDO  CODE  OF  PROPOSED  WEIGHTED  SUPPORT  ALGORITHM Input: D \(Database\d MIN_WS \(Minimum weighted support threshold Output: L \(Frequent pattern of data-set  Procedure weighted support \(D, MIN_WS for \(k=1; L k-1 NULL; k C k ws_gen \(L k-1  for each transaction t D c t  C k t for each candidate c C k c.count MIN_WS return L For each itemset l 1 L k-1  For each itemset l 2 L k-1  if\(l 1 1]=l 2 1 l 1 2]=l 2 2 205\205\205\205

For each transaction \(t\ubset function is used to find all subsets of the transaction that are candidates and the count of each of these candidates is accumulated. The ws_candidates which satisfies the minimum weighted support are considered as frequent itemsets, L. The ws_gen  procedure consists of two operations, namely, join and prune. L k-1 is joined with L k-1 to generate candidates. The prune component is used to remove candidates who do not posses minimum weighted support. The has_infrequent_subset procedure is related to pruning and is shown in prune procedure    where k = size of itemset and p = maximum threshold value set up by the user for minimum itemset size The limiting value of the above function is 0.5p. This dynamic nature of MIN_WS helps the developers to generate a moderate number of frequent patterns of itemsets V  PERFORMANCE  ANALYSIS We have assessed the performance of Weighted Support \(WS\gorithm against both of the classical Apriori algorithm d Ap rioridis algorithm [4 We have made our experiment on EXTENDED BAKERY dataset 1 of 50 items and have increased the number of transactions gradually from 1000 and then 5000 to 25000 in steps of 5000. To show the relative performance, we have chosen a threshold value 0.08 which refers to MIN_WS for WS algorithm min_sup  for Apriori algorithm min_togetherness for Aprioridis algorithm a v e tes t ed ou r  algorithm for 3 different cases \(a\itemset \(b itemset and \(c\itemset with the same threshold The experimental results are shown through the following bar charts. We have shown number of transactions along X- axis and number of frequent itemset along Y-axis  Fig. 1 Performance of WS, Apriori and Aprioridis algorithms for 1-itemset with threshold = 0.08     1   In prune procedure n 1 and n 0 represents the set of all 1s and all 0s respectively. Thus n 1 refers to direct association and n 0 refers to null transaction set In stepwise method the algorithm computes support Jaccard similarity coefficient and null transaction impact factor of candidates and finally accepts only those candidates whose WS value are higher or equal to min_ws IV  DYNAMIC  WEIGHTED  SUPPORT  Most of the well known algorithms follow the uniform minimum threshold value for the determination of frequent pattern of itemsets. But if an itemset becomes frequent with a specific threshold, its superset may or may not be the frequent set w.r.t. the same threshold. So we may think of using more practical approach for minimum threshold. Basically minimum threshold possesses a close relationship with the size of the itemset Support of any itemset say AB will be greater than or equal to its superset, say ABC. So, support would tend to decrease as the size of the itemset increases From this we can assert that the user specified minimum threshold value should also decrease gradually with the increase of the itemset size. So in reality MIN_WS should have a dynamic nature and should be a decreasing function w.r.t the value of itemset size k. For example one can choose the following monotonically decreasing function for MIN_WS   


 Fig. 2 Performance of WS, Apriori and Aprioridis algorithms for 2-itemset with threshold = 0.04   Fig. 3 Performance of WS, Apriori and Aprioridis algorithm for 3itemset with threshold = 0.04   Now going back to Table I let us recheck our proposed measure. Both itemsets AB and BC have same support value 0.4 and with respect to min_sup  0.3 both are frequent itemsets. If we set up the MIN_WS = 0.5 then only BC \(WS= 0.5333\ will be treated as frequent itemset but AB \(WS=0.48\will be infrequent VI  CONCLUSION The classical support measure considers linear association among items ignoring the presence of dissociation among them. Again Jaccard coefficient togetherness\ considers both linear association and dissociation among items, but ignores the cases of the form ~A B. Many authors have categorized A B as a negative association and some authors suggested it as positive association. As a result an ambiguity occurs.  Our method named Weighted support does not consider  null transaction \(~A B as either positive association or negative association but takes into account its impact over positive association. Experimental results proved the effectiveness of the proposed weighted support algorithm for frequent set generation vis-\340-vis traditional support and togetherness.  We have also discussed the necessity of dynamic minimum weighted support which expresses inverse proportional relationship with item size R EFERENCES  1  R. Agarwal and R.

QARM techniques found applications in various domains Therefore a large number of research works are contributed towards ef“ciently solving the problem of QAR mining In this work we highlight various trends in QARM research and present a comprehensive study on various approaches with their relative merits and limitations To conclude it can be stated that from the broad variety of techniques in existence no particular technique seems to be suitable for application in all domains because the appearance size and nature of data belonging to different domains vary Moreover current solutions may be considered inadequate because there are several issues pertaining to the available QARM techniques which we identify and enlist below 1 Inability to mine both Positive and Negative QARs 2 Failure to generate ef“cient multi-dimensional QARs 3 Dependence on proper selection of thresholds for generating rules 4 Redundant uninteresting and misleading rules generation 5 Poor scalability of the

Retail is a sparse dataset  consists of product sales data from retail stores Each transaction in the Retai dataset represents purchase information from one consumer at a time The details of the datasets are presented in gure 6 The programming language used to implement all the three algorithms is java and run in 3.3 GHz Intel processor 4 Gbyte memory and Windows 7 32bit OS Figs 7…9 show results of runtime experiments regarding the real and synthetic datasets shown in gure 6 In these gures we can observe that IHT-growth outperforms the others in all of the cases IHT-growth uses the proposed header tree structure to store the 1-frequent items instead of the older header table to minimize access times to search items As a result its advantages have a positive effect on reducing runtime in whole experiments Especially in the case of Retail dataset the difference of runtime between our algorithm and the others is much more than the other datasets  In all experiments FP-growth shows the worst performance Note that IHT-growth method can be used with any fptree mining to improve its ef“ciency We suggested here two methods to implement the new algorithm If we dont know the number of items in advance the First method is suggested In this experiments we used the second method By using the second method we can create a more ef“cient BSHTree because all the items with highest frequency will be appeared on the top of the BSHTree By using this method the run time can be improved by minimizing the searching time of items while sorting out the transactions VI CONCLUSION This study proposes an ef“cient transaction processing method during the transaction scanning time By applying the ef“cient binary search tree the mining time drastically reduced The new transaction sorting method is also improves the performance of mining The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the fp-growth and IFP-growth two well known and widely used algorithms Here we used a BSHTree after the rst scan to store the items with support count While using the BSHTree we used the actual names of items as keys This method can be applied to improve the mining process with any frequent itemset mining algorithm which is using a header table R EFERENCES  Jia wei H an Jian Pei and Y iwen Y in Mining Frequent P atterns without CandidateGeneration,SIGMOD 00 Proceedings of the 2000 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data.Pages 1-12  Gw angb umPyun a Unil Y u n a  K eun Ho Ryu  E f cient frequent pattern mining based on Linear Pre“x tree Knowledge-Based Systems 55 2014 125…139  Y uh-JiuanTsay a T ain-Jung Hsu a Jing-Rung Y ub,FIUT  A n e w method for mining frequent itemsets,Information Sciences 179 2009 1724 1737  K e-Chung Lin I-En Liao  Zhi-Sheng Chen An impro v e d frequent pattern growth method for mining association rules Expert Systems with Applications 38 2011 5154…5161  F an-Chen Tseng An adapti v e approach to mining frequent itemsets ef“ciently Expert Systems with Applications 39 2012 13166…13172  R Agra w al T  Imielinski A.N Sw ami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases in Proceedings of the ACMSIGMOD Conference on Management of Data pages 1993 pp 207…216  R Agra w al R Srikant F ast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules very Large Data Bases\(VLDB 1994 487499  Xiaobing Liu K u n Zhai W itold Pedrycz An impro v e d association rules mining method,Expert Systems with Applications 39 2012 13621374  Qiao yongwei,Y ang Hui Dong T ingjian,Research On QAR Data Mining Method Based On Improved Association Rule,Physics Procedia 24 2012 1514-1519  T  Hu S.Y  Sung H Xiong Q Fu Disco v ery of maximum length frequent itemsets Information Sciences 178 1 2008 69-87  G Lee U Y un K Ryu Sliding windo w based weighted maximal frequent pattern mining over data streams Expert Systems with Applications 41 2 2014 694-708  S.K T anbeer  C.F  Ahmed B.S Jeong Y  Lee Ef cient single-pass frequent pattern mining using a pre“x-tree Information Sciences 179 5 2008 559583  V S Tseng C.W  W u B.E Shie P S Y u  UP-Gro wth an ef cient algorithm for high utility itemset mining Knowledge Discovery and Data mining KDD 2010 253-262  T  W u  Y  Chen J han Re-e xamination of interestingness measures in pattern mining a uni“ed framework Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery DMKD 21 3 2010 371-397  J Han H Cheng D Xin X Y an Frequent pattern mining current status and future directions Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery DMKD 15 1 2007 55-86  Zaki Mohammed J Naren Ramakrishnan and Lizhuang Zhao Mining frequent boolean expressions application to gene expression and regulatory modeling International Journal of Knowledge Discovery in Bioinformatics IJKDB 1.3 2010 68-96 1084 2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing Communications and Informatics ICACCI

paying a price of a slightly worse ratio for subsets Taken together the price of having more subsets is preferred because subsets contain only items actually in the assembly while superset and overlap patterns also contain unrelated items The 002rst and second row of 002gure 8 correspond to the instance and the pattern-based approach for graded synchrony The third corresponds to the instance-based approach for binary synchrony Comparing the diagrams for unrelated patterns our graded method detects all injected patterns 050\002rst and second rows\051 while the binary method also produces unrelated pattern In 050Borgelt et al 2015\051 it is demonstrated that the instance-based approach yields slightly better results than the pattern approach However this approach does not consider the precision of synchrony Surprisingly using only the pattern-based approach with a graded notion of synchrony yields a better ratio for overlap and superset patterns 7 CONCLUSIONS In this paper we presented a method to detect frequent synchronous patterns in event sequences using a graded notion of synchrony for mining patterns in the presence of imprecise synchrony of events constituting occurrences and selective participation 050incomplete occurrences\051 Our method adapts methods presented in the literature to tackle selective participation using binary synchrony especially the instancebased approach which looks at instances of patterns to improve the detection by removing instances that are likely chance events checking the precision of synchrony of these instances We demonstrate in our experiments that using a graded notion of synchrony for support computation helps to simplify the detection of selective participation because a pattern-based approach yields better results or at least equally good results as an instance-based approach This is a considerable advantage since identifying the individual pattern instances is costly and thus it is desirable to avoid it ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The work presented in this paper was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness 050MINECO Grant TIN2012-31372\051 and by the Principality of
