Thus energy consumption is one of the most significant 
issues in wireless sensor network environment. For various sensor network applications, security features are also to be a rising big issue more and more. If wireless sensor network supports a variety of security functions, more powerful devices and more energy are required. On the other hand, providing security feature and energy consumption together face a trade-off Therefore, in this paper we propose a novel efficient security architecture in IEEE 802.15.4-based wireless sensor network called Hybrid Adaptive Security Framework. The goal of the proposed security framework is to provide hybrid adaptive security suites 
to each packet according to various WSN considerations  1. Introduction  Wireless sensor networks with low-power devices have been used as an infrastructure as well as core technology in order to implement ubiquitous computing environment. A variety of rapidly increasing applications of wireless sensor networks are driven by ecological, military, living environment health and personnel related area. These increasing sensor network applications can sometimes include 
very sensitive information such as military monitoring and tracking information, personnel related information, and individual health data because of its native characteristic. Moreover, wireless sensor network has a lot of security vulnerabilities because it consists of low computing power and limited resources. Such threats can be classified by network layering architecture such as jamming and tampering in physical layer, collision, exhaustion, unfairness in link layer, spoofed, altered or replays routing information, selective forwarding, sinkhole, and 
wormhole in network layer, flooding and desynchronization in transport layer. Thus, in order to protect sensitive sensing data and security threat security capabilities in wireless sensor network are strongly required. These security capabilities have seven requirements as follows; availability authorization, authentication, confidentiality, integrity non-repudiation, and freshness. However, as we mentioned before, wireless sensor network has inherently resource constrained such as low 
computation, low memory, short communication range, and low batter life. Specifically, the energy consumption problem continues to remain one of the biggest issues in wireless sensor network for challenge barrier of battery capability. Thus, there is a significant trade-off between providing security functionalities and decreasing energy consumption [1-4 This paper concentrates on a security approach to solve the contradiction issue in wireless sensor network. The approach is to make a hybrid adaptive security framework which can provide efficient 
security capabilities considering energy consumption problem. In this paper, we propose a hybrid adaptive security framework and then show use cases and test platform to verify the proposed framework. This paper is structured as follows. An overview and introduction of IEEE 802.15.4/Zigbee and its security schemes are given in the next Section 2. The proposed approach is discussed in Section 3. In Section 4, implementation and performance evaluation are performed. The paper is concluded in Section 5 
 2. Background  IEEE 802.15.4 security consists of four kinds of security services such as access control, message integrity, message confidentiality, and replay protection. Access control feature should prevent unauthorized users from participating in the network In other word, authorized users can join a legitimated network. The access control is supported by access 


control list which includes a variety of security information. Message integrity means the validity of transferred data and message authentication implies message senderís verification using cryptographic key These message integrity and message authentication are guaranteed using message authentication code\(MAC\ IEEE 802.15.4. The MAC is appended to each message sent. Also, several security suites are defined in IEEE 802.15.4 security specification. The security suites consists of 8 different security levels and each level means a kind of cryptographic algorithm, the mode of block cipher, message authentication code, and the size of message authentication code[5-6 Many researchers have addressed many research areas in wireless sensor network security. Especially there are a few security architecture researches for providing security features in wireless sensor network In case of TinySA t i s perf or m e d on   s m a rt d u s t   using TinyOS operating system to provide a lightweight security architecture for wireless sensor networks. TinySA consists of a suite of security protocols and cryptographic primitives to ensure confidentiality, integrity and authenticity of communication in a sensor network using ECC\(Elliptic Curve Cryptography\ algorithm. Tanv present a cluster formation, secure key management scheme, and a secure routing algorithm to address the special security needs of tiny sensor nodes and sensor networks as a security framework  present a security concept called adaptive security architecture. The security architecture is divided into low level, medium level, and high level according to application services. The three defined levels of security allow covering the exigencies of every wireless sensor network service. Slijepcevic et al. [10  propose a communication security framework where for each type of data we define a corresponding security mechanism. By employing this multitiered security architecture where each mechanism has different resource requirements, we allow for efficient resource management that is essential for wireless sensor networks. The security level I is reserved for mobile code, as the most sensitive information sent through the network. The security level II is dedicated to the location information conveyed in messages. The security level III mechanism is applied to the application specific information  3. Security Architecture 3.1  Hybrid Adaptive Security Suite Security suite is a combination of security operations which is designed to provide security services on MAC frames. As we already discussed in section 2.2, IEEE 802.15.4 security suite consists of 8 different security levels including symmetric cryptography algorithm, mode, and integrity code bit length. In case of the proposed hybrid adaptive security framework, it provides the security suite as called Hybrid Adaptive Security Suite\(HASS\ Table 1 and 2   Table 1. Hybrid adap tive security suite  Basically, the proposed security suite of Table 1 is the almost same as IEEE 802.15.4 suite except that it doesnít have ìno securityî suite. However, the most significant point is that the proposed HASS can be dynamically applied to MAC frames according to a characteristic of wireless sensor network. In other words, in this paper, the main contribution of the HASS is to provide flexible and dynamic security capability using HASS decision parameters\(as illustrated in Table 2\. When a packet is sent or received, an appropriate security suite is decided by various wireless sensor network features such as network and data characteristics. Table 2 describes HASS decision parameters. In case of network characteristics, the features consist of Public Commercial, and Private. These attributes of network characteristics have a different secrecy by using keys and its length. In other words, ìPublicî network attribute means a kind of open network which everybody can connect and it doesnít guarantee any confidentiality. However, ìPrivateî network means it needs very strong security requirement because the network can have a high possibility of including sensitive information and network devices Commercialî attribute is located at the middle of the previous two network features. In case of Zigbee network, it has a concept of Trust Center with two kinds of network attributes such as commercial and residential Data characteristics of HASS decision table are first divided into application and control attribute Application data means a kind of collected data from application services in WSN. Such sensor network application attributes consist of Periodic, UrgentPeriodic, On-Demand, and Event-Driven. Control data means a kind of management signal or message for  HASS 1 HASS 2 HASS 3 HASS 4 HASS 5 HASS 6 HASS 7 Authenti cation  O O O O O O Integrity  O O O O O O Confident O    O O O MAC Size 0 32 64 128 32 64 128 


operating wireless sensor network. For example, a message with security information\(Security\routing information\(Routing\, geometric information\(Location\, and update code data\(OTA be included as a control data attribute. Thus, when a packet is sent or received, network characteristic is first considered, and then each network attribute are divided into application and control data features again. After confirming two-tier decision parameters, an appropriate security suite is finally decided Table 2.

Figure 1 shows whole architecture of IEEE 802.15.4-based network stack with hybrid adaptive security sublayer. Basically HASF is based on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC and PHY. In other words, the proposed hybrid adaptive security sublayer\(HASS\ and security functions are embedded to network and MAC layer, separately. Also, it uses security functions in IEEE 802.15.4 MAC In whole network architecture, the HASS consists of hybrid adaptive security block and frame support block Hybrid adaptive security block has a responsibility to apply an appropriate security suite to a packet or frame for efficient encryption and decryption operations. It satisfies HASS security properties outlined in Section 3.1 and the hybrid adaptive security block consists of hybrid adaptive security manager\(HASM\d hybrid adaptive security decision engine\(HASDE   Hybrid adaptive security manager\(HASM\ : When a frame or packet is received to HASM, it performs a kind of a probing process about security related information In other words, HASM analyzes hybrid adaptive security suite information, and then performs cryptographic operation  Hybrid adaptive security decision engine\(HASDE HASM requests HASS to HASDE. Thus, HASDE receives basic security information from HASM, and then it find out an appropriate HASS level from hybrid adaptive security decision table  Figure 1. Hybrid adaptive security architecture   Moreover, a frame related support block has two kinds of functions such as frame classification and frame management. Frame classification\(FC\ module performs the classification operation of received frames from MAC layer. First, FC module receives a frame from MAC, and then checks whether the frame is secured or not. If the frame is unsecured frame, FC sends the frame to an appropriate network module according to network header information. Frame Management\(FM\ module performs the management operation of received network packets from upper network layer subsystems. First, FM module receives a network packet from an upper layer, and then checks whether the network packet is secured or not. If the network packet is unsecured, FM sends the packet to MAC layer  4  Implementation 4.1  Performance Analysis and Discussion In order to analyze the performance of HASS approach, we apply an expected overhead for calculating the size of security header of HASS framework. The expected overhead can be derived of a polynomial equation with a header size and a weighted value as usage frequency. In case of the size of security 


header, the default size is 5 byte\(frame counter 4bytes and key counter 1byte\er, if HASS uses MAC code to provide message authentication, an added header size can be 4, 8, 16byte, separately. Thus, a possible combination can be 0, 5, 9, 13, 21, and these expected header sizes can be presented as an EOS   called Expected Overhead Si ze in the equation \(1   is a coefficient as a weighted value which is the usage frequency of a security capability\(suite\mbination Through controlling weighted coefficient, we can assume the total overhead of HASS like \(2\The weighted values of the estimated overhead equation can be changed according to a kind of security policy The security policy is not focus in this paper. The applied weighted value of \(2\ is an experiential result in our experiments. Thus, the derived result can be one of the candidates for HASS based wireless sensor network system, not fixed values   5  10  15  20  45  21 13  9  5  0  7  4 05  1 3  1 35  1 0  1 0 21  05  0 13  1  0 9  15  0 5  20  0 0  45  0  2       1           4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 0 0 and W and EOS where n Calculatio Overhead Expected HASS of Value Weighted W Size Overhead Expected EOS where EOS W EOS W EOS W EOS W EOS W HASS of Overhead Expected                       From the derived equation of \(2\e can obtain total overhead is 4.7 if the HASS framework has 45%. 20 15%, 10%, 5% as a weighted value\(coefficient\f expected overhead equation The weighted value is a kind of control parameter for energy consumption and efficiency. Thus the weighted values are not consistent but variable for network and its application  Table 3.

The performance analysis is used AES and RC-5 algorithm based on a sensor node with MSP 430 In cas e of MSP 430 micro-controller, it spends 1.26nJ per cycle and it needs 26 cycle operations per byte. HASS framework has AES-based encryption system and the security overhead of 4.7bytes from the above expected overhead estimation. On the other hands, Crossbow sensor node based on TinySec architecture requires additional 5 bytes security overhead and RC-5 encryption algorithm. Table 3 shows the performance comparison among three kinds of sensor nodes such as IEEE 802.15.4 based system with no security, the proposed HASS system, and Crossbow system with TinySec. We can see that the proposed HASS scheme is better performance than crossbow system From these experiment results, the most significant factor is to decrease security header size in order to alleviate an overhead of security processing. Moreover the performance of crypto algorithms is important, too  4.2  Implementation In this Section, we introduce our own WSN sensor node platform, and the real implementation experimental results using the nodes based on the proposed HASS approach. Figure 2 shows H/W prototype of our sensor node with the proposed reliability approach based on IEEE 802.15.4. The prototype consists of chipconís CC2420 and MSP 430 component T I MS P 43 0 h a s 16bi t R I S C  architecture and 12-bit A/D, D/A converter. Radio chip is also TI CC2420 which has operating frequency of 2.4 GHz, transmit bit rate of 250 kbps, and receiver sensitivity of -95 dBm. Moreover, internal memory is 116Kb flash and 8Kb ram and the size of sensor board is 60 x 32 mm. In case of operating system, TinyOS 2.0 is ported and related S/W programs using NesC Additionally, 30pin sensor interface and 3V operating voltage\(AA battery x2\ are used   Figure 2. IEEE 802.15.4-based Sensor Node Prototype  In order to present an example of WSN application using the sensor nodes with HASS framework, we deployed wireless sensor network with various sensors like Figure 3. First, five kinds of sensor nodes are installed in our instituteís office. The sensor nodes have sensing modules such as sound, vibration motion, photo, and gas. There are also lots of relaying 


nodes in office for multi-hop data relaying. If an event is occurred, the collected information is transferred to sink node, and then we can confirm the event information using sensor event analysis tool on the UMPC\(Ultra Mobile PC\ In this deployment, we could confirm the usability of the proposed HASS framework that reflect network and data features of the office surveillance application through this practical demonstration   Figure 3. WSN Demonstration with HASS framework  5  Conclusion  Energy consumption has known as the most significant limitation in wireless sensor network. On the other hand, increasing of various sensor network applications is requesting security features of higher level more and more. However, it is not easy problem to support both limited energy resource and providing security capability in wireless sensor network environment. Thus, in this paper, we have designed a hybrid adaptive security suite framework to solve the trade-off issue between energy and security using applying a flexible security suite to packets dynamically. Base on this idea, we evaluated the proposed approach and compared its performance to IEEE 802.15.4 security scheme and TinySec-based Crossbow product. The experimental results showed that the proposed Hybrid Adaptive Security Framework approach presented better energy efficiency. In case of energy efficiency experiment using expected security ov erhead, the hybrid adaptive security suite approach shows a slight superior to TinySec-based Crossbow\(4.8% versus 5.2 However, the small difference is mainly dependent to the result value of the expected overhead calculation Thus, energy consumption efficiency can be improved through controlling weighted security header ratio and it can be a kind of near future work Moreover, we plan to study on more efficient method to find optimized characteristics of wireless sensor network in order to reduce energy consumption and enhance security capability  6  Reference   In st i t u t e o f E l ect ri cal an d  E l ect ro n i cs E n gi n eers In c   IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2003, ìWireless Medium Access Control MAC\d Physical Layer \(PHY\ecifications for Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks \(LR-WPANs\w York, IEEE Press.

special contributions of these users and should be harvested for important bits of information. For instance, the information dissemination category has tips and work-arounds to successfully perform a particular task using the software. This is an important category where the software does not do this work, but the users have appropriated a smart use of it, to get their work done. Also, the tips and work-arounds are suggested are the points of user initiated innovation and must be utilized for that. Just as a starting point in the forums, these tips / work around can be presented as sticky threads \(which remain at the top of the list of threads in the forum, rather than moving down the list as new threads are created\This would preserve them for re-use and avoid their loss in all the other messages Also, these information dissemination messages should be made more visible than the average question and answers because they will potentially serve a larger number of users We found the potential of explicit and implicit feedback to the product developers. The category of Feature Request contains messages where users are specifically asking the developers to add certain functionality that will be useful in getting their work done. In our study, we did not explore evidence of this feedback to the developers being utilized but we strongly believe that these messages should have a way to make it to the developers. These can just be forwarded to another list or can be collected and send to the developers of the software as direct feedback from the users. We also found instances of indirect feedback to developers through the information seeking messages categorized as Does this exists  These messages once again, are looking for a feature that the users think should be in the software and would be useful but are not aware of its presence. This means one of two things; either that this feature is not present and hence this can also be used as a feature request message or that the feature is present but is not visible to the user and hence the usability of this feature needs to be re-evaluated. In both the types of feedback to the developers, once a threshold of messages is reached, the feature should move to the priority list of developers, thereby providing direct feedback to the developers  4.2. Types of Questions  Questions posed in online discussion forums can simply be divided into two broad categories: those asked by the help-seekers and those asked by the helpgivers. Subsequent analysis gave a number of subcategories. The help-seekers posted questions about how to get things done, why am I stuck, what is wrong etc. while the help-givers asked about background information of the help seeker s computer, the task that they were doing, the results of following the steps that they have taken, and so forth. Table 4 and Table 5 show the categories that emerged after in-depth coding Both questions and responses arise from non-unique coding a posting can contain multiple questions responses or both  Table 4.

Types of Response  A response typology was developed to categorize the different types of responses posted on these online discussion forums as illustrated in Table 6. The ten types of responses are as follows 1  Instructional  This category represents the responses that were usually given by help-givers and consisted of explicit, detailed, step-by-step instructions, code for achieving the solution  2  Explanatory These are the messages that were written either by help-givers or by help-seekers. When help-givers write explanatory messages, they give details of the software processes; explain functionality and logic of the software activities. Help-seekers are explaining what they have done on their own before reaching the bottleneck 3  Informational  This category represents the messages that are providing basic information about the software or the forums, these also can come from either the help-seekers or the help-givers. When helpgivers write informational messages they are telling from their experience in the forums  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


4  Re-directional  This is a very important category of responses. It consists of the messages, usually from help-givers, directing help seekers to solutions. For example, the help giver will point the help seeker to a previous thread / wiki / manual / documentation with solution to their problems 5  Verificational The responses that fall in this category are me too responses. These are responses from help-seekers and might seem like noise and not useful, but, as we found out in our data, these me too  responses serve two purposes. Firstly, they verify the initial help-seekers problem by saying that they are having the same problem. Secondly, and more importantly, they provide contextual information about the problem to the help-givers and help in formulating the complete problem 6  Innovative  These are the responses where users post some innovative solutions like work-around or tips. These are sometimes solutions and sometimes unsolicited responses with the hope of common good The users post a trick or special appropriation of the software Table 5. Types of Questions by Help-seekers Type of Questions Examples 1 Any suggestions ideas after the last two updates, I get a regular "Server not found screen.

7  Speculative These are the messages where the help giver is not sure if what h/she is proposing is a solution or not but they speculate and ask the help seeker to try something and report back to the forum 8  Negational These are the responses that are not adding anything to the conversation and posted by help-givers who volunteer and will say that they don t know how to solve this problem 9  Solicitational  The messages in this category are very common as follow-up questions by the helpgivers. In these messages the help giver is the details about the software, operating system, work history etc. These questions form a very large part of the iterative process of problem solving and automating these iterations can lead to much quicker solution 10  Social  These messages usually do not contribute to the process of problem solving but are expressions of, or comments on, etiquette. These messages include messages like thank you  you are welcome  Search the forum before asking etc  Table 6. Types of responses Types of Responses Instructional A better way to do this Code Small direct solution Step by step instructions Do this, this is the solution Informational Fixed in next version Not a problem for this product Re-directional Link to external resources Link to Internal Resources Link to Previous Thread Link to Wiki Read FAQ / Read the manual Innovative No can t do that but workaround This is what works for me Tips Speculation Suggestion for a solution Try this Verificational Me Too Explanatory Detailed Explanation Social Don t waste our time Negational I don t know Solicitation Background Info questions Clarification questions Give a screenshot History Details Repeat the question  5. Discussion It can be seen that although entirely volunteerbased, OSS technical help is on the whole remarkably timely and effective. However, this voluntary nature means that there is a substantial variance in both speed and effectiveness; posting a request is no guarantee that anyone will bother to reply, or reply in a reasonable time. Responsiveness shows a long tail effect. Also, there is inevitably a selection effect we are only seeing those people who go to the forums and ask for help. We don t see those who are unable unwilling or intimidated to ask for help in such a public way. We also don t see those who manage to get help from other sources on the website \(various documentation including help files, tutorials, blogs or wikis\ or from other less official sources. We also do not see those who get the information they need from simply reading pre-existing threads. However, we believe this is a useful start to understanding online technical help in general and OSS technical help in particular. Although a typical help-giving interaction might consist of a request, a reply containing a set of contextual questions to help clarify the problem, some problem-solving, one or more proposed solutions and comments on their efficacy, there are a number of other variant interactions. In other work we look at issues of media use and the use of external resources to support the help-giving, problem-solving and clarificatory processes. In this paper we note the kinds of questions and responses that commonly occur Although our current focus is on understanding OSS technical support and how it can be improved, we are interesting in future work in comparing the categorizations found here with other help-giving settings. Do the categorizations also apply in those other contexts The open source technical help forums obviously have similarities with open source technical development: open to all to participate, reliant on volunteers choosing to work on a particular need having emergent leadership arising in the form of a few core members who make disproportionately large contributions and a long tail of participants with smaller contributions. However, there are also differences. The barriers to participation are lower. It is typically easier to offer help on how to use an application than to recode that application. Some help particularly to novice users\ relatively easy to provide and does not require specialist knowledge Some help is simply a matter of pointing to preexisting resources that address the problem raised Other is a matter of explaining or re-contextualizing existing help so that the recipient can understand what they need to do Other requests are much more difficult, rather like the stumpers that skilled reference librarians relish as Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


worthy problem-solving challenges to their expertise s o r a com p aris on o f techn i cal h e lp w i t h th e  reference interview Online technical help predates the current growth of open-source software, and can be seen in various Usenet news forums for a range of technical areas aimed at both novices and expert users. Over time an etiquette of question asking and responding has evolved and continues to evolve. For example it is considered good manners to try and search for relevant help before asking, and to indicate in one s request that one has indeed done so Modern bulletin board functionalities and interfaces have been adopted by technical help websites to good effect. However it is worth considering how helpgiving could be made more effective. Many possible changes are non-technical, involving recruiting more help-givers and providing better education and orientation to both help-seekers and help-givers. But there are also technological interventions that might help, either by lowering the costs and effort of helpseeking or help-giving, improving their effectiveness supporting the development, refinement and re-use of help resources, or by feeding user-centered results back into the OSS development process. Here we list some examples, inspired by our analyses   Semi\Automation of contextual information to be supplied by the help-seeker. A good help request needs to provide information such as the hardware and operating system being used, the version of the application, what the user is trying to do, what has been tried \(and presumably failed\d which help resources have been completed. Much of this information could be obtained automatically if it was an option built into the application, and the rest might be supported, \(and the user encouraged to provide it by a suitably structured form   Support for refactoring a help request into a FAQ or online help documentation wiki   System support for volunteer updating of help taking a help explanation and updating it for a new version of the software   Lightweight measures of re-use. We know people are consulting 'dead' threads - would a simple 'this worked for me too' button get used The observations made in this study lay a path for improvement by highlighting the multiple uses that can be made of these interactions. Here we present some of the uses that we believe have strong potential of improving the current process. Help requests can be used as feedback for the redesign of both the system and its help. Some help requests are pointers to usability problems with the software and hence can be highlighted for analysis by the OSS User Interface team. They will have documented evidence of the users having problems with the application and can provide some quick semi-fixes to the interface and eventually produce longer more complex full solutions or design to obliterate the problem Creating a better visualization of the entire discussion database will facilitate the assessment of patterns of help requests, such as which parts of the system seem to cause disproportionate confusion. It could also allow organizational improvement through supporting queries such as   Show me all threads that point to a particular piece of documentation \(help, FAQ, etc   Bundling of threads: show all threads with a similar topic. Are they repeats? Can they be connected rejoined, or better tagged to avoid duplication and aid re-use  6. Future Work and Conclusion  Future work in this area could include triangulating these results with studies using alternative methods such as interviewing forum participan t h ese  categories are found to be significant then there maybe implications for design of support environments and their integration with both formal and static help sources \(such as manuals\ and with the software application itself. A wider issue is whether the findings are transferable to proprietary software or beyond software to physical products and services Extending the work in this way would help determine whether the nature of the OSS software and its community have an identifiable influence on the pattern of help-related activities We would also like to compare this process with other settings including other online technical help, inhouse technical forums, non technical help, technical discussions not purely help related and tech forums in Usenet, around mashups, etc. West & O Mahony compare autonomous and sponsored OSS communities in terms of software production, governance and intellectual property; it would be interesting to explore whether this dimension also influences user-support activities. A further extension could be to consider product-related forums to investigate how the nature of the topic \(software, physical product or service influences user contributions e w ill a l so be  conducting analysis on this data with respect to information re-use and tools to aid the process of reuse. We view this paper as an exploratory precursor to more detailed qualitative studies. In particular our methodology complements other approaches such as those based on questionnaire surveys terv ie w s   a m i n e d f r o m p u bl i c  m a i l i n g l i s t s 20]. We suggest that these methods on their own are unlikely to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


be sufficient for exploring in detail how online help actually unfolds In this paper we present some results about the content of online discussion support forums from a larger study. We have shown that the forums do not just contain straightforward help requests. We have presented a detailed list of categories of questions that are asked. We highlight the how of the process of problem solving by showing the different types of responses for problem questions and present a typology for these responses. This paper presents multiple pragmatic approaches to improve the process of collaborative problem solving in open source software by some quick fixes and by highlighting multiple points of inquiry for research  7.

 11 This model specifies that covariates act multiplicatively on time t r than on the hazar d function.  That is, we assume a baseline hazard function to exist and that the effects of the covariates are to alter the rate at which an individual proceeds along the time axis.  In other words, the covariates z accelerates or decelerates the time to failure Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002, Lawless 2003  It should be pointed out that the distribution-based regression models for exponential and Weibull distributions in the previous section are th e special cases of both PHM and AFT.  This correspondence is not necessarily true for models based on other distribu tions. Indeed, two-parameter Weibull distribution has the uniq ue property that it is closed under both multiplication of fa ilure time and multiplication of the hazard function by an arbitrary nonzero constant Lawless 2003, Kalbfleisch & Prentice 2002, Klein Moeschberger 2003  2.6. Counting Process and Survival Analysis   In the previous sections, we introduced censoring and survival analysis models th at can handle the censored information; however, we did not discuss how the censored information is processed.  Accommodating and maximally utilizing the partial information from the censored observations is the most challenging and also the most rewarding task in survival anal ysis.  This also establishes survival analysis as a unique fiel d in mathematical statistics Early statistical inferences for censored data in survival analysis were dependent on asymptotic likelihood theory Severini 2000\ Cox \(1972, 1975\ proposed partial likelihood as an extension to classical maximum likelihood estimation in the context of hi s proportional hazards model as a major contribution. Asymptotic likelihood has been and still is the dominant theory for developing survival analysis inference and hypothesis testing methods \(Klein and Moeschberger 2003, Severini 2000\. There are many monographs and textbooks of survival analysis containing sufficient details for applying survival analysis \(Cox and Oakes 1984, Kalbfleisch and Prentice 1980, 2002, Lawless 1982, 2003, Klein and Moeschberger, 2003\. A problem with traditional asymptotic lik elihood theory is that the resulting procedures can become very complicated when handling more complex censoring mechanisms \(Klein Moeschberger 2003\. A more elegant but requiring rigorous measure-theoretic probability theo ry is the approach with counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theorems.  Indeed, this approach was used by Aalen 1975\ to set the rigorous mathematical foundation for survival analysis, and later further developed and summarized by Fleming and Harrington \(1991\, Andersen et al. \(1993\several research papers.  In reliability theory Aven and Jensen \(1999\ dem onstrated such an approach by developing a general failure model, which we briefly introduced in Section 1.2. However, the counting process and Martingale approach require measure theoretic treatments of probability and st ochastic processes, which is often not used in engineering or applied statistics.  A detailed introduction of the topic is obviously beyond the scope of this paper, and we only present a brief sketch of the most important concepts involved.  Readers are referred to the excellent monographs by Andersen et al. \(1993 Fleming and Harrington \(1991\ Aven and Jensen \(1999\ for comprehensive details, and Kal bfleisch and Prentice \(2002 Klein and Moeschberger \(2003\, Lawless \(2003\ for more applicationñoriented treatments The following discussion on this topic is drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  A counting stochastic process N  t  t 0 possesses the properties that N  0 ro and N  t   with probability one. The sample paths of N  t ht continuous and piecewise constant with jumps of size 1  step function In a right-censored sample, \(we assume only right censoring in this section N i  t  I  T i t  i   which keep the value 0 until individual i fails and then jump to 1  are counting processes. The accumulation of N i  t ocess     1 t N t N n i i is again a counting process, which counts the number of failures in the sample at or before time t   The counting process keeps track of the information on the occurrences of events,   for instance, the history information such as which individual was censored prior to time t and which individual died at or prior to time t as well as the covariates information This accumulated history information of the counting process at time t is termed filtration at time t denoted by F t For a given problem F t  rests on the observer of the counting process.  Thus, two observers with different recordings at different times will get different filtrations.  This is what Aven and Jensen 1999\ referred to as different information levels or the amount of actual available information about the state of a system may vary  If the failure times X i and censoring times C i  are independent,  then the probability of an event occurs at time t given the history just prior to t  F t\n be expressed as  t T if dt t h t C t X dt t C dt t X t P F dt t T t P i i i i i i r t i i r          1     t T if F dt t T t P i t i i r 0   1    51  Let dN  t be the change in the process N  t over a short time interval    t t t Ignoring the neglig ible chance of ties 1   t dN if a failure occurred and 0   t dN otherwise  Let Y  t denote the number of individuals with an observation time T i t Then the conditional expectation of dN  t   dt t h t Y F dt t C dt t X t with ns observatio of number E F t dN E t i i i t              52 


 12 The process  t  Y  t  h  t  is called the intensity process  of the counting process.  It is a stochastic process that is determined by the information contained in the history process F t via Y  t  Y  t  records the number of individuals experiencing the risk at a given time t   As it will become clear that   t is equivalent to the failure rate or hazard function in tr aditional reliability theory, but here it is treated as a stochastic process, the most general form one can assume for it. It is this generalization that encapsulates the power that counting stochastic process approach can offer to survival analysis  Let the cumulative intensity process H  t be defined as   t t ds s t H 0 0      53  It has the property that  E  N  t  F t  E  H  t  F t  H  t   54  This implies that filtration F t, is known, the value of Y  t  fixed and H  t es deterministic H  t is equivalent to the cumulative hazards in tr aditional reliability theory  A stochastic process with the property that its expectation at time t given history at time s < t is equal to its value at s is called a martingale That is M  t martingale if           t s s M F t M E s  55  It can be verified that the stochastic process         t H t N t M 56  is a martingale, and it is called the counting process martingale The increments of the counting process martingale have an expected value of zero, given its filtration F t That is  0      t F t dM E 57 The first part of the counting process martingale [Equation 56  N  t non-decreasing step function.  The second part H  t smooth process which is predictable in that its value at time t is fixed just prior to time t It is known as the compensator  of the counting process and is a random function. Therefore, the martingale can be considered as mean-zero noise and that is obtainable when one subtracts the smoothly varying compensator from the counting process  Another key component in the counting process and martingale theory for survival analysis is the notion of the predictable variation process of M  t oted by    t M It is defined as the compensator of process   2 t M  The term predictable variation process comes from the property that, for a martingale M  t it can be verified that the conditional variance of the increments of M  t  dM  t  h e inc r em ents of   t M That is          t M d F t dM Var t  58  To obtain      t F t dM Var  one needs the random variable N  t  variable with probability   t of having a jump of size 1 at time t The variance of N  t   t  1 t   since it follows b i nom ial distribution    Ignoring the ties in the censored data 2  t  is close to zero and Var  dM  t  F t    t  Y  t  h  t   This implies that the counting process N  t on the filtration F t behaves like a Poisson process with rate  t    Why do we need to convert the previous very intuitive concepts in survival analysis in to more abstract martingales The key is that many of the sta tistics in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of the basic martingales described above The stochastic integral equations are mathematically well structured and some standard mathematical techniques for studying them can be adopted  Here, let   t K be a predictable  process An example of a predictable process is the process   t Y Over the interval 0 to t the stochastic integral of su ch a process, with respect to a martingale, is denoted by     0 u dM u K t It turns out that such stochastic integrals them selves are martingales as a function of t and their predictable variation process can be found from the predictable variation process of the original martingale by           0 2 0 u M d u K u dM u K t t 59 The above discussion was drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003 also provide examples of how the above process is applied. In the following, we briefly introduce one of their exampl es ó the derivation of the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard estimator  First, the model is formulated as           t dM dt t h t Y t dN  60  If   t Y is non-zero, then               t Y t dM t d t h t Y t dN 61  Let   t I be the indicator of whether   t Y  is positive and define 0/0 = 0, then integrating both sides of above \(61 One get 


 13                     0 0 0 u dM u Y u I u d u h u I u dN u Y u I t t t 62  The left side integral is the Nelson-Aalen estimator of H t           0  u dN u Y u I t H t 63  The second integral on the right side           0 u dM u Y u I t W t 64  is the stochastic integral of the predictable process      u Y u I with respect to a martingale, and hence is also a martingale  The first integral on the right side is a random quantity    t H   t du u h u I t H 0        65  For right-censored data it is equal to   t H  in the data range, if the stochastic uncertainty in the   t W is negligible Therefore, the statistic    t H is a nonparametric estimator of the random quantity    t H   We would like to mention one more advantage of the new approach, that is, the martingale central limit theorem.  The central limit theorem of martingales ensures certain convergence property and allows the derivations of confidence intervals for many st atistics.  In summary, most of the statistics developed with asymptotic likelihood theory in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of some martingale.  The large sample properties of the statistics can be found by using the predictable variation process and martingale central limit theorem \(Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  2.7. Bayesian Survival Analysis  Like many other fields of statistics, survival analysis has also witnessed the rapid expansion of the Bayesian paradigm.  The introduction of the full-scale Bayesian paradigm is relative recent and occurred in the last decade however, the "invasion" has been thorough.  Until the recent publication of a monograph by Ibrahim, Chen and Sinhaet 2005\val anal ysis has been either missing or occupy at most one chapter in most survival analysis monographs and textbooks.  Ibrahim's et al. \(2005\ changed the landscape, with their comprehensive discussion of nearly every counterp arts of frequentist survival analysis from univariate to multivariate, from nonparametric, semiparametric to parametric models, from proportional to nonproportional hazards models, as well as the joint model of longitudinal and survival data.  It should be pointed out that Bayesian survival analysis has been studied for quite a while and can be traced back at least to the 1970s  A natural but fair question is what advantages the Bayesian approach can offer over the established frequentist survival analysis. Ibrahim et al 2005\entified two key advantages. First, survival models are generally very difficult to fit, due to the complex likelihood functions to accommodate censoring.  A Bayesi an approach may help by using the MCMC techniques and there is available software e.g., BUGS.  Second, the Bayesian paradigm can incorporate prior information in a natural way by using historical information, e.g., from clinical trials. The following discussion in this subsection draws from Ibrahim's et al. \(2005  The Bayesian paradigm is based on specifying a probability model for the observed data, given a vector of unknown parameters This leads to likelihood function L   D   Unlike in traditional statistics is treated as random and has a prior distribution denoted by   Inference concerning is then based on the posterior distribution which can be computed by Bayes theorem d D L D L D              66 where is the parameter space  The term    D is proportional to the likelihood    D L  which is the information from observed data, multiplied by the prior, which is quantified by   i.e          D L D 67 The denominator integral m  D s the normalizing constant of    D and often does not have an analytic closed form Therefore    D often has to be computed numerically The Gibbs sampler or other MCMC algorithms can be used to sample    D without knowing the normalizing constant m  D xist large amount of literature for solving the computational problems of m  D nd    D   Given that the general Bayesian algorithms for computing the posterior distributions should equally apply to Bayesian survival analysis, the specification or elicitation of informative prior needs much of the atte ntion.  In survival analysis with covariates such as Cox's proportional hazards model, the most popular choice of informative prior is the normal prior, and the most popular choice for noninformative is the uniform Non-informative prior is easy to use but they cannot be used in all applications, such as model selection or model comparison. Moreover, noninformative prior does not harness the real prior information. Therefore, res earch for informative prior specification is crucial for Bayesian survival analysis  


 14 Reliability estimation is influenced by the level of information available such as information on components or sub-systems. Bayesians approach is likely to provide such flexibility to accommodate various levels of information Graves and Hamada \(2005\roduced the YADAS a statistical modeling environment that implements the Bayesian hierarchical modeli ng via MCMC computation They showed the applications of YADES in reliability modeling and its flexibility in processing hierarchical information. Although this environment seems not designed with Bayesian surviv al analysis, similar package may be the direction if Bayesian survival analysis is applied to reliability modeling  2.8. Spatial Survival Analysis  To the best of our knowledge spatial survival analysis is an uncharted area, and there has been no spatial survival analysis reported with rigor ous mathematical treatment There are some applications of survival analysis to spatial data; however, they do not address the spatial process which in our opinion should be the essential aspect of any spatial survival analysis. To develop formal spatial survival analysis, one has to define the spatial process first  Recall, for survival analysis in the time domain, there is survival function   R t t T t S  Pr   68  where T is the random variable and S  t e cumulative probability that the lifetime will exceed time t In spatial domain, what is the counterpart of t One may wonder why do not we simply define the survival function in the spatial domain as   S  s  Pr S s  s R d  R > 0  69  where s is some metric for d-dimensional space R d and the space is restricted to the positive region S is the space to event measurement, e.g., the distance from some origin where we detect some point object.  The problem is that the metric itself is an attribute of space, rather than space itself Therefore, it appears to us that the basic entity for studying the space domain has to be broader than in the time domain This is probably why spatial process seems to be a more appropriate entity for studying  The following is a summary of descriptions of spatial processes and patterns, which intends to show the complexity of the issues involved.  It is not an attempt to define the similar survival function in spatial domain because we certainly unders tand the huge complexity involved. There are several monographs discussing the spatial process and patterns \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\.  The following discussion heavily draws from Cressie \(1993\ and Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  It appears that the most widely adopted definition for spatial process is proposed in Cressie \(1993\, which defines a spatial process Z  s in d-dimensions as    Z  s  s D R d  70  Here Z  s denotes the attributes we observe, which are space dependent. When d = 2 the space R 2 is a plane  The problem is how to define randomness in this process According to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005 Z  s an be thought of as located \(indexed\by spatial coordinates s  s 1  s 2  s n  the counterpart of time series Y  t  t   t 1  t 2  t n   indexed by time.  The spatial process is often called random field   To be more explicit, we denote Z  s  Z  s   to emphasize that Z is the outcome of a random experiment  A particular realization of produces a surface    s Z  Because the surface from whic h the samples are drawn is the result of the random experiment Z  s called a random function  One might ask what is a random experiment like in a spatial domain? Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\ offered an imaginary example briefly described below.  Imagine pouring sand from a bucket on to a desktop surface, and one is interested in measuring the depth of the poured sand at various locations, denoted as Z  s The sand distributes on the surface according to the laws of physics.  With enough resources and patience, one can develop a deterministic model to predict exactly how the sand grains are distributed on the desktop surface.  This is the same argument used to determine the head-tail coin flipping experiment, which is well accepted in statistical scie nce. The probabilistic coinflip model is more parsimonious than the deterministic model that rests on the exact \(perfect\but hardly feasible representation of a coin's physics. Similarly deterministically modeling the placement of sand grains is equally daunting.  However, th e issue here is not placement of sand as a random event, as Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\phasized.  The issue is that the sand was poured only once regardless how many locations one measures the depth of the sand.  With that setting, the challenge is how do we define and compute the expectation of the random function Z  s Would E  Z  s   s  make sense  Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\further raised the questions: \(1\to what distribution is the expectation being computed? \(2\ if the random experiment of sand pouring can only be counted once, ho w can the expectation be the long-term average  According to the definition of expectation in traditional statistics, one should repeat the process of sand pouring many times and consider the probability distributions of all surfaces generated from the repetitions to compute the expectation of Z  s is complication is much more serious 


 15 than what we may often reali ze. Especially, in practice many spatial data is obtained from one time space sample only. There is not any independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  How is the enormous complexity in spatial statistics currently dealt with? The most commonly used simplification, which has also been vigorously criticized, is the stationarity assumption.  Opponents claim that stationarity often leads to erroneous inferences and conclusions.  Proponents counte r-argue that little progress can be made in the study of non-stationary process, without a good understanding of the stationary issues Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  The strict stationarity is a random field whose spatial distribution is invariant under translation of the coordination.  In other word s, the process repeats itself throughout its domain \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005 There is also a second-order or weak\ of a random field  For random fields in the spatial domain, the model of Equation \(70  Z  s  s D R d  is still too general to allow statistical inference.  It can be decomposed into several sub-processes \(Cressie 1993             s s s W s s Z  D s  71  where  s  E  Z  is a deterministic mean structure called large-scale variation W  s is the zero-mean intrinsically stationary process, \(with second order derivative\nd it is called smooth small-scale variation   s is the zero-mean stationary process independent of W  s and is called microscale variation  s  is zero-mean white noise also called measurement error. This decomposition is not unique and is largely operational in nature \(Cressie 1993\he main task of a spatial algorithm is to determine the allocations of the large, small, and microscale components However, the form of the above equation is fixed Cressie 1993\, implying that it is not appropriate to sub-divide one or more of the items. Therefore, the key issue here is to obtain the deterministic  s  but in practice, especially with limited data, it is usually very difficult to get a unique  s   Alternative to the spatial domain decomposition approach the frequency domain methods or spectral analysis used in time series analysis can also be used in spatial statistics Again, one may refer to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  So, what are the imp lications of the general discussion on spatial process above to spatial survival analysis?  One point is clear, Equation \(69 S  s  Pr S s   s R d is simply too naive to be meaningful.  There seem, at least, four fundamental challenges when trying to develop survival analysis in space domain. \(1\ process is often multidimensional, while time pr ocess can always be treated as uni-dimensional in the sense that it can be represented as  Z  t  t R 1  The multidimensionality certainly introduces additional complications, but that is still not the only complication, perhaps not even the most significant 2\One of the fundamental complications is the frequent lack of independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process, as pointed out by Cressie \(1993\\(3\e superposition of \(1 and \(2\brings up even more complexity, since coordinates  s of each replication are a set of stochastic spatial process rather than a set of random variables. \(4\n if the modeling of the spatial process is separable from the time process, it is doubtful how useful the resulting model will be.  In time process modeling, if a population lives in a homogenous environment, the space can be condensed as a single point.  However, the freezing of time seems to leave out too much information, at least for survival analysis Since the traditional survival analysis is essentially a time process, therefore, it should be expanded to incorporate spatial coordinates into original survival function.  For example, when integrating space and time, one gets a spacetime process, such as          R t R D s t s Z d   where s is the spatial index \(coordinate t is time.  We may define the spatial-temporal survival function as   S  s  t  Pr T t  s D  72  where D is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidean space That is, the spatial-temporal survival function represents the cumulative probability that an individual will survive up to time T within hyperspace D which is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidian space.  One may define different scales for D or even divide D into a number of unit hyperspaces of measurement 1 unit  2.9. Survival Analysis and Artificial Neural Network   In the discussion on artificial neuron networks \(ANN Robert & Casella \(2004\noted, "Baring the biological vocabulary and the idealistic connection with actual neurons, the theory of neuron networks covers: \(1\odeling nonlinear relations between explanatory and dependent explained\ariables; \(2\mation of the parameters of these models based on a \(training\ sample."  Although Robert & Casella \(2004\ did not mentioned survival analysis, their notion indeed strike us in that the two points are also the essence of Cox s \(1972\roportional Hazards model  We argue that the dissimilarity might be superficial.  One of the most obvious differences is that ANN usually avoids probabilistic modeling, however, the ANN models can be analyzed and estimated from a statistical point of view, as demonstrated by Neal \(1999\, Ripley \(1994\, \(1996 Robert & Casella \(2004\What is more interesting is that the most hailed feature of ANN, i.e., the identifiability of model structure, if one review carefully, is very similar to the work done in survival anal ysis for the structure of the 


 16 Cox proportional hazards model. The multilayer ANN model, also known as back-propagation ANN model, is again very similar to the stratified proportional hazards model  There are at least two advantages of survival analysis over the ANN.  \(1\val analysis has a rigorous mathematical foundation. Counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theory form the survival analysis models as stochastic integral s, which provide insight for analytic solutions. \(2\ ANN, simulation is usually necessary \(Robert & Casella \(2004\which is not the case in survival analysis  Our conjecture may explain a very interesting phenomenon Several studies have tried to integrate ANN with survival analysis.  As reviewed in the next section, few of the integrated survival analysis and ANN made significant difference in terms of model fittings, compared with the native survival analysis alone The indifference shows that both approaches do not complement each other.  If they are essentially different, the inte grated approach should produce some results that are signifi cantly different from the pure survival analysis alone, either positively or negatively Again, we emphasize that our discussion is still a pure conjecture at this stage   3   B RIEF C ASE R EVIEW OF S URVIVAL A NALYSIS A PPLICATIONS     3.1. Applications Found in IEEE Digital Library  In this section, we briefly review the papers found in the IEEE digital library w ith the keyword of survival analysis  search. The online search was conducted in the July of 2007, and we found about 40 papers in total. There were a few biomedical studies among the 40 survival-analysis papers published in IEEE publications. These are largely standard biomedical applications and we do not discuss these papers, for obvious reasons  Mazzuchi et al. \(1989\m ed to be the first to actively  advocate the use of Cox's \(1 972\ proportional hazards model \(PHM\in engineering re liability.  They quoted Cox's 1972\ original words industrial reliability studies and medical studies to show Cox's original motivation Mazzuchi et al \(1989 while this model had a significant impact on the biom edical field, it has received little attention in the reliability literature Nearly two decades after the introducti on paper of Mazzuchi et al 1989\ears that little significant changes have occurred in computer science and IEEE related engineering fields with regard to the proportional hazards models and survival analysis as a whole  Stillman et al. \(1995\used survival analysis to analyze the data for component maintenance and replacement programs Reineke et al. \(1998 ducted a similar study for determining the optimal maintenance by simulating a series system of four components Berzuini and Larizza \(1996 integrated time-series modeling with survival analysis for medical monitoring.  Kauffman and Wang \(2002\analyzed the Internet firm su rvival data from IPO \(initial public offer to business shutdown events, with survival analysis models  Among the 40 survival analysis papers, which we obtained from online search of the IEEE digital library, significant percentage is the integration of survival analysis with artificial neural networks \(ANN In many of these studies the objective was to utilize ANN to modeling fitting or parameter estimation for survival analysis.  The following is an incomplete list of the major ANN survival analysis integration papers found in IEEE digital library, Arsene et 2006 Eleuteri et al. \(2003\oa and Wong \(2001\,  Mani et al 1999\ The parameter estimation in survival analysis is particular complex due to the requirements for processing censored observations. Therefore, approach such as ANN and Bayesian statistics may be helpful to deal with the complexity. Indeed, Bayesian survival analysis has been expanded significantly in recent years \(Ibrahim, et al. 2005  We expect that evolutionary computing will be applied to survival analysis, in similar way to ANN and Bayesian approaches  With regard to the application of ANN to survival analysis we suggest three cautions: \(1\he integrated approach should preserve the capability to process censoring otherwise, survival analysis loses its most significant advantage. \(2\ Caution should be taken when the integrated approach changes model struct ure because most survival analysis models, such as Cox's proportional hazards models and accelerated failure time models, are already complex nonlinear models with built-in failure mechanisms.  The model over-fitting may cause model identifiability  problems, which could be very subtle and hard to resolve 3\he integrated approach does not produce significant improvement in terms of model fitting or other measurements, which seemed to be the case in majority of the ANN approach to survival analysis, then the extra complication should certainly be avoided. Even if there is improvement, one should still take caution with the censor handling and model identifiability issues previously mentioned in \(1\ and \(2  3.2. Selected Papers Found in MMR-2004  In the following, we briefly review a few survival analysis related studies presented in a recent International Conference on Mathematical Methods in Reliability, MMR 2004 \(Wilson et al. 2005  Pena and Slate \(2005\ddressed the dynamic reliability Both reliability and survival times are more realistically described with dynamic models. Dynamic models generally refer to the models that incorporate the impact of actions or interventions as well as thei r accumulative history, which 


 17 can be monitored \(Pena and Slate 2005\he complexity is obviously beyond simple regression models, since the dependence can play a crucial ro le. For example, in a loadsharing network system, failure of a node will increase the loads of other nodes and influences their failures  Duchesne \(2005\uggested incorporating usage accumulation information into the regression models in survival analysis.  To simplify the model building Duchesne \(2005\umes that the usage can be represented with a single time-dependent covariate.  Besides reviewing the hazard-based regression models, which are common in survival analysis, Duchesne 2005\viewed three classes of less commonly used regression models: models based on transfer functionals, models based on internal wear and the so-called collapsible models. The significance of these regression models is that they expand reliability modeling to two dimensions. One dimension is the calendar time and the other is the usage accumulation.  Jin \(2005\ reviewed the recent development in statisti cal inference for accelerated failure time \(AFT\odel and the linear transformation models that include Cox proportional hazards model and proportional odds models as special cases. Two approaches rank-based approach and l east-squares approach were reviewed in Jin \(2005\. Osbo rn \(2005\d a case study of utilizing the remote diagnostic data from embedded sensors to predict system aging or degradation.  This example should indicate the potential of survival analysis and competing risks analysis in the prognostic and health management PHM\ since the problem Osborn \(2005 addressed is very similar to PHM. The uses of embedded sensors to monitor the health of complex systems, such as power plants, automobile, medical equipment, and aircraft engine, are common. The main uses for these sensor data are real time assessment of th e system health and detection of the problems that need immediate attention.  Of interest is the utilization of those remote diagnostic data, in combination with historical reliability data, for modeling the system aging or degradation. The biggest challenge with this task is the proper transformation of wear  time The wear is not only influenced by internal \(temperature, oil pressures etc\xternal covariates ambient temperature, air pressure, etc\, but also different each time   4  S UMMARY AND P ERSPECTIVE   4.1. Summary  Despite the common foundation with traditional reliability theory, such as the same probability definitions for survival function  S  t  and reliability  R  t  i.e  S  t  R  t well as the hazards function the exact same term and definition are used in both fields\rvival analysis has not achieved similar success in the field of reliability as in biomedicine The applications of survival analysis seem still largely limited to the domain of biomedicine.  Even in the sister fields of biomedicine such as biology and ecology, few applications have been conducted \(Ma 1997, Ma and Bechinski 2008\ the engin eering fields, the Meeker and Escobar \(1998\ monograph, as well as the Klein and Goel 1992\ to be the most comprehensive treatments  In Section 2, we reviewed the essential concepts and models of survival analysis. In Section 3, we briefly reviewed some application cases of survival analysis in engineering reliability.  In computer science, survival analysis seems to be still largely unknown.  We believe that the potential of survival analysis in computer science is much broader than network and/or software reliability alone. Before suggesting a few research topics, we no te two additional points  First, in this article, we exclusively focused on univariate survival analysis. There are two other related fields: one is competing risks analysis and the other is multivariate survival analysis The relationship between multivariate survival analysis and survival analysis is similar to that between multivariate statistical analysis and mathematical statistics.  The difference is that the extension from univariate to multivariate in survival analysis has been much more difficult than the developm ent of multivariate analysis because of \(1\rvation cens oring, and \(2\pendency which is much more complex when multivariate normal distribution does not hold in survival data.  On the other hand, the two essential differences indeed make multivariate survival analysis unique and ex tremely useful for analyzing and modeling time-to-event data. In particular, the advantages of multivariate survival analysis in addressing the dependency issue are hardly matched by any other statistical method.  We discuss competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis in separate articles \(Ma and Krings 2008a, b, & c  The second point we wish to note is: if we are asked to point out the counterpart of survival analysis model in reliability theory, we would suggest the shock or damage model.   The shock model has an even longer history than survival analysis and the simplest shock model is the Poisson process model that leads to exponential failure rate model The basic assumption of the shock model is the notion that engineered systems endure some type of wear, fatigue or damage, which leads to the failure when the strengths exceed the tolerance limits of th e system \(Nakagawa 2006 There are extensive research papers on shock models in the probability theory literature, but relatively few monographs The monograph by Nakagawa \(2006\s to be the latest The shock model is often formulated as a Renewal stochastic process or point process with Martingale theory The rigorous mathematical derivation is very similar to that of survival analysis from counting stochastic processes  which we briefly outlined in section 2.6  It is beyond the scope of the paper to compare the shock model with survival analysis; however, we would like to make the two specific comments. \(1\Shock models are essentially the stochastic process model to capture the failure mechanism based on the damage induced on the system by shocks, and the resulting statistical models are 


 18 often the traditional reliability distribution models such as exponential and Weibull failure distributions.  Survival analysis does not depend on specific shock or damage Instead, it models the failure with abstract time-to-event random variables.  Less restrictive assumptions with survival analysis might be more useful for modeling software reliability where the notions of fatigue, wear and damage apparently do not apply.  \(2\hock models do not deal with information censoring, the trademark of failure time data.  \(3\ Shock models, perhaps due to mathematical complexity, have not been applied widely in engineering reliability yet.  In contrast, the applications of survival analysis in biomedical fields are much extensive.  While there have been about a dozen monographs on survival analysis available, few books on shock models have been published.  We believe that survival analysis and shock models are complementary, a nd both are very needed for reliability analysis, with shock model more focused on failure mechanisms and the survival analysis on data analysis and modeling  4.2. Perspective   Besides traditional industrial and hardware reliability fields we suggest that the following fields may benefit from survival analysis  Software reliability Survival analysis is not based on the assumptions of wear, fatigue, or damage, as in traditional reliability theory.  This seems close to software reliability paradigm. The single biggest challenge in applying above discussed approaches to softwa re systems is the requirement for a new metric that is able to replace the survival time variable in survival analysis. This "time" counterpart needs to be capable of characterizing the "vulnerability" of software components or the system, or the distance to the next failure event. In other words, this software metric should represent the metric-to-event, similar to time-toevent random variable in survival analysis.  We suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(Li and Vitanyi 1997\n be a promising candidate. Once the metric-to-event issue is resolved, survival analysis, both univariate and multivariate survival analysis can be applied in a relative straightforward manner. We suggest that the shared frailty models are most promising because we believ e latent behavior can be captured with the shared fra ilty \(Ma and Krings 2008b  There have been a few applications of univariate survival analysis in software reliability modeling, including examples in Andersen et al.'s \(1995\ classical monograph However, our opinion is that without the fundamental shift from time-to-event to new metric-to-event, the success will be very limited. In software engineering, there is an exception to our claim, which is the field of software test modeling, where time variable may be directly used in survival analysis modeling  Modeling Survivability of Computer Networks As described in Subsection 2.3, random censoring may be used to model network survivability.  This modeling scheme is particularly suitable for wireless sensor network, because 1\ of the population nature of wireless nodes and \(2\ the limited lifetime of the wireless nodes.  Survival analysis has been advanced by the needs in biomedical and public health research where population is th e basic unit of observation As stated early, a sensor networ k is analogically similar to a biological population. Furthermore, both organisms and wireless nodes are of limited lifetimes. A very desirable advantage of survival analysis is that one can develop a unified mathematical model for both the reliability and survivability of a wireless sensor network \(Krings and Ma 2006  Prognostic and Health Management in Military Logistics PHM involves extensive modeling analysis related to reliability, life predictions, failure analysis, burnin elimination and testing, quality control modeling, etc Survival analysis may provide very promising new tools Survival analysis should be able to provide alternatives to the currently used mathematical tools such as ANN, genetic algorithms, and Fuzzy logic.  The advantage of survival analysis over the other alternatives lies in its unique capability to handle information censoring.  In PHM and other logistics management modeling, information censoring is a near universal phenomenon. Survival analysis should provide new insights and modeling solutions   5  R EFERENCES   Aalen, O.
