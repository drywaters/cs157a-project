IIT T t IS the Traffic iriformation distribution system Where Where T c is calculated travel time and Tt is true travel time recorded 1 C The error rate weighted by link length can reflect the travel time error better than error rate without weights Due to the large volume of test data we only disclose one part of result in table 1 From the table we can see the average error rate of link travel time is less than 20 By comparing with the error rate of other cities like Beijing around 15 Tokyo around 10 such result is basically acceptable for business It proves that the probe car system can run well in Shenyang city Record total driving distance when test is finished Extract calculated travel time from probe car system outputs Check congestion level and coverage on web/W AP Compare real and calculated travel time Publish test course and time to probe car system provider When car arrives one intersection do 1 Record current time 2 If the traffic light is red record waiting time 3 Start field test Choose test time and route Figure 3 Evaluation process The error rate of link travel time weighted by link length is calculated by the formula Error rate weighted t Li If the traffic light is green only do 1 When car departures do 1 Record date weather 2 Add gas fully 3 Record driving distance in trip meter and departure time Repeat when car arrives an intersection A Taxi dispatching system B Traffic information processing system E.rro:Rate XLi L L i The taxi dispatching system includes about 20000 taxies in Shenyang which are equipped with GPS units and wireless communication units GPRS frequently sending the GPS data taxi number and other data to the data base of taxi dispatching system The time interval of each taxi GPS location recording is 30 seconds to 1 minute which is depending on the settings of system In the field test we used about 10,000 taxi data as probe data for calculation of traffic information on line The traffic information processing system receives the probe car data from taxi dispatching system in real time and stores it in Data Base DB The probe car information process server picks the data from DB matches the raw GPS data onto the suitable road links in digital map estimates the trace of probe car on map calculates the average travel time on each road link judges the congestion level based on the average speed on road link and outputs the traffic information to traffic information distribution system The traffic information distribution system is actually a GIS engine platform of map provider which can read traffic information from traffic information processing system and display it on web and W AP portals In the portals user can find the real-time congestion status in real time and read current average travel time on main roads III EVALUATION AND RESULT After setting up the central system in telecommunication carrier we started the field test to evaluate the accuracy of the output of probe car system i.e travel time on roads The filed test was scheduled in one week The test car was driven on main roads in Shenyang from morning rush hour to evening rush hour The test routes and time were selected randomly each day by customer After recording the real travel time the calculated travel time from probe car system is extracted from output data and delivered to an independent third party to evaluate At the same time the traffic information of whole city was shown in the web and W AP portals to customers The congestion level and travel time were displayed and refreshed frequently The evaluation process is illustrated in figure 3 Based on the plan above we carried out the test for 5 days in one week and calculated error of travel time on test routes after collecting all test data The error rate of link travel time is calculated by the formula below Errorrate=IT c

We firstly propose an approach of SVM to establish a model secondly combine the Markov chain together to improve the accuracy, finally obtain two predicted value The results assess the feasibility of SVM and demonstrate that our method is a promising alternative for time series forecasting \(where the inventory of supply chain is a concrete time series This method possesses several attractive advantages. For one thing the non-uniform distribution and the tremendous fluctuation of the information offered by training data is taken into account With proper feature selecting, we can overlook or even eliminate the redundant information and obtain a more concise but more efficient and more straightforward model For another thing, this method also allows us to tune all the parameters automatically with optimizing algorithms Obviously, this idea is also valid for SVM in classification and for SVM in other cases. This work demonstrated the strong performance of SVM in forecasting and proposed an easy and systematic method for selecting the lags of the variables and the model parameters, which has been integrated with Markov chain, and finally achieved a novel model with high accuracy and formidable prediction ability. However, various issues such as the use of different loss functions, the properties of kernel functions and the identification of support vector points were not discussed and researched further more herein. More work is being conducted to explore these subjects, and the results will be presented in the future A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors would like to thank the referees for their most constructive comments.

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

  16  Figure 15. AIRS-AMSRE differences as a function of AIRS error estimate over one day  AIRS has an error estimate of the total water vapor value that it calculates. The diffe rences between AIRS and AMSR-E are shown as a function of this estimate in figure 15 and very little correlation is found 11  R ELEVANT W ORK  Merged A-Train Level 2 Data A merged product that preserves the relationship of observed atmospheric water properties facilitates the hydrological studies by enabling scientists to get directly at the model data without worrying about the logistics of finding, collecting, and coordinating the measured quantities from different instruments. Previously there did not exist a capability to discover and access data from the A-Train\222s multiple instruments as merged multi-parameter data sets Enabling Orchestratable Service Workflows Our distributed service-oriented approach of loosely coupled services also enable s a higher level of reusability and orchestration with other services. Increasing numbers of workflow engines are already supporting Web Services as components/operators, which can then be orchestrated together into higher-level meta/virtual services SciFlo, a Scientific Dataflow Execution Environment, is a workflow engine that already supports assembling reusable SOAP Services, native execu tables, local command-line scripts, and codes into a distributed computing flow \(a graph of operators\8 SciFlo can u tilize o u r g en eric SOAP services as part of a larger coordinated data flow The Taverna Workbench is a free software tool for designing and executing workflows. Like SciFlo, it can orchestrate SOAP-based Web Services as components within a workflow. Taverna provides a visual editor to construct and edit the sequence of services in the workflow We have found that Taverna can dynamically introspect a given WSDL and construct the workflow component interface representing it Giovanni Giovanni, an acronym for the Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Cent er, or GES DISC, Interactive Online Visualization and Analys is Infrastructure, is a webbased tool to help visualize Earth science data  It  provides a simple and intuitive way to visualize, analyze and access vast amounts of Eart h science remote sensing data without having to download the data. Similar to the services developed here, it addresses the difficulties of traditional data acquisition and analysis methods by moving the complexity to the server-side Giovanni provides multiple in terface instances based on instrument and measurement ty pes. For example, the \223ATrain Along CloudSat Track Inst ance\224 can provide plots of vertical profiles of clouds, temperature, humidity, cloud and aerosol classification across the multiple instruments of the A-Train A distinction between Givanni\222s A-Train data and the data set in this paper is that we are using a formal merged product of the A-Train. We leverage the NEWS effort that is based on error- and resolution-weighted mean of the input data sets, with associated uncertainty estimates. This provides a formal model of the collective A-Train observations rather than the collection of the individual instrument measurements Each of Giovanni\222s multiple interface instances provides a very simple and easy to use web interface. However, we recognized that sometimes scientists want more than the simple interfaces. Some scien tists may want to process Level 3 products using their own trusted code, or may want to perform variations of their own plots. With Giovanni, the individual scientist wanting more custom advanced capabilities must depend on the Giovanni development team Giovanni is based on the web portal paradigm where users visit a web page and use web tools to find and visualize data. Similar to Giovanni, our client APIs also make data acquisition more seamless. However, our services are based on the different paradigm were the power and flexibility of data analysis and processing are shifted back into the scientists own familiar computing environments. We realize that scientists generally want to perform \223exploratory computing\224 where they can sere ndipitously analyze the data using their own familiar and trusted code 


  17 Giovanni 2 was inherently synchronous where processing was bounded to a single http session. Long service running times still require the user to hold the same http session Similar to our asynchronous Web Service we discussed, the upcoming Giovanni 3 will be supporting asynchronous sessions. They will be using a RSS feed to monitor the service request. Version 3 will also be based on a servicesoriented architecture, wher e Giovanni services can be offered as a standard SOAP Web Services. This is similar to our approach, as well as SciFlo\222s services 12  C ONCLUSIONS  To achieve the science research goal of investigating longterm and global-scale trends in climate, water and energy cycle, and weather variability, we enhanced and improved on existing algorithms to work with distributed and heterogeneous data and information systems infrastructure By developing a service-oriented architecture for discovering, accessing, and mani pulating of NEWS merged A-Train data sets, we can strengthen the interconnectedness and reusability of these services across broader range of Earth science investigations The merged NEWS Level 2 data is a formal model containing the voluminous data from the AIRS, AMSR-E MLS, MODIS, and CloudSat instruments. Previously scientists wanting to perform long-term and global-scale studies encompassing simultaneous measured quantities would quickly face a data acce ss hurdle of first finding the data, then manually downloading them, and finally merging the data into a cohesive model\227before starting their analysis. Additionally the voluminous nature of the data particularly because of the MODIS data\each scientist potentially downloading the same data resulting in redundancy of reprocessing on the client sides. Our paradigm pushes more of the commonly repeated processing onto the server side. Moreover, this avoids repeated downloading of the same data among the science users. We can deliver customi zed averaged, subsetted, and summarized data of the merged A-Train observations to the scientists for them to immediately begin their analysis work We recognized that scientists also often want to perform 223exploratory computing\224 where they can freely explore the aspects of the data and run serendipitous exploration in their own familiar environment. We developed client-side distributed APIs in popular analysis environments such as Matlab, IDL, and Python. Our APIs hide the complexity of Web Services and allow the service capabilities to be embedded in the scientists own computing environments By purposely avoiding the \223web portal\224 paradigm and providing the suite of platform specific APIs in each of these language platforms, we enable the scientists to remain within their own familiar environments to select, process and download the data seamlessly into their environment for their own further analysis. Alternative methods involving web portals force the scientists to leave the environment and manually interact with the web portal to search and download the data We can examine not only long-term changes in amplitude of a single variable but also those among multiple variables Our L3Q clustering method was specifically designed to preserve information about the covariability of multiple observations, such as those from the A-Train.  Weather and climate variability is characterized by changes among atmospheric observables, but those changes have been limited by a lack of observations and analytical techniques We are not aware of any multi-parameter analyses to date The full potential of the A-Train climate record will not be realized until the multi-parameter climatology is understood. The work presented is one method of approaching this difficult problem Our service tool addresses several objectives of the NASA Earth science data community including 1\mprove interoperability to facilitate the transparent access and manipulation of heterogeneous and distributed data by science users, 2\ransition and deploy existing Earth science research analysis tools and software using a 223Service Oriented Architecture\224 \(SOA\ to enhance their reuse potential for other science domains and improve overall awareness and access of these tools by a broad community, 3\ increase users\222 ability to customize their discovery, access, deliv ery, manipulation, and preferred format of data and information 12  F UTURE W ORK  On-demand Level 3T Summaries from Level 3Q We plan to develop services for creating custom summaries of the L3Q data into more refined Level 3T summaries L3T\create their own custom Level 3 products on demand from L3Q. The custom Level 3 products are the transformation of L3Q data based on user-specific objectives such as regression and correlation analyses. The cust om production will generate not only the transformed data but also the statistical estimation of the accuracy of the summarized data based on the distribution of L3Q and the quality of L3Q Delegating the Temporal-Spatial Data Querying Currently, our processing layer utilizes existing and legacy processing code that was developed in IDL, Matlab, and C++. Though the original intent was to be able to adapt existing code and wrap as a service, this meant maintaining its original form of accessing the source data for processing Small modifications were made to enable these codes to quickly access the data based on file path and file naming schemes. However, we want to decouple the file accessibility and processing roles 


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
