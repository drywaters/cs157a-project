A Weighted Utility Framework for Mining Association Rules   M. Sulaiman Khan 1, 2 Maybin Muyeba 1 Frans Coenen 2  1 School of Computing, Liverpool Hope University, UK 2 Department of Computer Science University of Liverpool, UK khanm@hope.ac.uk  muyebam@hope.ac.uk  frans@liv.ac.uk    Abstract  Association rule mining \(ARM\entifies frequent itemsets from databases and generates association rules by assuming that all items have the same significance and frequency of occurrence in a record i.e. their weight and utility is the same \(weight=1 and utility=1\ which is not always the case. However, items are actually different in many aspects in a number of real applications such as retail marketing, nutritional pattern mining etc. These differences between items may have a strong impact on decision making in many application unlike the use of standard ARM. Our framework, Weighted Utility ARM \(WUARM considers the varied significance and different frequency values of individual items as their weights and utilitie s. Thus, weighted u tility mining focuses on identifying the itemsets with weighted utilities higher than the user specified weight ed utility threshold. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real data sets using standard ARM, weighted ARM and Weighted Utility ARM \(WUARM and present analysis of the results  1. Introduction  Data mining and knowledge discovery in databases is an interesting research area only developed in the last fifteen years. Association rule mining [1  popular data mining technique because of its wide application in marketing and retail communities as well as other more diverse fields. Researchers from the data mining community are more concerned with qualitative aspects of attributes \(e.g. significance utility\ as compared to considering only quantitative ones \(e.g. number of appearances in a database etc because qualitative properties are required in order to fully exploit the attributes present in the dataset Classical association rules mining techniques treat all items in the database equally by considering only the presence within a transaction without taking into account their significance to the user or business and also their utility as frequency of occurrences in each record. Although standard ARM algorithms are capable of identifying distinct patterns from a dataset they sometimes fail to associate user objectives and business values with the outcomes of the ARM analysis. For example, in a retail mining application frequent itemsets identified by the standard association rule mining algorithm may contribute only a small portion of the  overall company profit because high profit and luxury items normally do not frequently appear in transactions and thus do not appear in rules with high support count  values Given weighted items in table 1, we see from table 2 that the rule [jeans 000 suit, 50 be more  important than [shirt 000 suit, 75 ev en th o u g h th e  former holds a lower support. This is because those items in the first rule usually come with more profit per unit sale and jeans appear twice in transaction 2, which doubles the profit for jeans in that transaction. In contrast, standard ARM simply ignores this difference Table 1 Weighted items table ID Item Profit Weight  1Shir t 10 0.1 2 Jean 25 0.3 3 Jacket 50 0.6 4Sui t 80 0.9 Table 2 Customers transactions Tid Shirt Jean Jacket Suit 1 1 1 0 1 2 0 2 1 0 3 1 1 2 1 4 1 0 1 1  Many techniques and algorithms have been proposed for mining association rules that consider the qualitative properties of attributes in the databases However, proposed techniques mostly compromise either on quality of rules or efficiency of algorithms

The main challenge in mining weighted and utility association rules is that the anti-monotonic property [2  does not hold. Also the rules generated using these techniques are not guaranteed as high quality rules These issues give rise to a new approach for identifying correct patterns from databases considering their significance and utilities as quality constraints. To our knowledge, there seems to be no work addressing both weighted and utility mining frameworks in a hybrid fashion Weighted Utility association rule mining WUARM\ is the extension of weighted association rule mining in the sense that it considers items weights as their significance in the dataset and also deals with the frequency of occurrences of items in transactions Thus weighted utility association rule mining is concerned with both the frequency and significance of itemsets. Here weighted utility mining is helpful in identifying the most valuable and high selling items which contribute more to the companyís profits Weighted Utility of an item set depends upon two factors Transactional Utility It is the frequency of occurrences or quantity of an item in a transaction Item significance It is the value representing significance of an item \(value, profit etc\d it holds across the dataset Items weights are stored in a weighted table \(see table 1\.  Using transactional utilities and item weights we can extract weighted utility rules The paper is organized as follows: section 2 gives a background and related work, section 3 gives a problem definition, section 4 discusses the downward closure property \(DCP\d weighted utility property section 5 shows experimental evaluation and a conclusion in section 6  2. Background and related work  One major issue in association rule mining with weighted or utility settings is the invalidation of antimonotonic property of itemsets. Previous works [3, 4 5, 6 co n s id ered ite m  w e ig h t s as t h eir u tilit y  to ref l ect  their significance in the dataset. Our approach is different from all these in that we define utility differently by considering the frequency of occurrences of database attributes in a single record. The weight shows the significance of an item in a dataset e.g profit margin of an item or items under promotional offers etc. We define item weight as a weighting function to signify an item differently in different domains \(see next section, definition 2\. This way we can extract those rules that have significant weight and high utility In ob j ect ori e n t ed  m i ni ng approach i s  proposed that takes into account the items utilitiesí as the objective defined by the user to generate top-K high utility association rules, where K is the number of user specified rules. Standard DCP is not valid in the proposed model but instead a condition based weaker DCP approach is used. Also, the significance of items is not taken into account while generating the utility association rules A most recent framework for mining weighted ARs is presented in w h ere a g e n e ralis ed w e i g h t ed A R M  model is given that uses a modified Apriori approach 1 o r b i n a ry an d q u a n tita tiv e attrib u t es. T h e ap p r o ach  also has a valid DCP. But this model only considers an items significance and not their utilities. In real world applications, transactional databases hold item utilities as well but classical and weighted ARM simply ignores these  3. Problem definition  In this section, a formal description of the weighted utility mining problem is given and related concepts are described Definition 1 \(Weighted Utility Mining Let the input data D have transactions       3 2 1 n t t t t T   with a set of items         3 2 1 I i i i i I  and a set of positive real number weights        2 1 I w w w W   associated with each item in I  Each th i transaction i t is some subset of I and a weight w is attached to each item j i Thus each item j i will have associated with it a weight from the set W i.e. a pair    w i is called a weighted item where I i  and W w  Weight for the th j item in the  th i transaction is given by    j i i w t with u as the utility \(frequency of occurrence\f an item in a transaction from a set U and represented with non negative integers. Weighted Utility mining is thus a triple  U W I    Definition 2 Item Weight  IW is a non-negative real value   j i w given to each item j i ranging in   w i t h s o m e de g r ee of i m portan ce, s u ch t h at    j i w    j i W where W is a weighting function, a function relating specific values in a domain to user preferences. The weight reflects the significance of an item that is independent of transactions

Definition 3 Weight Table is a two dimensional table    W I WT over a collection of items I where W is the set of positive real numbers   j i w given to each item I i   Definition 4 Item Utility of an item j i in a transaction q t is denoted as    u i t j q Item utility reflects the frequency of an item in a transaction and is transaction dependent Definition 5 Item Weighted Utility IWU is the integrated weight w and utility u value of an item j i in a transaction i t denoted by     u i w t j i  Definition 6 Transaction Weighted Utility  TWU is the aggregated weighted utilities of all the items present in a single transaction. Transaction weighed utility can be calculated as              1 i t j j i i t u i w t t twu i     Definition 6 Weighted Utility Support  wus of an itemset X Y is the fraction of transaction weighted utilities that contain both X and Y relative to the transactional weighted utility of all transactions. It can be formulated as      1   1       T i i S i i t twu t twu XY wus  where     S Y X T S S S       By this means, weighted utility support is modeled to measure the actual contribution of an itemset in the dataset in weighted utility association rule mining scenario  4. Downward Closure Property \(DCP  In classical ARM algorithm, it is assumed that if the itemset is large, then all its subsets should be large, a principle called downward closure property \(DCP anti-monotonic property of itemsets. For example, in standard ARM using DCP, it states that if AB and BC are not frequent, then ABC and BCD cannot be frequent, consequently their supersets are of no value as they will contain non-frequent itemsets. This helps the algorithm to generate large itemsets of increasing size by adding items to itemsets that are already large In the weighted utility framework where each item is given a weight with several occurrences, the DCP does not hold in a straightforward manner. Because of the weighted support, an itemset may be large even though some of its subsets are not large and we illustrate this in table 5 In table 5, all frequent itemsets are generated using 30% support threshold. In column two \(i.e. Standard ARM\mset {ACD} and {BDE} are frequent with support 30% and all of their subsets {AC}, {AD CD} and {BD}, {BE}, {DE} respectively are frequent as well. But in column 3 with weighted settings, itemsets {AC} and {BE} are no longer frequent and thus violate the DCP  4.1. Weighted Utility anti-monotonic property  We argue that the DCP with weighted utility framework can be validated. We prove this by showing that if an itemset is not frequent, then its superset cannot be frequent and is always true \(see table 1 column 4, Weighted Utility ARM, only the itemsets are frequent with frequent subsets We also briefly prove that the monotonic property of itemsets is always valid in the proposed framework and is stated using the lemma as follows  Lemma If an itemset is not frequent them its superset cannot be frequent and     sueprset wus subset wus  is always true  Proof Given an itemset X not frequent i.e wus X wus min_    For any itemset Y X where Y   i.e. superset of X if a transaction t has all the items in Y, i.e t Y  then that transaction must also have all the items in X, i.e t X  We use tx to denote a set of transactions each of which has all the items in X, i.e       t X tx t T tx tx      Similarly we have       t Y ty t T ty ty      Since Y X   we have ty tx  Therefore     ty wus tx wus  According to the definition of weighted utility support, the denominator stays the same, therefore we have     Y wus X wus   Because wus X wus min_    we get wus Y wus min_    this then proves that Y is not frequent if its subset is not frequent

 4.2. Simulated Example  We demonstrate an example to simulate the process of weighted utility mining framework with valid DCP Table 3 is the weighted items table with weights associated with each item according to some profit margin  Table 3 Weighted items table Items i Profit Weights w  A £60 0.6 B £10 0.1 C £30 0.3 D £90 0.9 E £20 0.2  Table 4 is a transaction database with 10 records The last column in table 4 shows the transaction weighted utilities for each transaction and the last row shows the total transactional utilities sum Table 4 Transaction database with transactional weighted utilities of items Items A B C D E twu  1 1 1 4 1 0 0.700 2 0 1 0 3 0 1.400 3 2 0 0 1 0 1.050 4 0 0 1 0 0 0.300 5 1 2 0 1 3 0.575 6 1 1 1 1 1 0.420 7 0 2 3 0 1 0.433 8 0 0 0 1 2 0.650 9 7 0 1 1 0 1.800 10 0 1 1 1 1 0.375 Weighted Utility count 7.703  Table 5 shows all possible itemsets generated using table 3. Itemsets with classical ARM support are shown in column 2, itemsets with weighted ARM support are shown in column 3 and column 4 shows itemsets with weighted utility ARM support. Column 1 in table 5 shows the itemsets ids. Support threshold for classical ARM and weighted ARM is set to 30% and for weighted utility ARM it is set to 0.3 \(as equivalent to 30%\emsets with highlighted background are frequent itemsets This simulation illustrates the effect of an itemís utility and its weight on the generated rules. Using a standard ARM technique without considering items utilities and their weights, rules generated with 30 support are shown in column 2. It is interesting to note that the rules generated with 30% support using weighted ARM framework \(column 3\o frequent using the classical ARM technique. This is due to the fact that WARM uses already generated frequent itemsets with standard ARM approach and thus misses many potential ones as shown in table 5 But the proposed framework overcomes this problem by using weights and utilities for itemsets pruning using the Apriori approach, thus considers potential itemsets which WARM ignores Table 5 Weighted utility mining comparison  Standard ARM Weighted ARM Weighted Utility ARM 1 A \(50 A \(30 A  0.59  2 A B  30  A B  21  A B  0.22  3 A B C  20  A B C  20  A B C  0.14  4 A B C D  20  A B C D  38  A B C D  0.14  5 A B C D E  10  A B C D E  21  A B C D E  0.05  6 A B C E  10  A B C E  12  A B C E  0.05  7 A B D  30  A B D  48  A B D  0.22  8 A B D E  20  A B D E  36  A B D E  0.13  9 A B E  20  A B E  18  A B E  0.13  10 A C  30  A C  27   A C  0.38  11 A C D  30  A C D  54   A C D  0.38  12 A C D E  10  A C D E  20  A C D E  0.05  13 A C E  10  A C E  11  A C E  0.05  14 A D  50  A D  75   A D  0.590  15 A D E  20  A D E  34  A D E  0.13  16 A E  20  A E  16  A E  0.13  17 B \(60 B \(6 B  0.51  18 B C  40  B C  16  B C  0.25  19 B C D  30  B C D  39  B C D  0.19  20 B C D E  20  B C D E  30  B C D E  0.10  21 B C E  30  B C E  18  B C E  0.16  22 B D  50  B D  50   B D  0.45  23 B D E  30  B D E  36  B D E  0.18  24 B E  40  B E  12  B E  0.23  25 C \(60 C \(18 C  0.52  26 C D  40  C D  48   C D  0.43  27 C D E  20  C D E  28  C D E  0.10  28 C E  30  C E  15  C E  0.16  29 D \(80 D \(72 D  0.90  30 D E  40  D E  44  D E  0.26  31 E \(50 E \(10 E  0.32   Rules {A C}, {AC D} and {A D} in column 4 are frequent under Weighted Utility framework because of their high weight and utility in transactions But it is interesting to get a rule B D, because B has least weight and low utility count. Justification for this kind of rule is that, though B has low weight \(0.1\, it has the second highest count support \(i.e. 60%\d it appears more with item D than any other item \(i.e 50%\nother aspect to note is that D has the highest weight \(0.9\d count support \(80%\These kinds of rules can help in ìCross-Marketingî and ìLoss Leader Analysisî in real world applications Further, the rules generated using our approach holds a valid DCP and the monotonic property of itemsets as proved in section 4.1 and table 5 illustrates a concrete example of this. Itemset BD appears in transaction 1, 2, 5, 6, 9 and 10 with high utility therefore the 45  0    BD wus Intuitively, the occurrence of its superset BDE is only possible when 
90 


BD appears in that transaction. Itemset BDE only appears in transactions 5, 6 and 10, thus 18  0    BDE wus were     BD wus BDE wus   Summatively, if BD is not frequent, itís superset BDE is impossible to be frequent; hence there is no need to calculate its weighted utility support  5. Experimental Evaluation  In this section we report our performance study for the WUARM approach. In particular, we compare the quality and efficiency of WUARM algorithm with Apriori version of standard and weighted ARM, a well known algorithm for mining frequent itemsets Experiments were undertaken using three different association rule mining techniques. Three algorithms were used for each approach, namely Standard ARM as classical Apriori ARM, Weighted ARM \(WARM as post processing Apriori weighted ARM and Weighted Utility ARM \(WUARM\ proposed approach We performed two types of experiments based on quality measures and performance measures. For quality measures, we compared the number of frequent itemsets generated using three algorithms described above with real and synthetic data. In the second experiment, we showed the scalability of the proposed WUARM algorithm by comparing the execution time of three algorithms with varying support thresholds Both real and synthetic datasets are used in experiments. For real data we used Retail dataset, a real market bask an d T10I4D100K synthetic data is obtained from the IBM dataset generator [8   5.1. Frequent Itemsets Comparison  For quality measure, both the dataset described above were used. Each item is assigned a weight range between [0-1 g to th eir s i gn i f ican ce in t h e  dataset We generated artificial frequencies of items range 1o r bot h real an d sy n t h e t i c dat a t o obt ai n i t e m s utilities in transactions. In figure 1 and 2, the x-axis shows support thresholds from 1% to 6% and on the yaxis the numbers of frequent itemsets are shown. Three algorithms as described above are compared. Weighted Utility ARM algorithm uses weighted datasets with items utilities; Standard ARM using binary dataset and WARM using weighted datasets and applying a post processing approach. Note that the weight of each item in classical ARM is 1 i.e. all items have equal weight and utilities of each item in Standard ARM and WARM is 1 i.e. all items with utility exactly one which is not the case in real applications The results show quite similar behavior of the three algorithms to classical Apri ori ARM. As expected, the number of frequent itemsets increases as the minimum support decreases in all cases. The number of frequent itemsets generated using the weighted ARM algorithm are always less than the number of frequent itemsets generated by standard ARM because weighted ARM uses  frequent itemsets generated by standard ARM This generates less frequent itemsets and misses many potential ones   Retail Dataset 0 40 80 120 160 123456 Minimum Support Frequent Itemsets Standard ARM Weighted ARM Weighted Utility ARM  Figure 1 No. of frequent Itemsets generated using varying support threshold \(real data  T10I4D100K 0 100 200 300 400 123456 Minimum Support Frequent Itemsets Standard ARM Weighted ARM Weighted Utility ARM  Figure 2 No. of frequent Itemsets generated using varying support threshold \(synthetic data WUARM generated fewer rules than standard ARM but more rules than weighted ARM because it not only considers the items weight but also take into account the items utilities in each transaction and considers potential itemsets which weighted ARM ignores. Also we do not use standard ARM approach to first find frequent itemsets and then re-prune them using weighted utility support measures. Instead all the potential itemsets are considered from beginning for pruning using Apriori approach to validate the DCP 
91 


Results of the proposed WUARM approach are better than weighted ARM because we consider all the possible itemsets and uses items weight and their utilities. Moreover, WUARM, Standard ARM and WARM utilises binary data  5.2. Performance  For performance study, we compare the execution time of WUARM algorithm with classical Apriori ARM and WARM algorithms using both real and synthetic data   Retail Dataset 40 60 80 100 120 123456 Support Threshols Execution Time \(sec Standard ARM Weighted ARM Weighted Utility ARM   Figure 3 Execution time \(real data  We investigated the effect on execution time caused by varying the support threshold with fixed data size number of records\.

Conclusion  In this paper, we have presented classical and weighted Association Rule Mining, in particular, the weighted utility framework which has the ability to deal with item weights and utilities in a hybrid fashion This framework can be integrated in the mining process, which is different to most utility and weighted ARM algorithms. To solve this problem, we identified the challenge faced while using weights and utilities together, in particular the invalidation of downward closure property Using a simulated example, we proved that weight and utility can be used together to steer the mining focus to those itemsets with significant weight and high utility. This is further proven by experiments conducted on real and synthetic datasets. We have showed that efficient WUARM algorithms can be developed by modifying the standard Apriori algorithm with weighted utility settings. The experiments also show that the algorithm is scalable  7.

patterns in the gure have one extra edge representing a link formation pattern in common Although the precise assessments are not made the patterns might capture a process of communication diffusions and the common edge might play a key role for the diffusion V R ELATED W ORK In this paper we employ a link formation pattern as an element of correlation and contrast patterns A concept of link formation in a time evolving graph is proposed in  and an algorithm L FR-Miner is de v e loped to mine link formation rules However LFR-miner restricts base patterns to have only edges directly connected to the extra edge An algorithm GERM deri v es a g raph e v olution r ule  GER which might be regarded as a set of link formation patterns Different from the patterns in this paper a GER requires the extra edges have the same relative timestamps in common Furthermore neither correlation nor contrast is considered Correlation patterns HP and contrast patterns CP 002 can be viewed as an upgrade of hyperclique patterns   4 and conditional contrast patterns  into the g raph domain

respectively We deﬁne the correlation and contrast measures by adjusting those measures in itemset mining to a single graph setting with time information On the other hand the deﬁnition of a correlation pattern CP 003 by pseudo clique is original in this paper While a wide variety of graph patterns in time evolving graphs and graph sequences is proposed recently 2   m ost o f t hem w ith fe w e xceptions d o not consider correlation and contrast at all An algorithm CorSSS  enumerates a correlated patterns i n a g raph sequence However CorSSS takes a sequence of subgraphs as a pattern and the target is very different In  a correlated spatio-temporal pattern representing changes in an evolving graph is proposed While focuses on the correlation o f changes the time of link formation has been paid attention in our proposal To the best of the authors knowledge there is no proposal on contrast pattern mining in a time evolving graph VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we discuss the problem of mining correlation and contrast patterns of link formations in a time evolving graph To solve the problems we develop a top-down enumeration framework in which base patterns are mined by a graph miner and combinations of link formations are discovered by an itemset and a pseudo clique enumeration algorithms The experiments by real world datasets show the feasibility of the proposed framework As future work further experiments with large-scale datasets and careful evaluation of the quality of obtained patterns are necessary Furthermore developing correlation and contrast patterns based on other criteria e.g k plex is one of important future work R EFERENCES  M  B erlingerio F  Bonchi B  B ringmann and A  G ionis Mining graph evolution rules in Proc of the European Conference

 1   1   l  1 i 2  i  Hence the true frequency count of any item occurring on some input stream must be C  l  1 j  x 1  tc  j    j    where  is a small quantity 3  The number of items present in each input stream is thus n  C 4  Since synopses for d l  1  x input streams are transmitted through a node at level x  the load on the most heavily loaded link\(s is L  x  d l  2  x  n C  Clearly the maximum value of L  x  is achieved when   0  The expression for L  x  can be simpliìed to L  x  1  l  1 j  x 1  j  d x  j 1  Now our expression for the worst-case load on any link can be reduced to W  T    max x 0  1 l  2  L  x   We desire to minimize W  T   subject to the constraints  2   l  1  0 and  l  1 j 2  j   1 It is easy to show that this minimum is achieved when L 0  L 1    L  l  2  Solving for  2   l  1  we obtain  i   1  d  1  l  2   d  1 d  2  i  l  2 and  l  1   1  d  l  2   d  1 d  Translating to error tolerances we set  i   1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d for all 2  i  l  1  This setting of  2  l  1 minimizes worst-case communication load on any link We term this strategy MinMaxLoad WC Under this strategy the maximum possible load on any link is L wc   l  2   d  1 d d   1 counts per epoch Lastly we note that MinMaxLoad WC remains the optimal precision gradient even if nodes of the same level can have different  values Informally since with worst-case inputs all incoming streams have identical characteristics maximum link load cannot be improved by using non-uniform  values for nodes at a given level we omit a formal proof for brevity 2.1.4 Good Precision Gradients for Non-Worst-Case Inputs Real data is unlikely to exhibit worst-case characteristics Consequently strategies that are optimal in the worst case may not always perform well in practice In terms of minimizing the maximum communication load on any link the worst-case inputs are ones in which the set of items occurring on each input stream are disjoint When this situation arises a gradual precision gradient is best to use as shown in Section 2.1.3 Using a gradual precision gradient some of the pruning of frequency 3 Recall that we allow the frequency of an item to be a real number 4 More precisely each stream contains  n C  items of weight 1 each and one item of weight  n C  n C   Note that each input stream contains at most one item with weight less than 1 as stipulated earlier counts is delayed until a better estimate of the overall distribution is available closer to the root thereby enabling more effective pruning In the opposite extreme when all input streams contain identical distributions of item occurrences there is no beneìt to delaying pruning and performing maximal pruning at the leaf nodes as in strategy SS2 is most effective at minimizing communication In fact it is easy to show that SS2 is the optimal strategy for minimizing the maximum load on any link when all input streams are comprised of identical distributions we omit a formal proof Note however that SS2 still incurs a high space requirement on the root node R since it sets  1    We posit that most real-world data falls somewhere between these two extremes To determine where exactly a data set lies with regard to the two extremes we estimate the commonality between input streams S 1 S m by inspecting an epoch worth of data from each stream We compute a commonality parameter   0  1 as   1 m   m i 1 G i L i  where G i and L i are deìned over stream S i as follows The quantity G i is deìned as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i and also at least   S  times in S  S 1  S 2  S m  where  S  denotes the number of item occurrences in S during the epoch of measurement The quantity L i is deìned as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i  Hence commonality parameter  measures the fraction of items frequent enough in one input stream to be included in a leaf-level synopsis by strategy SS 2 that are also at least as frequent globally in the union of all input streams A natural hybrid strategy is to use a linear combination of MinMaxLoad WC and SS2 weighted by   The strategy is as follows set  i 1       1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d        for 2  i   l  2  and  l  1 1       1  d  l  2   d  1 d         We term this hybrid strategy MinMaxLoad NWC for non-worstcase Commonality parameter  1 implies that locally frequent items are also globally frequent and SS2 modiìed to use  1   is a good choice Conversely  0 indicates that MinMaxLoad WC is a good choice For 0  1  a weighted mixture of the two strategies is best 2.1.5 Summary The precision gradient strategies we have introduced are summarized in Table 3 Sample precision gradients are illustrated in Figure 3 3

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
