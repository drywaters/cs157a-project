Once the model has extracted prospective hyponyms by using lexico-syntactic patterns, an Apriori algorithm is applied to eliminate faulty hyponyms and increase precision. We show that a model based on a particular lexico-syntactic pattern and association rules for Turkish language can successfully retrieve many is-a relation with high precision Keywords-lexicon; hypernym/hyponym; Apriori algorithm I   I NTRODUCTION  Semantic relations among words have captured the interest of NLP researchers. The Hypernym/Hyponym relation is one of the main semantic relations. The term hyponym used in this paper refers to the definition that can be summarized as hyponym is \(a kind\of hypernym'' [1 v er t h e y e a r s  m a n y  studies have been done for semantic lexicon construction Hand-built lexicons, such as Cyc [2 d W o rd Net  1 3  4   ar e  the most popular and useful resources for NLP purposes. These lexicons are widely used and considered here for comparison Although these resources are reliable, effective and widely used, developing them can be troublesome and timeconsuming. To cope with the problem, many alternative methods have been developed in recent years. In this study, we aim to make a contribution to the field by proposing a fully automatic system for acquisition of hypernym/hyponym relations from a Turkish corpus [5   Previous attempts [6,7,8,9 s ed pa tte rn s t o ex t r act lex i c al  information from Machine Readable Dictionaries \(MRDs Because of the limitations of MRDs, Hearst proposed automatic acquisition of hyponyms from a large text corpora and became the first to apply a pattern-based method to extract hyponyms from Grolier's American Academic Encyclopedia 10  S e ver a l r e s e ar c h e r s a l so used c o rp us-dr i ve n  pa t t er nbased methods to find hypernym/hyponyms 12,13,14,15,16,17  Pattern-based methods have also been applied to other web documents [18,19,20 Rec e nt l y  m a n y st ud i e s ha ve pr opo s e d to construct semantic relations by exploiting web documents and wiki pages [21,22,23,24,25  For the Turkish language, BalkaNet [26  i s  t h e fi r s t  comprehensive project for a multilingual lexical database for Balkan languages such as Turkish WordNet.

Then, the system applies the most reliable lexico-syntactic pattern to find the hypernyms. For each hypernym, a variety of patterns are used to extract its potential hyponym lists, called transactions which are passed to the Apriori algorithm. The algorithm generates several rules to discover important relations between     1  Turkish Language Council   978-1-4673-1448-0/12/$31.00 ©2012 IEEE 


 fruit berry  fruit broccoli  fruit pear orange 005  The problem of association rules mining is to generate all association rules that have a support and confidence value greater than a support threshold \(minsup\ and confidence threshold \(minconf In our paper, the transactions are considered as the lines that match patterns above \(e.g. \223fruit such as apple and banana\224\ and the items are each unique noun in the lines \(e.g 223apple\224, \223banana\224, \223table\224\. For example, I fruit banana, apple orange, pear, potato, broccoli, berry} is a simple example which shows items for fruit hypernym and the following five transactions are examples of the transaction database for the same hypernym t1=banana,apple t2=banana,pear,orange,potato t3=apple,pear,orange,broccoli t4=banana,apple,pear,orange t5=banana,apple,pear,broccoli To extract hyponyms, association rules such as pear orange can disclose useful information in order to predict hyponyms. In brief, the methodology employed here proceeds in three stages as follows A  Extracting Hypernyms and Their Candidate Hyponyms The most precise and well-known acquisition methodology applied previously by Hearst [1  rel i es on l e x i c o s y n t act i c  patterns. Starting from the same idea, we firstly determine which hypernyms are chosen. We analyzed the following lexico-syntactic patterns by using regular expressions for Turkish 002 A transaction t i contains X, a set of some items in I, if tX i 002 and to explore less observable real relations such as 003\003 and 0 YX 002 where berry is one of items in I, is the main challenge of this study The process of building association rules can be divided into two steps: to find all frequent item sets whose support are greater than minsup and to discover rules whose confidence is greater than minconf. Weak candidates are expected to be removed by pruning in step one, because the rule implies that frequent item sets automatically satisfy both minsup and minconf For transactions above, let the minsup be 0.5 and minconf be 0.7. The resulting rules would be as shown below pear orange conf: 1.0  sup: 0.6 apple pear conf: 0.75 sup: 0.6 banana apple conf: 0.75 sup: 0.6 002  The association rule is described as Y,X where I,YI,X 002 as an expected result. To eliminate an unexpected result such as 004 The rule YX holds in the transaction set D with confidence c if  c% of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y. The rule YX has support s in the transaction set D if s% of transaction in D contain Y.X 200  NP\ gibi CLASS"  \(CLASS such as \(NP where NP refers to Noun Phrase and CLASS refers to Hypernym. The pattern matches over 200.000 cases from which 500 reliable candidate hypernyms can be compiled and from them, 17 hypernyms are selected according to their frequency Different variations of the same pattern can be used to find candidate hyponyms as follows 200  NP\\(, NP\* gibi CLASS" \(CLASS such as \(NP NP 200  NP\* ve NP gibi CLASS" \(CLASS such as NP\ and NP These patterns have a good potential to give a strong indication of an is-a hierarchy. At the end of this process prospective hyponym lists are determined. The lists will be evaluated as transactions in the following sections B  Elimination by Assumption When we examine the instances that are captured from lexico-syntactic patterns defined above, the output list has many correct hyponyms. However, some incorrect hyponyms are extracted due to parsing and other errors. Another reason for the inclusion of non-hyponym words is that they could be strongly associated with their hypernyms. We need to filter these non-hyponyms out. The objective of this step is to prevent such non-hyponyms from being a member of finally decided hyponym list In our reliable patterns, we observed a grammatical rule that real hyponyms tend to appear in nominative case and without any suffix. If a noun appears in the pattern, but is not in nominative case but in accusative, dative, or genitive case, it will be eliminated. This rule is very effective for the Turkish language due to its agglutinative structures and highly productive inflectional and derivational morphology C  Elimination with the Apriori Algorithm Although we successfully filtered out non-hyponyms by applying the assumption above, we can still have erroneous candidates. To discover strong relations between hyponyms and eliminate weak relations, an association rule algorithm, the Apriori algorithm that is inspired by Agrawal [32 is u s e d  Th e association rule algorithm utilizes assumptions about the domain and the idea that frequently co-occurring terms are semantically related. In this way, association rules can be used to extract semantic relations between hyponyms The formal definitions and formula for the association rules used in this paper refer to the definition proposed in Agrawal Let I ={i 1 i 2 i m be a set of distinct items and D={t 1 t 2 t n be a set of  transactions, where each transaction t i is a set of items such that It i 


orange pear conf: 0.75  sup: 0.6 pear apple conf: 0.75  sup: 0.6 banana pear conf: 0.75  sup: 0.6 apple banana conf: 0.75  sup: 0.6 pear banana conf: 0.75 sup: 0.6 To choose an appropriate threshold for both confidence and support degree is crucial to the successful exploration of strong association rules. For the example above, when the minsup value is chosen 0.4, the item broccoli would be also included in the hyponym lists, which is unexpected III  I MPLEMENTATION  A  Language Resources In our experiments, we used the BOUN Web corpus and language resource   T h e y p r o vi de a s e t  o f l a ngua ge resources for Turkish language processing applications. These include an implementation of a morphological parser based on two-level morphology, an averaged perceptron-based morphological disambiguator with accuracy of %98, and a web corpus of  490M  tokens B  Experimental Setup The model takes raw text and finds structure \(root, suffix pos and other\ of the words in the text by using Turkish morphological parser   E a c h  t o k e n i n t h e  co rp us i s  represented in the form of surface/lemma/pos. We manually selected 17 categories/hypernyms out of 500 classes that the lexico-syntactic pattern based module yields IV  R ESULTS AND E VALUATION  For the evaluation phase, we checked the proposed model against the 17 selected categories. The first column in Table-1 shows the categories. In order to measure success rate, we semi-automatically extracted all possible hyponyms of all classes. To capture all hyponyms, once several algorithms employing word similarity measurement \(e.g. dice, jaccard, chi etc.\s been run to produce as many candidates as possible then incorrect hyponyms were manually eliminated We tested the methodology within 3 different settings. The pattern based procedure called P attern-1 was used to extract a number of hypernym/hyponym pairs by lexico-syntactic patterns that showed in Section II. This can be considered as a baseline algorithm due to its simplicity. Its output size and precision score are shown in second and third columns respectively in Table I. In a second phase called P attern-2 the method proceeds by applying the assumption that if an item occurs only once within the patterns, it is suspicious and eventually eliminated, since incorrect items can accidentally appear in the pattern. The fourth and fifth columns of the table represent the output size and the precision score of the second phase. Finally, we tested the Apriori algorithm by substituting it for pattern-2 above. The results obtained by the Apriori  algorithm are shown in the last three columns; the number of output, minsup/minconf value and precision Looking at Table I it is obvious that the pattern-2 module outperforms pattern-1. The items appearing once in the pattern tend to be incorrect hyponyms. To check whether those items are reliable or not, we apply association rules to the system The Apriori algorithm eliminates non-hyponyms from pattern-1 according to pre-determined minsup and minconf value. For low minsup values, there can exist many frequent sets and also many rules. The result would remain the same as pattern-1 and not make any sense. The essential key is to choose a proper threshold. It is necessary to experiment with different thresholds and observations of results are crucial in this phase When we analyze the average precision of pattern-2 and Apriori, they both have higher precision than pattern-1. It is normal because of elimination and reduced size of output. On the other hand, their recall values are low. In order to solve the recall problem, the capacity of the Apriori model can be improved by using low minsup values to find new candidates The average precision scores of pattern-2 and Apriori algorithm seem to be the same at a glance. However, the Apriori algorithm outperforms the pattern-2 in terms of production capacity and recall value.  When we look at the total number of items for a comparison, while the former has produces 828 items, the latter gives only 726. It means that the former has better recall on average When looking at the hypernyms which have low accuracy in Table I, we face the topical similarity problem. For example the terms tea and cigarette frequently co-occur as a part of beverage hypernym. The relation is mostly based on topical similarity. They are highly associated and related like the terms astronaut and moon. However they are not siblings and do not share the same type. The main problem described here can be solved within a more fine-grained model V  C ONCLUSION  To disclose is-a relations in a corpus, we proposed a fully automatic model based on syntactic patterns and association rules. In this study, a most productive and reliable lexicosyntactic pattern was used. We observed that hypernym/hyponym pairs are easily extracted by means of the patterns for Turkish Language. In order to get more precision we designed some elimination criteria. Methods for the elimination phase can be divided into two types. One type is based on grammatical rules, the other utilizes association rules The study succeeded in getting promising results and at the model that gives higher precision. The experiments show that the limited number of pairs with low recall is the main challenge in this field The results showed that a fully automated model presented in the paper can successfully discover is-a relations by mining a large corpus. The simplest method for the detection of is-a hierarchy is to apply lexico-syntactic patterns. It can disclose many relations. Secondly, frequency based and rule-based elimination are very useful for the sake of higher precision. We designed an elimination phase and succeeded in getting a better 


score. Finally, to get better precision, we exploit the Apriori algorithm. We showed that the Apriori algorithm within the proposed model gives promising results. We implemented and provided a utility program to verify and reproduce the results that we claim In a future piece of research, we will design a preprocessing phase in order to avoid the problems coming from polysemy and other factors. We also intend to apply an expansion algorithm to get better recall and productivity. A subsequent step will be to adopt the same principles to different semantic relations such as meronyms or holonyms specifically for the Turkish  language domain TABLE I  P RECISION VALUES OF THE EXPERIMENT  Category of items Pattern-1 of items Pattern-2 of items minsup minconf Apriori  bank 31 65 13 85 17 0.01/0.7 82 mineral 19 68 12 92 9 0.02/0.7 100 sport 44 98 27 100 33 0.008/0.7 100 event 33 88 12 100 22 0.01/0.7 91 profession 68 94 16 100 50 0.01/0.7 96 illness 141 81 84 96 99 0.001/0.7 82 animal 97 82 52 94 50 0.01/0.7 96 city 118 75 89 96 75 0.001/0.7 96 fruit 37 86 31 90 27 0.01/0.7 93 country 279 50 178 74 103 0.0005/0.7 93 device 52 85 22 95 36 0.01/0.7 83 tool 72 96 23 100 51 0.01/0.7 96 drink 28 93 14 100 20 0.01/0.7 90 vegetable 40 85 31 94 26 0.001/0.7 92 sector 151 87 72 99 140 0.003/0.7 88 newspaper 66 88 24 96 42 0.001/0.7 95 organization 59 76 26 85 28 0.004/0.7 79 average 82  94  91  R EFERENCES  1  G.A.

168 charts is that even when a student has performed at the highest level in each of these subjects, his/her failure rate at the G.C.E Aílevel in the Physical Science stream is not the lowest E Prioritizing the Impact of G C.E. Oílevel Subjects on the G.C.E. Aílevel Results The impact of the results of different G.C.E. Oílevel subjects on the G.C.E. Aílevel results vary when considered individually. The impact of these subjects was measured by varying the result of one subject while keeping the results of the other subjects constant.  This effect has been analyzed in Figure 11.  It should be noted that the points have been connected by a line to demonstrate the decline of the pass rate clearly In this graph, the x-axis indicates the results that can be obtained for the G.C.E. Oílevel subjects and the y-axis indicates the confidence of passing the G.C.E. Aílevel examination.  Any point \(related to A, B or C\ on each line of the graph reveals the confidence value for the group of subjects with the indicated grade for the subject that line belongs to and A grades for rest of the subjects. For example, for the point corresponding to a B grade for Mathematics, it gives the confidence value for a student who obtains a B grade of Mathematics and an A grade for each of the other six subjects at the G.C.E. Oílevel. The following will provide a better depiction of the above Figure 11 Comparison of the impact of G.C.E. Oílevel subject results on 2007 G.C.E. Aílevel results in the Physical Science stream, when the results of a single subject vary There are two points on the green line which have confidence values of approximately 0.8 for an A grade and 0.25 for a B grade. If one considers the first point, it illustrates the following association rule Mathematics A  Religion A, First Language A, English A, Science A, Social Studies A, Technical subject A A/L Result = Pass The second point illustrates the following association rule Mathematics B  Religion A, First Language A, English A, Science A, Social Studies A, Technical subject A A/L Result = Pass It is very clear that apart from the Mathematics results, all other results are constant in both situations. The confidence of passing the G.C.E. Aílevel examination has reduced from 0.8 to 0.25 due to the effect of the decline in the G.C.E. Oílevel Mathematics result from an A pass to a B pass Again, if one considers the light blue line which corresponds to the English language, the following association rules can be identified respectively for the three points English = A  Religion A, First Language A Mathematics A, Science A, Social Studies A, Technical subject A A/L Result = Pass English = B  Religion A, First Language A, Mathematics A, Science A, Social Studies A, Technical subject A A/L Result = Pass English = C  Religion A, First Language A, Mathematics A, Science A, Social Studies A, Technical subject A A/L Result = Pass The confidence values in relation to the three association rules are 0.8, 0.78 and 0.67 respectively The above figure clearly depicts that more than 80 percent of the students who obtained very good passes in all six of the main subjects at the G.C.E. Oílevel  have performed well at the G.C.E. Aílevel. This fact is emphasized by the points corresponding to the A grade. Further, the points corresponding to the B grade represent the confidence value for passing the G.C.E. Aílevel examination with a B grade for the particular subject and A grades for the rest of the main subjects considered. A similar interpretation can be given to the points corresponding to the C grade where it expresses the confidence value for passing the G.C.E. Aílevel examination with a C grade for a particular subject and very good passes for the rest of the main subjects. Hence, by looking at the above figure, it can be clearly seen that a majority of the students who have obtained A passes for all the main subjects except English language, have passed the G.C.E. Aílevel in Physical Science stream.  This implies that the English language result at the G.C.E. Oílevel examination does not have a significant impact on the performance at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination under this stream 


169 The decline increases starting from the Technical subject then Religion, Social Studies and First Language and finally Science and Mathematics; emphasizing the importance of good grades in Mathematics and Science at the G.C.E. Oílevel examination to become success at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination in Physical Science stream. The difference between the percentage that passes the G.C.E. Aílevel after obtaining an A grade in all seven Oílevel subjects and a B grade in Mathematics and A grades in the remaining six Oílevel subjects is quite high. This is however quite small with respect to the other six subjects. Yet, it should be noted that all these facts are true only for those who sat the 2007 G.C.E Aílevel examination in the Physical Science stream Figure 12 depicts the same information with respect to the 2010 G.C.E. Aílevel examination results in Physical Science stream. This figure clearly shows that approximately 80 percent of students who obtained A passes in all seven main subjects in G.C.E. Oílevel examination have passed the G.C.E. Aílevel examination, which is considerably high. However only 60 percent of those who obtained a B pass in Science and A passes in all other main subjects, were successful at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination held in 2010. When G.C.E Oílevel Mathematics is Figure 12 Comparison of the impact of G.C.E. Oílevel subject results on 2010 G.C.E. Aílevel results in the Physical Science stream, when the results of a single subject vary considered, this rate reduces to less than 50 percent. This decline is considerably low. Further, only 30 percent of those who had a C pass for Oílevel Science and A passes for the remaining six subjects were successful at the 2010 G.C.E Aílevel examination.  This rate is also considerably low. This highlights the importance of the G.C.E. Oílevel Science and Mathematics results for success at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination. When other subjects are considered, English language seems to be the least important subject as the decrement is very marginal.  The other four subjects too show marginal decrements which are not significant in comparison to Mathematics.  However the order has changed slightly from the 2007 results. In 2007, next to Mathematics and Science Religion was the most important subject.  But in 2010, the importance of this subject has reduced slightly Despite the differences, these two graphs clearly indicate the importance of G.C.E. Oílevel Mathematics and Science to become success at the G.C.E. Aílevel.  They both pointed out the lack of importance of the English language. It should be noted here that these confidence values have been obtained using the association rules generated with a minimum support value. Therefore the impact of a C pass for some of the other subjects has not been considered as the accuracy of the confidence value for these subjects would be minimal due to the insufficient number of records IV D ISCUSSION This study has been conducted with the intention of identifying any prevailing relationship between a studentís G.C.E. Oílevel result and his/her G.C.E. Aílevel result in Physical Science stream. Initially, the study focused on identifying whether the students selected to the Physical Science stream were those with the correct knowledge and capabilities. Thus the study was restricted to the students who did Physical Science at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination. The only method available was to compare the G.C.E. Aílevel results with the corresponding G.C.E. Oílevel results, to identify any existing patterns From the analysis carried out, it was observed that the G.C.E. Oílevel Science and Mathematics results of a student have a direct impact on his/her G.C.E. Aílevel result, for those in Physical Science stream. Further it was evident that a student had to perform at the highest level with regard to these two subjects in order to do well at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination In other words, better the performance in these two subjects higher the probability of passing the G.C.E. Aílevel examination. This was clear from the computed confidence and support values too. Moreover, it was found out that there are a few other subjects that a student should focus on if he/she is planning on follow G.C.E. Aílevel in Physical Science stream namely Religion, First Language, Social Studies and the Technical subject. This combination was identified with respect to the 2007 G.C.E. Aílevel results and corresponding G.C.E Oílevel results. From this study, the fact that G.C.E. Oílevel Mathematics and Science were the most important subjects behind the success at the G.C.E. Aílevel was highlighted Although the analysis revealed the above results, it was observed that some students with A grades in all subjects at the G.C.E. Oílevel examination have failed the G.C.E. Aílevel 


170 examination. This may be due to some other factors which cannot be captured through an analysis which was purely based on examination results. There were also very rare students who had not obtained an A grade for any of the G.C.E. Oílevel papers, but were successful at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination These were extreme cases. There were also a quite a few students who have performed extremely well at the G.C.E Aílevel examination but those do not satisfy the above criterion.  However from the study it can be concluded that a student who fulfills the identified requirements has a higher chance of passing the G.C.E. Aílevel examination in Physical Science stream V L IMITATIONS OF THE S TUDY A few limitations had to overcome during this study. A major limitation was the lack of knowledge on other factors that influence the performance at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination. In this study the main focus was on identifying any relationship between G.C.E. Oílevel examination result and G.C.E. Aílevel examination result of students. However there could be other external factors that affect a studentís performance at the G.C.E. Aílevel examination It should be further pointed out that the standard of the Oílevel and Aílevel examinations can vary from year to year Hence one may argue that comparing the results of students who sat the examination in different years is not practical VI S UGGESTIONS FOR F URTHER W ORK Other factors that may have an effect on the G.C.E. Aílevel results of students could be considered. Provided that data for some other factors are available, a logistic model could be fitted to identify the determinants of a studentís G.C.E. Aílevel results. A clearer understanding could also be obtained if results of a longer period were available for the analysis R EFERENCES 1  20 11 A p r i l  E d uca tio n F o r  A l l N atio nal A c tio n P l a n S r i L a nk a  Onlin  A va i l a b le  http://planipolis.iiep.unesco.org/upload/Sri%20Lanka/Sri%20Lanka%20 EFA%20NAP.pdf 2  20 11 A p r i l  T h e E duc at io nal S y s t e m  o f S r i L a nka.

show the similar phenomenon Figure 8 shows the running time of all algorithms with min sup 3 and min conf 0  5 on all context logs From this gure we can see that the running time of BP-Growth BPGrowth-P is dramatically less than BP-Growth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R on all context logs Summary  by comprehensively analyzing the experimental results for running time we summarize the observations as follows a BP-Growth BP-Growth-P dramatically outperform BPGrowth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R in terms of running time It implies that the strategy of removing redundant data plays a more important role in reducing the running time for behavior pattern mining than the strategy of data set partition and the improvement for data set partition based algorithms is more dramatic b GCPM-H-R is roughly comparable to GCPM-H in terms of running time It implies that applying the strategy of removing redundant data to an Apriori-like algorithm only leads to very limited improvement of running time c BP-Growth-P is roughly comparable to BP-Growth in terms of running time It implies that the pseudo projection technology only has very limited effect on reducing the running time of BP-Growth VII CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we studied several strategies which may be used for improving the efìciency of behavior pattern mining in terms of computing efìciency and memory cost To be speciìc we searched some typical optimizing strategies for association rule mining and discuss the feasibility of applying them to behavior pattern mining since the two problems are similar in many aspects Moreover we proposed a novel and efìcient algorithm named BP-Growth for behavior pattern mining by combining two promising strategies The extensive experiments in a practical mobile computing environment clearly show that BP-Growth and its optimization signiìcantly outperform GCPM and other two baselines which adopt one of the two promising strategies in terms of both running time and memory cost One challenge of utilizing behavior patterns is that there usually exists thousands of behavior patterns for an individual mobile user Usually many of them are semantically similar or related and may be summarized by several representative patterns As for future work we plan to study the effective approaches to summarize lots of behavior patterns for easing the representation of user habits while maintaining as much information as possible VIII A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research was supported by grants from Nokia Research Center China Natural Science Foundation of China Grant

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
