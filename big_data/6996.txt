Mining temporal patterns with quantitative intervals Thomas Guyet Ren  e Quiniou INRIA DREAM Team Campus de Beaulieu 35042 Rennes France 002rstname.lastname@irisa.fr Abstract In this paper we consider the problem of discovering frequent temporal patterns in a database of temporal sequences where a temporal sequence is a set of items with associated dates and durations Since the quantitative temporal information appears to be fundamental in many contexts it is taken into account in the mining processes and returned as part of the extracted knowledge To this end we have adapted the classical APriori  fr ame work to pr opose an ef\002cient algorithm based on a hyper-cube representation of temporal sequences The extraction of quantitative temporal information is performed using a density estimation of the distribution of event intervals from the temporal sequences An evaluation on synthetic data sets shows that the proposed algorithm can robustly extract frequent temporal patterns with quantitative temporal extents 1 Introduction The classical view of frequent sequential patterns mining FSPM considers a lar ge database of sequences D  Each sequence s 2 D is an ordered set of items with possible duplications The mining task consists in extracting the longest patterns that are suf\002ciently frequent i.e that can be found in a number of sequence of D above a prede\002ned threshold The FSPM is strongly motivated by its application to knowledge extraction from customer purchase database DNA sequences web logs medical time series 9 16 etc Most of these investigations have only considered a linear sequential notion of time But in some contexts the quantitative temporal dimension of data provides fundamental information that should be taken into account in the mining processes and returned as part of the extracted knowledge For example in web log analysis the browsing patterns can be re\002ned by the time spent to explore the web pages The comparison between the quantitative time spent on a web page and the required time to browse its content may be useful to decide whether some part of the information has not been read In a medical context the temporal information is crucial to diagnose the patients accurately This is obvious in situations ranging from diabetes mellitus to intensive care unit ECG monitoring and arti\002cial ventilation For example in dif ferent kinds of cardiac ar rhythmias could be discriminated thanks to the quantitative temporal intervals between events chronicles models Some authors e.g Chiu et al propose to simulate event duration by the repetition of a same event having a 002xed atomic duration However in some applications it is necessary to distinguish the repetition of events from a single occurrence of this event for example two apneas of 30 s each should not be confused with a single apnea of 1 min  This distinction is only possible with a quantitative representation of the time information Unfortunately discovering the quantitative temporal extents of events is a dif\002cult problem The construction of the sequence of items should be intertwined with the construction of representative durations On the one hand temporal sequence instances are required to construct the representative duration between two events in a temporal sequence But on the other hand the durations are required to identify the temporal sequence instances To tackle this problem we propose to enhance the classical APriori algorithm to handle quantitative temporal extents of the items In section 2 we de\002ne the temporal sequence the hypercube representation and temporal pattern Then in section 3 we give some details about temporal pattern extraction task In section 4 the algorithms are presented and the section 5 presents the evaluations Finally we present related work in section 6 2 Temporal sequences and temporal patterns 2.1 Temporal sequences De\002nition 1  Temporal sequence  A temporal sequence S is a set of temporal items  where a temporal item A  denoted as A   A  l u   is a symbolic event A associated

2.2 Temporal patterns De\002nition 7  Temporal pattern  A temporal pattern is a temporal sequence  P  f  p i   l i  u i  g i 2 N n  that is the representative of a set of similar temporal sequences Similarly to Giannotti et al  a pattern is a representative However in patterns are rules a t 000 b  meaning that the representative duration between events a and b is t  Our patterns provides the delay between events as well as the duration of events Chronicles or delta patterns  are not representati v es The y just generalize the represented temporal instances In fact the interval between two events gives the lower bound and the upper bound of the delay between these two events De\002nition 8  Temporal pattern coverage  A temporal pattern P  f  p i   l p i  u p i  g i 2 N n covers an example S  f  s i   l s i  u s i  g i 2 N m  denoted S 026 P  if the symbolic signature of S contains the whole symbolic signature of P  i.e  9 f  N n 7 N m injective  8 i 2 N n  p i  s f  i  If S 026 P  then S P denotes the longest temporal subsequence of S such that S P 026 P  Finally the coverage of S by P is de\002ned by cov P  S   sim 020 P  S P 021  Example 3 If P   A 1     B 4    and S  f  A 1  1  3     D 1  5     B 4  1  5   g  then S 026 P and S P  f  A 1  1  3     B 4  1  5   g  The coverage is computed by 3 000 1  1 003 5 000 4  1 max 2 003 1  2  3 003 1  2 031 0  62 The temporal pattern coverage is null in two cases 1 if P does not cover S  or 2 if at least one pair of corresponding temporal items do not overlap i.e 9 i  l p i  u p i   h l s f  i   u s f  i  i    De\002nition 9  Temporal pattern strict-coverage  A temporal pattern P strictly-covers a temporal sequence S  denoted S 036 P  if S 026 P and cov P  S  6  0  3 Temporal pattern extraction Temporal pattern extraction aims at 002nding the interesting temporal patterns from a set of temporal sequences denoted D  In our approach interesting temporal patterns are the longest patterns such that sequences similar to this pattern can be frequently encountered in D  De\002nition 10  Temporal pattern extraction  Let D  f s i g i 2 N m be a set of m temporal sequences and f min 2 0   be the frequency threshold Then temporal pattern extraction consists in 002nding out the longest  i.e with the highest dimension temporal patterns f P i g i 2 N p such that for each P i the examples strictly-covered by P i are frequent jf s 2 D j s 036 P i gj m 025 f min  Example 4  Temporal pattern extraction  Given the database D that contains the following temporal sequences s 1   A 1     B 4   s 2   A 1  2  3     B 3  8  4     C 5  8  6   s 3   A 1  1  3     D 1  5     B 4  1  5   s 4   A 0  9  2     B 4  1  5     C 6  2  7   s 5   A 0  1  0     B 4  2  5   Given a frequency threshold f  0  5  there is only one frequent symbolic signature of dimension 2  A B   Then temporal extents must be associated with each event but several temporal patterns are possible 017  A 0  1  3     B 3  8  5   strictly-covers all the examples but the mean coverage is low  031 0  36  017  A 1  1  3     B 4   has a better mean coverage  031 0  71  but does not strictly-cover s 5  Moreover several temporal extents that strictly-cover the same set of temporal sequences can be computed for a temporal pattern Our aim is to de\002ne a unique and representative temporal extent for each interval of a temporal pattern Since the distributions of temporal intervals can highlight such representative temporal extents we propose a solution to construct unique and representative temporal extents which relies on the estimation of the interval distributions Figure 3 Interval distribution of A left and B right For example Figure 3 shows the distribution of A intervals and B intervals of the example 4 that can be used to extract the temporal extents Clearly temporal sequence s 5 rises a problem all the sequences seems similar with respect to the B intervals distribution but s 5 does not seem similar to the others with respect to the A interval distribution Consequently the distribution of A intervals in

the pattern having  A B  as symbolic signature can not be inferred from all A intervals More generally this shows clearly that the interval distributions of a pattern can not be inferred from the interval distributions of its subpatterns Therefore interval distribution extraction is intertwined with symbolic signature construction This is the temporal pattern extraction issue to tackle At this point the hyper-cube representation is helpful This representation allows to consider the distribution of the intervals for all temporal dimensions globally at the same time In Figure 4 the frequency of temporal regions is outlined with darkening color the darker a region is the more temporal sequences overlap this region Figure 4 Distribution of temporal sequences  A B  represented by hyper-cubes Our proposition is based on hyper-cube distributions which can be approximated using density-based multidimensional clustering  e.g EM algorithm Then e xtracted clusters are used to compute representative temporal bounds In our framework we approximate distributions with Gaussian mixture models Once computed each Gaussian is associated with a possible temporal pattern The temporal intervals to overlay over the symbolic signature are extracted from a Gaussian of the model by computing the bounds associated with an interval representing some ratio of the whole con\002dence This is the temporal extent threshold  In our experiments we have chosen 95 con\002dence intervals Figure 5 illustrates the Gaussian distribution estimation and the extracted temporal bounds Two clusters represented by ellipses are computed so two temporal patterns are extracted Each ellipsis axis gives the temporal bounds for the item associated with the axis dimension Note that it is easy to understand 2-dimensional temporal sequence graphs and their distribution For higher dimensions graphical representations are almost impossible to understand but the same reasoning can be done Figure 5 On the left temporal sequences instances and Gaussians iso-density ellipsis On the right the density estimation 4 Framework and algorithms Our framework is based on the APriori algorithm to construct the longest frequent symbolic signatures The main idea of this algorithm is based on the following property every symbolic signature that covers a frequent symbolic signature is frequent  This property is helpful to prune a lot of candidates of size n knowing the infrequent symbolic signatures of size strictly inferior to n because if a symbolic signature of size n is covered by an infrequent symbolic signature then it is not frequent  The algorithm whose pseudo-code is given in Algorithm 1 iterates two stages namely 1 the selection of frequent temporal patterns of dimension n  and 2 the generation of symbolic signature candidates of dimension n  1 from those of dimension n  These two stages are detailed in the following sections The process terminates when there is no more potential longer candidate or when the candidates are no longer suf\002ciently frequent The algorithm has been adapted to process hyper-cube representations of temporal sequences In particular the selection of frequent temporal patterns uses the distribution estimation approach to extract the temporal intervals see section 4.2 and the candidate generation uses a priori constraints enriched by temporal bounds see section 4.3 4.1 Main algorithm The 002rst step of the algorithm consists in constructing the frequent symbolic signatures of dimension 1 If an item  e.g  A   has less occurrences than f min 003 jDj  then it is not frequent and according to the APriori algorithm principle it should not be taken into account Then we enter in the main selection-generation loop Assume that L n  the set of symbolic signatures of dimension n  has been constructed As will be seen later these symbolic signatures are good candidates to be frequent The selection phase

aims 1 at verifying the frequency of generated candidates and 2 at constructing their associated temporal intervals Given p 2 L n  we 002rst verify that the symbolic signature of p is frequent Then and only then we can expect to 002nd out temporal intervals using the density estimation of the interval distribution The candidate selection function is detailed in the next section This function returns a set of frequent temporal patterns that are added to M n  Note that a symbolic signature can give rise to several temporal patterns see Figure 5 for instance Once all symbolic signatures have been processed and if M n is empty then no temporal patterns of size n is frequent Thus the result given by the algorithm is the set of frequent temporal patterns of size n 000 1  Algorithm 1  Temporal pattern mining algorithm inspired from the APriori algorithm Input  f min  minimal support D  temporal sequences database d  random points density Output  M n  the longest frequent temporal patterns of dimension n   Construct frequent symbolic signatures of dimension 1 in L 1 L 1 construct L1 D  f min  n  1  while L n is not empty do M n    for p 2 L n do  Selection phase f  f requency  p   if f 025 f min then M n  M n  selection f min  D  p  f  d  end end if M n is empty then return M n 000 1  end  Generation phase L n 1 generateCandidates M n  n  n  1  end return M n  4.2 Candidate selection Algorithm 2 details the candidate selection function This function aims at identifying the frequent temporal patterns in D that can be associated with some symbolic signature p  There is two main tasks 1 construct the representative temporal bounds for p  and 2 prune the infrequent temporal patterns The main part of the algorithm consists in estimating the density function for the distribution of the hyper-cube representation of p instances We use a Monte-Carlo approach to estimate the density function For each sequence s 2 D that is covered by p  random points vectors in dimension n  are uniformly generated inside the hyper-cube de\002ned by s p  The number of points is proportional to the volume of the hyper-cube Moreover to deal with the curse of dimensionality this number is e xponentially proportional to the dimension of the hyper-cube The required number of points is given by the following formula nb  vol  s p  003 d dim  p  1 where d is a parameter of our algorithm that can be easily adjusted depending on the time values expected in intervals Algorithm 2  selection f min  D  p  f  d  Input  f min  the minimal support D  temporal sequences database p  symbolic signature f  frequency of p  d  random points density Output  M  set of frequent temporal patterns  Generation of representative points for interval distribution for s 2 D do if p covers s then  nb number of points to generate nb  vol  s p  003 d dim  p   add nb random points inside s p to hh  end end  Extraction of frequent temporal patterns from hh GaussianM ixtureM odel  EM hh  for gm 2 GaussianM ixtureM odel do if f 003 gm:prop 025 f min then p new  temporal pattern p  gm  M  M  f p new g  end end return M  The distribution of generated points denoted hh in Algorithm 2 represents the distribution of the intervals Then algorithm EM is used to estimate the Gaussia n mixture model from these points In the most general case the density function is f  x   N X k 1 c k 2 031  000 d 2 j 006 k j 000 1  2 e 000 1 2  x 000 026 k  t 006 000 1 k  x 000 026 k  where N is the number of Gaussians 026 k is the mean vector and 006 k is the variance matrix of the k th Gaussian and c k is the proportion of the Gaussian in the mixture In the EM algorithm the number of Gaussians N must be given but the correct number of clusters is unknown

Consequently the algorithm is executed for several numbers of clusters and the best mixture is selected In practice the normalized entropy criterion NEC is used to select the number of clusters between 1 and nb 0  3  In addition we assume that the intervals in a temporal pattern are independent Consequently the EM algorithm is constrained to extract Gaussians with diagonal variance matrices This assumption reduces the computation cost Once the Gaussian mixture model has been computed the temporal patterns can be extracted First of all a Gaussian gm must have a suf\002cient proportion denoted c k in the mixture formula and denoted gm:prop in Algorithm 2 It means that if a symbolic signature has a frequency of f  then f 003 gm:prop gives the number of temporal sequences strictly-covered by the temporal pattern associated with an extracted Gaussian gm  Such a temporal pattern is retained only if f 003 gm:prop 025 f min  Finally the interval bounds are computed by h 026 k 000 013 2 2 031  000 d 2 j 006 k j 000 1  2  026 k  013 2 2 031  000 d 2 j 006 k j 000 1  2 i where 013 is a parameter used to adjust the width of the interval currently 002xed to 0.8 Algorithm 3  generateCandidates M n  Input  M n  set of frequent temporal patterns of dimension n Output  L n 1  set of candidate temporal patterns of dimension n  1  Generation of candidates for s 2 M n do for i 2 L 1 do P  f s  i  0001   1  g  L n 1  L n 1  P  end end  Suppression of a priori infrequent candidates for s 2 L n 1 do if s is a priori infrequent then L n 1  L n 1 000 s  end end return L n 1  4.3 Candidate generation Now we present the candidate generation see Algorithm 3 To generate only the potentially useful candidates we extend the classical APriori constraint on symbolic signature to a constraint that takes into account the temporal intervals thanks to the hyper-cube representation Let P  f  s i   l i  u i  g N n 1 be a temporal pattern of dimension n  1  P may be frequent if every orthogonal projection of its hyper-cube on each subspace of dimension n overlaps with at least one hyper-cube of M n  the set of frequent temporal patterns of dimension n  i.e  8 l 2 1  n   9 p 2 M n  sim 020  s i   l i  u i  N n 1 000f l g  p 021 6  0 In the 002rst phase of the generation temporal patterns of dimension n  1 are generated by concatenating an element of M n and an element of L 1 the set of frequent items The element of L 1 is associated with in\002nite temporal bounds In a second phase the a priori infrequent elements are pruned 5 Evaluation The algorithms have been implemented in MatLab v7.6 R2008a 1  We have used the MixMod library to compute Gaussian mixture models Our experiments were performed on a bi-processor Pentium IV 3.6GHz 2Go of RAM To evaluate the properties of our algorithm we have used synthetic data sets The simulation process is 003exible enough to quantitatively evaluate several properties such as accuracy computation time and robustness against the noise To our knowledge there is no other algorithms for extracting temporal sequences with quantitative temporal intervals that we could quantitatively compare with In section 6 we present a qualitative comparison of our temporal pattern extraction method to other temporal sequence mining methods 5.1 Data set simulation The data simulation process generates random temporal sequences based on a temporal pattern prototype to which is added temporal noise and structural noise A temporal pattern prototype is a set of n quintuplets  f  E i  026 b i  033 b i  026 d i  033 d i  g i 2 N n  where E n is an event name 026 b n  026 d n resp 033 b n  033 d n  are the mean resp the standard deviation of the generated begin instants and durations of E n  This prototype speci\002es the temporal pattern to discover  f  E i   026 b i  026 b i  026 d i  g i 2 N n  and the standard deviation parameters quanti\002es the Gaussian distribution of the interval bounds The larger the standard deviation is the harder the temporal pattern extraction is For the sake of simplicity all standard deviations are equal to tN 2 0    This parameter quanti\002es the temporal noise in the data set In addition some structural noise can be added A structural modi\002cation consists in randomly deleting an event or modifying an event name sN 2 0   is the ratio of structurally modi\002ed temporal sequences in the data set Finally 1 Source code for the algorithm and the data generator available on-line http://www.irisa.fr/dream/QTempIntMiner

Figure 6 Prototype upper graph and 10 generated examples totally randomly generated temporal sequences are added to the data set with ratio rP 2 0    Figure 6 illustrates the temporal sequence generation process  nb  10  sN  0  1  The fourth sequence has been randomly generated  rP  0  1  several sequences such as sequence number 8 have been structurally corrupted  sN  0  1  and time bounds 003uctuates due to the temporal noise  tN  0  2  In the following the prototype used to generate the data sets  nb  20  was f  E k  3 k 3 k  g k 2 N n  When not explicitly given the parameters take their default values n  4  nb  20  sN  0 and tN  0  2  For each set of parameters 10 different data sets were generated to yield statistically signi\002cant results The accuracy in 0    of the temporal pattern extraction process is evaluated by the similarity value between the prototype and the best extracted temporal pattern see Definition 6 This means that if the temporal pattern and the prototype share the same symbolic signature then the accuracy is given by the relative common volume Otherwise the accuracy will be set to 0 A non-zero accuracy points to a correct symbolic signature extraction this is always the case with the basic parameters thus the higher the accuracy the better the extracted temporal bounds 5.2 Experiments and results The results are organized as follow 002rst we present evaluations of the computation time and the accuracy of the algorithm according to the parameters nb  n  tN and sN linked to the temporal sequence representation Then we demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm in 002nding out the interesting temporal patterns in a large amount of temporal sequences Finally we highlight some properties on examples Computation time and accuracy Short computation time is a strong constraint on sequential pattern mining algorithms The computation time of APriori is known to increase exponentially with the pattern size  i.e the prototype dimension n  Moreover temporal bounds extraction in the selection phase is also time consuming The number of examples for the EM algorithm is proportional to d n  where d is a parameter see eq 1 Practically the maximum dimension of the extracted temporal pattern may be limited to have reasonable computation times Figure 7 Computation time on the left and accuracy on the right w.r.t the prototype size The results Figure 7 left show that the computation time increases exponentially with the prototype dimension  n ranges from 2 to 5 For d  4  the computation time ranges from 2 00 to 3 0 41 00  Figure 7 right gives the accuracy The accuracy decreases notably when the dimension increases This comes from the fact that the accuracy is evaluate from the similarity by de\002nition the similarity computes the product of the relative sizes lying in 0    of the intersection along each dimension of two hyper-cubes Experiments have been performed with six values of d from 1.5 to 6 We expected that the computation time should increase with d  while the accuracy should become better Practically this is the case for d 024 3  However we did not notice any statistically signi\002cant improvement of the accuracy for d 025 3  Nonetheless the computation time is signi\002cantly higher so we set d  3 for the other experiments Figure 8 illustrates the computation time and the accuracy with respect to the number of examples  nb ranges from 100 to 1000 On the one hand the computation time increases linearly and on the other hand the accuracy remains quite the same Thus this experiment shows that our

algorithm is robust with respect to the database size Figure 8 Computation time on the left and accuracy on the right w.r.t the examples number Boxplots show the variances Finally Figure 9 illustrates the accuracy with respect to the temporal noise There is two parts in this graph at the beginning the accuracy increases then it decreases when more temporal noise is added The second part shows a normal behavior the higher the temporal noise the less accurate the temporal intervals The dashed line highlights failures in pattern extraction the symbolic signature could not be successfully extracted This means that when the temporal variances become too high the algorithm is no more able to reconstruct the symbolic signatures due to the dif\002culty to identify the correct Gaussian mixture models For tN  0  6  it occurs only in 10 of the experiments but for tN  1 it occurs in 50 of the experiments We expected to obtain a very good accuracy and low variances when the temporal noise is low But the 002rst part of the Figure 9 shows the opposite It can be explained by observing that many extracted intervals are shifted compared to the prototype intervals This behavior is explained below We conclude from these experiments that 1 the algorithm extracts temporal patterns with accurate temporal intervals and 2 in spite of the theoretical drawbacks con\002rmed by the experimental results the computation time is reasonable Temporal interval enlargements and shifts For temporal interval extraction we hypothesize that the interval distribution 002ts a Gaussian distribution We identi\002ed two cases where this hypothesis is false The 002rst one occurs when the variance of the lower or upper bound of a prototype interval is high compared to the duration of this interval see Figure 10 left In this case the extracted temporal interval is larger than expected The second case occurs when the variance of the lower bound of a prototype interval is low compared to the variance of its duration see Figure 10 right In this case the Figure 9 Accuracy w.r.t temporal noise The dashed line gives the accuracy mean computed with non-zero accuracies extracted temporal interval is shifted In fact the distribution is not Gaussian anymore it is rather exponential Figure 10 Two cases of inadequate interval extraction Plain line rectangles show the temporal bounds extracted from the computed Gaussians ellipsis Dashed line rectangles show the expected temporal bounds Knowing these possible behaviors is helpful to determine the assumption under which the extraction algorithm will be ef\002cient As a consequence the data set must be such that the variance of interval lower bounds must be low but suf\002ciently high compared to their respective duration variance Robustness to structural and database noises In the previous experiments database temporal sequences were corrupted with temporal noise only In the present section we keep some temporal noise  tN  0  2  but we introduce structural noise in the temporal sequence generation The robustness to structural corruption can be assessed by varying the f min parameter of the APriori framework As

suming that rP  0  i.e that there are only positive examples possibly corrupted of the temporal pattern and given f min  we expect that the algorithm will be robust with respect to a structural noise equal to f min  Figure 11 illustrates the accuracy with respect to the structural noise level and f min  0  5  Temporal pattern extraction failures occur when sN 025 0  35 only 1 failure out of the 10 trials for sN  0  35  When sN  0  5 temporal pattern extraction fails in more than half of the cases 6 failures out of 10 trials This experiment con\002rms that when f min is low the robustness of our algorithm against the structural noise is high Figure 11 Accuracy with boxplots w.r.t structural noise The dashed line gives the mean of non-zero accuracies However in real databases positive examples of a temporal pattern are mixed 1 with positive examples of other temporal patterns and 2 with random irrelevant temporal sequences Then f min must be suf\002ciently low both to 002nd out the few positive examples of a temporal pattern and to be robust against the structural noise But if f min is too low the computation time may hugely increase and irrelevant patterns could be extracted To con\002rm this hypothesis we have generated a more realistic data base containing 1000 temporal sequences with 80 of randomly generated sequences  rP  0  8  Two different prototypes were used to generate relevant temporal sequences  10 each Consequently f min must be lower than 0  1 ratio of positive examples in the database per temporal pattern to consider relevant temporal sequences as frequent but due to additional structural noise  sN  0  2  it must be lower than 0  1 003 1 000 sN   Thus we choose f min  0  05  The experiment showed that our algorithm is able to 002nd out at least one temporal pattern and the two temporal patterns in 65 of the trials with a mean accuracy of 0  33 and a mean computation time of 9 0 07 00  Additional properties Other experiments have been performed to illustrate interesting additional properties of our algorithm For example our algorithm can extract 1 temporal patterns with temporal items that overlap or 2 temporal patterns with twins i.e several identical events associated with different intervals Contrary to existing approaches e.g  these temporal patterns do not introduce dif\002culties to our algorithm thanks to the hyper-cube representation that separates the temporal information for each item In the case of temporal patterns with twins two dimensions can be separated if two representative temporal extents are extracted This can be computed from Gaussian mixture models For example it can distinguish the two representative Gaussians of Figure 5 6 Related work Temporal sequence mining involves two different kinds of issues FSPM algorithm with time constraints 14 and temporal relation discovery 9 11 12 Hirate et al  propose a generalized FSPM with the capability to handle two kinds of item interval measurements item gap and time interval Time constraints approaches make use of minimum and maximum gap values that must be de\002ned as the gap constraint by the user Then the algorithms such as SeqLog  or GTC Graph for T ime Constraints 15 e xtract or dered sequences of items that respects these gaps However the algorithm do not discover the time constraints The gaps are used to get rid of insigni\002cant patterns and rules so as to reduce the number of generated patterns and rules Temporal relation discovery approaches use extended de\002nitions of temporal sequences In 11 qualitati v e temporal relations on intervals i.e Allen temporal relations are associated with sequence items H  oppner propose a level-wise algorithm inspired from the APriori algorithm to extract ef\002ciently both event sequences and temporal relations Chen et al  or Quiniou et al  propose an intermediate representation of temporal sequences between qualitative temporal relations and quantitative temporal constraints Chen et al  uses the concept of fuzzy sets to extend the original APriori algorithm and Pre\002xSpan algorithm so that fuzzy time-interval sequential patterns are discovered from databases Quiniou et al  uses a 002rst-order relational learning method to construct a graph of temporal constraints called chronicles  The closest approaches to ours are 8 9 12 The temporal information associated with temporal sequences is represented by quantitative interval extents In Giannotti et al propose an extension of the sequence mining paradigm to linear temporally-annotated sequences where each transition A  B in a sequence is annotated with

a typical transition time t  denoted by A t 000 B  The notion of Delta-Pattern  proposed by Yoshida et al  is quite similar to temporally annotated sequential patterns DeltaPatterns have the form A 0   000\000 B  denoting a sequential pattern A  B that frequently occurs in the data set with transition times from A to B that are contained in 0    The FACE system adapted the APriori framework to extract the temporal extents of the interval between two events as the enveloping interval of the temporal sequence instances intervals As us Giannotti et al and Yoshida et al  use a clustering method to e xtract the representative values of the transitions Yoshida et al  pro vide an heuristic for 002nding some frequent Delta-Patterns but their method is not exhaustive Giannotti et al  propose to combine a candidate sequence generation step with a clustering step but do not provide details nor evaluations of their method In both methods the main issue of intertwining a pattern growing method with temporal interval generation based on the analysis of interval distributions is not explicitly addressed 7 Conclusions In this paper we introduce a temporal extension of the classical sequential pattern mining which adds quantitative temporal information to patterns Using a hyper-cube representation of temporal sequences the temporal extents of pattern events can be globally extracted We propose an algorithm that solves the issue of intertwining the interval distribution extraction and symbolic signature construction Our algorithm is based on the APriori algorithm and an approximation of the interval distribution On the one hand a variant of the APriori algorithm enables the extraction of the longest patterns in large temporal sequence database On the other hand the use of Gaussian mixture models for approximating the interval distributions enables the extraction of the representative quantitative temporal extents of a pattern As APriori our method is exponential with the size of the patterns but it remains linear with the number of sequences in the database The practical ef\002ciency of the method has been evaluated on synthetic data sets The results show that while the pattern growth technique makes our algorithm robust against the structural noise the use of Gaussian mixture models makes it robust against temporal noise References  R Agra w al and R Srikant Mining

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
