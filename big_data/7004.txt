Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu P.R. China 610031   Abstract  Mining the frequent item sets is the core of algorithm for mining association rules. Therefore, to improve the efficiency of discovering the frequent item sets is a key issue in data mining area. In this paper, an algorithm for acquiring the frequent item sets, which is based on the set operations of item-transaction list, is put forward. It turns out to cost less in terms of both space and time Moreover, it is applied to get the scheme modifying association rules in the intelligent system for technical examination of vehicles in accident, and it proves effective  1. Introduction  As the most important and popular one of datamining methods, association rule method was firstly put forward by Agrawal R in 1993  R.Agrawal used the Apriori algorithm to mine the association rules. Apriori algorithm involves two steps: first, it finds the frequent item sets with the support degree being more than the threshold; second, it generates the association rules based on the frequent item sets. Apriori algorithm is Antimonotone, i.e. if an item sets is not a frequent item sets then its supper sets are all not frequent item sets, thus the  k 1\didates can be generated based on the k  frequent item sets, which narrows down the search range of algorithm The Apriori algorithm has the following limitations 1\The time of scanning the database is equal to the length of max frequent item sets. So, if there are some long frequent item sets, it would take a long time 2\didates may be generated. If the number of frequent item sets with the length being 1 is more than 10000, the number of frequent item sets with the length being 2 will be more than 10MB 3\he infrequent but important information can not be taken into account. Due to the minimization support degree, the transactions with low support degree can not be involved. Similarly, if the minimization support degree is set to be very low, the efficiency of the algorithm would be poor, and many irrelevant item sets may be generated 000\021 000\003 0000 any candidates and timely scanning database are the bottlenecks of Apriori algorithm, focus on these limitations, many researchers do much work to improve the algorithm, and many extended algorithms were advanced, such as AprioriTid algorithm presented in referen r u n i ng al g o rithm pres en ted i n ref e re n c e   h table tech n i q u e pres en ted in ref e re n ce [4 Partition based association rules mining algorithm presented in referen a m p li n g alg o rit h m pres e n ted  in referen d th e DIC  D y n a m i c Ite m s e t C oun ti ng   presented in referen 000\003 Different from the extended algorithms, there are other algorithms based on different theories and data expression for discovering association rule. The Tree Projection algorithm  takes the Lexicographic tree as the frame of data store. With the strategy of depth first, the database transactions can be projected and counted in the tree, with a matrix, the frequency of item sets is calculated lastly. Therefore, it is speedier than the Apriori algorithm The FP-growth algorithm, put forward by Han in referen a ty pe of f r equ e nt pattern  m i n i n g  m e th od  based on frequent pattern tree\(FP-tree\ompared with the Apriori algorithm, it has these following properties 1\ing the FP-tree to store the key information of database, it scans the database for only two times, so more I/O time for scanning database can be saved. \(2\he candidate needs not to be generated, so more time for generating and testing candidate can be saved.\(3\th the strategy of dividing and ruling, the search range can be narrowed down  The algorithm based on Diffset   brought forth by Zaki, only keeps the difference between the candidate pattern and the existing frequent pattern, so it reduces much storage place, especially for the denseness data Different from the above algorithms, a method based on the set Operations of item-transaction list is put forward to get the frequent item sets. In the intelligent system for technical examination of vehicles in accident this method is applied to the scheme modifying transaction, thus the frequent items set for association rules is gained  2.

4. An example  Scientific traffic management entails the identification & compensation for road traffic accident, in which the technical examination of vehicles in accident plays a pivotal role. Through the technical examination we can get a general picture of how the vehicle acts in the traffic accident, thus objectively analyzing the reasons behind the accident so as to identify the party’s liability Nowadays vehicles are numerous, and the number of road traffic accidents is on the rise, which calls for more experts as well as more scientific examinations indeed For technical examination to be more efficient, an intelligent system for technical examination of vehicles in accident is developed, in which the CBR method is applied to chose the scheme of the most similar one as the scheme of the new problem from the history case, then the scheme modifying association rules is applied to help decision maker modify the scheme of the new problem and more importantly, the algorithms based on the set operations of item-transaction list is applied to get the scheme modifying association rules The scheme’s structure in the system is showed in table 1, from which we can see that a scheme is composed of some examination items, and to modify the scheme means to delete or add some examination items from it  Table 1 The scheme’s structure Field name Field type Field length Remark jddbh Char 18 Scheme number jdxmbh Char 10 Item number jdxmmc Char 24 Item number jdbz Char 100 Standard jdjg Char 20 Result  Let     2 1 m i i i I  be the set of all examination items, and   2  1   m j i j  be an item of     2 1 m i i i I  Let         2 1 m i Add i Add i Add T         2 1 m i Del i Del i Del  be the set of all modification actions, here   l i Add  means adding examination item l i and   j i Del means deleting examination item j i Let     1 2 1 1 n i i i P   be the former scheme and     2 2 1 2 n i i i P  be the final scheme. Supposing 1 I be the set of items deleted and we can get 2 1 1 P P I   supposing 2 I be the set of items added, and we can get 1 2 2 P P I   so a modifying transaction can be           2 1 I i i add I i i del T j j l l     In this way, the system collects all the modifying transactions that decision maker made, and the part of transactions set is showed in table 2. We transform table 2 into item-transaction set, which is showed in table 3. By setting the support degree as 0.2, we apply the algorithms based on the set operations of item-transaction list and gain the final frequent item sets, which are showed in table 4  Table2 transactions list Transacti on number Modifying operations list T100 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.2 Del\(A3.2 T200 Add\(A1.2 Del\(A1.3 T300 Add\(A1.2 Add\(A1.3 T400 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.2 Del\(A1.3 T500 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.3 T600 Add\(A1.2 Add\(A1.3 T700 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.3 T800 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.2 Add\(A1.3 Del\(A3.2 T900 Add\(A1.1 Add\(A1.2 Add\(A1.3  Table3 The item-transaction set Modifying operation Transactions list Add\(A1.1\ T100,T400,T500,T70 0,T800,T900 Add\(A1.2\ T100,T200,T300,T40 0,T600,T800,T900 Add\(A1.3\ T300,T500,T600,T70 0,T800,T900 Del\(A1.3\ T200,T400 Del\(A3.2\ T100,T800  Table 4 The final frequent item sets K Frequent item sets Transactions list 1 Add\(A1.1 T100,T400,T500,T700,T800,T900 1 Add\(A1.2 T100,T200,T300,T400,T600,T800,T90 0 1 Add\(A1.3 T300,T500,T600,T700,T800,T900 1 Del\(A1.3 T200,T400 1 Del\(A3.2 T100,T800 2 Add\(A1.1\,A dd\(A1.2 T100 T800 T900 2 Add\(A1.1\,A dd\(A1.3 T500 T700 T800 T900 2 Add\(A1.1\,De l\(A3.2 T100 T800 2 Add\(A1.2\,A dd\(A1.3 T600 T800 T900 2 Add\(A1.2\,De l\(A1.3 T100 T800 2 Add\(A1.2\,De l\(A3.2 T100 T800

Conclusion  Frequent item sets acquisition based on the set operations of item-transaction list transforms the transactions list into item-transaction list. By doing some set operations on this list, the final frequent item sets is gotten. The analysis of algorithm shows that it is simple and costs little in space & time. Also , the actual application proves it is easy and worthy to be programmed. Moreover, the final results gotten by the algorithm not only include the frequent number and frequent items but also the transactions list corresponding to the frequent item sets, which can be applied to study whether the association rules are ordinary rules or individual rules, and it would be our future task  Acknowledgements  This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of P.R.

VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  In this paper, we have proposed a new algorithm called the FIAST algorithm for mining frequent itemsets based on similar transactions after deleting infrequent 1-itemsets. The algorithm applies the BitTable to aggregate transactions that have similar itemsets. The aggregation significantly reduces the number of transactions in the BitTable and the time using the divide-and-conquer method to reduce the bitwise AND operation for finding itemsets. Also, a depth-first search strategy is used to generate all frequent itemsets. We scan the database only once and avoid candidate generation to minimize I/O. We are impl ementing the FIAST algorithm and comparing our algorithm with other pattern growth approaches R EFERENCES   1  U. Fayyad, G. Piatetsky-Shapiro, and P.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con“gurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con“gure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef“ciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/˜manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
