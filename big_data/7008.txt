Leveraging Concept Association Network f or Multimedia Rare Concept Mining and Retrieval Tao Meng Mei-Ling Shyu Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of Miami Coral Gables FL 33146 USA Email t.meng@umiami.edu shyu@umiami.edu Abstract Automatic high-level semantic concept detection is a crucial step for multimedia data management indexing and retrieval It is well-acknowledged that semantic gap poses a great challenge in multimedia content-based research It becomes even more challenging when the concept of interest is extremely rare in the training data sets because of the 
poor modeling for the positive instances In this paper a Concept Association Network CAN is trained by selecting signiìcant links to capture the strong associations among different concepts using association rule mining ARM By taking into account of the correlations and credibilities of reference concept nodes the advantages of the reference nodes are utilized Experimental results using TRECVID 2010 data sets show that by utilizing the proposed framework the Mean Average Precision MAP values of all the concepts are improved and the signiìcant improvement of the MAP values 
of the rare concepts further attests the promising results Keywords content-based multimedia retrieval concept association network logistic regression rare concept detection I I NTRODUCTION The large amount of multimedia data such as videos on YouTube nowadays makes manual annotation infeasible Therefore automatically mining and annotating high-level concepts from multimedia data sets for the purposes of searching indexing and retrieving have become a popular research area 1   The common approach us ed is to train a set of binary one-versus-all classiìers for each highlevel concept based on the low-level features The testing 
instance is tested and assigned a score by each classiìer indicating the probability that the instance contains the corresponding concept The main problem of this approach is semantic gap which is the gap between low-level features and semantic concepts This problem becomes even challenging when the positive instances in the training set are rare On the other hand the concepts do not occur independently in the multimedia data sets and they have some correlations For example the concepts airplane and sky have high chances to co-occur in the same image or video clip Properly modeling the relationship among concepts and leveraging such information to improve the 
detection accuracy have received a large amount of attention Several frameworks have been proposed and they generally model the relationships in the following four ways model vector co-occurrence relationship ontology and probabilistic graphical network The model vector consists of the scores output from the binary detectors and it is treated as a new feature vector That new feature vector is then used for training and testing The idea behind this approach is that the model vector provides a signature for one class so that the testing instance could be classiìed based on this signature 4  O ne chal l e nge of t h i s approach i s t o o v ercome 
the error propagation issue because of the low accuracies of individual detectors In terms of co-occurrence relationships Chen et al 5 u tilized d o m ain k n o wled g e fo r t h e co occurrence relationship to help the detection of the target concept using the information from the reference concept and gained 60 improvement for certain concepts in terms of MAP More recent work integrates the information in linguistic ontology to model the correlations among different concepts so as to improve the detection rate 1  One problem in this approach is its dependence on domain knowledge Finally some frameworks used the tree or graph structure with nodes representing concept models and edges representing association between concepts For example 
Choi et al 7 model ed t h e cont e x t u al rel at i ons hi p i n a probabilistic tree structure while Aytar et al 8 adopted a complete graph structure and u sed the conditional probabilities as weights for edges to combine the scores One problem in this approach is the noisy inputs from the casual connections in the training data sets In data mining association rule mining ARM is an important algorithm to identify the frequent patterns in a given data set The frequent patterns represented by rules usually indicate the signiìcant internal association among items ARM has been widely utilized in multimedia concept

Figure 1 Training phase of the proposed framework tween nodes is modeled as bi-di rectional which matches the observations of the real world Fourth rather than capturing the relationship between only two nodes the CAN could be easily extended to capture ternary or high order relationships among concept nodes by generating rules consisting of more than two items Fifth the construction of the CAN is fully automatic based on the training data which shows the advantage over the probabilistic graphic model and ontology model since they usually rely on prior knowledge or domain knowledge The paper is organized as follows In Section II the proposed framework is introduced Experimental results and discussions are shown in Section III Section IV concludes the paper and describes future work II T HE P ROPOSED F RAMEWORK The proposed framework is shown in Figure I training phase and Figure II testing phase The training phase consists of the Concept Based Classiìers Training Component and the Concept Association Network Training Component  The former follows the architecture of the state-of-the-art multi-label multimedia concept mining system Speciìcally in a training data set there are m instances images or video shots and n high-level concepts such as Outdoor and Sky  to detect The training instances are preprocessed and a set of features are extracted Afterwards n binary content-based classiìers models are trained for n concepts so that each model j  1 002 j 002 n  outputs m ranked scores for the j th concept represented by C j in this paper This component is included here for the purpose of completeness and is not the main focus of the overall framework The Concept Association Network Training Component receives the ranked scores from the Concept Based Classiìers Training Component and mines the frequent itemsets in the label matrix to be described in Section II-A to Figure 2 Testing phase of the proposed framework build a CAN In this component several essential modules are included to be introduced in details in the following subsections to ensure that the association links retained in the CAN after rule pruning are signiìcant and the related parameters are optimized It is important to point out that this component does not depend on which models used in the Concept Based Classiìers Training Component  In the testing phase the same set of features as in the training phase are rst extracted For each testing instance it receives one score from each content-based classiìer By leveraging the CAN for a speciìc concept of interest a new score which integrates the information from related concepts is generated as the nal score The evaluation criterion is Mean Average Precision MAP Deìnition 1 Concept-Class Pair The concept-class pair is the representation of the class label for a certain concept It is denoted as C 002 j where j  1 002 j 002 n  indicates the concept number and 002 1 or 0 When 002 1 or 002 0 it is called positive or negative concept-class pair Deìnition 2  003 itemset The 002 itemset is the set consisting of 003 concept-class pairs where 003  1  2   n For example  C 1 1  C 0 5  is a 2itemset i.e 003 2 Please note that C 1 j and C 0 j for the j th concept cannot be in the same 003 itemset  Deìnition 3 Support The support is deìned as the number of occurrences of a 003 itemset in the training data set and is represented using sup  003 itemset   Deìnition 4 Concept of Interest  Related Concept The Concept Of Interest COI is deìned as the concept to be detected also called the target concept node in a CAN The Related Concept RC is deìned as the concept which has a signiìcant correlation with COI also called a reference concept node in a CAN Deìnition 5 Self Score  Reference Score The self score or reference score is deìned as the score output from the content-based classiìer corresponding to COI or RC respectively

A Label Organizing To mine the concept relationship from the training data set automatically the labels of all concepts are organized in a label matrix Assuming there are m instances and n classes in the training data set the labels are organized in an m  n matrix L   l ij   i  1 2  m and j  1 2  n where l ij  C 1 j or l ij  C 0 j indicates the i th instance is labeled as positive or negative for the j th concept B Association Link Generation In order to utilize the relationship among different concepts proper modeling of the links among those concepts is necessary In general the signiìcant links should have the following characteristics First the links need to be significant compared to the other links Second the signiìcance of the links depends on the COI to be detected Take an example from the TRECVID 2010 11 t rai n i n g dat a s et  The importance of the link between C 6 Animal and C 43 Dogs is different based on which concept to detect In terms of C 6  the link between C 43 and C 6 is very helpful because a correct positive label for dogs ensures a correct label for an animal However the link from C 6 to C 43 is of less interest because an animal is not necessary a dog Taking this into consideration an ARM-based association link generation algorithm is proposed The algorithm works as follows First all 1itemsets are generated for L  Only the 1itemsets  C 1 j  consisting of positive concept-class pairs are retained Second all the candidate 2itemsets are generated by combining the 1itemsets with a minimum support of one Afterwards the candidate 2itemsets which contain COI are organized together Based on these 2itemsets  a set of candidate rules which draw the conclusion that COI is positive are generated In order to select the most signiìcant rules two rule pruning modules are incorporated into the framework Suppose that C b is COI and C a is RC  and one candidate rule is  C 1 a 003 C 1 b  The support-based rule pruning module addresses the signiìcance of the rule from the perspective of COI and is modeled by the support ratio R s deìned in Equation 1 R s  sup   C 1 a  C 1 b   sup   C 1 b    1 A threshold value 004  is used to select the rules with relatively high R s values Next the interest-based rule pruning module is added to handle the signiìcance from the RC s perspective The interest ratio R i is deìned in Equation 2 A threshold 005  is used to select rules in a similar way as 004  The parameters 004 and 005  are dynamically selected for each concept based on the training scores to maximize the average precision AP so that different preferences of the concept nodes are captured in the framework R i  sup   C 1 a  C 1 b   sup   C 1 b    sup   C 1 a    2 From the network point of view if all the relationships among concepts are modeled in a network G   V  L  W   where V is a set of nodes each node representing a concept L represents a set of links and each link has a weight in set W to model the relationship between two nodes The selected signiìcant rules could be viewed as the signiìcant links from the RC stothe COI  These links are deìned as the association links in the framework and form the core of a CAN C Posterior Probability Calculation Another important task is to model the credibility of the scores output from the content-bas ed classiìers In addition instead of assigning a positive or negative label modern multimedia retrieval systems usually output the ranking scores in a descending order to indicate the relevance of the retrieved results to a user query Therefore the traditional F 1 score precision and recall evaluation metrics are not suitable In this study a Bayesian posterior probability based score is used to integrate the information from the credibility of a model Assuming for an instance i  the detection score of C j is O  j  i   The output score O 004  j  i  for the C j which encompasses the information of the credibility of the model is given in Equation 3 O 004  j  i  p  O  j  i   C j  1   p  C j  1  006 1 z  0 p  O  j  i   C j  z   p  C j  z   3 where p  C j  1  is the prior probability of C j appeared in a data instance and is estimated by dividing the sup   C 1 j   by the total number of training instances p  C j  0  is one minus p  C j  1  because there are only two possible cases p  O  j  i   C j  1  is the conditional probability density function pdf f P  x  p  x  C j  1  evaluated at x  O  j  i  and p  O  j  i   C j  0  is the conditional pdf f N  x  p  x  C j  0  evaluated at x  O  j  i   To estimate f P  x  and f N  x  the Parzen-Window 12 a pproach is applied here The k ernel function used in this study is the standard normal distribution N  0  1   and the Parzen-Window estimation of the pdf for one dimensional random variable x is given by Equation 4 p  x  1 v v 006 u  1 1 005 2 007 exp    x u  x  2 2   4 Here x u are the training instances and v is the total number of training instances Using this equation f P  x  and f N  x  could be estimated from the positive and negative training instances respectively In this way not only does the information of the input score be included but also the credibility of the model be integrated in the nal score O 004  j  i   D Afìnity Computation and Score Integration After the association links are generated in Section II-B the skeleton of the CAN is completed The next step is to integrate the information from different sources Speciìcally

two questions need to be answered The rst question is how to analyze the link between the target concept node and reference concept nodes quantitatively The second question is how to weigh the contributions of the self score and reference scores Different from most of the previous work the link between two concept nodes is modeled as a bidirectional link in this study This approach is adopted based on the observation of the asymmetrical relationship between semantic concepts in the real world so that the weight of the link depends on the direction As far as the weight is concerned inspired by the conìdence measurement in ARM we deìne the afìnity of a link in Equation 5 Here C b is the target concept node and A a 003 b indicates the afìnity of the link from C a to C b  A a 003 b  sup   C 1 a  C 1 b   sup   C 1 a    5 Hence for C b  the afìnities of all the links from the reference concept nodes could be computed Assume they form a set D  For one data instance i  the integrated information from all reference concept nodes is summarized in the integrated reference score S N  b  i   deìned in Equation 6 S N  b  i  006 d 006 D A d 003 b  O 004  d  i  006 d 006 D A d 003 b  6 where O 004  d  i  is computed for C d and instance i using Equation 3 While Equation 6 summarizes the reference scores the information of the self score is still missing It is important to weigh these two types of scores In this study the logistic regression algorithm is applied to determine the necessary weights Speciìcally for a concept C b let x  i  be the column vector  1 S N  b  i  O 004  b  i  T and a parameter vector 003  010 0 010 1 010 2  T  The probability of an instance i to be positive is given by the logistic function in Equation 7 g 002  x  i   1 1  exp   h 002  x  i   7 h 002  x  i   003 T x  i   8 Here 003 could be learned by minimizing the cost function in Equation 9 using the gradient descent algorithm The updating rule for 010 q  0 002 q 002 2  is shown in Equation 10 where 011 is the learning rate determined by empirical study based on the training data set m is the number of training instances and y  i  is either 1 or 0 indicating whether the instance is positive or negative For a testing instance the nal score is computed using Equation 7 and the trained 003  J  003   1 m  m 006 i  1 y  i  log g 002  x  i    1  y  i   log  1  g 002  x  i   9 010 q

After removing those keyframes which do not have any ground truth labels and data preprocessing 118  581 keyframes from the training videos form the nal training set and the corresponding labels are used to generate the label matrix As mentioned in Section II the Concept Association Network Training Component is able to adapt to any content-based classiìers models Therefore CUVIREO374 13 is u s ed an d its d e tectio n s co res a re d o wn loaded from 14 a s t he i nput  S i n ce onl y t he det ect i o n s cores for the TRECVID 2010 testing keyframes were provided and the parameters of CAN need to be tuned using the training scores the TRECVID 2010 testing keyframes are used in this paper The labels for TRECVID 2010 were provided by NIST according to the collaborative annotation in 2011 In terms of the keyframes which contain only annotations for some concepts the labels for th e other concepts are treated as negative Three-fold cross validation is adopted and three rounds of three-fold cross validation are performed To better evaluate the performance of the proposed framework the approaches in 8 a nd 15  are i mpl ement ed In 8 a c ompl et e g raph model w a s b ui l t wi t hout an y l i n k selection and the c onditional probabilities were utilized to model the weights of the links The parameter matrix w used in the implementation is computed using the least square method In 15 the reference concepts w ere s elected for each target concept in the ontology-based graphic model Afterwards the similarity between a reference concept and a target concept was computed based on the entropy values and used as the weight between the two concepts For a complete graph model under the current situation there are 8385 links in total for 130 concepts if the bidirectional link between two concepts is counted as two individual links After the association link generation only about 3  4 of the links are retained and proved to be signiìcant For example in one fold of the cross validation in the third round of the experiments the retained links are 335 and each target concept node has 2  58 links on average which indicates the selected links are sparse Table I shows the MAP values for all the 130 concepts for different numbers of retrieved instances For example Top10 indicates the MAP value of the top 10 retrieved instances for all concepts and the last column is the MAP value if all instances are retrieved Each value in the table is the average of the three rounds of three-fold cross validation Baseline corresponds to the MAP value of the raw scores Yusuf

in order to test the signiìcance of the improvement the Students t test is applied In this case the null hypothesis is that the proposed framework does not lead to any improvement and the p value indicates the maximum probability of making the Type I error The p values for the corresponding MAP values are shown in the last three rows of Table I  p 1   p 2 and p 3  denote the comparison of the proposed framework with baseline Yusuf and BH correspondingly The common criterion for p is 0.05 and therefore it shows that our proposed framework improves all MAP values signiìcantly The experimental results show that the Yusuf method is worse than the Baseline One possible reason is that the noisy inputs from the insigniìcant links actually confuse the models Interestingly the performance of the Yusuf method approaches baseline as the number of retrieved instances increases This was also observed in 8 and one possible reason is that the scores of all models become smaller with the increase of the retrieved instances so the effect of integrating scores turns trivial The BH approach performs better than the Baseline but still worse than the proposed framework One possible reason is that their framework models the link between two concepts as a symmetric edge which does not match the asymmetrical relationship between semantic concepts in the real world In terms of rare concepts the concepts are sorted in the ascending order according to the number of positive instances in the developing data set Table II shows the MAP values for the top ranked rare concepts For example Top5Rare means the concepts which have top 5 fewest positive instances in the developing data set Mean Positive Number means the mean value of the number of positive instances of the rare concepts in the corresponding column It can be observed that the total number of instances in the developing set is 96516 Therefore the top 5 rare concepts only have 4.2 positive instances for training The following rows show the performance comparison in a similar way as in Table II Here it shows that our proposed framework improves the MAP values for the rare concepts consistently when compared with the Baseline Yusuf and BH The relative improvement of the MAP values for the rare concepts is higher than that of the whole 130 concepts It indicates that the proposed framework is more effective for the rare concepts The two possible reasons are as follows First compared with the classiìcation model built on the target rare concept the models of the reference concepts which have more training instances perform better and the scores output from them are more reliable By integrating such scores properly the nal output score for the rare concept is better Second generally speaking the baseline MAP of the rare concepts is worse than the that of the overall 130 concepts Therefore the relative improvement of MAP for the rare concepts compared to that of all the concepts is larger More future studies will be performed to shed light on the rationales in depth To further evaluate our proposed framework a detailed analysis is performed to evaluate the contribution of each important module in it The results are shown in Table III The rst column indicates the changing of the module No Change denotes the original framework Remove Link

 0  1245  0  0207 It could be seen that the link selection module contributes the most to the performance gain This observation again shows the importance of selecting the signiìcant links In addition the posterior probability calculation module also makes relatively big contributions to the nal performance gain IV C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK This paper presents a framework that utilizes the concept relationships to improve the detection accuracies of the highlevel concepts from multimedia data A concept association network CAN is built based on the label matrix of the training data set and the generated association links By integrating the information from the reference concept nodes properly the nal score is assigned to a testing instance for the target concept node as the output Experimental results show that our proposed framework improves the MAP values for all the concepts signiìcantly Furthermore the proposed framework provides even more promising results for the challenging rare concept detection problem The future work includes extending the CAN with high-order relationships reìning the model of the afìnities by integrating the tag information developing

Fig 3 The grid structure used in the supermarket environment we use the real world distance between the centers of the corresponding grid cells The shortest path is then determined using Dijkstraês algorithm MONSTRE determines when to present new navigation instructions to the user by mapping the shortest path into a motion trajectory where each grid cell has been reduced to its center coordinates The coordinates are then processed sequentially and we calculate the angle 004 between two successive line segments i.e straight lines joining two successive coordinates We consider a cell a turning point whenever the angle 004 between two successive line segments exceeds a predeìned threshold 004 Th  Currently we use 004 Th 45 002  After analyzing the path and determining the turn points we divide the path into a number of overlapping segments Each of the two end points of a segment is either the starting grid cell the destination grid cell or a turn point While the user is moving along the path her current location is monitored and segment speciìc instructions are generated Speciìcally when entering a segment a new instruction is presented that steers the user towards the end point of that segment Furthermore if the length of the segment is long enough an intermediate instruction is also presented to help the user to stay on the correct path In our current implementation an intermediate instruction is played only if the length of a segment is at least ve grid cells To minimize the inîuence of positioning inaccuracies the instructions are presented when the estimated location of the user is within the extended neighborhood of the target grid cell The performance of MONSTRE has been evaluated in a user study with 20 participants In the study participants were given different navigation tasks and we measured the number of navigation errors and the cognitive load of the participants The results indicate that MONSTRE facilitates nding products from the store despite the challenging environment while at the same time imposing a small cognitive load on the participants see for more details W e ha v e also used MONSTRE to conduct a study that explored how different types of navigation instructions affect the attention that cusFig 4 Navigation support in Ma$$iv e  tomers pay to the supermarket environment In the study we considered two types of landmark instructions that differed in terms of their visual demand The rst type of instructions sign-based  used salient signage within the supermarket as landmarks whereas the other type of instructions productbased  used salient product-categories as the landmarks As the product categories were located within the aisles the landmarks forced the participants to actively scan the environment for the landmarks However results from the study revealed that in both conditions customers paid little attention to their surroundings Consequently  a major challenge in pro viding navigation support within supermarket environment is how to assist the customer in a way that is commercially feasible i.e not only enables customers to nd products efìciently but also ensures customers are susceptible to advertising and impulse purchases within the store environment This aspect is one of the main topics in our current research In addition to navigation we have also integrated our algorithm for identifying special offers with the indoor positioning to provide personalized and location-aware advertisements within the supermarket environment Results from a prelimi

nary study suggest that the algorithm is able to increase sales and to lead to additional impulse purchases V S UMMARY AND F UTURE W ORK This paper described the design and current status of Ma$$iv e  an intelligent mobile assistant for enhancing customerês grocery shopping experience The design of Ma$$iv e has been informed by a survey study that we conducted in a large national supermarket The current features of Ma$$iv e include support for natural language shopping lists predictive text input product search product recommendations and indoor positioning We are currently developing new functionalities as well as extending and augmenting the current functionalities First in terms of natural language interaction we are exploring how to make recipe recommendations based on the userês shopping list entries Second the results of the survey indicated that users are relatively interested in product level information One-dimensional bar codes are currently the standard way to identify grocery products and it seems unlikely that other technologies would become commonplace in the near future Mobile phone cameras have been successfully used to read one-dimensional bar codes in laboratory settings However recognizing bar codes that are small or printed on reîecting metallic surfaces is difìcult and alternative solutions for product recognition need to be investigated Instead of attempting to recognize individual products we are currently exploring the combination of computer vision and positioning for recognizing product categories by taking pictures of the shelfs of interest We also exploring the integration of WiFi positioning with pedestrian dead reckoning to improve the accuracy of the indoor positioning A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This work was supported by the Finnish

show the similar phenomenon Figure 8 shows the running time of all algorithms with min sup 3 and min conf 0  5 on all context logs From this gure we can see that the running time of BP-Growth BPGrowth-P is dramatically less than BP-Growth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R on all context logs Summary  by comprehensively analyzing the experimental results for running time we summarize the observations as follows a BP-Growth BP-Growth-P dramatically outperform BPGrowth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R in terms of running time It implies that the strategy of removing redundant data plays a more important role in reducing the running time for behavior pattern mining than the strategy of data set partition and the improvement for data set partition based algorithms is more dramatic b GCPM-H-R is roughly comparable to GCPM-H in terms of running time It implies that applying the strategy of removing redundant data to an Apriori-like algorithm only leads to very limited improvement of running time c BP-Growth-P is roughly comparable to BP-Growth in terms of running time It implies that the pseudo projection technology only has very limited effect on reducing the running time of BP-Growth VII CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we studied several strategies which may be used for improving the efìciency of behavior pattern mining in terms of computing efìciency and memory cost To be speciìc we searched some typical optimizing strategies for association rule mining and discuss the feasibility of applying them to behavior pattern mining since the two problems are similar in many aspects Moreover we proposed a novel and efìcient algorithm named BP-Growth for behavior pattern mining by combining two promising strategies The extensive experiments in a practical mobile computing environment clearly show that BP-Growth and its optimization signiìcantly outperform GCPM and other two baselines which adopt one of the two promising strategies in terms of both running time and memory cost One challenge of utilizing behavior patterns is that there usually exists thousands of behavior patterns for an individual mobile user Usually many of them are semantically similar or related and may be summarized by several representative patterns As for future work we plan to study the effective approaches to summarize lots of behavior patterns for easing the representation of user habits while maintaining as much information as possible VIII A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research was supported by grants from Nokia Research Center China Natural Science Foundation of China Grant

improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
