A Randomized Approach for Approximating the Number of Frequent Sets Mario Boley and Henrik Grosskreutz 003 Fraunhofer IAIS Schloss Birlinghoven 53754 Sankt Augustin Germany f mario.boley henrik.grosskreutz g iais.fhg.de Abstract We investigate the problem of counting the number of frequent item problem known to be intractable in terms of an exact polynomial time computation In this paper we show that it is in general also hard to approximate Subsequently a randomized counting algorithm is developed using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method While for general inputs an exponential running time is needed in order to guarantee a certain approximation bound we empirically show that the algorithm still has the desired accuracy on real-world datasets when its running time is capped polynomially 1 Introduction Frequent pattern mining is a technique that is used for data mining within several combinations of local pattern types and application domains A few examples are association rules for market basket data frequent subgraphs for molecule prediction and sequential patterns for time series data see for an o v ervie w Their unifying property is that patterns are only considered interesting if they satisfy a minimum frequency constraint i.e a certain number of records of the input dataset have to contain the pattern In contrast to most other work devoted to frequent pattern mining which deals with the development and evaluation of algorithms that list all frequent patterns in this paper we are interested in counting them quickly Knowing the relationship between frequency threshold and the resulting number of frequent patterns can for instance be used for computing a frequency-plot  i.e a plot showing all possible thresholds x-axis against the corresponding number of frequent sets y-axis Having such a plot prior to the actual mining process can for instance be used within intelligent 003 Henrik Grosskreutz was supported by the European Commission under the project iWebCare IST-2005-028055 discovery assistants IDAs in order to either pro vide user guidance for setting the frequency threshold or to tune it automatically For this purpose it is an essential requirement that the involved computation is performed quickly Indeed the problem is precisely to predict a combinatorial explosion without suffering from it    as Geerts et al 4 ha v e put it in their related study of bounding the number of candidate patterns that have to be processed within a BFS-listing of all frequent patterns In particular for dense datasets this requirement prohibits the use of any of the known exhaustive data mining algorithms that list all frequent patterns Even though these algorithms have been optimized to an impressive level in recent years they have the number of frequent sets as an inherent lower bound of their time complexity While this does not pose a problem for sparse datasets in dense ones this number behaves in essence exponentially for low frequency thresholds For that reason we are aiming at an algorithm counting the number of frequent sets in a time that does not depend on that number Since it is well known that no exact deterministic algorithm with this property can exist unless P  NP  we are aiming at a randomized approximation algorithm using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method Moreover we restrict ourselves to the case of plain frequent item which are used e.g for generating association rules In summary we are aiming at an input polynomial algorithm solving the following computational problem Problem 1 FREQUENT SETS  Given a transactional dataset and a frequency threshold compute the cardinality of the corresponding frequent set family We discuss the question of why all this is a worthwhile venture in some more detail in Section 2 After some formal de\002nitions Section 3 that are needed for the subsequent technical content we analyze theoretical limits in Section 4 As the main result of this section we show that the number of frequent sets is hard to approximate In addition we interpret some known complexity results in the context of

our problem We then develop a randomized approximation scheme in Section 5 that is integrated into a hybrid algorithm with an approximative and an exhaustive counting phase As indicated by the hardness result we show that for general inputs the algorithm's correctness cannot be guaranteed or its time complexity is not bounded polynomially However experiments we present in Section 6 constitute its applicability on several real-world and synthetic datasets A concluding discussion is given in Section 7 2 Motivation In order to raise business value of data mining or generally to make it more accessible to non-expert users approaches like Intelligent Discovery Assistants IDAs or Mining Mart ha v e been proposed Both assist a user in selecting a valid data mining process for their data Still once a user has decided on a valid process the next problem is to 002nd good parameter settings and in case a frequent pattern mining step is part of the process this usually involves a minimum frequency threshold Knowledge about the relation between frequency threshold and the corresponding number of frequent sets is very helpful in this context as it allows to control the output size and thus indirectly the output time because frequent set mining algorithms usually exhibit a time complexity that is roughly linear in the output Consequently quickly counting the frequent sets helps to make optimal use of the available time budget Moreover as we will argue below a computed frequency plot can also help semantically to setup and interpret the whole process It should be noted that the following discussion is illustrative and motivating A thorough investigation of how to choose a minimum frequency threshold justi\002es a complete study in its own right 2.1 Frequency Plots In order to explain the possible use of a frequency plot let us assume we have a dataset generated by the following illustrative and absolutely idealized underlying process Example 2 Beginner's Guide Process  There is a hobby shop carrying items for k different hobbies In particular there is a beginner's guide a i for every hobby and a corresponding starter kit consisting of items c i 1      c i;l  i   1 024 i 024 k  A usual senior customer purchases every item independent from one another with probability p c except for the beginner's guides which he will never purchase However with probability p a per hobby independent from one another a customer will pick up a new hobby and buy the corresponding beginner's guide a i  In this case he will always also purchase items c i 1 to c i;l  i  and behaves like a usual customer otherwise Clearly the most if not the only interesting association rules for this underlying process are the rules a i  c i 1    c i;l  i  for i 2 f 1      k g  All of these rules will have the maximum con\002dence 1 of 1  which measures the actual semantical value of a rule Whereas their expected support is equal to the probability p a  We generated three datasets using the above process for p a  0  1  0  13  0  16 and p c  0  6  Each of the datasets was generated with k  5 implicant items 10 different consequence items for each implicant and 5000 transactions Figure 1 shows their resulting frequency plots Depending on initial assumption on the generative process Figure 1 frequency plots there can be different strategies of inferring a good threshold from this plot First however it is necessary to clarify the motivation of introducing a minimum frequency threshold at all 2.2 Frequency Thresholds The reasons for introducing a frequency constraint can roughly be subsumed under three purposes i suppress statistically insigni\002cant results that are a mere random 003uctuation of the underlying data generating process for instance all antecedences occurring in only one transaction will induce rules with maximum con\002dence ii raise output pattern value in the sense that they are applicable to more data instances and iii allow additional pruning of search space thus making otherwise intractable tasks tractable 1 The con\002dence of a rule is the fraction of transactions containing a rule's consequence among those containing its antecedence

In particular for the last purpose the frequency threshold is often set to higher values than it would be necessary for reasons i and ii alone Clearly this can harm the analytical value of the resulting patterns because patterns that are interesting according to a primary criterion e.g con\002dence might be pruned without any statistical reason purely for the sake of performance Thus it would be desirable to set the frequency threshold to the minimum value that is reasonable with respect to reasons i and ii For the above example observe that for all three datasets the interesting rules have an expected support that lies before that point of when the plot 002nally turns to a purely exponential behavior Thus a user setting the frequency threshold to this point is expected to not miss most of them Although this must not always be the case this strategy generally aims at 002nding the most conservative threshold that preserves most interesting rules while it suppresses most of the statistically insigni\002cant sets Moreover the plots lead to a small set of reasonable candidate frequency points namely the sockets before steep exponential slopes Clearly this is an improvement when compared to the uninformed approach of trial-and-error parameter twiddling 2.3 Related Work and Objections An important related approach to raise user control in frequent set mining is listing only the topK frequent sets proposed by Wang et al in While this approach tak es care of output size control and scheduling it fails to provide the global overview of computing a frequency plot for all possible frequency valuesóa task that cannot be done using a topK miner in particular on dense datasets because the same restrictions apply to them as stated in the introduction for ordinary exhaustive miners This may inspire a general objection to the above motivation Why is it useful to compute regions of the plot that correspond to frequent set families so large that they are impossible to list in a subsequent mining step The answer to this lies in the fact that frequency is usually only a subsidiary interestingness criterion While the frequency plot shows the effect of that criterion alone the 002nal pattern set may result from a conjunction of several constraints e.g con\002dence many of which can be used for pruning already during frequent set listing as pointed out by Pei and Han  Thus the resulting output f amily  albeit its lo w frequency threshold can in fact be listed effectively 3 Preliminaries In this section we recall and 002x notions from frequent set mining randomized approximation algorithms and Markov chains that are needed in the subsequent discussion Frequent Set Mining Let E be a 002nite set A dataset D over E is a 002nite multiset with D 022 E for all D 2 D  In the context of frequent pattern mining the elements of E are often called items and the elements of D transactions  For a set F 022 E we de\002ne its support multiset as D  F   f D 2 D  D 023 F g  Frequency thresholds can be speci\002ed as absolute or relative thresholds depending on what is more convenient in a given situation For an absolute integer threshold f  F is called f frequent or frequent in D if jD  F  j 025 f respectively for a relative real threshold f 2 0  1  if jD  F  j 025 f jDj  The family of all f frequent sets in D is denoted F  D  f  or just as F when D and f are clear from the context Probabilistic Approximation Algorithms A bounded probability BP algorithm for a problem with instances X and possible solutions Y speci\002ed by a correctness relation R 022 X 002 Y is a probabilistic algorithm A such that it holds that P  x A  x  2 R  025 3  4  The constant 3  4 appearing in the de\002nition has no signi\002cance other than being strictly between 1  2 and 1  Any two success probabilities from this interval can be reached from one another by a small number of repetitions of the corresponding algorithm and computing a combined result depending on the nature of Y see  No w we consider the case when Y is the set of natural numbers N  A randomized approximation scheme for a mapping f  X  N is a BP-algorithm A taking arguments x 2 X and 017 2 0  1 satisfying the relaxed correctness predicate R 017  f  x y   1 000 017  f  x  024 y 024 1  017  f  x  g  i.e A satis\002es P 1 000 017  f  x  024 A  x 017  024 1  017  f  x  025 3  4  1 Such an algorithm is called fully polynomial if its time complexity is bounded in a polynomial in size  x  and 1 017  A weaker notion of approximation is given by the following de\002nition An algorithm A is called an 013 factor approximation of f or said to approximate f within 013  if it satis\002es the correctness relation R 017  f  x y   f  x  013  x  024 y 024 013  x  f  x  g where 013  x  is a function that may grow in the size of x  Clearly an ef\002cient approximation scheme can act as an ef\002cient c factor approximation algorithm for all constants c  1  Markov Chains A discrete Markov chain on state space 012 is a sequence of discrete random variables M  X 1  X 2     with domain 012 satisfying the Markov condition i.e P  X n 1  x j X 1  x 1      X n  x n  is equal to P  X n 1  x j X n  x n  for all n 2 N and x x 1      x n 2 012  Thus given a probability distribution on the initial state M is completely speci\002ed by the state transition probabilities P  x y   P  X n 1  y j X n  x  of all x y 2 012 that do not depend on n  The j 012 j 002 j 012 j matrix containing P  x y  in column x and row y is a stochastic matrix

we denote by P  The t th power of this matrix contains the probability of going from x to y in t steps P t  x y   P  X n  t  y j X n  x   We call a state y 2 012 reachable from a state x 2 012 if there is a t 2 N such that P t  x y   0  A Markov chain M is called aperiodic if for all x y 2 012 with x is reachable from y there is a t 0 2 N such that for all t 025 t 0 it holds that P t  x y   0  and it is called irreducible if any two states are reachable from one another Finally M is called ergodic if it is irreducible and aperiodic Any ergodic Markov chain has a unique limiting stationary distribution 031  012  0    i.e for all states x y 2 012 it holds that lim t 1 P t  x y   031  y   Moreover if there is a function 031 0  012  0   satisfying the detailed balance condition 8 x y 2 012  031 0  x  P  x y   031 0  y  P  y x  then 031 0 is a stationary distribution It follows that ergodic Markov chains with symmetric transition probabilities always converge to the uniform distribution  The distance from the t step distribution of a Markov chain to its stationary distribution can be measured by the total variation distance k P t  031 k tv  max x 2 012 1  2 P y 2 012 j P t  x y  000 031  y  j  Using this de\002nition we can de\002ne the mixing time of M by 034  017   min f t 2 N  8 t 0 025 t k P t 0  031 k tv 024 017 g as the minimum number of steps one has to simulate M until the resulting distribution is guaranteed to be 017 close to its stationary distribution For more details and results about Markov chains and their mixing time we refer to Randall's survey 4 Problem Complexity Gunopulos et al proved in P hardness 2 of FREQUENT SETS implying that there is no exact algorithm for that problem unless P  NP  They did this using a reduction from the P complete problem of computing the number of satisfying truth assignments of a given monotone 2CNF formula i.e a conjunctive normal form formula containing only two positive literals per clause It was shown by Zuckerman that this problem and in f act e v en its logarithm is hard to approximate within a factor of n 017 for instances of size n  The reduction in ho we v er  transforms a 2-CNF for mula into a transaction dataset with n items such that the number of satisfying truth assignments corresponds to the number of sets that are not 1 frequent and then it uses the fact that the number of infrequent sets is equal to 2 n minus the number of frequent sets Hence the construction is highly non-parsimonious i.e the numbers usually change drastically without any reasonable bound As a 2 Essentially P is the class of problems asking to count the number of solutions where it is possible in polynomial time to verify a single solution  consequence relative approximation guarantees are not preserved by that reduction and it does not lead to a hardness result for approximating FREQUENT SETS Still it is an important side note that the two aforementioned theorems together do imply the strong result that there is no ef\002cient approximation algorithm for counting the number of infrequent sets even if the absolute frequency threshold is 002xed to 1  This is an interesting difference to the same restriction for FREQUENT SETS When restricted to frequency threshold 1 approximating the number of frequent sets becomes equivalent to approximating the number of satisfying assignments of a given DNF-formula and for this problem there is a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme Now for acquiring a hardness result for the number of frequent sets we have to choose a different starting point namely the hardness of approximating a frequent set of maximum cardinality With this approach we can show the following result Theorem 3 Unless for all 017  0 and for all problems in NP there is a BP-algorithm that runs in time 2 n 017 for instances of size n  the following holds There is a constant 016 F such that there is no polynomial time BP-algorithm that given a dataset D over n items and a frequency threshold f  approximates log jF  D  f  j within n 016 F  Proof It was shown in that under the same assumption as in the claim there is no polynomial time algorithm approximating a frequent set of maximum cardinality within n 016 BC  That result was based on Khot's seminal inapproximability result for Bipartite Clique which in fact ruled out BP-algorithms under the above assumption see where you can also 002nd more information about the magnitude of 016 BC  Furthermore it is easy to prove that approximating only the maximum number k such that there is a frequent set of size k is polynomially equivalent to the actual construction of a corresponding set Thus it is suf\002cient to show that an algorithm for approximating the logarithm of jFj can be used to approximate this number k  Since all subsets of a maximizing frequent set F 2 F with j F j  k are also frequent it holds that jFj 025 2 k  On the other hand all frequent set are of size at most k and thus jFj 024 022 n k 023  022 n k 000 1 023  001 001 001  022 n 0 023 024 n k  Now suppose a BP-algorithm A approximates log jFj within n 016  It follows that k 024 log jFj 024 k log n  log jFj  log n 024 k 024 log jFj  A  D  t    n 016 log n  024 k 024 n 016 A  D  t   Now observe that for any 016  016 BC  the expression n 016 log n is asymptotically dominated by n 016 BC  say starting from the

constant n  016   Choose 016 F to be any number strictly between 0 and 016 BC  Then modify A such that it looks up the true result of all 002nitely many instances of size less than n  016 F  in a hard-coded table Then A is a BP-algorithm approximating the maximum cardinality of a frequent set within n 016 BC as required Although the complexity assumption of this theorem is stronger than P 6  NP it is still a widely believed standard assumption Moreover non-existence of an 013 approximation of the logarithm of a number implies non-existence of an 2 013 approximation to the actual number Thus we have strong evidence that there is no reasonable approximation algorithm for the general FREQUENT SETS problem and in particular no fully polynomial approximation scheme That said there may still be algorithms allowing a good approximation for a wide range of practical relevant datasets With this in mind we are going to derive a randomized approximation algorithm in the next section 5 Algorithm 5.1 Monte Carlo Estimation The perhaps simplest Monte Carlo approach for counting the number of frequent set would be the following Uniformly generate an element F 022 E  return 1 if F 2 F  and return 0 otherwise The expected value of this experiment is jFj  2 j E j  Thus taking the mean of suf\002ciently many independent repetitions and multiplying it by 2 j E j is a correct randomized approximation scheme It is however not fully polynomial This is due to the fact that jFj  2 j E j can be as small as 1  2 n for an instance of size n  For such instances the expected number of trials before the 002rst 1 turn-out appears is not bounded by a polynomial in n  But as long as the returned result is 0 the solution does not satisfy any relative approximation guarantee and in particular not Equation 1 The standard solution to this problem is to decompose the result into a number of factors each of which having a reasonable lower bound In our case this can be done as follows From now on we 002x some order of the items E  e 1      e n  Then for i 2 f 1      n g let F i  f F 022 E  jD  F  j 025 f and 8 e j 2 F j 024 i g be the family of frequent sets containing only elements from the 002rst i items With this we can rewrite the quantity to compute jFj  jF n j as the product jF s j n 000 1 Y i  s jF i 1 j jF i j  jF n j 2 with some starting index s 2 f 1     n 000 1 g  It follows directly from the de\002nition that F i 022 F i 1  Since moreover for each element F 2 F i 1 n F i the set F n f i  1 g must be in F i  it holds that jF i 1 n F i j 024 jF i j and thus 1 025 jF i j  jF i 1 j 025 1  2  3 With this we can design a Monte Carlo algorithm as follows Approximate the reciprocal 026 i  jF i 000 1 j  jF i j of each factor separately count jF s j for an appropriate s exhaustively and then compute jFj through Equation 2 For an F drawn uniformly at random from F i let Z i denote the random variable that takes on value 1 if F 2 F i 000 1 and 0 otherwise Then Z i is a Bernoulli experiment with P  Z i   026 i  Moreover 026 Z i   Z 1 i  001 001 001  Z  t  i  t with t 025 1 and Z  j  i independent copies of Z i is an unbiased estimator of 026 i with variance Var 002 026 Z i 003  026 i 1 000 026 i  t  Then an algorithm A returning Z 000 1 jF s j with Z  026 Z s 1    026 Z n is a randomized algorithm approximating jFj  Once we have a procedure that can draw an element from the sets F i uniformly at random the implementation of A is straightforward This problem is approached in Section 5.2 For the rest of this subsection we discuss the conditions under which the above algorithm is a correct randomized approximation scheme for jFj as speci\002ed by Equation 1 This analysis closely follows b ut is ne v erthel ess gi v en here for the sake of completeness In order to derive the required number of repetitions for each Bernoulli experiment one can instantiate Chebycheff's inequality as follows P  j Z 000 E  Z  j 025 017 E  Z  024 Var  Z  017 2 E  Z  2  4 So a bound on this probability can be established by appropriately bounding the ratio of Z s variance to the square of its expectation For the estimator of each factor 026 Z i we know that Var 002 026 Z i 003 E 002 026 Z i 003 2  026 i 1 000 026 i  t\026 2 i  1 t  026 000 1 i 000 1 024 1 t 5 where the last inequality follows from Equation 3 Thus if we set the number of trials t to trials  s 017  with trials  s 017   5 n 000 s  017 000 2 we can deduce for the product Var 002 026 Z s 1    026 Z n 003  026 s 1    026 n  2  n Y i  s 1  1  Var 002 026 Z i 003 026 2 i  000 1 024 1  1 t  n 000 s 000 1  000 1  017 2  5 n 000 s  001 n 000 s 000 1 024 exp  017 2  5 000 1 024  017 2  4  Plugging this bound into Equation 4 it follows that Z satis\002es Equation 1 and thus that an algorithm simulating it is a randomized approximation scheme as required

5.2 Frequent Set Sampling In the naive Monte Carlo algorithm sketched in the beginning of Section 5.1 the necessary number of trials was prohibitive while the required uniform sampling from the power set did not pose a problem Now the situation is different The required number of trials is polynomially bounded but it is unclear how to sample uniformly from the frequent set families F k  D  f  for k  s  1      n as required for estimating the factors 026 k  We approach this problem by a repeated application of the following procedure Let F old be the current element of F k  Then 1 with probability 1  2 set F new to F old  otherwise 2 uniformly draw an i 2 f 1      k g 3 if e i 2 F old set F new to  F old n f e i g   otherwise 4 if  e i  F old  2 F then set F new to  F old  f e i g   This procedure simulates one step of a Markov chain M F k on F k with state transition probabilities P  F F 0   1  2 k for F F 0 2 F with j F 001 F 0 j  1 where 001 denotes symmetric difference All remaining probability is assigned to the self-loops i.e P  F F   1 000 jf F 0 2 F  j F 001 F 0 j  1 gj  2 k  So the transition probabilities and thus the corresponding state transition matrix P as well as the reachability relation of M F k are symmetric Together with the fact that F is closed under taking subsets this implies that M F k is irreducible because all states are reachable from   Moreover there are non-zero selfloop probabilities for every state This implies that M F k is also aperiodic and together with irreducibility this means that M F k is ergodic For an ergodic Markov chain we know that there is a unique distribution 031 that it converges to and that is stationary i.e P 031  031  Since P is symmetric 031 must be the uniform distribution Hence simulating M F k for suf\002ciently many steps can be used to sample a frequent set from F k uniformly at random as required The question is however for how many steps we have to simulate M F k until it is close enough to the uniform distribution Let M t F k  F  denote the random variable corresponding to simulating M F k for t steps starting in state F  The mixing time 034  017 0  is de\002ned as the smallest number such that the total variation distance between the distribution of M t 0 F k  F  is 017 0 close to the uniform distribution for all possible starting states F 2 F  Here we use the symbol 017 0 in order to set it apart from the accuracy parameter 017 of the algorithm Since we will switch to a heuristic for the number of steps below we will not explain what values of 017 0 would preserve the overall approximation guarantee Instead we refer to for the connection between counting and almost uniform sampling  The reason for using a heuristic is that in line with Theorem 3 a general polynomial bound in size  D  to the mixing time 034 should not be expected Indeed we can observe the following Proposition 4 For n 2 N the Markov chain M F n with frequency threshold f  1 and D  ff 1 g  f 2      n g  f n  2      2 n gg on items E  f 1      2 n g has mixing time 034  017 0  of at least 2 n 000 1 log\(1  2 017 0   Proof Let P  X  denote the power set of a set X  For n 2 N the 1 frequent sets of the dataset given in the claim are F  ff 1 gg  P  f 2      n g   P  f n  2      2 n g  with the cardinality jFj  2 n  The conductance of M F n is de\002ned as 010  min f 010 S  S 022 F  D  1  031  S  024 1  2 g with 010 S  1 031  S  P x 2 S;y 2F n S 031  x  P  x y   It is a well-known fact see for instance that the mixing time of a Markov chain is bounded from below by the conductance as follows 034  017  025 1 4\010 log 1 2 017  6 Now choose S  ff 1 gg  P  f 2      n g  n f;g  Then j S j  2 n 000 1 and consequently 031  S   1  2  010 024 010 S  P x 2 S;y 62 S 031  x  P  x y  031  S   2 X x 2ff 1 g  f n gg 031  x  P  x    2 n 1 2 n 1 2\(2 n   1 2 n 1 Plugging this bound into Equation 6 yields the claim Intuitively the reason for the slow mixing time on these instances is that the probability of crossing over from one of the two blocks P  f 2      n g  and P  f n 1      2 n 000 1 g  to the other is very low compared to their sizes This situation is obviously rather arti\002cial and it is a reasonable assumption that most real-world datasets do not possess such strictly separated blocks For that reason we use for the rest of this paper steps  k 017   017 000 1 k ln k as a heuristic for the required number of steps This is of the same order as the expected number of steps until each item has been drawn at least once coupon collector's theorem reasonable minimum requirement As we will see in the experimental section this heuristic works absolutely 002ne for different test datasets Clearly there are other possible choices for steps  k 017   in particular when there is prior knowledge of the input dataset

5.3 Hybrid Counting Plugging together the Monte Carlo framework with the Markov chains M F  001  we already have an approximation algorithm As indicated in Section 5.1 we have to count a starting factor 026 s exhaustively It remains to decide to what value s should be setóa decision that requires some analysis of the involved time complexities For that we regard one frequency check as unit step We will drop 017 from the parameter lists of trials  001  and steps  001  for ease of notation as it is constant throughout one call of the algorithm Estimating 026 i requires at most trials  s  steps  i  frequency checks On the other hand counting jF s j exhaustively can take up to 2 s frequency checks in case all subsets of E s are frequent This rough bound can be used to make an initial choice for s by choosing it such that it minimizes the estimated overall running time 2 s  T apx  s  with T apx  s   trials  s  n X i  s 1 steps  i  denoting the expected time for approximating all remaining factors Clearly more knowledge about the used implementationsóin particular that of the exhaustive mineróis likely to lead to an improvement of this choice Additionally we can further improve our choice of the starting index s  Denote the index found by the considerations above as s 003  The loose a priori bound used there can be improved once we have counted F s 003  We know that jF s 003 1 n F s 003 j 024 jF s 003 j see Equation 3 Thus in case jF s 003 j  T apx  s 003  000 T apx  s 003  1 we can increase s to s 003  1 and add jF s 003 1 n F s 003 j counted exhaustively to jF s j  Clearly as long as the above condition remains true for the new s it amortizes to repeat this step The resulting algorithm counts F s for the 002nal s chunkwise as jF s j  jF s 003 j  jF s 003 1 n F s 003 j  001 001 001  jF s n F s 000 1 j  For the exhaustive counting tasks it is desirable to use one of the existing highly optimized frequent set listing algorithm Let Dj i denote the dataset in which all transactions have been restricted to the 002rst i items Observe that jF  D  f e s g  j s 000 1  j is equal to jF s  D  n F s 000 1  D  j  Thus one external call of the exhaustive miner with the dataset D  f e s g  j s 000 1 suf\002ces to compute the latter quantity This concludes the presentation of techniques used in our counting procedure A 002nal pseudocode incorporating all ideas is given with Algorithm 1 Using the heuristic steps  k   017 000 1 k ln k it performs O 000 017 000 3 n 2 ln n 001 frequency checks Algorithm 1 Hybrid Frequent Set Counting Input  dataset D on items E  f e 1      e n g  frequency threshold f 2 f 1      jDjg  accuracy 017 2 0   Require M F k mixes in steps  k  Output  q with P 1 000 017  jFj 024 q 024 1 017  jFj  025 3  4 1 exhaustive phase 2 s  argmin s 0 024 n 2 s 0  T apx  s 0  3 S  exhaustive  Dj s  f  4 while S  T apx  s  000 T apx  s  1 do 5 S  S  exhaustive  D  f e s 1 g  j s  f  6 s  s  1 7 approximative phase 8 for k  s  1      n do 9 026 k  0 10 for i  1      trials  s 017  do 11 F  M steps  k  F k    12 if e k 62 F then 026 k  026 k  1 13 026 k  026 k  trials  s 017  14 return S Q n i  s 026 000 1 i 6 Evaluation In this section we present experiments contrasting the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm with counting via exhaustive enumeration The experiments are performed with respect to performance as well as accuracy  017  0  5 was used throughout all experiments As a representative exhaustive miner we used the modi\002ed FPgrowth algorithm by Grahne and Zhu whose C implementation is publicly available This implementation has shown to rank among the fastest exhaustive miners in the competitive workshop FIMI In the follo wing we will refer to this implementation as F P Z HU  The benchmark datasets are also taken from the FIMI repository supplemented by synthetic datasets generated according to the beginner's guide process Example 2 with different choices for the probabilities p a and p c  For Algorithm 1 we used a Java implementation that is available online together with the arti\002cial datasets  http://www-kd.iai.unibonn.de/index.php?page=people details&id=16 or corresponding main page The experiments were performed on an Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 with 3 GB of RAM running Windows XP All 002gures below use relative frequency thresholds 6.1 A Note on the Implementation The central part of Algorithm 1 is a large number of Markov chain simulations As a 002rst optimization it is possible to do better than just simulating M F k for k

s  1      n naively Instead we 002rst buffer the required number steps  k  of random item indices for a single random walk Since the result of each random walk F is only used to evaluate the Bernoulli experiment of whether item e k is an element of F  we can simply stop the Markov chain simulation after the last occurrence of k in the buffer Similar if e k was put into F due to the next to last occurrence of k we can also stop the chain simulation at that point Since in this case the last occurrence of k will surely cause the item e k to be removed from F again we can directly report that result The really dominant operation however is the test of whether a set I  F  f e g that is an augmentation of a frequent set F with a single item e remains frequent This corresponds to step 4 of the Markov chain see Section 5.2 Since this test has to be performed roughly every second step of each random walk it is crucial for the overall performance of our algorithm In order to decrease the cost of this operation our implementation makes use of FP-trees  Basically  an FP-t ree is a compact representation of the dataset where the transactions in the original dataset are represented as paths in a pre\002x-tree Since overlapping transactions share a branch-pre\002x this usually achieves a signi\002cant compression In addition there are node lists connecting all nodes representing the same item The frequency test for a set is done by selecting its least frequent item and following its node list in the FP-tree adding the counts of all nodes whose parent nodes include all items in the set I  As a minor optimization we have stored at each node a hash set containing the items in the parent nodes While this information is redundant it allows to ef\002ciently determine if a node contributes to the frequency of I  6.2 Accuracy We now report a series of accuracy experiments that are summarized in Figure 2 Our algorithm was applied 100 dataset median low quart max dev failed BMS-POS 0.004 0.004 0.05 0 BMW-Web 0.003 0.003 0.109 0 chess 0.106 0.159 0.56 0.0025 connect 0.092 0.169 0.49 0 mushroom 0.061 0.089 0.24 0 pumsb 0.139 0.297 1.05 0.07 pumsb-star 0.044 0.146 0.372 0 PC60PA13 0.029 0.043 0.139 0 Figure 2 deviation from exact solution times to each combination of one of eight test datasets with one of four frequency thresholds resulting in a total of 3200 runs per dataset A run fails if the reported result deviates from the true number of frequent sets by more than 50 as we used 017  0  5 as accuracy parameter If the overall approximation guarantee holds we expect the fraction of failed runs to be below 1  4 Equation 1 As desired this was the case on all of the eight test datasets In fact in our experiments the highest ratio of failed runs was 0  07 for the pumsb dataset Thus the observed success rate was consistent with the probabilistic approximation guarantee for all datasets and in fact we experienced much better error bounds The table also shows median median lower quartile low quart and maximum max dev of the experienced relative deviation Figure 3 accuracy on chess Figure 3 shows accuracy results on chess in more detail For different frequency thresholds it shows on a logarithmic scale the exact number of sets exact count computed exhaustively the upper and lower 50 deviation limits upper limit and lower limit as well as the result of the randomized algorithm in a series of 16 runs mcmc count The 002gure shows that in most randomized runs the approximated result lies in the desired deviation interval The 002gure does not contain the exact number of sets for the lowest thresholds because these could not be computed by the exhaustive miner We close this subsection by presenting an approximated frequency plot computed for a dataset generated by the example process from Section 2 We refer to this dataset as PC60PA10  because it is an instantiation of this general process with probabilities p c  0  6 and p a  0  1  The result is shown in Figure 4 together with the exact curve and illustrates that the randomized algorithm provides an adequate approximation of the exact plot 6.3 Runtime Next we compare the runtime of our randomized algorithm with that of F P Z HU on several datasets We start with

Figure 4 frequency plot for PC60PA10 counting is infeasible That said on sparse datasets it is hard to compete with the sophisticated and highly ef\002cient frequent set mining algorithm and implementations the data mining community has emerged during the last decade Future Work There are several possible optimizations for Algorithm 1 we did not investigate in this paper For instance in order to speed up frequency tests in subsequent Markov chain simulations it appears to be promising to store maximal frequent sets as well as minimal infrequent sets as they are visited Furthermore the method proposed in this work is not directly optimized towards drawing a frequency-plot i.e it does not bene\002t from the situation when there is more than one frequency threshold for which FREQUENT SETS has to be solved This setting has room for extensive performance improvements that should be explored in future research Some straightforward observations are Exhaustive miners clearly do bene\002t from this situation as they can build up the whole plot by just one run with the lowest involved frequency threshold Similar the Monte Carlo algorithm can acquire a lower bound for F i  f   F i 1  f  already while sampling from F i 1  f 000 1 during the run for threshold f 000 1  Improved lower bounds can then be used to reduce the number of trials for their corresponding factor 026 i  There is another possible speed-up along these lines that is applicable in the single threshold case as well Deriving empirical bounds on the variance of each factor would also allow to reduce the required number of trials On a more global scale an important next step is to investigate whether the randomized counting approach can be extended to other pattern classes like closed sets or graph mining This extension promises to be both challenging and bene\002cial as the cost of exhaustive mining generally increases with the pattern complexity Acknowledgment The authors wish to thank Thomas G  artner for the helpful insights he provided them into Markov chains References  R Bayardo B Goethals and M J Zaki editors Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations 2004  volume 126 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings  CEUR-WS.org 2004  A Bernstein F  Pro v ost and S Hill T o w ard intelligent assistance for a data mining process An ontology-based approach for cost-sensitive classi\002cation IEEE Trans on Knowl and Data Eng  17\(4 2005  M Bole y  On approximating minimum infrequent and maximum frequent sets In Discovery Science  pages 68ñ77 2007  F  Geerts B Goethals and J V  D Bussche T ight upper bounds on the number of candidate patterns ACM Trans Database Syst  30\(2 2005  G Grahne and J Zhu Ef 002ciently using pre\002x-trees in mining frequent itemsets In FIMI'03 Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  2003  D Gunopulos R Khardon H Mannila S Saluja H T oi v onen and R S Sharma Discovering all most speci\002c sentences ACM Trans Database Syst  28\(2 2003  J Han and M Kam ber  Data Mining Concepts and Techniques  Morgan Kaufmann 2000  M Jerrum and A Sinclair  The mark o v chain monte carlo method an approach to approximate counting and integration In Approximation algorithms for NP-hard problems  pages 482ñ520 PWS Publishing Co Boston MA USA 1997  M R Jerrum  L G V aliant and V  V  V azirani Random generation of combinatorial structures from a uniform distribution Theor Comput Sci  43\(2-3 1986  R M Karp M Luby  and N Madras Monte-carlo approximation algorithms for enumeration problems J Algorithms  10\(3 1989  S Khot Ruling out ptas for graph min-bisecti on densest subgraph and bipartite clique In Foundations of Computer Science  pages 136ñ145 Washington DC USA 2004 IEEE Computer Society  K Morik and M  Scholz The miningmart approach In GI Jahrestagung  pages 811ñ818 2002  J Pei and J Han Can we push more constraints into frequent pattern mining In KDD  pages 350ñ354 2000  D Randall Rapidly mixing mark o v chains with applications in computer science and physics Computing in Science and Engineering  8\(2 2006  L G V aliant The comple xity of computing the permanent Theor Comput Sci  8:189ñ201 1979  J W ang J Han Y  Lu and P  Tzv etk o v  TFP An ef 002cient algorithm for mining top-k frequent closed itemsets IEEE Trans Knowl Data Eng  17\(5 2005  D Zuck erman On unapproximable v ersi ons of np-complete problems SIAM J Comput  25\(6 1996

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
