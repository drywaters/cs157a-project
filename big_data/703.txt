to minimise unplanned equipment downtime are therefore significant factors in service support required to guarantee availability throughout operational life A major component of this capability is the provision of diagnostic and prognostic tools through advanced health monitoring Condition monitoring employing novelty methods is therefore a key aspect of this process In novelty detection or one-class classification a model of normality is constructed from normal data with significant 
deviations from that model classified as abnormal 1 In the field of condition monitoring this technique is particularly well-suited to the identification of event precursors in data sets where the number of abnormal examples is too small to adopt a conventional faultdetection multi-class classification approach This is a typical scenario in high-integrity systems such as gasturbine engines in which faults are very rare in comparison with long 
periods of normal operation 2 Existing Work Current methods of novelty detection in aerospace gasturbine engine data suffer from a number of disadvantages 1 A novelty threshold is set on the model output such that data exceeding this threshold are deemed abnormal this is the decision boundary The setting of this novelty threshold often relies on a heuristic approach 1 Such heuristics are typically derived from engineering 1 


experience and have no principled quantifiable measure of the likelihood of false detections which is required for making business decisions regarding the operation of condition monitoring This reliance on heuristic expertise also makes transferral of knowledge between engineering projects difficult typically the setting of novelty thresholds is performed in a heuristic time-consuming manner for each new engine design This also precludes the use of the system in an automated on-line setting as the model's novelty thresholds cannot be set without human intervention 3 2 Many high-integrity systems are susceptible to the presence of noisy data which can result in undesirable false-positive novelty detections In the analysis of gasturbine engines for example the cost associated with a false-positive alarm is particularly high and must be reduced as much as possible while still being sufficiently sensitive to detect episodes of abnormality 2 3 Existing approaches require an explicit training period sometimes over 50 flights in duration for aircraft engines 4,5 during which the model cannot perform novelty detection It is desirable that novelty detection is performed as early as possible ideally from the entry of the system into service This paper presents the results of an investigation into a new method of novelty detection that overcomes these disadvantages Paper Overview In Section 2 we describe the vibration data domain used in the investigation described by this paper introducing challenges for the novelty detection process that arise due to the nature of aerospace gas-turbine vibration Section 3 describes a proposed Bayesian extension to extreme value statistics that allows the setting of novelty thresholds to be performed in a principled probabilistic manner and which allows novelty detection to take place during model training The application of the technique to several large data sets of vibration data recorded from a modem gasturbine is described in Section 4 and results of novelty detection are presented Finally Section 5 discusses the advantages and limitations of the proposed technique and introduces topics for further research 2 GAS-TURBINE VIBRATION DATA Modem aerospace gas-turbine engines divide the task of air compression from atmospheric pressure to that ultimately required within the combustion chamber into several stages Many gas-turbine engines within the civil aerospace market involve three consecutive compression stages the low pressure LP intermediate pressure IP and high pressure HP stages 6 Air passes through each stage as it travels from the front of the engine to the rear being further compressed by each until it reaches the combustion chamber Each of the compressor stages is driven by its own turbine assembly resulting in three corresponding turbine units situated within the exhaust stream at the rear of the engine Each compressor is linked to its corresponding turbine by a separate shaft which are mounted concentrically In threecompressor engines these are named the LP shaft the IP shaft and the HP shaft The operating point of the engine is often defined in terms of the rotational speed of these shafts 7 Transducers are mounted on various points of the engine assembly for the measurement of engine vibration Vibration data used for investigations described in this paper were acquired using the QUICK acquisition system 8 that computes spectral representation of engine vibration via high-resolution FFTs at rate 5 Hz for each sensor output Engine vibration is assumed to be pseudo-stationary over this measurement period such that the generated FFTs may be assumed to be close approximations of actual engine vibration power spectra Tracked Orders A tracked order is the fundamental data type used in the investigation described by this paper and is defined to be the amplitude of engine vibration measured within a narrow frequency band centred on the fundamental or a harmonic of the rotational frequency of a shaft 4 During normal engine operation most vibration energy is present within tracked orders centred on the fundamental frequency of each rotating shaft we term these the fundamental tracked orders Using the terms LP IP and HP to refer to engine shafts we define fundamental tracked orders associated with those shafts to be JLP lIP and JHP respectively Vibration Signatures We define a vibration signature to be the vibration amplitude or phase of a tracked order measured over a range of speeds of the corresponding shaft For example a signature may be constructed from IHP vibration data measured as a function of the speed co of the HP shaft Tracked order vibration is measured across the speed range   O 100 2600 maximum speed of the corresponding shaft This speed range is subdivided into B equal bins defining B sub-ranges of o Within each bin b  1 B vibration amplitude or phase values observed within the corresponding sub-range of shaft speeds are collected Figure 1 shows an example vibration signature in which amplitude of vibration lxl is shown against shaft speed o for B  400 bins on the horizontal axis Mean vibration amplitude u can be seen to be generally increasing with 2 


shaft speed while maximum variance of lxl occurs at approximately o  5000 In this paper we consider only vibration amplitude the use of phase is considered as future work in Section 5 1D,5  05 lo\(1 20 40 M sQ m 8 90 PI  shaft speed Figure 1 A vibration signature showing vibration amplitude lxl against shaft speed a Mean vibration amplitude u is shown as a yellow line plotted through the centre of each distribution Example novelty thresholds are shown as red lines above and below u Existing Use of Vibration Signatures Previous approaches construct a speed-based vibration signature from vibration values observed during a single engine run which could be either a single flight or a single ground-based test cycle 4,5,7,9 The vibration values in each of the B bins are averaged resulting in a vector of B average vibration amplitudes for each engine run A model of normality is then constructed from these B-dimensional vectors using clustering methods 10 or a Support Vector Machine 4 This has been shown to allow the separation of vibration signatures from normal and abnormal flights However these methods suffer from the three disadvantages noted in Section 1 reliance on heuristic expertise potential for over-sensitivity resulting in false alarms and the requirement for a training period during which novelty detection does not take place Furthermore by only using the mean vibration value in each speed bin useful information regarding the full distribution of vibration data is discarded For the purposes of the investigation described by this paper we wish to consider the full distribution of vibration values within each of the B speed bins For each bin b we will find lower and upper novelty thresholds hmin and hmax respectively such that if a flight contains vibration classified abnormal Example novelty thresholds are shown in Figure 1 as red lines 3 THEORY This section describes the proposed method of setting novelty thresholds in each speed bin b such that the previously-identified disadvantages are overcome First conventional approaches to setting novelty thresholds are described which are seen to result in oversensitivity to noisy in the normal data Secondly the field of extreme value theory EVT is presented as a statistical method for setting novelty thresholds that can overcome this sensitivity to noise but which has further disadvantages of its own when less than 50 engine runs of data are available Finally a novel Bayesian extension to extreme value statistics is presented that overcomes this requirement for large amounts of data by modelling uncertainty in our estimate of the data distribution This allows novelty thresholds to be set using as few as 2 engine runs of data and which adapt to new data as more engine runs are completed Conventional Methods for Setting Novelty Thresholds Given the distribution of vibration amplitudes within a speed bin b conventional methods of setting novelty thresholds could be used in which a statistical model is fit to the data giving an estimate of the underlying data distribution p\(x Approaches to this vary from parametric approaches in which the data are assumed to be generated from a known distribution such as the Gaussian distribution to semi-parametric approaches such as using a Gaussian Mixture Model 11 The novelty threshold is then set in the tail of this distribution p\(x often using the cumulative distribution such that P\(x  1-H where H is the probability of observing an abnormal event e.g H 10-6 An example is shown in Figure 2 in which a Gaussian distribution has been fitted to normal vibration data in a speed bin b and an upper novelty threshold hmax set in its tail here using the cumulative probability distribution P\(X  1_10-6 However because the novelty threshold is set far into the tail of the distribution it occurs where p\(x takes very small values and where the gradient of p\(x and P\(x is almost zero Thus small changes in the normal data can result in significant changes in the location of the novelty threshold making it oversensitive to noise amplitudes falling outside the range hmin hmax it will be 3

Experimental Methodology Given that each data set contains data from a separate engine an engine-specific approach was simulated by considering each data set separately To simulate the on-line novelty detection process we step through each data set flight-by-flight each flight resulting in a 20-bin signature for each of the three fundamental tracked orders Stepping through flights from 2 n at flight n we will compare data from the current flight against a model of normality constructed from the previous 1 n-i flights Thus at flight n for each of the B speed bins we form a data set from the N 3 maxima from the 1 n-I flight signatures observed so far treating each tracked order separately I.e at flight n we have a distribution of 3\(n-1 maxima for each of the B speed bins for each of the three tracked orders This is repeated separately for minima As described in Section 3 we can now set lower and upper novelty thresholds hmin and hmax in each speed bin We set thresholds using three methods for comparison Method 1 conventional ML-based EVT as described in Section3 Method 2 the proposed Bayesian-EVT method Method 3 a heuristic method currently used by domain experts This latter method sets novelty thresholds hmin and hmax for observed data X as follows hmax  lx  KImax\(X hmin u KL08x-min\(X 8 where ux is the mean of X and K is some constant chosen heuristically on a model-by-model basis to best separate normal data from abnormal data typically taking values intherangeK 1.2 1.5 Classification Thus for each of the three methods at flight n we have set novelty thresholds hmin and hmax in each of the B  20 speed bins for each of the three fundamental tracked orders A method classifies a flight tracked order signature abnormal if it contains vibration data that exceed novelty thresholds in two or more speed bins This latter restriction removes the potential for single-point noise spikes to cause a tracked order signature to be classified abnormal according to the agreement between the classification of a tracked order signature output by the novelty detection method normal or abnormal and presence or absence of an engine event or precursor event as described in Table 1 The sensitivity is the proportion of tracked order signatures containing actual engine events that were correctly classified as abnormal Sensitivity  TP TP FN The specificity is the proportion of tracked order signatures containing no actual engine events that were correctly classified as normal Specificity  TN TN  FP 10 These two metrics are often used for comparing the performance of classification schemes 1 with the ideal novelty detection method having sensitivity and specificity of 1.0 Results Results of setting novelty thresholds using the three methods are shown in Table 2 given as sensitivity and specificity Note that because data sets B1   B4 contain no abnormal events the sensitivity will always be zero because TP  0 These normal data sets are used only to evaluate the specificity of each method Discussion When applied to the abnormal data sets Al and A2 all three methods detected both of the engine events and the same set of precursor events Several of the precursor events from data set Al were not detected by any of the methods due to the low magnitude of vibration amplitude observed during those flights However all three methods provided the same amount of advance warning of the main engine event which took place in flight 71 detecting the first precursor event during flight 65 Thus the sensitivity can be seen in Table 1 to be identical for all three methods The specificity of the three methods is significantly different with the heuristic method attaining specificity 0.73 the ML-based EVT method attaining 0.83 and the proposed Bayesian-EVT method attaining 0.99 This significant improvement in specificity is the key advantage of the proposed method over the original MLEVT method and the heuristic method which were suspected a priori to suffer from large numbers of falseWe define true-positive TP false-positive FP truenegative TN and false-negative FN classifications 7 9

12 Figure 6 Spoken Dialogue Interaction Figure 6 Spoken Dialogue Interaction NASA Ames Research Center has developed prototypes for intelligent agents applied to mixed human-robotic teams and to planetary habitats  1 1  These software systems were supported by facile mobile information systems and simulations of planetary surface surveys were conducted in analog environments  1 2  The intelligent agents implemented in the Belief-Desire-Intent language Brahms responded to questions like 322Where am I?\323 322What is the current activity What is the voltage from the generator?\323 and other queries of information available in the distributed IT system The agents would also initiate commands to the robots 322Robot take a picture of me\323 322Robot go to location 1 GPS coordinates 311\323 etc Note how useful these types of human to agent interactions could be aboard a spacecraft and how they mimic natural interactions between people Figure 6 shows a picture of an astronaut performing payload operations using interactive spoken dialogue interaction with a human on Earth However aboard a future transit vehicle this may well be an intelligent agent particularly when light speed delays prevent real-time communication with Earth Intelligent agents will be in effect the extra crew members needed to run and maintain the spacecraft A crew of 3-5 persons may not be able to operate a complicated spacecraft without the support of virtual crew members capable of working 24/7 Many functions can be handled or augmented by these virtual assistants Spacecraft monitoring maintenance and repair operations are obvious candidates given the amount of work required on these tasks Activities requiring specialized knowledge could be facilitated such as medical treatment by giving the human crewmember help in executing procedures for diagnosis and treatment The following are brief summaries of selected agent functions proposed for particular activities Repair Agent Intelligent agents can monitor subsystems and follow trends in operating parameters which might signal impending problems and schedule maintenance before the system fails or loses significant function or performance The following subsystems will need to be monitored continuously 1 life support 2 navigation 3 propulsion 4 communication 5 consumables 6 power 7 radiation shielding and 8 structural integrity Most repairs have complicated diagnostic and replacement procedures to be followed along with needed diagrams and technical information The spoken dialogue system can read out the procedure steps one by one and provide the necessary diagrams and pictures All of this material needs to be on the spacecraft so that no interaction with the ground is necessary to proceed with the repair A set of intelligent repair agents can significantly reduce the time to diagnose and complete a repair while improving the quality of the repair Medical Agent The crew is a vital part of the spacecraft and their health is as important to the success of the mission as the health of the vehicle The health of the crew will be monitored continuously both during exercise and normal activities This monitoring will have to be unobtrusive because of the long duration of the mission and this requirement is nicely met using body-worn sensors Sensor-bearing vests or shirts have been suggested as ways of measuring heart rate body temperature EKG and arterial oxygen These could be integrated with the sensors used to monitor location and body position for virtual HSI These sensors provide information wirelessly to the spacecraft medical intelligent agent The agents would keep track of all of the crew physiological data and analyze it for signs of medical problems in each crew member before they became serious Often trends in medical data are very valuable for finding conditions that may become serious in the future During medical emergencies like injuries or breathing difficulties the medical agent would interact with the care giving crew member to assist in diagnosis and treatment Much work has been done in the past to develop diagnostic decision trees which allow the system and caregiver to make a rapid diagnosis Since the medical agent would already have many of the vital signs it could quickly eliminate diagnosis sub trees that do not match the measured symptoms The agent could also communicate with earthbased flight surgeons for consultation saving time during serious medical conditions Crew Personal Agent Each crew member would have an intelligent agent to keep track of schedules exercise entertainment and correspondence with the earth On the long trip to Mars it will be necessary to keep up a rigorous exercise program Since the whole crew will be dependent on a limited number of exercise machines it will be necessary to schedule these machines between the whole crew The agent system will dynamically allocate exercise times and update the schedule in case of breakdowns and other delays Scheduling and coordination can be optimized and the results of this optimization sent to the Crew Personal Agent for execution by guiding the crewmember through 


13 scheduled activities This same concept can be applied to any constrained resources Communication with the ground will be delayed for up to 40 minutes so a system which keeps track of crew questions and answers received from Mission Control will be very important When the answer to a question arrives 2 days after the initial query it will necessary to pair the query and answer automatically to save crew time and jog their memory These communications will be in speech and text/picture form and will have to be indexed and tracked 6. T ECHNOLOGY D EVELOPMENT Implementing the MAA and associated HSI concepts will require investments in improving computer technology both hardware and software Fortunately very little needs to be invented since most components have either commercial or developmental predecessors Significant development of radiation-hardened avionics computing nodes would be needed Power consumption would have to be dramatically reduced Intelligent sensor modules would need to be developed all minimizing installed cost Sensor modules would need to be very small incorporating multiple sensing elements processor and network interface The MAA relies on high-performance computing and networks which can function at many times the rate needed for control This large excess of performance is used for implementing the voting and coherency algorithms needed for effective coordination Fortunately modern semiconductor technology provides the means to implement all of these features In addition to further development of low-power radiation tolerant electronics significant advances in avionics packaging would be required For example such avionics modules could not be liquid or conduction cooled rather thermal control would have to be passive Given the fact that no wired interfaces penetrate from the exterior the use of completely sealed packages would be possible which can increase reliability and interchangeability Network technology has progressed significantly with the adoption of AFDX time-deterministic Ethernet for critical aerospace control applications  1 3  This is being used in the latest Airbus and Boeing passenger aircraft Timetriggered Ethernet is a similar alternative Each method relies on issuing packets on a timed basis with sufficient gaps in between packets to allow other time-critical packets to be interleaved which produces bounded latency  1 4  Wireless network technology has similarly progressed but to date wireless time-deterministic networks have not been developed. Mesh routing software would be needed Today several products are available that perform mesh routing at either the MAC Zigbee or TCP/IP level Tropos Mobile IP routing has been flown aboard satellites in flight tests The biggest hurdle for implementation and biggest risk is the development of the necessary system management algorithms and software architectures needed for massively redundant peer-to-peer avionics systems Although much of the critical control for MAA can be adapted from IMA the larger number of possible redundancy solutions means that better means of maintaining coherency and failover would be needed Model-based system management and diagnostics could be useful in this area The system is reconfigured according to multiple constraints synthesized from current system state Planning algorithms could be used to determine the optimal process for reconfiguring such complex redundant systems Power transmission using inductive coupling is simply a matter of producing the correct magnetic interfaces Semiconductor technology providing the high-frequency driving current is used in every switching power supply 320 not an issue for technology development However providing an alternative power source maybe more difficult in that radiative schemes for power transmission may be difficult to apply internal to a spacecraft for humans Tripleredundant power distribution schemes are possible where each module couples with more than one distribution circuit Again low power electronics enables battery backup devices to be small and lowers the performance needed from wireless power transmission methods There are a number of building block technologies needed for the virtual disseminated interfaces we are proposing The various sensory display devices that physically present the information to the users are a real challenge These are devices such as miniature flat panel displays and audio interfaces for head mounted systems Recent advances in head mounted display technology benefiting from new OLED displays and redundant optical tracking systems make possible development of virtual cockpits based on body and head mounted displays that can present cockpit virtual images laid out within a user\325s 4   steradian field of regard Such displays can replace the much heavier powerhungry flat panel displays of conventional control consoles with bright high-resolution full color lightweight displays that only draw on the order of a few watts Other types of sensors such as miniature medical sensors currently exist and can be adapted to this use Array microphones can focus upon the speech of a crew member in a given known location The corresponding audio output function can be implemented using surround sound techniques commonly used for home theater Haptic sensors for interpreting motion and gestures are now available, but the feedback elements are lagging. Other types of user input devices are emerging and may be useful The main challenge for HSI is not the device development but rather the information and sensor fusion required for providing a coherent yet dynamic and flexible user interface The interface and display-rendering software that translates all the vehicle sensor and state readings into human sensory information and then encodes human voice and action responses into commands the spacecraft can use 


14 is particularly challenging It is noteworthy that these translations may well be haptic and audible as well as visual A final building block for the disseminated user interface is the development of advanced packaging techniques for assembly of the HSI components into sufficiently small packages that may be unobtrusively introduced into crew quarters and crew clothing so that their use requires little or no special setup before operation Power sources and lightweight batteries would be needed as well compatible with the spacecraft environment Changing your shirt may also change your batteries for the wearable sensors Intelligent agents are a focus for many of the activities of the Intelligent Systems Division at NASA Ames Several demonstrations of early prototypes have been performed so this area is considered one for development rather than just research 7. C ONCLUSIONS Inflatable spacecraft represent a revolutionary way of creating viable living and operations volume for humans engaged in exploration missions providing increased usable volume with reduced launch mass and volume They can potentially increase resistance to micrometeorite and space radiation hazards over conventional aluminum structures while being more flexible for reconfiguration from transit to habitat modes Challenges maintaining avionics operation during dynamic changes from stowed to deployed state during inflation providing feedthroughs between the inner and outer surface of the pressure vessel and for monitoring the health of the inflatable fabric itself can be met by applying innovations in the areas of avionics architecture intelligent sensors, human-system interfaces and spacecraft information interaction, currently in the research and development phase These innovations leverage the capabilities of each other to provide new concepts for the operation of long duration human spacecraft MAA is based on a massively redundant peer-to-peer construct providing much higher fault tolerance and higher computational performance Intelligent sensors have the potential for dramatically reducing sensor failures and inaccuracies again by employing many redundant elements with internal cross-checking of function and accuracy MAA directly supports roaming mobile HSI and its excess computational power can be used for hosting intelligent agent technology for information management and access The use of wireless networks and wireless power distribution directly supports inflatable spacecraft by eliminating inflexible cables and feedthroughs across the pressure vessel An innovative operations concept for transit vehicle piloting operation and maintenance was outlined incorporating these technologies providing virtual cockpits for vehicle operation, augmented reality for complex support activities and unobtrusive interfaces for common activities Design guidelines for constructing such HSI systems were presented consistent with current human factors practice The use of intelligent agents nicely complements advanced HSI allowing natural interaction between crew and spacecraft systems and payloads, effectively increasing crew size Technology for implementing proof-of-concept prototypes already exists Significant improvement in performance power consumption size mass and cost are required for all elements but are anticipated to be achieved using modern semiconductor advances Packaging and hardening for the space environment will remain serious challenges Critical advances in software architecture and algorithms will be needed to integrate these widely dispersed assets into a coherent system capable of maintain function despite failures and changing mission conditions In many ways the system architecture described is a good host for developing and testing many advanced software concepts Agent-based design in general may help coordinate many of the loosely-coupled modules and functions identified Successful implementation of this architecture and complementary features can lead to more robust inflatable spacecraft, increasing the performance and capabilities of the spacecraft and its crew during the conduct of exploration missions to the moon and Mars

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
