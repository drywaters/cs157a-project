AC merges association rule discovery and classification to construct a rule based classification model for the prediction purpose The use of associative classification for text mining-classification problem appears in the last few years [1   T e x t  c l a s s i f i c a t i o n  i s  the process of automatically predicting the valid categories of the text documents based on knowledge discovery in the construction phase of classification model Currently text classification has a wide range of applications such as classification of news stories e-mail routing spam filtering news monitoring, document indexing, searching for interesting information on the internet, web page classification, and so on 2   During the building and testing of text association classification model, we conduct several processes such as data pre-processing feature weighting and selection class association rule generation and define the prediction methods Given a text training data set which is labelled with many categories in our approach we consider each category individually Assume that D is a set of documents in training data set, D = {D1, D2, D3,\205, Dn }, and T is a set of terms that represent documents after data preprocessing and feature selection processes, T = {T1, T2, T3,\205, Tn }, two values are used to determine the importance of class association rules minimum support and minimum confidence. These values are used as thresholds Using this restriction a set of frequent terms is generated where frequent terms are those that exceed the minimum support threshold Out of these frequent terms the classification rule is discovered based on rule confidence and based on restriction in which the right hand side of rules must be a class label, for this reason the AC is considered as special case of association rule 3   F o r m a l l y   T 001 C is called class association rule where T is a set of frequent terms and C must be a class label associated with this rule This rule is strong if the support for the co-occurrence of T 001 C satisfies minimum support and the confidence satisfies minimum confidence [4   Most of the classification methods are applied to English and European languages. In this paper we investigate the use of AC to classify Arabic language text documents Arabic and English are two different languages For instance they have different alphabets the English alphabet has 26 characters while the Arabic alphabet has 28 characters. The writing style is also different, in Arabic language, the text is written and read from right to left while in English language, the text is written and read from left to right. In addition, the shape of the Arabic character is context-sensitive, depending on its location within the words. One of the important properties of Arabic language is that it is a derivational and highly inflectional language so that the morphological analysis takes a significant role when we deal with Arabic text computerized systems The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in section II we highlight and discuss the related works Section III describes our methodology and the architecture of AC and it addresses the issues such as feature selection associative classifier construction and testing. In section IV, we explain the experimental results The conclusion and future works are given in section V II  RELATED  WORKS M a ny previous efforts have been conducted for classification methods development The main motivation of research on classification problem is to obtain a classification model with an acceptable accuracy In the last decade of research in data mining, AC was presented as a new method for text classification and it has been applied with various of 114 Text classification problem receives a lot of research that are based on machine learning statistical and information retrieval techniques In the last decade the associative classification algorithms which depends on pure data mining techniques appears as an effective method for classification In this paper, we examine associative classification approach on the Arabic language to mine knowledge from Arabic text data set Two methods of classification using AC are applied in this study these methods are single rule prediction and multiple rule prediction  The experimental results against different classes of Arabic data set show that multiple rule prediction method outperforms single rule prediction method with regards to their accuracy In general the associative classification approach is a suitable method to classify Arabic text data set and is able to achieve a good classification performance in terms of classification time and classification accuracy  Abs tract\227

We employ Apriori algorithm similar to that used in [6  t o  d i s c o v e r  a l l  f r e q u e n t  t e r m s  t h a t  f o r m  r u l e s  b o d y  from a preprocessed supervised training data set Two measurable values are used to determine frequent items and frequent class association rules i.e support and confidence The discovered rule are ordered and pruned in this phase, and then the associative classification model is constructed these steps are called post mining of class association rules [5                       F igure 1.

   1  Frequent Class Terms Generation The frequent terms for each class are generated during frequent terms generation process The term set that are selected in feature selection step represent training data set that is associated with its predefined classes are used as an input to the Apriori algorithm The frequent class terms are measured using term set support value, which is the number of occurrence of terms together in the observed data 1    A n  i t e r a t i v e  s e a r c h  o v e r  training data set is conducted to discover the associated terms that distinguish each category from the others Apriori knowledge is used to remove unfrequented terms and reduce search space  Assume that T  t1 t2 t3 205 tm  i s  a  s e t  o f  t e r m s   The first candidates term set are generated directly and the frequent 1-term sets that pass minimum support are retained and used to generate candidate 2-term set The frequent 2 term set is discovered in the next step according to minimum support The generation process of subsequent candidate and frequent m-term sets continues until no further frequent term set can be generated from the training data set [6    7    2   Class Association Rule Generation Class association rule must be restricted and constrained in the rule head and rule body The rules that form classifier are only rules that indicate a category label These rules take the form Tj 002\001\002 Ci where Tj is a set of frequent terms that represent documents in the training data set, and Ci is the class that is associated with these documents. Formally, class association rule CR is of the form Tj 001 Ci , where, Tj  is a set of frequent terms of the form t1 t2 205 tm  a n d  i s  c a l l e d  r u l e  t e r m s   a n d  C i  i s  t h e  category of this rule and is called the rule head. Each rule must have support and confidence the rule CR is called a strong and frequent rule if it passes the minimum confidence and minimum support threshold values [1    6     7    The support of rule CR Tj 001  Ci   is the percentage of document that contains rule terms Tj  among the whole documents in each observed class Ci 1   223  1  224    p r e s e n t e d  t h i s  ratio 1  Where sup \(Tj 001 Ci is the number of documents in data set that match terms of R, and associated with class C of R and N is the total number of documents in class data set The expected rule accuracy 21  i s  u s e d  a s  t h e  r u l e  confidence which is defined as the conditional probability which rule head is valid given the condition of rule body. The classes are already associated with each rule and always occur with rule body Therefore the rule accuracy as in 223 2\\224 will be used in this paper 2 Where D tot    R is the number of documents in training data set that contains rule body and N c is the number of classes 3   Class Association Rule Ordering and Pruning The class association rules that are discovered in the last step will be passed through rule sorting procedure In this paper we order the rules according to its confidence support and the number of terms in the rule body as presented in Fig 2 1   After rule ordering process, a list of ordered rules is retained Actually these rules are pruned during the search in the rule mining process according to rule confidence The rules that have lower confidence than the minimum confidence threshold are eliminated. In addition, the rules are also pruned based on rule redundancy method if the rule contains another rule. In other words, if there is a rule body that fully matches or subset of other rule body and it has less confidence then this rule is eliminated from the list. The two main reasons of doing pruning process are to create an Associative classification model using the set of rules that have a discriminative power for distinguishing categories and to build model using a reasonable number of class association rules that could not take a long time for future prediction [3    6    D  Prediction of New Document Class Several methods can be used for classification using a set of class association rules These methods belong to two categories single rule prediction or multiple rules prediction 1   I n  t h i s  p a p e r   w e  f o c u s  o n  o r d e r e d  d e c i s i o n  l i s t   s i n g l e  r u l e  prediction and majority voting multiple rules prediction methods 22   I n  o r d e r e d  d e c i s i o n  l i s t  m e t h o d   t h e  f i r s t  r u l e  that covers new test document is used for prediction; the new test document is assigned to the class that is associated with this rule However the majority voting method classifies the new document based on the total number of rules that cover this document In this method all rules that cover new document rule body is partially or fully match the terms of new document are weighted equally The majority voting method composed of four steps as follows 267  Search through the rules list 267  Find all rules that cover the test document to be classified       Figure 2.

 267  If all retained rules have identical class classify this document to this class 267  Else, assign this document to the class that is favored by the majority of all retained rules IV   EXPERIMENT  AND  RESULTS A     Data Set Arabic news article data sets are used in our experiment This data set is collected from many sources. Most of our data are taken from online Arabic corpora [23   t h e  r e s t  i s  c o l l e c t e d  from Arabic news channels websites such as Aljazeera web site and from other websites The data set consists of 5640 documents about 16.5 MB with different sizes belong to seven categories The data set categories and the number of documents for each category are presented in Table I B   Results and Evaluation  The classification accuracy is used in this paper as the base measure of our experimental results The classification accuracy is calculated as in \223\(3\\224 by dividing the number of the correctly classified document by the total number of documents in the testing dataset   3  Where TrueC is the number of test documents that are classified correctly True classification and Total is the total number of test documents In this paper an Arabic data set is used for experiments this data set described in section IV,A in our experiment we consider about 70% of data for training and the rest for model testing The data is processed and the important terms that represent labeled documents are selected as discussed in section III and the Apriori algorithm is used to discover association rule for each class The minimum support and minimum confidence threshold values are selected according to the literature and are based on experimental results We set min-supp to 10% in the first experiment and 5% in the second with 50%, 70%, and 80 for min-conf The class association rules that are generated are ordered and pruned using the steps that are described in section III, C, and the remaining rules are used to form the Arabic text associative classifier that represents as a set of class association rules Finally the ordered decision list and majority voting methods \(Section III D\ are used to predict the classes of test documents in testing data set      Table II shows the number of class association rule that is generated from our data set, the classification accuracy of the two prediction methods that are used in this paper in addition to the training and testing time of our associative classifier The results obtained when the minimum support was 10 with variant confidences of rules After analyzing table II we find that the classification accuracy increases with both prediction methods when the rule confidences is high The majority voting and ordered decision list reach the peak of accuracy 84 and 81 respectively when the rule confidence is 80 with 50 prediction rules The majority voting method outperforms than ordered decision list method in most experiments The execution time for both training and testing does not exceed 6 minutes in all experiments, and most of this time is taken for model training Additional experiments are conducted to test the performance of associative classifier with a large number of Arabic class association rules Table III presents the results when the minimum support is 5 We discover that the number of class association rules increase roughly by six times than obtained rule when minimum support is 10 The large number of prediction rules affects the classification accuracy and this indicates that the associative classifier with a reasonable number of rules performs well than those with a large number of rules Figure 3 depicts the classification accuracy reported in Table II and Table III for both prediction methods \(Majority voting and ordered decision list Figure 3 depicts the classification accuracy reported in Table II and Table III for both prediction methods Majority voting and ordered decision list\.According to this figure the classification accuracies for both prediction methods are not so far from each other The ordered decision list prediction method produces better accuracy than majority voting method when the minimum confidence is 50%, but the majority voting method superior ordered decision list method with 70 and 80 of rule confidences In general the results are good and satisfactory when we deal with Arabic text with a size that is used in this study. To the best of our knowledge the most of the pervious works that conducted on Arabic text classification used small Arabic   Category Name N umber of Documents Culture 1450 Economy 1054 Politic 1098 Sport 1574 Education 144 Information technology 144 Health 176 Total 5640 Minimum Support = 10 Accuracy Testing Time \(m Confidence NO. of Rules Training Time\(m Majority Voting Ordered Decision List Majority Voting Ordered Decision List 50 95 3.26 0.771 0.787 1.39 1.22 70 82 3.19 0.803 0.792 1.27 1.38 80 50 3.17 0.846 0.812 1.32 1.35 Total TrueC Accuracy   TABLE  I  C ATEGORIES AND N UMBER OF D OCUMENTS  TABLE II   R ESULTS OF A SSOCIATIVE C LASSIFIER FOR THE A RABIC T EXT D ATA S ET  118

However, at 15% and 20% of minimum support the culture category appears without any rule and that means this category doesn\222t have much of correlated terms As shown in the experimental results the AC model achieves an acceptable accuracy an d it classifies test documents in reasonable time. This indicates that our model is constructed using association rules that are strongly related to its predefined classes and most of these rules have a discriminative power to distinguish each class from t In addition, the number of class association rules that form AC model is not large and the prediction methods are simple with few computations, therefore, the search space for prediction is limited and the prediction method does not need a long classify test documents    Minimum Support = 5 Confidence NO. of Rules Training Time\(m 50 633 3.54 70 359 3.50 80 345 4.00 Figure 3  Associative classificatio n accuracy, minimum confidence varying from 50% to 80 TABLE III  R ESULTS OF in our experiment the used for AC model testing used for both training and testing in some Figure 4 shows the number of classification rules that is derived from our Arabic data set with different parameter s of minimum confidence and minimum supports As shown in this figure the number of classification rules with 5 of minimum support decrease s from about 633 rules with 50 of rule confidence into 359 rules with 70 of rule confidence At 10 of minimum rt no much difference between 50 and 70 of rule confidences only 13 rules is the difference  The number of same with 50 and 70 of rule 15% and 20%, which spectively.

The system scales very well with dataset size because the SPARQL graph patterns are mostly evaluated with index-based nested loop joins, which tend to have execution times proportional to result size. Q5 shows the worst scalability because the execution cost is dominated by the regular expression filter on the unselective triple pattern, and the number of intermediate results that must be scanned for the regular expression filter grows significantly as the dataset size increases B  Computing SEM_CONTAINS_COUNT This experiment studied the overhead of computing sem_contains_count by executing two variations of the five sem_contains queries \(Table V\ against the LA130 dataset: \(1 sem_contains only and \(2 sem_contains  sem_contains_count The results of the experiment are shown in Figure 4. As expected, computing sem_contains_count adds some overhead. This overhead is proportional to the result s et size because the count has to be computed once for each document in the result set The overhead required to compute the count value is reasonable. For example, the overhead ranged from 0.001 sec Q2\ to 0.081 sec \(Q3\. The larger overhead observed for queries Q1 and Q3 can be attributed to the larger result size The overhead of computing sem_contains_count is relatively small for Q2, Q4, and Q5, which can be attributed to the fact that the result set size is small for these queries 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Query Number Execution Time \(sec sem_contains sem_contains + sem_contains_count  Fig. 4 Overhead for sem_contains_count on LA130 dataset C  Ordering Results by SEM_CONTAINS_COUNT This experiment tested the scalability of computing and sorting results by sem_contains_count as the query result set size increases.

0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 12345678 Partitions Accessed Execution Time \(sec Partitioned Non-Partitioned  Fig. 6 Benefit of partition pruning on LA130 dataset The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 6. As expected, partition pruning shows a significant speedup in query execution time when only a few partitions are accessed The speedup ranged from 2.8 times faster when one partition is accessed to 1.2 times faster when three partitions are accessed. Not surprisingly, the benefit of partition pruning is reduced as more partitions are qu eried.  This can be attributed to two opposing factors in play In our implementation, each semantic index partition results in a single RDF model, so the non-partitioned index yields one large RDF model, and the partitioned index yields eight small RDF models. The single B  tree index structure, in case of non-partitioned table, is organized independently of the partitioning key pubdate and hence does not benefit from locality of reference when the query is selective requiring access to one or a few partitions. However, for the partitioned index case, the local indexes have triples grouped by pubdate which tends to perform better for selective queries. These benefits start to diminish as the number of partitions to be accessed by the query goes up and eventually the non-partitioned index starts to perform better. When all eight partitions are accessed, the query using the \(local partitioned index runs 1.4 times slower VI  C ONCLUSIONS  The paper presented the semantic indexing feature of Oracle Database, which allows indexing unstructured text columns to generate RDF content that can subsequently be searched with a SPARQL query pattern. It described a model of a semantic index that can be incrementally composed by a combination of base extractor policies, knowledge bases, and entailments. A model for querying semantic index was discussed that allows both searching for matching documents and/or matching triples. An experimental study involving TREC documents demonstrated the feasibility of our approach The proposed semantic indexing framework is intended to create a synergy between the database, semantic web, and information extraction communities. Specifically, the integration and inference benefits of semantic technologies become available for use against unstructured data in the databases. The semantic web community benefits as large volumes of RDF data, hitherto residing as unstructured text can now drive the development of semantic applications Information extraction community benefits as their technologies are put to immediate use by the database and semantic web communities Although extracted data, stored in standard RDF format, is amenable to querying, it tends to be verbose. Further work is needed, in conjunction with the information extraction community, to come up with levels of summarization that will also result in compact and efficient SPARQL query formulation. A more complete realization of the semantic indexing framework would involve work in several areas including optimized processing of blocking queries involving ancillary operators, devising s ophisticated ranking measures for capturing document r elevance, and incremental maintenance of entailments at the document \(named graph level A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Zhe Wu and Vlad Kolovski for providing support for named graph inferencing R EFERENCES  1  S G.
