However, mining data streams is more difficult than mining static databases because of the huge high-speed and continuous characteristics of streaming data This paper presents an algorithm, called IDSM-MFI. The algorithm uses a synopsis data structure to store the items of transactions embedded data streams so far. It adopts a topbottom and bottom-top method to mine the set of all maximal frequent itemsets in landmark windows over data stream, which can be output in real time based on users specified thresholds. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our algorithm is efficient and scalable for mining the set of all maximal frequent itemsets over the entire history of data stream  Keywords: data mining; data streams; maximal frequent itemsets 1  Introduction Mining frequent itemsets is an essential step in many data mining problems, such as mining association rules sequential patterns, closed patterns[1,2 m a x i m a l p a ttern 2   an d m a ny ot h e r i m port a n t dat a  m i n i n g t a s k s  Recently database and data mining communities have focused on a new data model, where data arrives in the form of continuous streams It is often referred to data streams or streaming data Many applications generate large amount of data streams in real time, such as sensor data generated from sensor networks, transaction flows in retail chains Web record and click streams in Web applications performance measurement in network monitoring and traffic management, call records in telecommunications etc. Mining data streams is more difficult than mining static databases because of the huge, high-speed and continuous characteristics of streaming data. Consequently, previous multiple-pass data mining techniques studied for traditional datasets cannot be easily employed for the streaming data domain According to the data stream processing model h e research of mining frequent itemsets in data streams can be divided into three fields landmark windows model 5   sliding windows model 7,1 an d damped windows model 11 as des c ri bed bri e f l y as f o l l o w s T h e f i rs t s c h o l a rs t o  give much attention to mining all frequent itemsets over the entire history of the streaming data were Manku and Motwani h e pr opos ed a l g o ri t h m  L o s s y  C oun t i n g i s a first single-pass algorithm based on a well-known Apriori property Lossy Counting uses a specific array representation to represent the lexicographic ordering of the hash tree, which is the popular method for candidate counting. Teng et al 7 prop os ed a reg r es s i onbas e d algorithm, called FTP-DS, to find frequent itemsets in sliding windows Moreover, Chang and Lee s o  proposed a single-pass algorithm for mining recently frequent itemsets based on the estimation mechanism of the algorithm Lossy Counting. Chang and Lee [8 d e ve l o p a n algorithm estDec for mining frequent itemsets in streaming data in which each transaction has a weight and it decrease with age. In other words, older transactions contribute less toward itemsets frequencies. Referen dev e lops a FPtree based algorithm [9 d  FPstream, to mine frequent itemsets at multiple time granularities by a novel titledtime However, because of numerous redundant data and patterns in main memory for mining frequent itemsets mining maximal frequent itemsets in data streams becomes a more important problem in recent years. There are few algorithms to solver this problem efficiently. In [12 Hu aFu Li propose the DSM-MFI algorithm to mine maximal frequent itemsets over a data stream in landmark windows The algorithm DSM-MFI uses an efficient data structure named summary frequent itemset forest \(abbreviated as SFI-forest  to store data  stream, and uses top-down method to find the maximal frequent itemsets. The disadvantage of the DSM-MFI is that it stores a lot of projection of transaction, which consumes large numbers of memory usage and using top-down method to find the maximal frequent has to calculate support threshold of many itemsets, which is the most time-consuming in mining frequent itemsets. This paper proposes an improved algorithm called the improved algorithm of DSM-MFI abbreviated as IDSM-MFI\which employs a synopsis data structure to be developed for incremental maintaining the essential information about maximal frequent itemsets embedded in the stream so far and combines bottom-up and top-down method to find maximal frequent itemsets. It can efficiently prune the superset of the short infrequent itemsets and the subset of the long maximal frequent itemsets The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Problem definition is given in Section 2. Algorithm IDSMMFI to find the MFI is described in Section 3. The performance results are presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes our study

2  Problem definition A data stream  DS W 1 W 2  W N  a n i n fin i te sequence of basic windows where each basic window W i   i = 1, 2, Ö, N  is associated with a window identifier i and N is the window  identifier of the latest  basic window  B N A basic window consists of a fixed sized number of transactions, where each transaction is composed of a set of items named itemset he size of a basic window W is denoted by |W|. The current length abbreviated as CL  data stream is |W 1 W 2 W N  Because it is unrealistic to store all the data into limited main memory or even in secondary storage, the single-pass algorithm for mining data streams has to sacrifice the correctness of their analytical results by allowing some frequency errors. Therefore, the true support of an itemset X is the number of transactions of the stream containing the itemset X as a subset, and denoted by X.tsup  The estimated support of an itemset X is the estimated true support stored in the summary data structure, and denoted by X.esup Note that 1  X.esup  X.tsup The current length of data stream with respect to an itemset X is W j W j 1 W N where basic window W j  is the first window containing X recorded in the current summary data structure, and is denoted by X.CL. In this paper, the itemsets embedded in the data streams can be divided into three types frequent itemset  significant itemset and infrequent itemset An itemset X is called frequent if X  esup  s  X.CL where s is a user-defined minimum support threshold in the range of [0, 1  A n ite m s e t  X is called significant if s  X.CL  X  esup   X.CL where is a userspecified maximum support error threshold in the range of 0 s  n ite m s et X is called infrequent if X  esup   X.CL  An itemset is called maximal if it is not a subset of any other frequent itemsets 3  The algorithm:IDSM-MFI To efficiently find a set of maximal frequent itemsets in land window, we propose an algorithm IDSM-MFI: first it reads a window of transactions from the buffer in main memory, and sorts the items of transactions in a synopsis data structure called summary extended frequent itemset tree \(abbreviated SEFI-tree\d, it prunes the infrequent information from the synopsis data structure Third, it searches the maximal frequent itemsets from the current synopsis data structure. Step 1 is performed in sequence for a new incoming basic window. Steps 2 and 3 are usually performed periodically or when it is needed 3.1 The structure of SEFI-tree Based on Apriori principle, DSM-MFI projects the transaction T into many sub-transactions. The detail [12 o f  projection is defined as follows. A transaction T with m items, i.e T  x 1   x 2  x m converted into m subtransactions; that is x 1  x 2  x m  x 2  x 3  x m   x m which are inserted into the current SFI-forest. Because SFI-forest stores sub-transactions of transaction, it repeatedly inserts large number of infrequent itemsets When DSM-MFI reads a transaction T from the current basic window and prune infrequent itemsets, it deletes each node of numerous infrequent itemsets via entire SFI-forest which wastes a lot of storage space and consumes a great deal of execution time. Thus, we use the advantages of FPtree and the characteristics of streaming data which requires that algorithm can be single streaming data scan for counting itemsetís frequent information. We design summary data structure called SEFI-tree. SEFI-tree stores each item of transaction in the current basic window. When all the transactions in the basic window are read, the infrequent itemsets are deleted from SEFI-tree so that SEFItree stores the nodes with x.esup  x.CL from  begin window to the current window. Based on the ideas of DSMMFI, we employ OFI-list to store sub-transactions of transaction. The characteristics of SEFI-tree are as follows Definition 1  SEFI-tree\ summary extended frequent item tree is a tree structure defined below 1. SEFI-tree  consists of one EIS-tree \(Extended Item Suffix Tree\d a  FI-list  Frequent Item List 2. Each node in the EIS-tree  consists of five fields itemname  node-count  window-id  brother and link where itemname registers which this node represents item nodecount registers the number of transactions represented by the portion of the path reaching this node window-id registers the window identifier of the current basic window  brother links to the node in the EIS-tree carrying the same itemname or null if there is none and link links to the next node in the EIS-tree carrying the same itemname or null if there is none 3. Each entry in the FI-list consists of four fields itemname  node-count  window-id and node-link which points to the first node in the EIS-tree carrying the itemname  4. Each entry in the OFI-list consists of three fields itemname  item-count and window-id which is expressed x i OFI-list 3.2 Constructing and Maintaining of SEFI-tree When streaming data arrive in, each item is embedded in SEFI-tree and each sub-transaction of transaction is inserted into OFI-list. When all items in the current window are read, firstly, the all infrequent nodes which node-link of FI-list points to in the EIS-tree carrying the itemname are pruned, secondly, the infrequent node in the FI-list is pruned, and finally, the nodeís OFI-list is deleted Algorithm 1  BuildMaintainSFI-tree: constructing and maintaining of SEFI-tree Input DS=[w 1 w 2 w n   a us e r s pe cif i e d m i ni m u m s u ppo r t  thr e s h o l d  s  0,1\, and a user-defined maximum support error threshold  0,s Output A SEFI-tree generated so far

Based on Apriori principle, we design a tobobotoMFI \(top-bottom and bottom-top selection of maximal frequent\ algorithm to find a set of maximal frequent itemsets from SEFI-tree Suppose there are k 1- itemsets such as e 1 e 2 e k in the current FI-list and each item e i   i=1,2,Ök\ , has a e i OFI-list, whose     size is | e i OFI-list|. Each item in e i OFI-list denotes e i o 1 e i o j assume j i e i OFI-list| in this paper. Based on Apriori principle, each item in the e i OFI-list generates 12   i ii i j jj j cc c itemsets, which combines e i  to a new itemsets respectively. We adopt top-bottom and bottom-top method and prune the supersets of infrequent and the subsets of long maximal frequent items to reduce the large number of item support threshold calculating Algorithm 2  tobo-botoMFI: Finding a set of maximal frequent itemsets  Input A current SEFI-tree, the current window identifier N, mining support threshold s, and a maximum support error threshold  Output A set of all maximal frequent itemsets Foreach e i in the FI-list do Enumerate top j c itemsets and combine them with e i to a candidate maximal frequent itemsets E1 /*top=|e i OFI-list  e i OFI-list|/2  Enumerate bottom j c itemset and combine them with e i to a candidate maximal frequent itemsets E2;    /*bottom=1 e i OFI-list|/2  Do each itemsets E1 m in the E1 and E2 n in the E2 \(m,n=1,2 Count E1 m esup by traversing the SEFI-tree If E1 m esup>=s∑ E1 m CL If E1 m  MFI and is not a subset of any other frequent itemsets in MFI then MFI=MFIE1 m  Prune the subsets of E1 im from E2  endif Count E2n.esup by traversing the SEFI-tree  If E2 n esup E2 n CL If E2 n  MFI and is not a subset of any other frequent itemsets in MFI then MFI=MFIE2 n  else Prune the subsets of E2 n from E1 endif Until E1 is {} and E2 is endfor 3.3 Theoretical analysis of algorithm 3.3.1 Maximal estimated support error analysis Theorem 1 The error between true support and estimated support is below x.CL Proof Suppose x is a infrequent itemsets when it is in the window-i, and is a frequent itemsets when it is in window-p \(p>i So  sup  sup  sup 1 p xt xe x e i i   i=1,2,Öp in IDSM-MFI, if x is a infrequent itemsets, we can know sup  ii xe xCL

First, while constructing and maintaining the SFI-forset, we need to insert 12    I II I CC C TN   itemsets into SFI-forest. Then, in order to delete an infrequent itemsets we need to traverse 2 1 2 i T i Ti C     n odes  S econ d   the next parts is discovering the maximal frequent itemset Each item e i   i=1,2,3Ök, in the current FI-list has a e i OFI-list. The size of e i OFI-list is denoted by |e i OFI-list which is expressed j i in this paper. Algorithm need 12 1    i ii i k j jj j i CC C   times support threshold calculating  So the complexity of time of DSM-MF is 2 2 12 2 11    2 1 2     i ii i T k j i Ti j j j ii II TNC C C CC C      1 which C1 is the number of infrequent itemsets and C2 is the time of traversing one itemset. Calculating the complexity of time in IDSM-MF also includes two parts. First, we need to insert TN  itemsets into the SEFI-tree. While in the part of deleting infrequent itemsets, the number of nodes needed to be deleted is equal to the number of the infrequent itemset in SEFI-tree, in which the number is denoted by C3 Obviously 2 1 2 3 i T i Ti CC    Second, the same to DSM-MF, It need also 12 1    i ii i k j jj j i CC C   times support threshold calculating. But, IDSM-MFI needs 12 1    i ii i k j jj j i F FF   times support threshold calculating by pruning operation, in which 12   i ii i j jj j F FF is respectively remnant itemsets of 12   i ii i j jj j CC C after pruning operation. Obviously 12    i ii i j jj j F FF  12  i ii i j jj j cc c  Hence, the complexity of time of DSM-MFI is 12 1 1 3 2    i ii i k j jj j i TNC C C F F F        2\ompare \(1\d 1 3.3.3 Comparison the complexity of space  Suppose the number of 1-itemset is k. The space requirement of both DSM-MF and IDSM-MF consists of three parts. The difference is it is SFI-tree that is used to store frequent itemset in DSM-MFI, while it is EIS-tree that is used to store frequent itemset in IDSM-MFI. Hence, the complexity of space is O \(2 k  n D S M MF  A n d t h e  complexity of space is O \(Ck\ in IDSM-MF. Obviously while k is huge, the result is 2 k CK   4  Performance evaluation Base on l t h e ex peri m e n t s are perf or m e d on a 2.66GHz PertiumIII with 512MB, and the program is written in Microsoft Visual C++6.0. To evaluate the performance of DSM-MFI and IDSM-MFI algorithm, we conduct the empirical studies based on the synthetic datasets. The parameters of synthetic data generated by IBM synthetic data gene des c ribed as f o llo w s   IBM Synthetic Dataset T 10 I 5 D 1M and T 30 I 20 D 1M. The first synthetic dataset T 10 I 5 has average transaction size T with 10 items and the average size of frequent itemset I is 5-items. It is a sparse dataset. In the second dataset T 30 I 20, the average transaction size T and average frequent itemset size I are set to 30 and 20 respectively. It is a dense dataset. Both synthetic datasets have 1,000,000 transactions. In the experiments, the synthetic data stream is broken into blocks with size 50 K i.e., 50,000\or simulating the continuous characteristic of streaming data, where 1 K denotes 1,000. Hence, there are total 20 blocks in these experiments.

In Figure 2 \(a\we can see that the

execution time incurred by IDSM-MFI is quite steady and is shorter than that of DSM-MFI. The experiment shows that IDSM-MFI performs more efficiently DSM-MFI. In Figure 2 \(b\ the memory usage of IDSM-MFI is more stable and smaller than that of DSM-MFI. This is because IDSM-FI adopts a better search method to find sets of maximal frequent itemsets. Hence, it shows that IDSM-MFI is more suitable for mining long frequent itemsets in data streams        a\cution Time        b\mory Usage Figure 2 Comparison with algorithm DSM-MFI 4.1 Comparison with Algorithm DSM-MFI on Different Support Threshold  In this experiment, we examine the execution time between DSM-MFI and IDSM-MFI by dataset T 30 I 20 D1000k and T10.I5 D1000K In Figure 3, we can see that algorithm DSM-MFI is more suitable for large support threshold and sparse data sets. Algorithm IDSMMFI is much better than algorithm DSM-MFI for the suitability of support threshold and data sets       a  T30.I20.D1000        b\  T10.I5.D1000K Figure 3 Comparison with algorithm DSM-MFI on different support threshold 5  Conclusion In this paper we proposed a novel algorithm, IDSMMFI, to discover and maintain maximal frequent itemsets in the current data stream landmark window. The algorithm uses a new SEFI-tree which is developed for incremental maintaining the essential information about maximal frequent itemsets embedded in the stream so far and a topbottom and bottom-top method to mine the set of all maximal frequent itemsets in landmark windows over data stream. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that our method can achieve better performance than a representation algorithm DSM-MFI in terms of both time and space overhead, especially when the minimum support is low, and the dataset is dense. In the future, we plan to extend our proposed algorithm to different data stream applications 6  Reference   M  Z a ki and C Hsi a o CH A R M   A n eff i ci en t al go ri t h m  f o r closed itemset mining.

latency encountered could be reduced by a signi\002cant margin It also demonstrates an increase in the cache-hit percentage which indicates that data items are being acquired before they are requested In addition the pre-fetchers accuracy is increased according to the client access frequency since with the increase in the number of requests the patterns could be observed more clearly V C ONCLUSIONS AND F URTHER W ORK This paper presents a model that extrapolates the users data access requests by using a semantic linking over the data source to provide them with a better performance system regardless of network variations code details and data access patterns The proposed model is also bandwidth-adaptive in the sense that it adapts to varying bandwidths and varies its caching capacity correspondingly It is found to be successful in prefetching the data search items from the data cloud with good accuracy and relatively little overhead Moreover this model can also be used over a data source that contains dynamically changing data items by using the concept of merely comparing the update time of the content with that of the one in the cache Currently we are investigating the use of various types of server-side statistics to promote or demote semantic links that will adapt to the overall access behavior of the web-application clients In addition we are considering possible adjustments that are to be made to the current algorithm when the data source contents are rapidly changing We aim to 002nd the costs that are to be incurred in such situations and then try to reduce them by using a hybrid version of this technique R EFERENCES  ABI Research 223W idgets and the apps dilemma for smartphones netbooks media tablets and connected mobile devices,\224 2010  A v ailable http://www abiresearch.com/research/1003385  IBM de v eloperW orks 223IB M surv e y IT professionals predict mobile and cloud technologies will dominate enterprise computing by 2015,\224 Oct 2010 A v ailable http://www03.ibm.com/press/us/en pressrelease/32674.wss  H Zhuge R Jia and J Liu 223Semantic link netw ork b uilder and intelligent browser  Research articles,\224 Concurrency and Computation Practice and Experience  vol 16 pp 1453\2261476 2004 doi:10.1002/cpe.v16:14  Coda Research 223W i-\002 enabled mobile phone handsets in the US 2010-2015,\224 2010 A v ailable http://www codaresearch.co.uk wi\002cellular/abstract.pdf  ComScore Research 223Understand mobile trends and consumer behavior,\224 2010 A v ailable http://www comscore.com Products Services/Product Index/MobiLens  A Besta vros 223Using speculation to reduce serv er load and ser vice time on the WWW,\224 in Proc of ICIKM  1995 pp 403\226410 doi:10.1145/221270.221653  D Albrecht I Zuk erman and A Nicholson 223Pre-sending documents on the WWW A comparative study,\224 in Proc of IJCAI  vol 2 1999 pp 1274\2261279  M Deshpande and G Karypis 223Selecti v e Mark o v models for predicting web page accesses,\224 ACM Trans Internet Technol  vol 4 no 2 pp 163\226184 May 2004 doi:10.1145/990301.990304  E P  Markatos and C E Chronaki 223 A top-10 approach to prefetching the web,\224 in Proc of INET  1998  J Hine C W ills A Martel and J Sommers 223Combining client knowledge and resource dependencies for improved world wide web performance,\224 in Proc of INET  1998  C W u and M Bauer  223I mpro ving web serv er performance with predictive caching,\224 in Proc of ICOMP  Las Vegas NV 2004 pp 145\226149  S Gupta A Joshi J Santiago and A P atw ardhan 223Query distrib ution estimation and predictive caching in mobile ad hoc networks,\224 in Proc of MobiDE  2008 pp 24\22630 doi:10.1145/1626536.1626542  L Y in and G Cao 223Supporting cooperati v e caching in ad hoc netw orks 224 IEEE Trans Mobile Comput  vol 5 no 1 pp 77\22689 Jan 2006 doi:10.1109/TMC.2006.15  Amazon.com Inc 223Documentation of the elastic load balancing over Amazon EC2,\224 2009 A v ailable http://a ws.amazon.com elasticloadbalancing

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
