We present an efficient algorithm where a fading factor   is used for computing frequency counts exceeding a user-specified threshold over data streams. Our algorithm  Miner can detect approximate frequent items of 
a data stream using O  1 memory space and the processing time for each data item is O 1\ Experimental results on several artificial data sets and real data sets show that  Miner performs better than LC in terms with precision, memory requirement and time cost Keywords-data stream; data mining; frequent items; fading factor I   I NTRODUCTION  In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to mining data streams. Mining frequent item sets from stream data is an important problem with ample applications in 
stream data analysis. Examples include stock tickers bandwidth statistics for billing purposes, network traffic measurements, web-server click streams, data feeds from sensor networks, transaction analysis in stocks and telecom call records, etc Problems related to frequency estimate have been studied by many researchers in different fields. Algorithms for identifying frequent items and other statistics in the entire data stream have been proposed. Lossy Counting by G. S. Manku et al was the first algorithm for finding frequent items from a data stream. Lossy Counting is a onepass algorithm that provides an accuracy guarantee on the set of frequent data items and their frequencies reported

This algorithm needs only 1  counters for the most frequent data items in the stream Many algorithms for frequent item counting use random sampling. Flajolet and Martin  d W h an g et al.

multinomially-distributed. Gibbons and Matias [8  presented sampling algorithms to recognize topk queries H. Liu pres en ts an erroradaptiv e an d tim e a w ar e maintenance algorithm for frequency counts over data stream  In many applications, recent data in the stream is more meaningful. For instance, in an intrusion detection system IDS\, the current status of the network is usually more important than that of one day ago. The algorithms mentioned above do not discount the effect of old data. This is undesirable in solving many application problems. One way to handle such problem is using sliding window models 
which ignore the out of date data and only consider the recent data. Recently several data mining algorithms over sliding windows are proposed. Based on MG algorithm Arasu and Manku a v e a det e rm i n i s t i c al g o ri t h m  f o r  finding approximate frequent items; it supports   1 1 log     O query and update time and uses   1 2 1 log     O space.

In this paper, we introduce a fading factor 0 1 to act on the density of data items in data stream. One advantage of this measure is that it takes into account the old data items in the history. Furthermore, the frequency density changes smoothly when more data arrive continuously without a sudden jump. We propose an efficient frequency estimation algorithm  Miner which improves the space and time costs. It can detect approximate frequent items in data stream with O  1 emory space and processes each data item in O 1\e. We verify the effectiveness of our approach empirically using real data sets and synthetic data sets. Compared with LC, our method performs better in terms with precision, memory requirement and time cost  II  D ENSITY OF DATA ITEM  In many data stream applications, recent data are more important than the older ones. To capture this, we use a fading factor  1  0    in calculating the data items’ support counts. Let the input data stream be X  x 1  x 2  x 3 For each data item x its support count decreases as x ages. We call such modified support counts the density of the data item. In each time step, the density of the data item will be reduced by a fading factor    Suppose t>t s here t is the  current time and t s is the latest time data item x being received. It is obvious that  s t t s t x D t x D          1 Although the density of a data item should be constantly modified by a fading factor  it is unnecessary to update the density values of all data records at every time step Instead, it is possible to update the density of a data item only when an identical new data item is received from the data stream. The time when the last data item x was received should be recorded so that density of x can be updated when a new data x arrives. Assuming a new data item x is received at time t n and the time when the last same data item x  arrived is t l   t n t l e density of x can be updated as follows  1          l t t n t x D t x D l n  2 Lemma 1 Let X  t e the set of all the data items that arrive from time 1 to t we have a           1 1 1 1      t t X x t x D for any t 1,2 b        1 1    lim   t X x t t x D  Proof: For a given time t        t X x t x D is the summation of the densities of the t data records arriving at time steps 1  t respectively. Denote the data record arriving at time t  1 t   t as a  t and its density at time t as D  a  t  t  Therefore, the summation over all the data items is    t t t X x t t a D t x D 1            Since  t t t t a D 1        tt   we have              1 1 1 1    1     t t t t t t X x t x D Also, it is clear that              1 1 1 1 lim    lim   t t t X x t t x D  Q.E.D Let 1  0   S be a user specified threshold, at time t a data item x is a frequent one if its density    1    S t x D  Let 1  0    be a user specified error bound and S We are asked to discover the data items with density at least     1 S The estimated densities output by our algorithm are less than the complete densities by at most    1  III  T HE ALGORITHM  M INER  A  The Framework of the Algorithm  Miner In our algorithm Miner, for each data item, a characteristic vector is defined as follows Definition 1 \(Characteristic Vector in Miner The characteristic vector of a data item x is C  x  x, D  x, t s  F  x, t s  t s  h ere t s  is the last time when data item x is received D  x, t s   is the relative density of data item x at time t s  F  x, t s is the density correction value of x at time t s  The algorithm processes the coming data from stream and updates a list L where each entry is the characteristic vector of a data item. The maximum size of L is len  1  The algorithm does not multiply the densities by the fading factor for all the entries in L at each time step instead the algorithm updates the density of a data item using t s only when an identical new data item is received from the data stream When the algorithm receives a new data item x from the stream, the algorithm modifies the list L by creating or updating a characteristic vector in L Whenever the size of L  goes beyond len the entry with the smallest density should be deleted. We can store this density value instead of subtracting it from all the entries in L To keep this deleted density value, the algorithm uses a record defined as follows Definition 2 \(Record of the Deleted Density   Miner saves the record of the deleted density     t where  is the deleted density in the algorithm at time  t  At beginning, the list L is empty or not full. There is no need to delete an entry. The initial value of record     t is set as   T h eref ore Wh en a new entry is inserted into the list L the new entry to be inserted into L is x 1,0 t  a ter whenever the size of L goes beyond len the entry                s s s t t x F t x D x with the smallest density should

be deleted  keeps this deleted density value and  t is set equal to the current time t         s t t s t x D     3 The framework of the algorithm Miner is as follows  Figure 1  The framework of Miner To avoid the operations of subtracting an identical density value from all of the entries, we just operate on the new created entry. Once the operation of deletion is happened, the value of  would be changed and updated Whenever the new data item x is received, the new created entry x 1,0 t  h ou l d be repl a ced by     1   t x t t t t           where 1         t t s t x D  and     t t s t x F    This causes the relative density in each entry in L does not reflect its actual value. Suppose the entry of x at time t is          s s s t t x F t x D x Then, its complete density    t x D a at time t should be  s s t t s t t s a t x F t x D t x D                4 To answer a query request at any time t only the frequent data entries         s s s t t x F t x D x satisfying    t x D a        1 S can be output The framework of the algorithm Query t as shown in Fig. 2  Figure 2  The framework of the algorithm Query t  From the algorithm Query t it is obvious that all items whose complete density exceeds   1 S must be output and no item whose complete density is less than     1 S is output.  The estimated densities of the output entries are less than the complete densities by at most    1   B  Complexity of the Algorithm   Miner Since the maximum size of queue L is L  1   Miner also requires no more than O  1 pace  Miner does not update all the entries at each time, but uses  to save the value which should be added to the new created entries later. Also the algorithm does not multiply the densities by fading factor  for all the entries in L at each time step instead it updates the density of a data item using t s only when a data item is received from the data stream. In each step, the algorithm processes one data item by the operation of inserting a new entry, or modifying an old entry in L or deleting an entry from L Therefore, time complexity for the algorithm to process one data item is O 1\ce the maximum size of list L is L  1   it is obvious that computation time for answering each query is O  1  IV  E XPERIMENTAL RESULTS  In order to compare with the similar method, we revise LC algorithm by adding  on it. We evaluate our algorithm and compare its performance in handling the data streams against LC in terms with space cost, computation time recall and precision  All experiments were carried out on 1.7GHz processor and 512 MB memory running Windows XP. In our experiments, we always fix  0.1 S  0.99 A  The Synthetic Data Sets We randomly generate four data sets with Zipf distribution. The size of each data set is 1000K.

Since the space cost of Miner is O  1 the memory requirement of Miner is a constant when  is fixed. But in LC  its  memory requirement is    log 1 n O    where n is the length of the data received from the stream. From Fig. 3, we can see our algorithm requires less memory than LC  The time costs of the two algorithms with 0.001 are shown in Fig. 4. It is obvious that Miner is much faster than LC  Fig. 5 shows the recalls of the two algorithms which are both 100%. The result empirically proves that the output of the algorithms have no false negatives. From Fig 6, we can see that Miner has higher precision than that of LC at each step B  The Real Data Set In this section, we adopt the log file data of visiting the 1998 Word Cup official web as the real data set  T h i s  log file records all of the visit requests for the word cup official web in the period of competition of 1998 Word Cup Each request consists of 8 attributions including visit time IP address, the ID of the visit web and so on. We pick up all of the IDs o f the visit webs as the experimental data set and find out the most frequent visit webs.

sketches is far more pronounced MSE is on average 48.9 higher with HC than CM with relative size of 50 and the difference between CM and CS is on average 69.26 for the same size In both cases any relationship between the difference and the number of items is doubtful  r  0  5  For MRE CS again has the lowest error but this time HC is similar to CM with a relative size of 100 and outperforms it when the size is 50 The errors are extremely high when compared to the Gaussian distribution with the smallest error being 78.55 and the largest 650.23 MRE is invariant with the number of items for CS  p  0  16  but is larger for smaller sizes For CM the error increases with the number of items  r  0  968  p  2  98 e  5  the same relationship appears for HC  r 0  913  p 0  0016  When it comes to the entropy estimation however while CS continues to outperform CM HC has comparable error to CS In fact HC averages a 28.5 smaller error than the best case of CS Unlike with the other distributions the error in entropy estimation actually increases with the number of items for CM but for CS the relationship is doubtful with statistical signi“cant for one size 75 but not the others With a xed relative size of 50 and varying skew the picture is slightly complex For MSE Fig.6\(a the skew has a large impact on the error with larger skews producing much smaller errors In all cases HC performs similarly to CM with CS having the lowest error For MRE Fig 6\(b the dependence on skew is still very evident but the order of performance changes With low skew CS has the smallest error followed by HC then CM but as the skew increases CS performs increasingly badly relative to CM and HC When the skew is 2.5 CM and CS have similar performance and HC is the best performing When the skew increases to 3 CS now has the largest error followed by CM and then HC The story for the entropy estimation Fig 6\(c is different again It remains the case that as the skew increases the errors decrease but this time HC always has the smallest error followed by CS and then CM When the skew is 2 the errors for the sketches increase with the number of items  p  0  0038  but when the skew is 3 the errors fall as there are more items  p 0  0008  for CM but there is no statistical signi“cance to the relationship for CS  p 0  659  At low skew the average error for CM is 42.92 11.81 for CS and 6.07 for HC When the skew is high the averages become 3.25 0.27 and 0.23 for CM CS and HC respectively D Orders of Magnitude The results for the uniform distribution Fig 7\(a show that CS has the largest errors followed by CM with HC having no errors at all The errors for                  a MSE                 b MRE                 c Entropy Fig 5 Performance of CM CS and HC for a synthetic Zip“an distribution with skew=2 relative size shown in brackets CM are virtually zero for all magnitudes with the average across all data set sizes being just 0.22 with a relative size of 1 In comparison the average error for CS is 10.15 for the same size and is a signi“cant 5.88 when no memory savings are being made A similar pattern is seen for the Gaussian distribution in Fig 7\(b Again HC has no error and the error for CM is an average of 0.22 even with just 1 relative size CS has slightly higher errors with the Gaussian distribution compared to a uniform one at 10.87 for 1 relative size and 6.12 for 100 relative size Things change dramatically in the Zip“an distribution shown in Fig 7\(c Here CM has the largest error averaging between 7.94 with 100 size and 8.90 84

item was seen If the true frequency is high then the discrepancy can become very large This cannot happen with CM The results for the Gaussian distribution are very similar to those of the uniform distribution but the errors are a little larger This is because the true frequencies in the Gaussian distribution do not vary by very large amounts Increasing the standard deviation lowers the errors because the frequencies become even more similar With the Zip“an distribution however the frequencies are scale-free That is there are very large differences in the true frequencies with a small number of items appearing a very large number of times and most items appearing only once For these distributions CM has the largest error because the heavy hitters can have a very large impact on a large number of items This is particularly true as the sketches become smaller and it is harder to avoid collisions with the most frequent items On the other hand CS can detect when an item has collided with a heavy hitter because its frequency is estimated as a negative number When this happens the frequency used is just one which is likely to be close to the true count for a non-heavyhitter CS therefore only needs to avoid heavy-hitters colliding with other heavy-hitters too often which is easier to do Although some measures have been used in this paper to examine the performance of sketches for probability estimation they are not objective The best that can be hoped for is to compare one or more estimators and consider their performance relative to each other but there can be no objective method of declaring an estimator to be good enough The question of whether an estimator is good enough depends entirely on what it will be used for We have therefore provided a straightforward estimator HC for comparison which we hope places the performance of the sketches into some context but we remain cautious about drawing strong conclusions from these results VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have considered the use of sketches for estimating the probability of all items in very large data sets The sketches are memory-ef“cient data structures designed for identifying and estimating the frequency of so-called heavy-hitters They are however in theory capable of estimating the frequency of all items To the best of our knowledge this is the rst attempt to examine their applicability to this problem In order to gain some understanding of the performance of the sketches we considered three metrics mean square error mean relative error and the error in entropy estimation Our results show that for uniform and Gaussian distributions the CM sketch performs very well even with very small sketch sizes whereas CS performs less well estimating the entropy incorrectly by an average of over 10 For Zip“an distributions however it is CS that performs best with increasingly better performance as the data set becomes more skewed The measures we have used are not objective and inherently it is impossible to declare an estimator good enough without reference to a speci“c task Thus the results in this paper are illustrative and suggestive only Additionally we considered only pure distributions which may not be re”ected in real data In particular data may be mixtures of different distributions We do conclude however that the sketches produce estimates with smaller errors than might seem likely from their construction which suggests that for some applications at least sketches need not be restricted only to the problem of nding the most frequent items In the future we would like to examine how the sketches perform with real data sets and whether even small errors as seen in the entropy estimations might affect the ranking of items for feature selection algorithms A CKNOWLEDGMENT Anthony Kleerekoper gratefully acknowledges funding from the EPSRC APT Platform Grant EP/G013500/1 Dr Luj  an is supported by a Royal Society University Research

our derivation in Section IV-D C Effect of Data Skewness We conduct experiments to evaluate the effect of data skewness on the performance of netFilter Figure 7\(a and b show the results under different 003 values data skewness with n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We adopt the optimal setting for netFilter obtained from similar experiments as in the above two subsections the lter size is set to 100 and the number of lters is set to 3 and 5 under n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We include the communication cost incurred by the naive approach for comparison For readability the y-axis is on log scale From these gures we can see that the cost incurred by netFilter is much smaller than that incurred by the naive approach For instance with n as 10 6 thecost incurred by netFilter is only 2  5 of that incurred by the naive approach In addition the cost incurred by both netFilter and the naive approach decreases with the data skewness For netFilter this is explained by the improved ltering performance under very skewed data For the naive approach as the data skewness increases the average number of distinct items that a peer propagates along the hierarchy is reduced resulting in reduced communication cost 1000 10000 100000 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness 001  netFilter  naive  1000 10000 100000 1e+06 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness

Figure 8 shows the results with 002 set to 0  1  0  01 and 0  001  Again we adopt the optimal setting for netFilter the size of lter and number of lters are set to 10 6 under 002  0.1 100 5 under 002  0.01 and 1000 2 under 002 0  001  From this gure we can see when the threshold ratio incr eases the communication cost decreases This is as expected since larger threshold implies less number of items satisÞes the threshold condition VI C ONCLUSION The need of identifying frequent items IFI appears in a variety of P2P applications In this study we investigate the problem of IFI in unstructured P2P systems and made the following contributions 1 We identify and formally deÞne the problem of IFI and discuss how the need of addressing IFI exists in a variety of applications in P2P systems 2 To 100

propose an efÞcient two-phase in-network processing approach netFilter and address various issues faced in realizing netFilter 3 We analyze the performance of netFilter derive the optimal setting mathematically and discuss how to set netFilter optimally in practice 4 We conduct extensive performance evaluation to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal In the future we plan to

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con“gurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con“gure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef“ciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/˜manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
