proposed to mine user behavior patterns which characterize the habits of mobile users and account for the associations between user interactions and context captured by mobile devices However the existing approaches for mining these behavior patterns are not practical in mobile environments due to limited computing resources on mobile devices To ful“ll this crucial void we investigate optimizing strategies which can be used for improving the ef“ciency of behavior pattern mining in terms of computing and memory needs Speci“cally we examine typical optimizing strategies for association rule mining and study the feasibility of applying them to behavior pattern mining since 
these two problems are similar in many aspects Moreover we develop an ef“cient algorithm named BP-Growth for behavior pattern mining by combining two promising strategies Finally experimental results show that BP-Growth outperforms benchmark methods with a signi“cant margin in terms of both computing and memory cost Keywords behavior pattern mining  optimizing strategies I I NTRODUCTION In recent years the development of mobile devices progressed at an ever fastest pace to make possible supporting various applications and services beyond the traditional speechcentric service such as music videos web browsing gaming and camera shooting just to name a few The rich user inter 
action information captured by the mobile device can be used to understand user habits which can bring a great business value such as data-driven user studies for marketing targeted advertising and personalized recommendation Consequently studying the habits of mobile users through their interactions attracts many researchers attention e.g 1…3  A distinct property of the user interactions with mobile devices is that they are usually associated with volatile contexts such as waiting a bus driving a car or doing shopping Intuitively some user interactions are context-aware that is the occurrences of these user interactions are in”uenced by the contexts of users For example some users would like to listen to music with their smart phones when taking a 
bus to the workplace but rarely do the same thing on other contexts The context-awarenes s of user interactions re”ects the habits of mobile users Therefore Cao et al 3 p ropos ed to characterize user habits by the associations between user interaction records and the corresponding contexts This kind of associations is referred to as behavior patterns  A wide range of context-aware services such as contextaware recommendation context-aware UI adaption  can be improved by understanding the habits of mobile users from their behavior patterns Moreover behavior patterns can be used to build user pro“les and segment users for marketing analysis Context logs collect the history context data and interaction 
records of mobile users and thus can be used as data sources for mining behavior patterns However mining behavior patterns is not a trivial problem because it can not be addressed by the traditional association rule mining 5…7  O n one hand we should not collect context data only when an interaction happens because it loses the discriminative information on how likely no interaction happens with a given context On the other hand if we always collect context data no matter whether any interaction happens the occurrences of contexts and user interaction records in context logs will be very unbalanced which makes it dif“cult to mine meaningful patterns through the traditional association rule mining approach Therefore 
Cao et al 3 d e ned t he probl em of beha vi or pat t e rn mi ni ng from a different perspective which takes context logs as time ordered sequences of context records and calculates the support of a context by taking into account its time ranges of appearances Moreover they proposed an effective algorithm named GCPM to solve the problem To protect user privacy and save the data ow it may be desirable to directly perform behavior pattern mining on users mobile devices instead of transiting the raw context data to the back end server and then perform ing mining However we nd it is dif“cult to apply GCPM in practical mobile computing environment due to the limited computing resource of mobile devices which motivates us to search effective strategies for 
improving the ef“ciency of behavior pattern mining To this end we investigate several typical optimizing strategies for association rule mining and discuss the feasibility of applying them to behavior pattern mining since the two problems are similar in some aspects The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows First to the best of our knowledge it is the rst attempt to systematically study the feasibility of applying typical optimizing strategies used in association rule mining to behavior pattern mining

the related work we rstly brie”y review the related notions of associ ation rule mining 6…8 an d behavior pattern mining 3 9 a s f ol l o w s  A Association Rule Mining A transaction database TDB is a set of transactions where each transaction denoted as a tuple Tid,X  contains a set of items i.e X  and is associated with a unique transaction identi“er Tid  A transaction Tid,X is said to contain itemset Y if Y 002 X  The number of transactions in TDB containing itemset Y is called the support of itemset Y  denoted as Sup  Y   Given a minimum support threshold min sup and a minimum con“dence threshold min conf  A  003 B is an association rule if Sup  A 004 B  005 min sup and Sup  A 002 B  Sup  A  005 min conf where A  B denote two nonoverlapped itemsets A is called the antecedent and B is called the consequent B Behavior Pattern Mining The problem of behavior pattern mining is proposed by Cao et al  for m i n i n g t he habi t s of mobi l e us ers from t hei r context logs which record thei r historical context data and interaction records A context log R contains several context records r 1 r 2 r n  and each context record r   Tid,C,I  consists of a timestamp Tid  the most detailed available context at that time C  and the corresponding user interaction record I  A context C consists of several contextual featurevalue pairs   f 1  v 1    f 2  v 2     f l  v l   where  f i  v i  denotes a context data type f i and the corresponding value v i  such as  Time range AM8:00-9:00  It is worth noting that we mention available because a context record may miss some context data though which context data should be collected is usually prede“ned For example the GPS coordinate is not available when the user stays indoors Moreover interaction records can be empty denoted as Null because user interactions do not always happen Table I illustrates a toy context log which contains 10 context records According to  f or t h e a s s oci a t i ons bet w een us er contexts and the user interactions with mobile devices they are regarded as behavior patterns if both their supports and con“dences are bigger than prede“ned thresholds Compared with the traditional association rule mining behavior pattern mining can address the unbalanced occurrences of context data and user interaction reco rds well due to its different way of calculating the supports of contexts To be speci“c it counts the support of a contex t by taking into account how many times it continuously appears in several adjacent context records which constitute a context range of the context For a context range which contains non-empty interaction records the number of non-empty interaction records is regarded as the support of the corresponding context in this context range Otherwise for a context range which only contains empty interaction records the support of the corresponding context is regarded as one in this context range Finally the support of the corresponding context is calculated by summing the supports in each of its context ranges Take the context log in Table I for example considering the context   Is a holiday No  Time range AM8:00-9:00    though it appears in seven context records its support is not seven but three because it has three context ranges i.e  t 1 t 2 t 3    t 38 t 39  and  t 58 t 59   respectively and each cont ext range at most has one nonempty interaction record Moreover since   Is a holiday No  Time range AM8:00-9:00   and  Playing Music Player  co-occur two times the con“dence of    Is a holiday No  Time range AM8:00-9:00  006 Playing Music Player  is 2/3  0.66 According to 3  t h e d e n itio n o f b eh a v io r patterns is formulated as follows De“nition 1 Support Con“dence Given a context C i and an interaction record I the support of C i w.r.t I denoted as Sup  C i  003 I  s 002 m Count m  I  where Count m  I  denotes the occurrence number of I in the m th context range of C i  Given a complete interaction set 002 the support of C i denoted as Sup  C i  s 002 I 003 002 Sup  C i  003 I  N 0 where N 0 denotes the number of C i s context ranges which only contain empty interaction records Moreover the con“dence of C i w.r.t I denoted as  Conf  C i  003 I  s Sup  C i  004 I  Sup  C i   De“nition 2 Promising Context Behavior Pattern Given a context C i if 007 I Sup  C i  003 I  005 min sup  C i is called a promising context  Moreover if Sup  C i  003 I  005 min sup and Conf  C i  003 I  005 min conf  C i  003 I is called a behavior pattern

named GCPM for behavior pattern mining As introduced in the previous section behavior patterns denote associations between user inte ractions and contexts captured by mobile devices However though traditional association rule mining is widely used for mining associations between items that usually co-occurred in same transactions from a transaction data base 6…8  i t can not be us ed t o mi ne beha vi or patterns because of the unbalanced occurrences of contexts and interaction records 3  T herefore C ao et al d e“ned t he problem of behavior pattern mining by using different metrics of support and con“dence  which are two key notions of association GCPM is an Apriori-like algorithm 8 wh ich iter a ti v e ly generates candidate behavior patterns by joining shorter promising contexts and checks their correctness from the original context log Though it can effectively nd meaningful behavior patterns we nd it is still dif“cult to apply it to a practical mobile computing environment since it has a relatively high requirement of main memory and big computation cost To this end we are motivated to nd a much more ef“cient algorithm for behavior pattern mining which ts limited computation resource The problem of association rule mining has been studied for more than a decade and a lot of optimizing strategies are proposed to improve the mining ef“ciency These strategies can be roughly grouped into four categories The rst category is to reduce the redundant data be fore performing mining The second category is to compress the original data set by FPTrees The third category is to adopt divide and conquer principle and partition the original data sets into several small data sets The last category is to discover patterns by directly comparing candidate patterns in the sorted data set Most of successful algorithms take advantage of more than one optimizing strategy For example FP-Growth 10 an d CLOSET 11 t a k e adv a nt age o f t he s t rat e gi es of remo

the strategies of removing redundant data data set partition and directly comparing candidate patterns Since the problem of behavior pattern is largely related to association rule mining the optimizing strategies for association rule mining may be used for improving the ef“ciency of behavior pattern mining It motivates us to systematically study these strategies and discuss the feasibility of applying them to behavior pattern mining IV C ANDIDATE O PTIMIZING S TRATEGIES FOR B EHAVIOR P ATTERN M INING A Removing Redundant Data In the problem of traditional association rule mining an item is infrequent if and only if its support is less than min sup  A widely used optimizing strategy is removing the infrequent items of the original database before performing association rule mining It is easy to prove that removing infrequent items will not affect the mined association rules according to the Apriori-Theory 8 In this w a y  both t he memory requirement and mining space of association rule mining are reduced Similarly in the problem of behavior pattern mining we can safely remove the unpromising contextual feature-value pairs from the context log The support of a contextual feature-value pair is calculated by taking it as a 1-context To prove this statement we rstly introduce the following lemmas Lemma 4.1 Given a promising context C i  for any unpromising contextual feature-value pair p  we can conclude p 010 011 C i  Proof Assume that p is unpromising and p 011 C i  According to De“nition 2 007 I Sup  C i  003 I  005 min sup  Moreover according to the Context-Apriori theorem 007 I Sup  p  003 I  005 min sup  However the conclusion is in con”ict with the statement that p is unpromising Therefore the assumption is false and the lemma is true Lemma 4.2 Given a context C i and a context log R  removing a contextual feature-value pair p from R where p 010 011 C i does not affect Sup  C i  and 012 I Sup  C i  003 I   Proof First given a context C i  for each context record in R denoted as r   Tid,C,I  removing p does not affect whether C i appears in C  Therefore removing p does not affect the context ranges of C i  Considering that the interaction records are not affected by removing p too it is obvious that removing p does not affect N 0 and 012 I Sup  C i  003 I  according to De“nition 1 Moreover since Sup  C i  002 I 003 002 Sup  C i  003 I  N 0  we can conclude that removing p does not affect Sup  C i   The above lemmas imply that for any promising context C i  removing unpromising contextual feature-value pairs does not affect 012 I Sup  C i  003 I  and Sup  C i   Therefore we can safely remove unpromising contextual feature-value pairs for

reducing the size of original context log and thus the mining space In the problem of behavior pattern mining the size of the original context log can be further safely reduced by removing the adjacent duplicate contex t records which only contain empty interaction records accord ing to the following theorems Theorem 1 Given a context log R  r 1 r 2 r n  a context C i if 007 1 005 s<m 005 n r s C  r s 1 C    r m C where r.C denotes the context of r and 012 s 005 k 005 m,I I 010 011 r k removing r s 1 r m does not affect Sup  C i  and 012 I Sup  C i  003 I   Proof Because no context record of r s 1 r m contains a non-empty interaction record removing r s 1 r m does not affect 012 I Sup  C i  003 I  according to De“nition 1 We only need to prove removing r s 1 r m does not affect N 0  i.e the number of C i s context ranges which only contain empty interaction records Firstly suppose C i is a sub-set of r k C  Thus 012 s 005 k 005 m C i 013 r k C because r s C  r s 1 C    r m C  According to the de“nition of context range r s 1 r m must be in a context range of C i  In this case removing r s 1 r m just modi“es the context range but does not remove it Thus N 0 wont be affected Secondly suppose C i is not a sub-set of r k C  Thus 012 s 005 k 005 m C i 010 013 r k C because r s C  r s 1 C    r m C  According to the de“nition of context range r s 1 r m must not be in any context range of C i  In this case removing r s 1 r m does not affect any context range of C i can thus does not affect N 0  Similarly we have the following theorem Theorem 2 Given a context log R  r 1 r 2 r n  a context C i if 007 1 005 s<m 005 n r s C  r s 1 C    r m C and 007 s 005 k 005 m,I I 011 r k removing r k  s 014 k 014 m  does not affect Sup  C i  and 012 I Sup  C i  003 I  if r k

rule mining FPTree is a pre“x tree of the lists of frequent items of the original transaction database A FP-Tr ee is usually much smaller than the original transaction database because transactions usually share the same pre“x The following gure gives an example of FP-Tree for the context log in Table II by taking contextual feature-value pairs as items It is worth noting that each node is associated with a support vector for recording the supports of the context derived from the path to the root node w.r.t each 000 002\002\003 004\005 006 007 010 004\005 006 011 010 004 012 006\007 010

record and the corresponding N 0  For example Node A contains a support vector for recording the supports of   a 3   b 2   c 5  w.r.t I 1  I 2 and N 0  In contrast in association rule mining each node of FP-Tree only records the frequency that the item set derived from the path to the root node occurs as pre“xes of transactions 10  However we nd that FP-Tree cannot be applied to behavior pattern mining because the probl em of behavior pattern mining has not an important property that association rule mining has To ease introducing the property we introduce the following notion rstly De“nition 3 Minimum Coverage Path Given an item set 002  a FP-Tree T if1 N is a node of T where the item set derived from the path from the root node of T to N is a super set of 002  and 2 there exists no a path from the root node of T to an ancestor node of N which can also derive a super set of 002  the path between N and the root of T is called a minimum coverage path of 002  Property 1 Minimum Coverage Path Completeness In the problem of association rule mining given an item set 002 a FP-Tree T wehave Sup  002  002 N N.freq wherethepath between N and the root of T makes a minimum covering path of 002 and N.freq indicates the frequency that the item set derived from the corresponding minimum covering path occurs as pre“xes of original transactions This property is very important for the success of FP-Tree to maintain all necessary information for association rule mining For example if we take the context log in Table II as a transaction database and c onsider the FP-Tree in Figure 1 in the view of association rule mining we can calculate the frequency of   b 2   c 5  by summing the frequencies of   a 2   b 2   c 5  and   a 3 b 2   c 5  which are recorded by node A and node B respectively By contrast in the problem of behavior pattern mining we can not calculate the support of a context in a similar way Take the FP-Tree in Figure 1 for example given a context C i    b 2   c 5   node A and node B contribute two minimum covering pathes of C i which derive   a 2   b 2   c 5  denoted as C j nd   a 3   b  2   c 5  denoted as C k  respectively As mentioned

above node A records N 0 1  Sup  C j  003 I 1   Sup  C j  003 I 2 0  and node B records N 0 0  Sup  C k  003 I 1   Sup  C k  003 I 2   Thus both Sup  C j  and Sup  C k  are 1 However we can not calculate Sup  C i  since Sup  C i  010  Sup  C j  Sup  C k  The challenge of applying FP-Tree to behavior pattern mining is that FP-Tree can not maintain al l necessary information for mining behavior patterns which is caused by the different way of calculating supports C Data Set Partition The major computation cost of Apriori-like algorithms comes from the generation of candidate patterns In association rule mining the strategy of data set partition is usually used to avoid candidate pattern generation For example FPGrowth 10 and C LOS ET 11  r ecursively generate candidate FP-Trees from the original FP-Tree The main idea of data set partition is to recursively partition the original data set into smaller sub-datasets and then mine patterns on the basis of the seed patterns of each sub-data set Since in behavior pattern mining we can not use a FP-Tree to compress the original context log we should study the association rule mining algorithms which take advantage of data set partition strategy but do not use FP-Trees The typical algorithms of them are Pre“xSp an 12 and P T A C  14  Ins t ead of performing FP-Tree based partition they take advantage of an alternative data partition approach named Pre“x Projection  The main idea of pre“x projection is to recursively partition the original data set with pre“xes as projected data sets and make the new mined patterns from the projected data sets as new pre“xes To depict how to apply pre“x projection to behavior pattern mining lets introduce the following related notions De“nition 4 Pre“x Projection and Suf“x Given a context C i    x 1  v 1    x 2  v 2     x l  v l    one of its subcontexts C j    y 1  u 1    y 2  u 2     y m  u m   is called a pre“x of C i if and only if 012 1 005 k 005 m  x k  y k  015  v k  u k   Given a context record r  Tid,C i I  and one context C j 013 C i the projection of r w.r.t pre“x C j is rp   Tid,C p I  where C p is the longest sub-context of C i which has a pre“x C j  Moreover the suf“x of r w.r.t pre“x C i is rs  Tid,C s I  where C s  C p  C j  For example given a context record r  t 2    a 2   b  3   c 4   d 1  I 2  and a context  b 3  the projection of r w.r.t pre“x   b 3  is rp  t 2    b 3   c 4   d  1  I 2  and the suf“x of r w.r.t pre“x   b 3  is rs   t 2    c 4   d 1  I 2   De“nition 5 Projected Context Log Given a context log R and a context C j the projected context log of R w.r.t pre“x C j is a timestamp ordered suf“x sequence R  C j which contains all suf“xes of context records in R w.r.t pre“x C j  For example Table III shows the projected context log of the context log in Table II w.r.t pre“x   b 3   The suf“x of a context record can be taken as a special context record The related notions about context record also t suf“x Similarly the related notions about context log such TABLE III T HE PROJECTED CONTEXT LOG OF THE CONTEXT LOG IN T ABLE II W  R  T  PREFIX   b 3  Tid Context Interaction t 1   c 5  Null t 2   c 5   d 1

log Because projected c ontext logs are usually dramatically smaller than the original context log the search space of mining behavior patterns will be reduced if we can mine behavior patterns from the projected context logs Since the factors of indicating a behavior pattern C i  003 I are Sup  C i  003 I  and Sup  C i   if we can calculate the two factors from projected context logs we will be able to mine behavior patterns from projected context logs Theorem 3 Given a context C j    x 1  v 1    x 2  v 2     x l  v l   and one of its super contexts C i    x 1  v 1    x 2  v 2     x l  v l    x l 1  v l 1    012 I Sup  C i  003 I  Sup  C j  x l 1  v l 1  003 I  where Sup  C j  016  indicates the support of 016 in R  C j  This theorem is easy to prove It implies that given a l 1 context C i  denoting the last context feature-value pair of C i as  x l 1  v l 1   we can calculate Sup  C i  003 I  by calculating Sup  C j  x l 1  v l 1  003 I  where C j denotes the context generated by

3  It is because the projected context log may lose the information of context range contained by the original context log Fortunately we can solve this problem by extracting the context ranges of the pre“x C j from the original context log rstly and then build the projected context logs w.r.t pre“x C j in each context range of C j  Theorem 4 Given a context C j    x 1  v 1    x 2  v 2     x l  v l

where Sup k  C j  016  indicates the support of 016 in the projected context log from the k th context range of C j  This theorem is also easy to prove With this theorem we can perform behavior pattern mining in projected context logs For example Table IV shows the projected context logs of the context log in Table II w.r.t pre“x   b 3  for each context range of   b 3   From the projected

and access candidate promising contexts The experimental results show that the memory cost of GCPM-H is comparable to the original GCPM while the running time drops more than 10 ten times averagely 3 9   GCPM-H-R  An optimization of GCPM-H which adopts the strategy of removing redundant data In other words it rstly removes redundant data and then performs GCPM-H in the pruned context log  BP-Growth-NR  An algorithm which takes advantage of the same strategy of data set partition as BP-Growth but does not remove redundant data in the original context log and projected context logs As mentioned above it is desirable to directly perform behavior pattern mining on users smart devices for protecting user privacy and saving data ow which motivates us to nd an ef“cient algorithm for behavior pattern mining which can work well in practical mobile computing environments Therefore all experiments in this paper are conducted in a practical mobile computing environment To be speci“c in the following experiments the BP-Growth algorithm and all baselines are implemented by Qt on a Nokia N97 smart phone with S60v5 operating system 128MB main memory and 434MHZ CPU It is worth noting that the operating system needs more than 70MB main memory for running Consequently the development guideline claims the available main memory for third party programs are less than 40MB B Cost of Running Memory Since the available memory of smart phones for third part programs is usually much less than PC memory cost is an important indicator for the ef“ciency of algorithms which run in mobile computing environments Therefore in this section we rstly compare the memory cost of BP-Growth and the baselines on varying context logs Limited by space it is not feasible to show the detailed experimental results for all collected context logs Instead we randomly select two context logs namely R A and R B to show the detailed experimental results and report part of experimental results for other context logs Finally we summarize the observations from experimental results Figure 2 a and Figure 2 b compare the memory cost of BP-Growth the optimization of BP-Growth which takes advantage of pseudo projection technology denoted as BPGrowth-P  and the baseline algorithms with varying settings of min sup on R A and R B  respectively The min conf is set to be 0  5  The memory cost of GCPM-H and GCPM-HR with min sup 2 is not available because in this case its memory cost is over the memory limit 40MB of the experimental smart phone and the program terminates with an exception From the gures we can see that the memory cost of BP-Growth BP-Growth-P and BP-Growth-NR is dramatically less than GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R with relatively small min sup  To be speci“c they reduce more than 75 memory cost compared with GCPM-H in the best case In contrast when min sup increases bigger and bigger their memory cost becomes comparable to GCPM-H 2 4 6 8 10 0 5 10 15  Min_sup Memory cost\(KB

Numbers of mined behavior patterns for context logs a R A and b R B with varying min sup and the xed min conf 0  5  It is worth noting that the relatively good performance of GCPM in terms of memory

patterns with varying settings of min sup and the xed min conf 0  5 on R A and R B  respectively We can see that the number of mined behavior patterns drops quickly when the min sup increases Thus it is more meaningful to compare the memory cost of different algorithms by considering their performance with relatively small min sup  Moreover from Figure 2 a and Figure 2 b we can see that the memory cost of BP-Growth BP-Growth-P and BPGrowth-NR is stable with varying settings of min sup while GCPM-H and GCPM-H-Rs memory cost is sensitive to the decrease of min sup  0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 0 1 2 3 x 10 4

show the similar phenomenon Figure 8 shows the running time of all algorithms with min sup 3 and min conf 0  5 on all context logs From this gure we can see that the running time of BP-Growth BPGrowth-P is dramatically less than BP-Growth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R on all context logs Summary  by comprehensively analyzing the experimental results for running time we summarize the observations as follows a BP-Growth BP-Growth-P dramatically outperform BPGrowth-NR GCPM-H and GCPM-H-R in terms of running time It implies that the strategy of removing redundant data plays a more important role in reducing the running time for behavior pattern mining than the strategy of data set partition and the improvement for data set partition based algorithms is more dramatic b GCPM-H-R is roughly comparable to GCPM-H in terms of running time It implies that applying the strategy of removing redundant data to an Apriori-like algorithm only leads to very limited improvement of running time c BP-Growth-P is roughly comparable to BP-Growth in terms of running time It implies that the pseudo projection technology only has very limited effect on reducing the running time of BP-Growth VII CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we studied several strategies which may be used for improving the ef“ciency of behavior pattern mining in terms of computing ef“ciency and memory cost To be speci“c we searched some typical optimizing strategies for association rule mining and discuss the feasibility of applying them to behavior pattern mining since the two problems are similar in many aspects Moreover we proposed a novel and ef“cient algorithm named BP-Growth for behavior pattern mining by combining two promising strategies The extensive experiments in a practical mobile computing environment clearly show that BP-Growth and its optimization signi“cantly outperform GCPM and other two baselines which adopt one of the two promising strategies in terms of both running time and memory cost One challenge of utilizing behavior patterns is that there usually exists thousands of behavior patterns for an individual mobile user Usually many of them are semantically similar or related and may be summarized by several representative patterns As for future work we plan to study the effective approaches to summarize lots of behavior patterns for easing the representation of user habits while maintaining as much information as possible VIII A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research was supported by grants from Nokia Research Center China Natural Science Foundation of China Grant

Figure 6 is not as signi“cant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to ef“ciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
