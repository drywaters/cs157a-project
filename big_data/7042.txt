Code Smell Detecting Tool and Code Smell-Structure Bug Relationship  Phongphan Danphitsanuphan Department of Computer and Information Science King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok Bangkok, Thailand  phongphand@kmutnb.ac.th Thanitta Suwantada Department of Computer and Information Science King Mongkut's University of Technology North Bangkok Bangkok, Thailand  thanitta.su@gmail.com   Abstract   This paper proposes an approach for detecting the socalled bad smells in software known as Code Smell. In considering software bad smells, object-oriented software metrics were used to detect the source code whereby Eclipse Plugins were developed for detecting in which location of Java source code the bad smell appeared so that software refactoring could then take place. The detected source code was classified into 7 types: Large Class, Long Method, Parallel Inheritance Hierarchy, Long Parameter List, Lazy Class, Switch Statement, and Data Class  This work conducted analysis by using 323 j ava classes to ascertain the relationship between the code smell and structural defects of software by using the data mining techniques of Naive Bayes and Association Rules. The result of the Naive Bayes test showed that the Lazy Class caused structural defects in DLS, DE and Se. Also, Data Class caused structural defects in UwF, DE and Se, while Long Method, Large Class, Data Class, and Switch Statement caused structural defects in UwF and Se. Finally Parallel Inheritance Hierarchy caused structural defects in Se However, Long Parameter List caused no structural defects whatsoever. The results of the Association Rules test found that the Lazy Class code smell caused structural defects in DLS and DE, which corresponded to the results of the Naive Bayes test Index Terms-- Code smell, Refactoring, Software metric Structural  bugs  I   I NTRODUCTION  It is important to always keep up with a software maintenance process as it helps improve the system to perform to its best ability and to work suitably in line with the user’s purpose. Such a process can be described as an improvement of the software’s defects density or a development of the software that leads to its efficient and appropriate function within the system’s environment. However, in software development, there could be a limitation in terms of time therefore, the refactoring is often neglected because of complications and resource consumption  Code smell detection without an effective tool and the differences regarding basic knowledge about code smell together with the different software refactoring of each software developer can bring about difficulty in setting the bottom line of when to conduct the refactoring and how much needs to be done  In particular, the occurrence of code smell in software depends on the coding behavior of programmers; therefore code smell detection is difficult and also lacks accuracy. In large programming projects, software developers might forget or be confuse about which code smell has already been fixed which leads to work duplication  This paper proposes a tool that helps detect the location of the source code of code smell in Java programs under the concept of Martin Fowler [6  who presented a theory about code smell and software refactoring, and who developed a tool called Eclipse Plug-in. In addition, code smell and structural bug relationships are analyzed and elaborated in this paper II  C ODE S MELL  Code smell is the bad part of source code that creates difficulty to understand and improve the software. The principle of code smell is to indicate the coding spots that need to be refactored. There are 22 types of bad source code     but only some types of code smell can be measured by software metrics. These are Large Class, Long method, Long Parameter and Lazy class   III  S OFTWARE M ETRICS  Software Metrics are a quantitative measurement of software. In this paper, we focus only on source code’s metrics as referred to in the following table [1 1 9  3     Notation Title Level NOM Number of Methods Class LOC Lines of Code Class DIT Depth of Inheritance Tree Class PAR Number of Parameters Method 978-1-4577-1964-6/12/$31.00 ©2012 IEEE

It creates malfunctions in the system, such as slow compiling, difficulty in fixing or improving source code, and incorrect program output As there are many kinds of software structure bugs  we have chosen 6 structural bugs at are com m o n l y f o u n d  from experimenting source code \(323 Java classes\. They are as follows   SE_BAD_FIELD \(SE This Serializable class defines a non-primitive instance field which is neither transient, Serializable, nor java.lang.Object, and does not appear to implement the Externalizable interface or th e readObject\(\d writeObject methods.  Objects of this class will not be deserialized correctly if a non-Serializable object is stored in this field  DE_MIGHT_IGNORE \(DE This method might ignore an exception.  In general exceptions should be handled or reported in some way, or they should be thrown out of the method  UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR UwF This field is never initialized within any constructor, and is therefore could be null after the object is constructed. This could be a either an error or a questionable design, since it means a null pointer exception will be generated if that field is dereferenced before being initialized   DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE \(DLS This instruction assigns a value to a local variable, but the value is not read or used in any subsequent instruction. Often this indicates an error, because the value computed is never used  REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION \(REC This method uses a try-catch block that catches Exception objects, but Exception is not thrown within the try block, and RuntimeException is not explicitly caught. It is a common bug pattern to say try { ... } catch \(Exception e\omething } as a shorthand for catching a number of types of exception each of whose catch blocks is identical, but this construct also accidentally catches RuntimeException as well, masking potential bugs  DM_NUMBER_CTOR \(DM Using new Integer \(int\ is guaranteed to always result in a new object whereas Integer.valueOf\(int\ws caching of values to be done by the compiler, class library, or JVM Using of cached values avoids object allocation and the code will be faster V  B AD S MELL D ETECTING T OOL BSDT BSDT is implemented as Eclipse plug-in [4 d is cap ab le of detecting subsequent bad smells as depicted in table 1 by using a predefined threshold of software metrics which were elaborated from previous works as shown in the table below   Code Smell Level Metrics & threshold Reference Large Class Class NOM > 20 || NOF > 9 LOC >750 Long Method Method MLOC > 50 Long Parameter List Method PAR > 5  Switch Statements Method VG > 10  Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies Class DIT > 3 || NSC > 4  Data Class Class WMC > 50 || LCOM 0.8 [1 Lazy Class Class NOM < 5 && NOF 5\| DIT < 2 Table 2: Showing the appropriate threshold allocation for code smell and software metrics     


BSDT verification   In bad smell source code detection, BSDT possesses the ability to display the detected code smells, software metric values, and location of the bad smell in the associated source code, including the ability to link to the detected code smell location. Besides, the tool can provide the definition of the code smells and facilitate the proper refactoring method as shown in Fig. 1. Then, the tool will store the code smell detection result file in the extension form of .CVS for further Bad smell” - “Structure bug” relationship analysis   Figure 1: Code smell detection result  From the testing of BSDT by using known bad smell source code, which was the movie rental program and electricity calculating program from “Refactoring: Improving the Design of existing Code” book h e t ool cou l d  i n di cat e the type of code smell, software metrics value, and the location of the bad smell in source code with 100% accuracy When retesting with the tool after the code smells had been fixed, the fixed code smells were not being detected again This shows that BSDT was able to detect the bad smell and display the code smell detection results correctly Project Name  LOC Known smell type Known Smell Known detecte d smell Accuracy Movie rental Program 122 Lazy Class 5 5 100 Long Method 1 1 100 Switch Statement 1 1 100 Electricity calculating program 336 Lazy Class 3 3 100 Long Method 2 2 100 Switch Statement 2 2 100 Table 3: The BSDT testing result VI  B AD SMELL AND S TRUCTURAL BUG  CORRELATION ANALYSIS  In the analysis of the correlation between code smell and software structure bugs, the 323 data sets, which were the Java program source codes from 35 different projects and 18 different authors, were used. However, in each data set, there were over 5 classes or more than 300 LOCs \(Lines of Code and that amount can be added up to 42,777 lines When introducing source codes into the process of bad smell detection and also using the same set of data with the program Find Bug n  order t o  det ect t h e s t ru ct u r al bu g s t h e researcher used data mining by u s in g  Naiv e bay e s  an d Association Rules techniques to analyze which kind of software structure bug was being caused by each type of code smell. In the analysis, there are 2 factors as follows  1. Input factors are 7 types of code smell, which are Data class, Large class, Long method, Long Parameter List, Parallel Inheritance Hierarchy, Switch Statement, and Lazy class 2. Predict factors are 6 kinds of software structure bug which are Se, DE, UwF, DLS, REC, and DM  The result from the analysis of the correlation between code smell and software structure bug  Probability Calculation Value P\(LazyClass|DLS\ 0.661 P\(LazyClass|DE\ 0.767 P\(DataClass|UwF\ 0.779 P\(DataClass|Se\ 0.780 P\(LongMethod|UwF\ 0.779 P\(LongMethod|Se\ 0.630 P\(LargeClass|UwF\ 0.779 P\(LargeClass|Se\ 0.779 P\(SW|UwF\ 0.588 P\(SW|Se\ 0.606 P\(PIH|Se\ 0.756 Table 4: Probability calculation [21 o f co de sm e l l and so f t w a r e str u ct ur e  bug from Naive Bayes technique result  The analysis of P\(LazyClass | DLS\0.67 from the mentioned values shows that the calculated probability values are high due to the DLS type of software structure bug. That means the local variable has been set but never been used However, Lazy Class code smell is the class that does not do much work. It can possibly be interpreted as meaning that not every local variable is being used, so the DLS type of software structure bug occurs frequently  The high values in the probability analysis of P\(DE LazyClass\ = 0.62, and P\(LazyClass | DE\affected by the DE \(DE_MIGHT_IGNORE\pe of software structure bug which is the bug describing a method that might ignore an exception. In general, exceptions should be handled or  


reported in some way, or they should be thrown out of the method  It is noticed that Lazy Class code smell, which does not do much work, has fewer parameters and methods; therefore, this often leads to the programmer’s neglect in handling exceptions. Consequently, in Lazy Class code smell, it is more likely that the DE type of software structure bug will be found  From the analysis of P\(Se | LargeClass\ = 0.76, and P\(LargeClass | Se\.77, the probability values are quite high. It is noticeable that th e SE \(SE_BAD_FIELD\pe of software structure bug, which detects Serializable classes defines a non-primitive instance field which is neither transient, Serializable, or java.lang.Object, and does not appear to implement the Externalizable interface or the readObject\(\d writeObject\(\ethod. Objects of this class will not be deserialized correctly if a non-Serializable object is stored in this field  As being studied, Large Class code smell has a large number of lines of code, global variables, and methods, as well as a complicated function. There is a high probability that the Se type of software structure bug can be found due to the fact that the Large Class code smell has many global variables  From the observations of source codes used in the experiment, there is no software structure bug occurring from Long Parameter List code smell. It was found that none of the 6 detected software structure bugs detected the parameter Thus, from the results, there is no correlation between Long Parameter List code smell and the various types of software structure bugs  It can be noticed in the probability analysis of P\(LargeClass|UwF\ = 0.71 that  the UwF type of software structure bug is a local variable without the default value set in the constructor, which leads to a null variable. It is obvious that Large Class code smell is rather big and has a lot of global variables. Therefore, it is possible that the programmer might skip the value setting for some variables or, because of the large number of variables, only important variables may be selected to be set  P\(PIH|Se\ = 0.77 from the mentioned probability shows that the Se type of software structure bug is the Primitive variable, not a local variable, and does not have input and output management using the Externalizable Standard class in JDK 1.1. It is noticeable from PIH code smell that when a sub class is created, it could also be another class’ sub class. For example, if Class B is Class A’s sub class, when creating Class C from Class B, it also means that Class C is the sub class of Class A. In this case, if too much inheritance occurs, it is hard to read, to understand, to fix or to make changes. As in this case, when Class A runs a Move Method or Move Field, it is possible that the sub classes \(Class B and Class C\, which are referred to as the super class’ Method or Field, could not be found. In high PIH value source code, it the Se type of software structure bug is likely to be found due to the multiple inheritance source code, which refers to the big system with complicated functioning. Therefore, many variables are needed, including various types of variable, not only base variables. Thus, the chance of occurrence of the Se type of software structure bug is high  VII  T HE EXPERIMENT USING A SSOCIATION R ULES MINING TECHNIQUE  Only DLS and DE were detected by using Association rule techniques.  The following association rule threshold configurations were set  Minimum support = 10 items Minimum rule probability = 0.4  First detect: all types of code smell does not affect DLS but the LZC code smell possesses the possibility to cause and not to cause DLS as depicted in fig. 2   Figure 2: Code smells and DLS type of software structure bug using Association Rules technique  Second detect: all types of code smell do not affect DE but it is likely that DE could be or could not be caused by LZC code smell as shown in fig. 3   Figure 3: Code smells and DE type of software structure bug using Association Rules technique 


From the testing results using Association Rules mining there is only one code smell, Lazy Class, which can cause 2 types of software structure bug: DLS, and DE  VIII  C ONCLUSION  BSDT is able to detect the bad smell in Java source code and shows the results of the detection accurately against source code testing  From the Naïve Bayes probability calculation, when different types of code smell occur, there is a high probability that DLS and DE could occur when the Lazy Class code smell is found. UwF showed significant occurrences of Long Method code smell. UwF and Se were greatly affected by Large Class. Lastly, Se was highly associated with PIH  The Association Rules testing results only show that Lazy Class code smell brings about DLS and DE software structure bugs, which correspond with the results of the Naïve Bayes experimenting                               R EFERENCES  1 P i y a nuc h Che r m c ha ip um e   Software Metric Support towards Refactoring Inference Khon Kaen University of Information Technology, 2008 2  T h isa n a P i e n l e r t an d P o r n s i r i  Mue n c h aisr i  Ba d S m e l l D e te ctio n usi n g  Object-Oriented Software Metrics International Society of Computers and Their Applications \(ISCA\ International Conference on Computer Science, Software Engineering, Information Technology, e-Business and Applications \(CSITeA'04 Cairo, Egypt, December 2004 3 a n g Sa e T a n g   Design and Implementation of a Measurement Tool for Object-Oriented Programs Chulalongkorn University of Computer Engineering, 2001 4  Cl ay be r g E r ic, an d D a n Ru be l   Eclipse: Building Commercial-Quality Plug-ins 2nd ed., Boston: Addison-Wesley, 2006 5  Cr e s po Y a nia   Car l o s  L o pe z  Raul M a r t i c o r e n a, a n d E s pe r a nz a Ma ns o   Language independent metrics support towards refactoring inference in 9th ECOOP Workshop on QAOOSE 05 \(Quantitative Approaches in Object-Oriented Software Engineering Glasgow: UK.

improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to ef“ciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
