However datadriven methods to dynamically prioritize and genera te tasks are not well investigated in the domain of remote h ealth monitoring This paper presents a wireless health p roject WANDA that leverages sensor technology and wirele ss communication to monitor the health status of patie nts with diabetes The WANDA dynamic task management functio n applies data analytics in real-time to discretize c ontinuous features applying data clustering and association rule mining techniques to manage a sliding window size dynamica lly and to prioritize required user tasks The developed algor ithm minimizes the number of daily action items required  by patients with diabetes using association rules that  satisfy a minimum support confidence and conditional probabi lity thresholds Each of these tasks maximizes informati on gain thereby improving the overall level of patient adhe rence and satisfaction Experimental results from applying EM based clustering and Apriori algorithms show that the dev eloped algorithm can predict further events with higher co nfidence levels and reduce the number of user tasks by up to 76.19 Keywords remote health monitoring wireless health  telemedicine diabetes real-time feedback task op timization association rule mining Apriori algorithm expecta tion maximization algorithm  I  I NTRODUCTION  In the United States, 8.3% of the population has di abetes with $174 billion spent annually on the disease.

This paper describes a human-centered task optimizi ng process combining data discretization methods and f irstorder logic to reduce the burden in remote diabetes  patient monitoring systems This technique was verified usi ng WANDA Weight and Activity with Blood Pressure and Other Vital Signs a remote monitoring system leve raging wireless sensor and communication technologies to m onitor the health status of patients with diabetes [8    T he WANDA diabetes study was designed in collaboration betwee n the UCLA Computer Science Department and the UCLA Ronald Regan Medical Center. In this study, we appl ied data clustering and association rule mining techniques t o 21 of the subjects with Type-2 Diabetes enrolled in the inter vention group The experimental results show that the devel oped algorithm can reduce the required time windows by 8 0 compared to the case of using experts knowledge to  reach the maximum conditional probability In addition t he developed algorithm reduces the number of tasks by up to 76.19% with a minimum confidence of 0.95  II  R ELATED W ORKS  A  Remote Health Monitoring for Diabetics According to Desai 16   a n  e f f e c t i v e  r e m o t e  h e a l t h  monitoring system must contain the necessary elemen ts that together complete the circle of disease management Some of the important circle elements are the reliable meas urement of physiological variables that can help in the early detection of adverse events, the efficient transmission of data to enable a timely response the direct reception of data by pe rsonnel qualified to recommend an effective intervention, a nd patient adherence Many studies 17  1 8   1 9   h a v e  s h o w n  t h e  e f f e c t i v e n ess of remote health monitoring for patients with diabe tes Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of remote  health monitoring include the accuracy of the collected da ta automated feedback and decision support and improve ments in clinical outcomes inlcuding HbA1c or glycemic variability 20   T h e  s t u d i e s  h a v e  d e m o n s t r a t e d  t h e  effectiveness of well-designed remote monitoring sy stems that collect accurate data using sensors and reduce  the time interval between blood glucose measurements and fee dback from healthcare professionals Well-designed remote  health monitoring can also help patients manage their medi cations and daily behavioral routines including their dieta ry intakes and activity patterns IDEATel is one of the most successful remote health  monitoring studies between 2000 and 2008 18  2 1    IDEATel utilized devices and techniques from Americ an Telecare [22   I n  t h i s  s t u d y   p a t i e n t s  w i t h  d i a b e t e s monitored and uploaded blood pressure and blood glucose value s through a serial port connected to a computer and also participated in videoconferencing, electronic messa ging, and accessing study web pages The IDEATel study result ed in improved HbA1c, LDL-cholesterol and blood pressure levels over 5 years compared to the control group who did not use IDEATel components In Stone's study 19   p a t i e n t s  w i t h  d i a b e t e s  m e a s u red blood glucose, blood pressure, and weight using the Viterion 100 Telemonitor 23  c o n n e c t e d  t o  a  t e l e p h o n e  l i n e   If the transmitted readings were in an abnormal range nur se practitioners adjusted medication for blood glucose  blood pressure and lipid control based on American Diabet es Association target values The intervention resulte d significant reductions in HbA1C levels, which is re levant to long-term blood glucose level Montori's study 24  a l s o  d e m o n s t r a t e d  i m p r o v e m e n t  in HbA1c levels after 6 months use of a telemonitoring system The patients in the intervention arm measured their  blood glucose using the ACCU-CHEK Complete glucometer 25   and a phone-line connection. Nurses spent an averag e of 50 more minutes per patient providing feedback to pati ents over the phone demonstrating the increased collaboratio n between patients and their healthcare providers wit h the use of these technologies. As diabetes control is so cl osely linked to  variations in daily activities such as dietary intake and physical activity the exchange of information rega rding daily blood glucose readings meal and/or activity planning are critical for patient education and support [26   B  Patient-orientedRemote Health Monitoring One way to quantify patient satisfaction with healt h monitoring systems is  to evaluate the amount of sy stem use 20   H u a n g   2 7   d e s i g n e d  a  n e u r a l  n e t w o r k b a s e d  r e mote health monitoring system adoption model to predict the behavior intention toward using the system using s urvey answers as inputs  to the model \(Figure 1 Wu's study 28  s h o w e d  t h a t  a c c e p t a n c e  a n d  s a t i s f a c tion with a mobile healthcare system is related to compa tibility ease of use and perceived usefulness. In addition this study showed that the perceived usefulness and ease of us e are highly related to self-efficacy which is a belief that the person has an ability to execute a series of requir ed tasks. As self-efficacy is related to task complexity [29   i t is important to make the task procedure simple         n  n  Figure 1 Huang's research structure[27   N o t e   p e r ceived ease of use PEOU perceived usefulness and benefits PUB pe rceived disease threat \(PDT\, perceived barriers of taking action PBTA\, external cues to action \(ECUE\, internal signs\(IS\, attitude towa rd using \(ATT\, and behavioral intention to use \(BI

Time and cost-effectiveness is also an important cr iterion related to patient satisfaction of remote health mo nitoring systems Time-effectiveness is a factor of perceive d ease of use while cost-effectiveness is one of perceived u sefulness 30   E s t i m a t i o n s  i n  t h e  d e g r e e  o f  c o s t  r e d u c t i o n  w ith use of remote health monitoring studies compared to tradit ional care have varied between 1.6 to 68.3 31   R e d u c e d hospitalization and nursing home visits are major contributors of the cost lowering effects in remote  health monitoring However initial costs of device and se rvice purchase can be an obstacle to user satisfaction de spite longterm savings 18   T h e r e f o r e   r e d u c i n g  t h e  n u m b e r  o f required devices and daily tasks can reduce further  costs of equipments and physician workload In our study we focus on the perceived ease of use  and usefulness of the system for enhancing patient sati sfaction and adherence rates by decreasing the number of req uired sensors and tasks  III  S YSTEM A RCHITECTURE  WANDA is a three-tier end-to-end remote monitoring system with extensive hardware and software compone nts designed to cover the broad spectrum of the telehea lth and remote monitoring paradigm The overall architectur e is summarized in Figure 2 and further details are avai lable in 8   The first tier of the architecture consists of a da ta collection framework, which is formed from a hetero geneous set of sensing devices that measure various bodily statistics such as blood glucose weight body fat body water  blood pressure heart rate blood oxygen saturation and b ody movements Considering the variability in age and preferences with regard to network options [1  3 2   we offer several communication options. The data from these sensors are collected processed and transmitted via a pho ne-line Ethernet or smartphone-based gateway to the cloud—t he second tier of the WANDA architecture Data are stored and indexed using a scalable databa se and can be easily accessed. Data collected from the fir st tier are sent to web servers to store data and provide monit oring applications such as those in Figure 3 Through the  monitoring applications healthcare providers can l eave comments and annotation of collected data, as well as export data Additionally the WANDA web application inclu des a basic statistical analysis tool to verify the test result and the effectiveness of the clinical trial This function includes Wilcoxon rank test log-rank test t-test etc whi ch are widely used in many randomized trials [33   The last tier of the WANDA architecture is a backen d analytics engine capable of continuously generating  statistical models and predicting outcomes using va rious machine learning and data mining algorithms. Once d ata are transmitted to the server basic preprocessing and dimensionality reduction algorithms are executed pr ior to data analytics. Data cleaning and signal transforma tions are the main goals of this pre-processing step The ana lytics process normally consists of two stages First the  data are downloaded and analyzed offline based on various hypotheses Once a strong model has been generated and validated it can then be uploaded to the server to  perform real-time analytics. One of the challenges is to op timize the algorithm so that it can be executed in a real-time  fashion Finally, when the algorithm detects a pattern that is strongly associated with a predictable user action a predic ted outcome of task optimization missing data or an undesirable outcome real-time feedback is provided   to remote health monitoring systems patients and heal thcare professionals

 IV  T ASK O PTIMIZATION  As one of the data analytics in the third tier WAN DA performs data transformation for quantizing sensory  data readings and executes data association rule mining  Instead of using experts knowledge WANDA finds data clust ers and their ranges in order to discretize timestamps and blood glucose readings Association rule analysis is a me thod to find interesting relations among attributes in larg e data sets Rules are derived using previously collected data t o help predict the current or future behaviors of a patien t First order logic from association rule mining can be used for patient task optimization, emergency event pred iction and system optimization, as shown in Figure 4. Associat ion rule mining and its feedback are used for reducing the n umber of tasks required by patients while increasing informa tion gain One of the advantages of the task optimization step  is improving patients adherence to remote health moni toring and enhancing missing data imputation results by ob taining more data or finding underlying data relationships After task optimization for improving patient participation m issing data imputation techniques can be applied to WANDA in order to predict missing values and provide alarms to healthcare professionals when the predicted missing  values are out of acceptable range 35   I n  a d d i t i o n   a s s o ciation rules related to emergency events can be used to ge nerate early adaptive alarms and guidance  to prevent emer gency events. For example, analyzing past vital signal da ta can help find trends of readings, which cause emergent event s such as hospitalization. Also, the association rule mining finds users tendency of remote health monitoring system usage a nd provides dynamic feedback to the system for optimiz ing battery life  A  Data Discretization Sensor readings and corresponding timestamps in remote health monitoring are continuous signals. To reduce the dimensionality and complexity of processing con tinuous numeric and timestamp data, it is necessary to disc retize the data. Under supervised settings, patients might hav e regular schedules of meal and blood glucose measurement suc h as 6:30 am 11:30 am and 5:00 pm 38   H o w e v e r   i n  unsupervised environments such as remote health monitoring, patients can have more flexible schedul es, so it is hard to categorize time frames as morning, after noon and evening In addition as patients with diabetes gen erally have higher blood sugar, their readings can be more biased and may not follow normal distribution or standards  3   Moreover, results of Jarrett's study show that bloo d glucose levels in the afternoon or evening are generally hi gher than in the morning 39   S i n c e  b l o o d  g l u c o s e  l e v e l s  v a r y depending on the time of day discretizing blood gl ucose data equivalently for different time intervals can result in biased results Therefore, it is necessary to categorize and quanti ze data using data-driven methods instead of experts’ knowl edge or human intuition. In this paper, we assume that the collected sensor data follows a mixture of Gaussian distribut ion and apply an expectation maximization EM algorithm to  cluster data into the pre-defined numbers of bins The EM algorithm 40  4 1   i s  a n  i t e r a t i v e  m e t h o d  t o  o p t i m i ze the estimation of an unknown parameter   given measured variables U and unmeasured variables J The objecti ve of the EM algorithm is the maximization of the posteri or probability \(1\ of the parameter  given U and J          n   r       The EM algorithm consists of two steps The expectation step E step and the maximization step  M step The E step finds a local lower-bound to the posterior distribution while the M step optimizes the bound o btained from the E step using iteration In the E step the algorithm calculates the expected value of the log likelihood  function under the current estimate of the parameters  t  of the conditional distribution J given U This step finds  the best lower bound, B    t   B    t            n  n           2  while       n\n    n\n     P\(J|U   The M step iterates and chooses  t+1 by maximizing the bound, B    t from the E step   t+1    B    t                   3  while      is the expected complete log-likelihood  r\n  and P  is the prior on the parameters   The developed algorithm quantizes timestamps of sen sor readings and sensor readings in each time range are  discretized. Based on mean and standard deviation v alues of each Gaussian curve from the EM algorithm, the deve loped algorithm finds intersection points and these point s are used for discretizing time and blood glucose ranges   Figure 4.

B  Data Association Rule Mining Association rule analysis is a method to find inter esting and strong association among attributes in large da ta sets One example is affinity analysis to find the purcha se behavior of different groups of consumers and their  market baskets [42   T h e  r e s u l t s  o f  a f f i n i t y  a n a l y s i s  c a n  be used for arranging items in the store, planning store promot ions, etc In remote health monitoring for patients with chro nic diseases patients health status changes dynamical ly but health-related readings are correlated 43  4 4    T h erefore finding trends and associations of patients data c an help to reduce the number of tasks decide the order of tas ks and even enable to provide early adaptive alarms to pre vent emergency situations In  WANDA, rules are derived using previously colle cted data to help predict the status and behavior of a p atient. The WANDA implementation uses data collected within a dynamic sliding window w  determined by the algorithm in Figure 5 before the current or future measurement Association rule mining and its feedback are used f or reducing the number of tasks required by patients w hile increasing information gain In the data preprocess ing step the developed algorithm performs data cleaning and discretization for removing erroneous data and disc retizing timestamp and indexing data \(see section above\. Th e system also indexes blood glucose and questionnaire respon se data as multiple measurements and system non-use. Additi onally information on whether a caregiver contacted the pa tient for each day is used The developed algorithm applies the Apriori algorit hm 45  t o  d e r i v e  f i r s t  o r d e r  l o g i c  r u l e s   a f t e r  p r e p r ocessing the data \(Figure 5\. The discretized and categorized da ta are used in the algorithm as inputs and rules are derived by  looking back a variable number of days time window The t ime window is increased by one day for each iteration The algorithm calculates the support and confidence of each implication and chooses implications qualifying thr eshold limits. In each subsequent pass, the large item set s found in the previous step are used to generate the candidat e sets \(the largest item sets\. The results of each step are la rge item sets of qualifying minimum support and confidence in the given time window Let I    i 1  i 2  i m  be a superset of all possible task outputs Let D  be a set of events such that D  I  An association rule is an implication of A  B  where A  I  B  I  and A  B     Confidence c  means that c  of events in D contain A  and B  Support s  indicates s  of events in D  contain A  or B  Conditional probability p  indicates p  of events in D  contain B  when A  happens The developed algorithm requires generating association rules tha t have support confidence and conditional probability gre ater than the user-defined thresholds minimum support  s min  confidence c min and conditional probability p min  When Apriori returns first order logic rules A  B  the algorithm calculates the contrapositive rules  B   A If the timestamp of the consequent in either implication  original rule or contrapositive rule\ is larger than the tim estamp of the antecedent and the implication is not a subset of a ny existing rules, the generated rule is added to the rule set However, if a subset of the existing rule has a higher conditio nal probability the algorithm updates the existing rul e with a new conditional probability value The process stop s when there is no new rule and the algorithm returns the final rule set \(Figure 5 The generated rules in Rule  are prioritized based on the conditional probability values and applied to the r emote health monitoring system Using the implication rul es the system can reduce user tasks by monitoring necessar y tasks and predicting unperformed tasks As the Apriori al gorithm has excellent scale-up properties the developed al gorithm can be applied to the system for dynamically arrang ing daily patient tasks depending on the size of dataset [45   V  R ESULT  A  Subjects and Data Sets This study was approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board \(IRB\ and patients were randomized to either MAIN LOOP Rule  w 1 while Aw r  do   Aw  Result from APRIORI with minimum conditional probability p min   Aw Contrapositive of Aw  Aw Subsets of Aw U Aw which antecedents’ maximum timestamp is smaller than consequents’ minimum time stamp and not in Rule with smaller conditional probability  Rule  Rule U Aw   w  w 1 end  APRIORI Result   k 1 while C k r   do  create a counter for each itemset in C k  foreach events in database do  Increase the counter of itemsets in C k which appears in the events L k All candidates in C k with support s min  Resuit  Result U L k   C k+1 k l-itemsets which have all subsets of L k  k  k l end   Figure 5.Association Rule Learning Algorithm in WAN DA     T ABLE I  PATIENT  POPULATION  INFORMATION  Group Total Male Female Avg.

Each tim estamp period is T 1   7:30:00-12:00:00 T 2   12:00:00-16:30:00 and T 3  16:30:00-21:00:00 and blood glucose readings are  categorized as B 1 170.8 mg/dl B 2 170.8-274.0 mg/dl  and B 3 274.0 mg/dl \(Figure 6 For quantizing both timestamps and blood glucose readings  EMTBD  we utilized EM algorithm on collected timestamps of blood glucose measurements to discret ize data into three bins and readings collected in each time period is also discretized into three levels In other words  each time interval has different standards of categorizing bl ood glucose data in three different levels Each discretized ti mestamp period  and mean and standard deviation values of i ts three different blood glucose levels are in Table III We  assume that the readings are a mixture of Gaussian distrib ution and find intersection of Gaussian curves.

Patients are required to measure their blood sugar up to three times a day and answer four quest ionnaires daily The experimental results show that the devel oped algorithm can reduce the number of tasks by up to 7 6.19 with minimum support 0.95 minimum confidence 0.95  minimum conditional probability 0.85 and maximum ti me window size of 5 days Compared to our earlier stud y 37   the EM-based discretization helps improve confidenc e levels of first order logics and predict further events. A s the Apriori algorithm has excellent scale-up properties 45   t he developed algorithm can be applied to the remote pa tient with low complexity Future studies will investigate and validate the significance of the obtained first order logic rule s in this paper. To make the first-order logic richer to redu ce required patient tasks dynamically, more data association ru le mining techniques will be exploited and maximize the condi tional probability and confirmation. In addition, patient survey data will be combined to predict adherence rate in advan ce, based on their perception and experience of remote health  monitoring technologies  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by NIH/National Library of Medicine Medical Informatics Training Program Grant T15 LM07356 The authors would like to thank Nancy Lee  Rose Healy, Florence-Joy Figueras, Jane Lee, and To ni Ann Riveros for their help in patient recruitment and a dvice Tannaz Moin was an endocrinology fellow in the UCLA  Department of Medicine Division of Endocrinology Diabetes  Hypertension and is now a health service s research fellow supported by VA Office of Academic Affiliations Health Services Research and Developm ent through the Health Services Fellowship Training Pro gram TMP 65-020\, VA Greater Los Angeles  R EFERENCES  1  CDC Centers for disease control and prevention http://www.cdc.gov/. 2012 2  Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research G roup.

Figure 6 is not as signi“cant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to ef“ciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
