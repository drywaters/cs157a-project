Association Analysis of Signiìcant Frequent Colossal Itemsets Mined from High Dimensional Datasets Manjunath K Vanahalli Department of Information Technology National Institute of Technology Karnataka Mangalore India Email manjunath.k.vanahalli@gmail.com Nagamma Patil Department of Information Technology National Institute of Technology Karnataka Mangalore India Email nagammapatil@nitk.ac.in Abstract Bioinformatics has contributed to a different form of datasets called as high dimensional datasets The high dimensional datasets are characterized by a large number of features 
and a small number of samples The traditional algorithms expend most of the running time in mining large number of small and mid-size items which does not enclose valuable and signiìcant information The recent research focused on mining large cardinality itemsets called as colossal itemsets which are signiìcant to many applications especially in the eld of bioinformatics The existing frequent colossal itemset mining algorithms are unsuccessful in discovering complete set of signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets The mined colossal itemsets from existing algorithms provide erroneous support information which affects association analysis Mining signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets 
with accurate support information helps in attaining a high-level accuracy of association analysis The proposed work highlights a novel pre-processing technique and bottom-up row enumeration algorithm to mine signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets with accurate support information A novel pre-processing technique efìciently utilizes minimum support threshold and minimum cardinality threshold to prune irrelevant samples and features The experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has high accuracy over existing algorithms Performance study indicates the efìciency of the pre-processing technique I I NTRODUCTION 
Mining frequent itemsets have been the primary problem in Association Rule Mining ARM Frequent Itemset Mining FIM has a wide range of applications such as business data analysis discovering interesting items from medical data mining web traversal items scientiìc data analysis etc Extensive research work has been carried over the past decade in the eld of FIM The traditional FIM algorithms work on transactional datasets which are characterized by a large number of rows samples and a small number of items features  The FIM algorithms ha v e sho wn to be inadequate when the average transactional length increases The growth of bioinformatics has contributed to a different 
form of datasets which are characterized by a large number of rows sample and a small number of items features The amount of information that can be revealed from high-dimensional datasets is potentially huge but extracting information and knowledge from these datasets is a nontrivial task The traditional algorithms face an uphill task in mining frequent itemsets from high dimensional datasets Row enumeration based algorithms were proposed to mine frequent closed itemsets from high dimensional datasets  The output result of e xisting ro w enumeration and column enumeration based algorithms includes small and mid-sized itemsets which often has no suitable information in many applications  ARM gi v e s greater importance to the 
larger itemsets called as colossal itemsets especially in the eld of bioinformatics Strong and long association rules can be generated from frequent colossal itemsets 13 The FIM algorithms encounter challenges in mining relatively large itemsets as they spend an enormous amount of time in mining small and mid-sized frequent itemsets The concept of colossal itemsets was rst introduced by Zhu et al in an algorithm based on pattern fusion The e xisting colossal itemset mining algorithms have been classiìed into two groups namely feature enumeration and row enumeration based algorithms Pattern fusion algorithm is a feature enumeration based algorithm that attempts to mine the large cardinality itemsets by approximating the number of colossal 
itemsets generated rather than traversing each node of the tree Approximating the number of colossal itemsets generated might lead to missing some of the signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets Pattern fusion algorithm will not be able to mine the complete set of frequent colossal itemsets leading to the generation of an incomplete set of association rules BVBUC is a r o w enumerated based algorithm to mine frequent colossal itemsets BVBUC algorithm mine frequent colossal itemsets till the minimum support threshold level and prune off the remaining search space BVBUC algorithm will not be able to mine complete set of frequent colossal itemsets leading to the generation of an incomplete set of association rules Many of the mined frequent colossal itemsets tend to 
provide wrong support information leading to the generation of an incorrect set of association rules To overcome the drawbacks a novel pre-processing technique and a novel Frequent Colossal Itemset Mining FCIM 2016 IEEE Uttar Pradesh Section International Conference on Electrical, Computer and Electronics Engineering \(UPCON I ndian Institute of Technology \(Banaras Hindu University 978-1-5090-5384-1/16/$31.00 ©2016 IEEE 258 


algorithm is proposed The proposed pre-processing technique will prune the irrelevant samples and features by efìcient utilization of minimum support threshold and minimum cardinality threshold The

not meeting the criteria of minsup are described as irrelevant features and the rows not meeting the criteria of mincard are described as irrelevant rows The irrelevant features are pruned before proceeding with frequent itemset mining In frequent colossal itemset mining features should meet the criteria of minsup and rows should meet the criteria of mincard  The irrelevant rows and features have to be pruned before proceeding with frequent colossal itemset mining Pruning of irrelevant features helps in reducing the cardinality of rows and pruning of irrelevant rows helps in reducing the support of features The existing pre-processing techniques fail to take advantage of the reduction in cardinality of rows as well as the reduction in support of features To overcome the drawback of existing pre-processing techniques a novel pre-processing technique is proposed to prune irrelevant rows and irrelevant features with effective utilization of minsup and mincard  The proposed pre-processing technique utilizes bitset approach which is computationally fast and reduces the required memory space The bitTable consisting of dataset characteristic is constructed Table II shows the bitTable corresponding to high dimensional dataset D shown in Table I If a row of high dimensional dataset D consists of feature j then the j th bit of the corresponding row in bitTable is set to

the bitTable For example the support of feature G 3 in bitTable is 4 Algorithm 1 shows the proposed pre-processing technique The step 2 to step 6 in the proposed pre-processing technique prune the irrelevant features The step 2 to step 6 scans through all the available features in the bitTable and checks the support of each feature with minsup  The irrelevant features will be 259

Fig 1 Top-Down Search Strategy is searched starting from the largest rowset value and builds smaller rowset values during the process Fig 1 shows the top-down row enumeration tree with each node representing the rowset In top-down row enumerated tree the large cardinality itemsets are present at the nal level of the tree The topdown search strategy is inefìcient in mining frequent colossal itemsets as the approach expend huge amount of time in traversing small and mid-sized itemsets at the initial levels of the tree The top-down approach fails to take the advantage of anti-monotone property of minimum cardinality threshold The bottom-up traversing of the row enumeration space implies that the dataset is searched starting from the smaller rowset value and builds lager rowset values during the process Fig 2 shows the bottom-up row enumeration tree with each node representing the rowset The bottom-up search strategy is efìcient in mining colossal itemsets as the large cardinality itemsets are present at the initial level of bottom-up row enumerated tree The anti-monotone property of minimum cardinality threshold is utilised by the bottom-up search strategy to cut down the search space It means that if an itemset at a node represented by l rowset is not colossal then an itemset at a child node presented by  l 1\wset is also not colossal The top-down approach fail to utilize the pruning power of mincard Both bottom-up and top-down search strategies have advantage and disadvantage Depending on the advantages and disadvantages the proposed algorithm traverse the row enumerated tree in a bottom-up strategy using bitset approach V T HE P ROPOSED A LGORITHM Bottom-up row enumeration approach is efìcient for mining frequent colossal itemsets from high dimensional datasets Complete set of association rules cannot be generated from the Fig 2 Bottom-Up Search Strategy  Algorithm 2 FCIM Algorithm Input pre-processed high dimensional dataset minsup  mincard  Output signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets Initialisation  SFCI  r  initial row in row enumeration All bit's in bit result initialized to 1 1 FCIM  r bit result,SFCI  Procedure 1 FCIM rcomb bit result,SFCI 1 if node rcomb does not reach till minsup 2 return 3 calculate bit result at node rcomb 4 if   bit result   mincard  5 return 6 if   rcomb  minsup  7 Add bit result to SFCI 8 for each node rcomb in row enumeration 9 FCIM rcomb bit result,SFCI existing algorithms as they will not be able to mine complete set of frequent colossal itemsets Some of the mined frequent colossal itemsets from the existing algorithm provide wrong support information leading to incorrect association rules The algorithm 2 highlights the proposed FCIM algorithm The proposed FCIM algorithm mine frequent colossal itemsets by performing the depth-ìrst traversal of row enumeration space The pre-processed high dimensional dataset minimum support threshold and minimum cardinality threshold are provided as an input to the FCIM algorithm The FCIM algorithm provides signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets as an output The Signiìcant Frequent Colossal Itemset SFCI is initial261 


ized to null The r is the initial row in row enumeration and all the bits in bit  result is initialized to 1 The step 1 of procedure 1 indicates that if the node rcomb does not reach till minsup then that node and its subtree if exists is pruned to cut down the search space For example the node 3 and 4 along with its subtree in Fig 2 is pruned when the minsup is set to 3 The bit result is calculated at node rcomb  The step 4 of procedure 1 indicates that if the length of an itemset mined at node rcomb is less than mincard then the subtree of node rcomb is pruned to cut down the search space The mined itemset is added to SFCI if it is frequent and colossal The algorithm continues with depth-ìrst traversal of row enumeration space VI R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION The section emphasizes on the effectiveness of preprocessing technique and accuracy of FCIM algorithm in mining frequent colossal itemsets The experiments were conducted on a computer with a speciìcation of 3.4GHz core i7-3770 CPU 8GB RAM and 1TB hard disk The proposed pre-processing technique has been compared to the pre-processing technique used in BVBUC and the accuracy of FCIM algorithm has been compared with BVBUC algorithm The proposed pre-processing technique and FCIM algorithm have been implemented in C The BVBUC algorithm and its pre-processing technique have also been implemented in C to the best of our knowledge The accuracy mentioned in the gures shows the number of frequent colossal itemsets mined The experiments were conducted on two real highdimensional datasets ALL-AML leukemia and lung cancer  ALL-AML leuk emia consists of 38 samples ro ws and 7129 gene features lung cancer consists of 32 samples and 12533 gene features Table VII and Table VIII shows the comparison of proposed pre-processing technique P and the existing pre-processing technique E used in BVBUC for lung cancer and ALL-AML leukemia dataset respectively The preprocessing experiment has been conducted for different minsup and mincard  TABLE VII Comparison of proposed pre-processing technique and pre-processing technique used in BVBUC for Lung cancer  minsup 10 15 20  mincard P E P E P E 1000 Rows 32 32 32 32 32 32 Features 6825 6825 4873 4873 3555 3555 2000 Rows 31 32 30 32 28 31 Features 6810 6825 4727 4873 3265 3555 3000 Rows 30 31 26 28 0 20 Features 6603 6825 4180 4873 0 3555 4000 Rows 0 26 0 10 0 0 Features 0 6825 0 4873 0 3555 The experiment results show that proposed pre-processing technique takes the advantage of the reduction in the cardinality of rows due to the pruning of irrelevant features and a reduction in support of features due to the pruning of irrelevant TABLE VIII Comparison of proposed pre-processing technique and pre-processing technique used in BVBUC for ALL-AML leukemia  minsup 10 15 20  mincard P E P E P E 1000 Rows 38 38 36 36 36 36 Features 4179 4179 3265 3265 3233 3233 2000 Rows 20 26 20 22 18 20 Features 3233 4179 3233 3265 3196 3233 3000 Rows 20 22 19 20 16 20 Features 3233 4179 3212 3265 3125 3233 4000 Rows 0 0 0 6 0 0 Features 0 4179 0 3265 0 3233    Fig 3 Number of SFCI in  for ALL AML Leukemia Dataset with minsup set to 10    Fig 4 Number of SFCI in  for Lung Cancer Dataset with minsup set to 10 rows The experiment results show that for a given minsup and varying mincard the number of irrelevant features pruned by the existing pre-processing technique remains same as it fails to take the advantage of the reduction in support of features due to the pruning of irrelevant rows When the minsup mincard reaches 10,4000 20,4000 30,3000 for the lung cancer dataset as shown in Table VII the number of rows and features after pre-processing is zero which indicates that 262 


there are no frequent colossal itemsets This also indicates that the proposed pre-processing technique yields the nal results without the need for FCIM algorithm However even after existing pre-processing the existing algorithms has to go through an enormous number of row combinations to fetch the nal results Comparison of proposed pre-processing technique and existing pre-processing technique with the ALL-AML leukemia dataset as shown in Table VIII also reveal the similar results Fig 3 shows the number of signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets mined by the FCIM and BVBUC algorithm for ALL  AML leukemia dataset when the minsup is set to 10 Fig 4 shows the number of signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets mined by the FCIM and BVBUC algorithm for lung cancer dataset when the minsup is set to 10 FCIM algorithm will be able to mine more than 65 of the signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets FCIM algorithm outperforms BVBUC algorithm in terms of mining signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets VII C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK The complete set of frequent colossal itemsets will not be mined by the existing algorithms The proposed preprocessing algorithm prunes the irrelevant gene features and samples by effective utilization of minsup threshold and mincard threshold The proposed FCIM algorithm outperforms the existing frequent colossal itemset mining algorithms The FCIM algorithm mines more than 65 of signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets for different minsup threshold and mincard threshold Future work includes the design of the new data structure of achieving 100 mining of signiìcant frequent colossal itemsets R EFERENCES  R Agra w al R Srikant et al  Fast algorithms for mining association rules in Proc 20th int conf very large data bases VLDB  vol 1215 1994 pp 487Ö499  J Han J Pei and Y  Y in Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation in ACM Sigmod Record  vol 29 no 2 ACM 2000 pp 1Ö12  G Liu H Lu Y  Xu and J X Y u   Ascending frequenc y ordered preìx-tree efìcient mining of frequent patterns in Database Systems for Advanced Applications 2003.\(DASFAA 2003 Proceedings Eighth International Conference on  IEEE 2003 pp 65Ö72  G Liu H Lu J X Y u  W  W ang and X Xiao  Afopt An ef cient implementation of pattern growth approach in FIMI  2003  Y  Qiu Y J Lan and Q.-S Xie  A n impro v e d algorithm of mining from fp-tree in Machine Learning and Cybernetics 2004 Proceedings of 2004 International Conference on  vol 3 IEEE 2004 pp 1665 1670  F  P an G Cong A K T ung J Y ang and M J Zaki Carpenter Finding closed patterns in long biological datasets in Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  ACM 2003 pp 637Ö642  F  P an A K T ung G Cong and X Xu Cobbler combining column and row enumeration for closed pattern discovery in Scientiìc and Statistical Database Management 2004 Proceedings 16th International Conference on  IEEE 2004 pp 21Ö30  H Liu J Han D Xin and Z Shao Mining frequent patterns on very high dimensional data a topdown row enumeration approach in Proceeding of the 2006 SIAM international conference on data mining SDM06 Bethesda MD  SIAM 2006 pp 280Ö291  H Liu X W ang J He J Han D Xin and Z Shao T op-do wn mining of frequent closed patterns from very high dimensional data Information Sciences  vol 179 no 7 pp 899Ö924 2009  F  Zhu X Y an J Han P  S Y u  and H Cheng Mining colossal frequent patterns by core pattern fusion in Data Engineering 2007 ICDE 2007 IEEE 23rd International Conference on  IEEE 2007 pp 706Ö715  M K Sohrabi and A A Barforoush Ef cient colossal pattern mining in high dimensional datasets Knowledge-Based Systems  vol 33 pp 41Ö52 2012  R Alv es D S Rodriguez-Baena and J S Aguilar Ruiz Gene association analysis a survey of frequent pattern mining from gene expression data Brieìngs in Bioinformatics  p bbp042 2009  J Aguilar Ruiz D Rodr  guez-Baena and R Alves Gene association analysis frequent-pattern mining in Encyclopedia of Systems Biology  Springer 2013 pp 788Ö789  http://datam.i2r a-star edu.sg/datasets/krbd/inde x.html  263

The architecture enables discovery or interesting patterns with data from different domains related to Telecom Network Monitoring. The architecture is composed of five sub-modules: Data Analyzer, Mining Controller, Data Miner, Combiner, and Episode Analyzer. Each sub-module is described in detail along with implementation approach  functions in turn. The approach leverages and combines frequent itemset discovery over data streams, association rule learning, frequent sequential pattern mining, and frequent temporal pattern mining techniques while also making use of distributed processing platforms to achieve high-volume throughput. To test the functionality of the model, three classic pattern mining algorithms, namely, NewMoment PrefixSpan, and HTPM, are implemented Their performances are compared in terms of different parameter settings by executing the algorithms with a simulated streaming dataset Fig.10

LI et al  PRIVACY-PRESERVING-OUTSOURCED ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ON VERTICALLY PARTITIONED DATABASES 1859 the publication of this seminal work a number of privacypreserving association rule mining or frequent itemset mining solutions have been published in the literature see 11   1 3   28]–[31 The most relevant work is the privacy-preserving association rule mining solution presented in I n t hi s s ol ut i on a d at a owner known as the master is responsible for the mining The other data owners known as slaves insert ctitious transactions to their respectiv e datasets and send the datasets to the master Each data owner will also send his set of real transactions IDs to a semi-trusted third-party server The third-party server is assumed not to be colluding with any data owner but it cannot be trusted to hold the raw data The master generates association rule candidates from the joint database containing ctitious data For each rule candidate X  Y  the master sends the ID lists of the transactions containing X  Y and the transactions containing X to the third-party server The server veriﬁes if the rule is qualiﬁed or not Similar to our solutions a semi-trusted third-party is utilized for the mining However unlike our solutions a data owner i.e the master does the majority of the computational work Therefore we can hardly say that such a solution is an outsourced mining solution Though ctitious data are added in datasets to lower data usability the master is able to learn signiﬁcant information about other data owners raw data from the received datasets In cont rast our solutions do not leak such information as we do not rely on one particular data owner to undertake the computations and we also encrypt the datasets All existing solutions with the exception of  d

ecure s cal ar product p rot o col  a s et intersection cardinality protocol or a secret sharing scheme to perform these computations A majority of these solutions expose exact supports to all data owners resulting in the leakage of information about the data owners raw data  The only exception is one of s s o l u t i ons  I n  13 t here are two privacy-preserving solutions for frequent itemset mining The rst solution exposes exact supports which is not desirable The second solution does not expose exact supports However association rules cannot be mined based on the result of second solution because conﬁdences cannot be computed without the exact supports In addition this solution’s method cannot be used to mine association rules because securely computing conﬁdence is more complicated than computing support In comparison with this solution our frequent itemset mining solution’s computational complexity is signiﬁcantly lower Our solutions do not expose exact supports or conﬁdences to data owners Different from existing solutions based on homomorphic encryption we use symmetric homomorphic encryption instead of asymmetric homomorphic encryption and the manner in which we use homomorphic encryption also differs from existing solutions In our approach we use homomorphic encryption to create ERVs and build our secure outsourced comparison scheme B Privacy-Preserving

data owner inserts ctitious transactions in the encrypted database to conceal the item frequency After inserting the ctitious transactions any item in the encrypted database will share the same

and returns the result frequent itemsets and their supports to the data owner The data owner revises these itemsets supports by subtracting them with these itemsets corresponding occurrence counts in the ctitious transactions respectively Finally the data owner decrypts the received itemsets with the revised supports higher than the frequency threshold an d generates association rules based on

on encrypted items but it is vulnerable to frequency analysis attacks Applying this solution to vertically partitioned databases will also result in the leakage of the exact supports to data owners In this paper our adversary model is different We assume the cloud has knowledge of the item frequencies instead of chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs and our solutions are resilient to frequency analysis

solution for vertically partitioned databases This allows the data owners to outsource mining task on their joint data in a privacy-preserving manner privacypreserving manner Based on this solution we built a privacypreserving outsourced association rule partitioned databases Our solutions protect data owner’s raw data from other data owners and the cloud Our solutions also ensure the privacy of the mining results from the cloud Compared with most existing solutions our solutions leak less information about the data owners raw data Our evaluation has also demonstrated that our solutions are very efﬁci ent therefore our solutions are suitable to be used by data owners wishing to outsource their databases to the cloud but require a high level of privacy without compromising on performance To realize our solutions an efﬁcient homomorphic encryption scheme and a secure outsourced comparison scheme were presented in this paper Both schemes have potential usage in other secure computation applications such as secure data aggregation beyond the data mining solutions described in this paper Demonstrating the u tility of the p roposed homomorphic encryption scheme and outsourced comparison scheme in other settings will be the focus of future research A PPENDIX I NSERTING F ICTITIOUS T RANSACTIONS  s A LGORITHM  An algorithm to counter frequency analysis attacks on the outsourced database encrypted with a substitution cipher was proposed in F or the purpos e o f c oncealing t he item frequency this algorithm inserts ctitious transactions in the database to be oursourced The goal is to ensure that each item share the same frequency with at least k  1 items The algorithm is summarized as follows also see  Firstly the data owner scans the database to count each individual item’s support  Secondly the data owner groups items considering the supports and co-occurrence of items The data owner sorts items in decreasing order of support Starting from the rst of the sorted item list i.e the item with the highest support the data owner assigns every k adjacent items to a new created group If there are less than k unassigned items remaining these items will be assigned to the last created group The data owner swaps items from different groups to ensure that all items in the same group do not occur together in the same transaction  Thirdly for each item in each group the data owner calculates the difference between the item’s support and the highest support in the group The difference is deﬁned as the noise of the item  Fourthly to achieve k anonymity frequency the data owner generates ctitious transactions based on the result of the third step The number of an item’s occurrences in the ctitious transactions is equal to its noise calculated in the third step After inserting the ctitious transactions all items in the same group share the same support A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Quach Vinh Thanh the Associate
