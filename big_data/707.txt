 4 4 4 5 S 7 1 INTRODUCTION Scattered data interpolation is a problem of interest in numerous areas such as electronic imaging smooth surface modeling and computational geometry  1 2 Our motivation arises from applications in geology and mining which often involve large scattered data sets and a demand for high accuracy For such cases the method of choice is ordinary kriging 3 This is because it is a best unbiased estimator 3-5 Also in re mote 
sensing image fusion of multi-sensor data is often used to increase either the spectral or the spatial resolution of the U.S Government work not protected by U.S copyright This work was done when Nargess Memarsadeghi and Vikas C Raykar were graduate students in Computer Science Department of the University of Maryland at College Park The work of D M 
Mount has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation under grant CCR-0635099 images involved 6 7 A generalized version of the ordinary kriging called cokriging 3 5 can be used for image fusion of multi-sensor data 8 9 Unfortunately ordinary kriging 
interpolant is computationally very expensive to compute exactly For n scattered data points computing the value of a single interpolant involves solving a dense linear system of order n x n which takes O\(n3 This is infeasible for large n Traditionally kriging is solved approximately by local approaches that are based on considering only a relatively small number of points that lie close to the query point 3,5 There are many problems with this local approach however The first is that determining the proper neighborhood size is tricky and is usually solved by ad hoc methods such as 
selecting a fixed number of nearest neighbors or all the points lying within a fixed radius Such fixed neighborhood sizes may not work well for all query points depending on local density of the point distribution 5 Local methods also suffer from the problem that the resulting interpolant is not continuous Meyer showed that while kriging produces smooth continuous surfaces it has zero order continuity along its borders 10 Thus at interface boundaries where the neighborhood changes the interpolant behaves discontinuously Therefore it is important to consider and solve the global system for each interpolant However solving 
such large dense systems for each query point is impractical Recently an approximation approach to kriging has been proposed based on a technique called covariance tapering 11 12 However this approach is not efficient when covariance models have relatively large ranges Also finding a valid taper as defined in 11L for different covariance functions is difficult and at times impossible e.g Gaussian covariance model In this paper we address the shortcomings of the previous approaches through an alternative based on Fast Multipole Methods FMM The FMM was first introduced by Greengard and Rokhlin for fast multiplication 
of a structured matrix by a vector 13 14 If the Gaussian function is used for generating the matrix entries the matrix-vector product is called the Gauss transformn We use efficient implementations of the Gauss transform based on the FMM idea see  1 5,16 in combination with the SYMMLQ iterative method 17 for solving large ordinary kriging systems Billings et at 18 had also suggested the use of iterative methods in combination with the FMM for solving such systems The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section 1 


2 describes the ordinary kriging system and solving it via an iterative method In Section 3 we introduce the matrix-vector products involved in solving such systems We mention two existing efficient and approximate implementations of such products in Section 4 Section 5 describes our data sets Our experiments and results are presented in Sections 6 and 7 respectively Section 8 concludes this paper 2 ORDINARY KRIGING VIA ITERATIVE METHODS Kriging is an interpolation method named after Danie Krige a South African mining engineer 5 Kriging and its variants have been traditionally used in mining and geostatistics applications 3-5 Kriging is also referred to as the Gaussian process predictor in the machine learning domain 19 The most commonly used variant is called ordinairy kriging which is often referred to as a Best Linear Unbiased Estimator BLUE 3 1 1L It is considered to be best because it minimizes the variance of the estimation error It is linear because estimates are weighted linear combination of available data and is unbiased since it aims to have the mean error equal to zero 3 Minimizing the variance of the estimation error forms the objective function of an optimization problem Ensuring unbiasedness of the error imposes a constraint on this function Forrmalizing this objective function with its constraint results in the following system 3 5 12  LT  Co  1 method requires one O\(T 2 matrix-vector multiplication per iteration The storage is 0\(n since the matrix-vector multiplication can use elements computed on the fly without storing the matrix Empirically the number of iterations required k is generally small compared to n leading to a computational cost of O\(kn 2 3 MATRIX-VECTOR MULTIPLICATION The 0\(kn 2 quadratic complexity is still too high for large data sets The core computational step in each SYMM LQ iteration involves the multiplication of a matrix C with some vector say q For the Gaussian covariance model the entries of the matrix C are of the form C]i4  exp 3 xi2 a2 Hence the jth element of the matrix-vector product Cq can be written as Cq   qE exp 3 xi 2 a2 which is the weighted sum of n Gaussians each centered at xi and evaluated at x Discrete Gauss transform GT The sum of multivariate Gaussians is known as the discrete Gauss transform in scientific computing In general for each targetpoint Yi 243 PRd}7 which in our case are the same as the source points xi the discrete Gauss transform is defined as G\(yj  qie i=l 1 where C is the matrix of points pairwise covariances L is a column vector of all ones and of size  and w is the vector of weights wi    wr Therefore the minimization problem for a points reduces to solving a linear system of size n  1 which is impractical for very large data sets via direct approaches It is also important that matrix C be positive definite 3 12 Pairwise covariances are often modeled as a function of points separation These functions should result in a positive definite covariance matrix Christakos 20 showed necessary and sufficient conditions for such permissible covariance functions Two of these valid functions are the Gaussian and Spherical covariance functions 3,5,20 In this paper the Gaussianu covariance function is used For two points xi and xj the Gaussian covariance function is defined as Cij  exp 3 lzxi2 a2 where a is the range of the covariance function For large data sets it is impractical to solve the ordinary kriging system using direct approaches that take 0\(n3 time It erative methods generate a sequence of solutions which converge to the true solution in n iterations In practice however we loop over k a n iterations 21 In particular we used an iterative method called SYMMLQ which is appropriate for solving symmetric systems 1L7 Note that the coefficient matrix in the ordinary kriging linear system while symmetric is not positive definite since it has a zero entry on its diagonal Therefore methods such as conjugate gradient are not applicable here 22 The actual implementation of the SYMMLQ 2 where h in our case h  a/3 is called the bandwidth of the Gaussian Evaluating discrete Gauss transforms for art target points due to n different source locations arises in may applications In this paper the Gauss transform GT refers to this direct implementation which takes 0\(mn time 4 FAST APPROXIMATE MATRIX-VECTOR MULTIPLICATION Various fast approximation algorithms  15,23 have been proposed to compute the discrete Gauss transform in 0\(m  n time These algorithms compute the sum to any arbitrary c precision For any e  0 we define C to be an E-exact approximation to G if the maximum absolute error relative to the total weight Q  qi q is upper bounded by E i e max G\(yj yj vi Q C 3 The constant in 0\(Tri na depends on the desired accuracy c which however can be arbitrary At machine precision there is no difference between the direct and the fast methods The method relies on retaining only the first few terms of an infi nite series expansion for the Gaussian function These methods are inspired by the fast multipole methods FMM originally developed for the fast summation of the potential fields generated by a large number of sources such as those arising in gravitational potential problems 13  The fast Gauss transform FGT is a special case where FMM ideas were used for 2 


on the target coordinates yj However for the third exponential 2432\(yj x xi-x the are entangled The the Gaussian potential 23 The improved fast Gauss transform IFGT is a similar algorithm based on a single different factorization and data structure It is suitable for higher dimensional problems and provides comparable performance in lower dimensions  15 Improvedfast Gauss transform IFGT IFGT is an efficient algorithm for approximating the Gauss transform The fast Gauss transform first proposed by Greengard and Strain 23 is an E-exact approximation algorithm for the Gauss transform This algorithm reduces the Gauss transform's computational complexity from O\(MTI to O\(m  n However this algorithm's constant factor grows exponentially with dimension d Later improvements including the IFGT algorithm reduced this constant factor to asymptotically polynomial order in terms of d The IFGT algorithm was first introduced by Yang et al 15 Their implementation did not use a sufficiently tight error bound to be useful in practice Also they did not adaptively select the necessary parameters to achieve the desired error bound Raykar et al later presented an approach that overcame these shortcomings 16,24 We used the implementation due to Raykar et al We briefly describe some of the key ideas in IFGT Please see 1L6,24 for more details For any point x\243 C lRd the Gauss Transform at yj can be written as 5 Rearranging the terms Equation 5 can be written as G\(yj 2E  2 E lx z l lael<p-l i=l L Cll e y j x y lKl<p l h h  12Ih 2 h X h  where cc  qie 243 12 h X zi 243 a X h The coefficients C can be evaluated separately in 0\(n Evaluation of G\(yj at m points is 0\(m Hence the computational cost has reduced from the quadratic 0\(nrm to the linear 0\(n  m We have omitted the constants in the computational cost A detailed analysis of the cost can be seen in 16,24 G yj E qi  i=l n rl qic i=l Z qi1e  Ij e IIyj  error E Ignoring error terms can be approximated as GK IC elX,_X 112 22 e-IYj _X 112 2x as 16,24 243   h  h v 0 source coordinates xi The second exponential e/h depends only for now G\(yj a ao loal<p-l source and target can be writ ten on the crux of the algorithm is to separate this entanglement via Taylor series using multi-index notation The p-term truncated Taylor series expansion for e2  the truncation number p is chosen based on the prescribed 11 2\(ty.j-x e,2 4 In FEquation 4 the first exponential inside the summation ez*l/h2 depends only i=1 Thus far we have used the Taylor series expansion about a certain point x\243 However if we use the same x\243 for all the points we typically would require very high truncation number since the Taylor series is valid only in a small open ball around x The IFGT algorithm uses a data adaptive space partitioning scheme-the farthest point clustering algorithm 25]-to divide the a sources into K spherical clustersand then build a Taylor series at the center of each cluster The final algorithm has four stages The first stage involves determining parameters of the algorithm based on specified error bounds bandwidth and data distribution Second the d-dimensional space is subdivided using a k-center clustering 25 Next a truncated representation of the Gaussian inside each cluster is built using a set of decaying basis functions Finally the influence of all the data in a neighborhood using coefficients at cluster centers are collected and the approximate GT is evaluated Please see  16 24 for details GT with nearest neighbors GTANN GTANN is also an efficient algorithm for calculating matrixvector products This method was implemented by Raykar 26 where it is referred to as the FigTree method This method is most effective when the Gaussian models being used have small ranges while IFGT gives good speed-ups when dealing with large range values First based on the desired error bound a search radius is calculated Then for each target point source points within that radius are considered Since the Gaussian function dissipates very rapidly nearby points have the greatest influence These 2  yi x a Xi X a a h h Ial<-P-l 


source points are calculated via fixed-radius nearest neighbor search routines of the ANN library 27 Finally for each target point their nearest neighbor source points are calculated in matrix-vector product calculations involving the covariance matrix C in the ordinary kriging system 5 DATA SETS We generated three sets of sparse data sets For the first set the number of sampled points varied from 1000 up to 5000 while their covariance model had a small range value of 12 For the second set we varied the number of samples in the same manner except that the points covariance model had a larger range equal to 100 Finally we sampled 5000 points from dense grids where points covariance model had ranges equal to a  12 24,100 250 and 500 For each input data set we use 200 query points which are drawn from the same dense grid but are not present in the sampled data set One hundred of these query points were sampled uniformly from the original grids The other 100 query points were sampled from the same Gaussian distributions that were used in the generation of a small percentage of the sparse data 6 EXPERIMENTS We used the SYMMLQ iterative method as our linear solver We set the desired solutions relative error or the convergence criteria for the SYMMVLQ method to 62  10-3 Thus if SYMMLQ is implemented exactly we expect the relative error to be less than 10-3 The exact error is likely to be higher than that We developed three versions of the ordinary kriging interpolator each of which calculates the matrix-vector products involved in the SY MMLQ method differently Gauss Transform GT Computes the matrix-vector product exactly Improved Fast Gauss Transform IFG T Approximates the matrix-vector product to the e precision via the IFGT method mentioned in Section 4 Gauss transform with nearest neighbors GTANN Approximates the matrix-vector product using the GTANN method mentioned in Section 4 All experiments were run on a Sun Fire V20z running Red Hat Enterprise release 3 using the g compiler version 3.2.3 Our software is implemented in C and uses the Geostatistical Template Library GsTL 28 and Approximate Nearest Neighbor library ANN 27 GsTL is used for building and solving the ordinary kriging systems and ANN is used for finding nearest neighbors when using the GTANN approach In all cases for the IFGT and GTANN ap proaches we required the approximate matrix-vector products to be evaluated within e 10 accuracy All experiments results are averaged over five runs We designed three experi ments to study the effect of covariance ranges and number of data points on performances of our different ordinary kriging versions Experiment 1 We varied number of scattered data points from 1000 up to 5000 with a small fixed Gaussian covariance model of range a  12 Experiment 2 We varied number of sampled points This time points had a larger range equal to a  100 for their covariance model Experiment 3 Finally we examined the effect of different covariance ranges equal to a  12 25 100 250 and 500 on a fixed data set of size 5000 7 RESULTS In this section we compare both the quality of results and the speed-ups achieved for solving the ordinary kriging system via iterative methods combined with fast approximate matrixvector multiplication techniques Figure 1 presents results of the first experiment mentioned When utilizing approximate methods IFGT and GTANN the exact residuals are comparable to those obtained from GT The IFGT approach gave speed-ups ranging from 1.3-7.6 while GTANN resulted in speed-ups ranging roughly from 50150 This is mainly due to the fact that the covariance function's range is rather small Since there are only a limited number of source points influencing each target point collecting and calculating the influence of all source points for each target point the IFGT approach is excessive The GTANN approach works well for such cases by considering only the nearest source points to each target point In both cases the speed-ups grow with number of data points Algorithms perform similarly for points from the Gaussian distribution to those from uniform distribution Figure 2 shows results of the second experiment While the GTANN approach did not result in significant speed-ups the IFGT gave constant factor speed-ups ranging roughly from 1.5 to 7.5 as we increased the number of data points The IFGT approach results in larger residuals for small data sets and when solving the ordinary kriging system for query points from the uniform distribution In particular for n  1000 andd n  2000 the performance of IFGT is not acceptable with respect to the exact residuals calculated This poor overall result for these cases is because the SYMM[LQ method did not meet its convergence criteria and reached maximum number of iterations Increasing the required accuracy for the IFGT algorithm by changing the e  10-4 to 10-6 resolved this issue and gave residuals comparable to those obtained from the GT method As the number of points increases the quality of results approaches those of the exact methods For the query points from the Gaussian distribution the quality of results are comparable to the exact method when using the IFGT approach The GTANN approach also results in compa rable residuals to the exact methods in all cases Figure 3 presents results of the last set of experiments In all cases the quality of results is comparable to those obtained from exact methods The IFGT approach resulted in speedups of 7-15 in all cases The GTANN approach is best when 4 


used for covariance functions with small range values of 12 and 25 While the GTANN approach is slower than the exact methods for range values larger than 100 it results in speedup factors of 151 53 and 47-49 for range values 12 and 25 respectively Thus the GTANN approach is efficient for small range values and so is the IFGT approach for large ranges 8 CONCLUSIONS We integrated efficient implementations of the Gauss Transform for solving ordinary kriging systems We examined the effect of number of points and the covariance functions ranges on the running time for solving the system and the quality of results The IFGT is more effective as number of data points increases Our experiments using the IFGT approach for solving the ordinary kriging system demonstrated speed-up factors ranging from 7-15 when using 5000 points Based on our tests on varying number of data points we expect even higher speed-up factors compared to the exact method when using larger data sets In almost all cases the quality of IFGT results are comparable to the exact methods The GTANN approach outperfornned the IFGT method for small covariance range values resulting in speed-up factors as high as 153 and 49 respectively The GTANN approach is slower than the exact methods for large ranges 100 and over in our experiments and thus is not recommended for such cases The quality of results for GTANN was comparable to the exact methods in all cases Please see 26 29 for details of methods used in this work Future work involves efficient kriging via fast approximate matrix-vector products for other covariance functions where a factorization exists We also plan on using preconditioners 2 1  for our iterative solver so that the approximate versions converge faster and we obtain even higher speed-ups REFERENCES 1 I Amidror Scattered data interpolation methods for electronic imaging systems A survey Journal of Electronic Imaging vol I 1 no 2 pp 157-176 April 2002 2 P Alfeld Scattered data interpolation in three or more variables Mathematical methods in computer aided geometric design pp 1-33 1989 3 E H Isaaks and R M Srivastava An Introduction to Applied Geostatistics New York Oxford Oxford University Press 1989 4 A G Journel and C J Huijbregts Mining Geostatistics New York Academic Press Inc 1978 5 P Goovaerts Geostatistics for Natural Resources Evaluation New York Oxford Oxford University Press 1997 6 D L Hall Mathematical techniques in multisensor data fusion Norwood Artech House Inc 1992 7 Y Zhang Understanding image fusion Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing pp 657-661 June 2004 8 N Memarsadeghi J L Moigne D M Mount and J Morisette A new approach to image fusion based on cokriging in the Eighth International Conference on Information Fusion vol 1 July 2005 pp 622-629 9 N Memarsadeghi J L Moigne and D M Mount Image fusion using cokriging in IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium IGARSS'06 July 2006 pp 2518 2521 10 T H Meyer The discontinuous nature of kriging interpolation for digital terrain modeling Cartography and Geographic Information Science vol 3 1 no 4 pp 209-216,2004  1 R Furrer M G Genton and D Nychka Covariance taperincg for interpolation of large spatial datasets Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics vol 15 no 3 pp 502-523 September 2006 12 N Memarsadeghi and D M Mount Efficient implementation of an optimal interpolator for large spatial data sets in Proceedings of the International Conference on Computational Science ICCS'07 ser Lecture Notes in Computer Science vol 4488 SpringerVerlag May 2007 pp 503 510 13 L Greengard and V Rokhlin A fast algorithm for particle simulation Journal of Computational Physics vol 73 no 2 pp 325-348 1987 14 L Greengard The rapid evaluation of potential fields in particle systems Ph.D dissertation Yale NYU 1987 15 C Yang R Duraiswami and L Davis Efficient kernel machines using the improved fast Gauss transform in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems L K Saul Y Weiss and L Bottou Eds vol 17 MIT Press 2005 pp 1561-1568 16 V C Raykar C Yang R Duraiswami and N Gumerov Fast computation of sums of Gaussians in high dimensions Department of Computer Science University of Maryland College Park MD 20742 Tech Rep 2005 CS-TR-4767 17 C C Paige and M A Saunders Solution of sparse indefinite systems of linear equations SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis vol 12 no 4 pp 617-629 September 1975 18 S D Billings R K Beatson and G N Newsamm Interpolation of geophysical data using continuous global surfaces Geophysics vol 67 no 6 pp 1810-1822 NovemberDecember 2002 19 C E Rasmussen and C K I Williams Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning MIT Press 2006 20 G Christakos On the problem of permissible covariance and variogram models Water Resources Research vol 20 no 2 pp 251-265 February 1984 5

used to match the type of the play and Java functions extracted the specific information However to be useful this information must be matched with the ontology To this end the type of play was translated into a specific subclass of the PlayType class while the context of the play was used to determine the appropriate subclass of the Play class and to fill in the properties of these two classes The names of the players involved in the play were used to find the actual instances of the specified Player in the ontology taken from the roster files By reading the rosters and creating the teams first we can leverage the actors in this way when ontologizing the events of the game This helps protect the validity of the data by ensuring that all references to an individual actor refer to the same entity regardless of how they are referred to in individual events This point is best clarified with an example To use the previous example from the Boise St vs Oklahoma game by referring back to the input files we ensure that all references in the play-by-play to Jared Zabransky Zabranksy number 5 for Boise St or any other tangent reference to a property are referring to the same Player in the ontology Maintaining data integrity in this way goes to the heart of using an ontology which strives to eliminate all reference ambiguity in the data The final step established above for ontologizing the data was to write the data to permanent storage The necessity of performing this step is predicated upon whether a database connection was established in the beginning or not In the early development of both domains we represented the ontology using Jena s memory model which stores the model and its associated triples in memory However given that combat simulations can produce many gigabytes of data with the number ever growing an alternative was required as every time the program was run with the memory model it crashed due to running out of heap space As Figure 2 suggests establishing a database connection quickly became one of the few viable options Towards these ends an Oracle lOg database was used to house the data due to Oracle's commitment in the 10g and the subsequent release of the 1 Ig to store RDF triples uniquely as opposed to performing a conversion to a traditional relational database every time Putting the information into the database had the desired benefit of greatly expanding the constraint on file size Additionally once the database was established optimizations could be performed on the data storage to improve the access speeds of common queries By putting the information in a sufficiently large database parsing becomes a truly one-time expense where it never has to be repeated If a database is used the program no longer has to read in the template ontology at the beginning and then write the output ontology to a file for permanent storage at the end Instead the program can simply establish a connection to the database when started and it then has access to all of the preexisting data including the template ontology 7 ANALYSIS Up to this point we have described in extensive detail the problem definition how the template ontology was created and how the data was extracted and combined with the template ontology to form the structured output We will now examine the methods we used to analyze the data For both domains the major obstacle to performing analysis of significant depth is the massive amount of data associated with the event In order for analysts to answer substantive questions they must be able to efficiently filter the data for the information pertinent to the question at hand To achieve this data filtering we used SPARQL.6 The benefit of SPARQL for our application is that it allows for the easy creation of what we referred to as N-th order queries that filter the data to preciously what we need in accordance with the ontology By N-th order queries we mean a SPARQL query that has multiple layers or orders of filtering that restrict the data This is best seen through an example For illustrative purpose we will again use the Boise St vs Oklahoma game Let's say an analyst was interested in finding out if Boise St had any big pass plays when they were deep in their own territory The occurrence of such plays would speak to Boise St.'s ability to use big plays to change the game as well as to provide some barometer for how conservative their play calling on offense was As such the analyst might develop a SPARQL query that has an equivalent English sentence of Give me all the completed passes thrown by Boise St where they were on their own 25 or less that went for 15 or more yards This particular query is a fifth-order query Explicitly the layers of filtering are 1 completed pass 2 Boise St 3 own side of the field 4 less than 25 yardline and 5 gained 15 or greater yards To answer the posed question such an occurrence occurred twice in the Boise St vs Oklahoma game The first was a 19 yard gain from Jared Zabransky to Legedu Naanee starting at the Boise St 17 at the beginning of the second quarter and the other was a 36 yard completion from Zabransky to Derek Schouman starting at the 22 yardline on the last drive of regulation The ability to perform such N-th order queries is absolutely critical to operations analysis in combat simulations A sample question an operations analyst might ask for in a scenario is Give me all the times a F-22 on a DCA mission was shot and killed at by a specific SAM type within a geographic region bounded by minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes This is a ninth-order query where the layers are 1 shot fired 2 kill resulted 3 target of F-22 4 attacker of a specific SAM type such as SA-10 5 F-22 mission of DCA 6 shot location greater than minimum latitude 7 shot location less than maximum latitude 8 shot location greater than minimum longitude and 9 shot location less than a maximum longitude Given unstructured nature of the output data from most 8 6htro ii uerV 8  1 11 I_ 


simulations answering such questions previously required extensive datamining that could take at least hours if not days to perform and was highly susceptible to error However a SPARQL query could return the results in tenths of seconds for small data sets and minutes for very large datasets Plus if the parse is well formed and properly debugged there is no chance for errors either returning a false positive or an omission Another tremendous benefit received from the structuring of the data and querying it with SPARQL is the increased ease of debugging the definition of the scenario This is not necessarily a problem in football but it is a significant issue in combat simulation The very large scenarios blessed by the government to represent certain encounters of interest have thousands of platforms each individually created with unique properties As such even a low error rate yields a non-trivial amount of mistakes some of which could profoundly affect results Many man-hours are sunk into validating the details of a scenario such as the networks of the IADS or the command chain of platforms all of which is tedious Several well placed SPARQL queries can help greatly reduce the scenario debugging time and make the debugging less cumbersome in the process One of the lone downsides to employing the abovedescribed methodology for data mining and analysis in the combat simulation domain is the lack of familiarity of most analysts with these techniques While the learning curve is shallow schedule and mindset challenges limit most seasoned analysts ability to learn about Java RDF ontologies and SPARQL To help facilitate the creation of N-th order queries we developed a GUI to wrap around the code in the combat simulation domain The GUI was developed using NetBeans Matisse GUI developer and made creating N-th order queries simply a manner of selecting the desired options on the GUI As a result the analysts did not need to be Java programmers with extensive RDF knowledge in order to use the program Instead they simply needed to have knowledge of the domain which is already a prerequisite for performing the analysis 8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The combat simulation domain is faced with the problem of having several different tools that represent data that is fundamentally the same in their own unique way The domain requires a method for combining disparate data into a common ontology as well as a way to then mine through the masses of data and filter out only that which is relevant to the current analysis In this paper we proposed a solution to this problem using RDF ontologies to commonly represent the domain and SPARQL queries to filter the results Due to the propriety classified nature of the work however we developed and presented a solution to a similar domain that being analyzing college football College football was chosen due to its similarities to the combat simulation domain which include 1 the output comes from a variety of sources represented in their own unique way but typically from ASCII text chronological log files 2 both domains contain ASCII lists of actors performing actions specific to the domain 3 both domains allow for a limited number of actions yet require tremendous ontological flexible within the actions and actors and 4 both domains require analysts to apply many-order filters to extract the desired in-depth information The bulk of the paper focused on the specifics of how the ontology was created how the ontology was combined with the data and finally the methods used in querying the data To these ends Stanford's Protege was used to create the ontology A Java program was then used to parse the data from input and output files after which the information was combined with the template ontology through the use of the Jena Semantic Web Framework or Jena The data were stored in an Oracle lOg database for permanent storage SPARQL was then used to query the data with a GUI assisting in this process The work yielded some significant conclusions SPARQL provided a simple methodology for creating the N-th order queries required by both domains Furthermore the execution of these queries provided access to data and answers to questions in seconds that required hours or days to get previously This drastic reduction in time and increase in the ease of use could literally transform the modem day combat simulation analyst from a glorified data miner back into an analyst Abstracting away the data mining and post-processing allows the analyst to focus on the forest instead of the type of bark on the trees in the forest Furthermore the unification of several sources into a common ontology allows for the analyst to be an expert in the entire domain not an expert in a specific tool Furthermore the encoding of the output into an ontology helps ensure the validity of the data and provides for additional scenario debugging assistance The validity of the data is augmented by the fact that the ontology eliminates all ambiguity in which entity is being used regardless of how it was referenced as well as any ambiguity in the definition of a certain event The assistance in debugging the scenario comes from the use of SPARQL queries on the input to the scenario such as verifying the members of a network in the IADS or the command chain of the platforms The SPARQL queries help provide quick access to the information and allow it to be displayed in a manner that is less cumbersome to crosscheck This allows for faster debugging of the input scenario

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
