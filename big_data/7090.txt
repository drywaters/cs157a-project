GPS has become a global utility, indispensable for modern navigation on land, sea, and air around the world, as well as an important tool for map-making and land surveying. GPS also provides an extremely precise time reference, required for telecommunications and some scientific research. Among many possible uses, GPS data are also widely employed in geophysical applications to detect and follow the deforma tion of the Earth surface on a millimeter/centimeter  scale, via the differential operational 
mode M o reover, i n t h e near fut u re, t h e advanced European GALILEO Positioning System will be operational on this scenario More recently, the remote sens ing technique referred to as Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry DInSAR\ has been devel t h at al so al l o ws t o  investigate surface deformation phenomena on a millimeter/centimeter scale. In this case, the technique exploits the phase difference \(usually referred to as the interferogram\f two SAR images relevant to temporally separated observations of the i nvestigated area. An effective procedure to detect and follow the temporal evolution of deformation is via the generation of time series: to achieve this task the information ava 
ilable from each interferometric data pair is properly related to those included in the other acquisitions by generating an appropriate sequence of DInSAR interferograms Several approaches aimed at the DInSAR time series generation have already 9 In t h i s  paper, we focus on the technique referred to as the Small BAseline Subset \(SBAS\algor ithm [3 at h as b een  originally developed to investigate large spatial scale displacements with relatively low resolution \(typically of the order of 100 x 100 m 2  appropriate combination of differential SAR interferograms

A way to easily \223link\224 such subsets is the application of the Singular Value Decomposition \(SVD\ethod  The capability of the SBAS approach to generate deformation maps and time series from data acquired by the European Remote Sensing Satellite \(ERS\sors have been already shown in different applicati 15  Moreover, analyses on the quality of the DInSAR measurements based on comparison with data acquired via precise geodetic techniques \(leveling, GPS, alignment arrays 16 Accordi ngl y  we focus in this presentation to the comparison between the SBAS- DInSAR results and the measurements available from continuous GPS data. In particular, the investigated test site is the Los Angeles metropolitan zone \(Southern California, USA\a generally tectonically active region with surface deformations caused by different natural and anthropogenic actions. We remark that a key element for the seismic surveillance on the whole area is represented by the Southern California Integrated GPS Network \(SCIGN  which is an array of 250 GPS stations spread out across Southern California and northern Baja California, Mexico For what concerns the presente d DInSAR analysis t h e SBAS algorithm has been applied to a set of 42 SAR data track: 170, frame: 2925 during the 1995-2002 time interval, see Figure 1, and coupled in 102 interferograms, see Table 1. Each interferometric SAR image pair has been chosen with a perpendicular baseline value smaller than 300 m and with a maximum time interval of 4 years; precise satellite orbital information and a Shuttle Radar Topography Mission SRTM\ Digital Elevation Model \(DEM of t h e area have also been used. All the DInSAR products have been obtained following a complex mu 20 looks in the azimuth direction and 4 looks in the range one, with a resulting pixel dimension of the order of 100 x 100 m 2  


  3 As a first result of the SBAS algorithm analysis, we present in Figure 2a the geocoded SAR amplitude image relevant to the investigated area, with s uperimposed the estimated line of sight \(LOS\ean displacement velocity map and the locations of the GPS SCIGN sites \(black and white squares within the region. Note that, we selected in our analysis the GPS stations located in cohe rent areas, and for which the measurements are relevant to a time interval starting before the year 2000. This ensures at least two years of overlap with the available SAR data Following the GPS selection, we have compared the DInSAR time series with the corresponding LOS- projected GPS measurements, the latter obtained through the SCIGN web site [20  As first resu lt o f th is co m p ariso n we sh o w in

Note that both DInSAR and geodetic measurements have been referred to the same pixel located in correspondence of the ELSC station \(see Figure 2a\presented results clearly show the good agreement between these two measurements Let us now carry out a quantitative analysis. Accordingly we have computed the standard deviation values of the differences between the DInS AR and the LOS-projected GPS time series for each GPS site identified by black and white squares in Figure 2a \(see Table 2\and the average of these values; in this case, we obtained the mean square deviation d SAR 002  6.9 mm. Subsequently, we computed the LOS-projected GPS errors available from the SCIGN measurements and rem oved t h e bi as due t o t h e estimated errors relevant to the geodetic measurements Following this bias removal, we finally achieved the mean value d SAR 002  5.6 mm that is rather close to the standard deviation of LOS-projected GPS errors whose mean value computed from the measurements of the right column of Table 2\o d GPS 002  4 mm 2  C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS  We have compared the surface deformation measurement capability of the SBAS-DInSAR technique and of continuous GPS.

  6 acquired by the ERS sensors in the 1995-2002 time interval and continuous GPS measurements relevant to 38 sites. The carried out analysis has shown that the SBAS technique allows to achieve an estimat e of the single displacement measurements with a standard deviation of about 5mm which is comparable with the LOS-projected GPS data accuracy Moreover, the presented resu lts clearly demonstrate the potential of the SBAS-DInSAR technology for monitoring deformation in active seismic ar eas characterized, as for the investigated Los Angeles case, by significant urbanization The possibility to provide space\226time information on the detected deformation at relativ ely low cost and sufficiently high accuracy represents a ke y element for involving the DInSAR technology in rou tine surveillance operations These issues may clearly have a strong relevance in civil protection scenarios because of their impact on deformation-related risk mitigation As additional remark, we underline that the integration of DInSAR and GPS \(and GALILEO soon\easurements is foreseen in future devel opments. Indeed, the former technique allows us to achieve spatially dense measurements but limited to a single component of the detected deformation phenomenon. On the contrary, the GPS \(GALILEO\data are relevant to single points but leads to retrieve temporally dense time series with fully 3D information. The complementariness of the two techniques is evident A convenient possibility is the use of GPS \(GALILEO as \223tie points\224 at the DInSAR phase-unwrapping stage. This renders the procedure overdetermined and appropriate processing techniques may be implemented to improve the accuracy of the solution. Ne w constellation SAR satellites as for the Cosmo-Skymed case [21 will d r astically red u ce the revisiting time, thus allowing statistical analysis to possibly detect systematic errors. In addition, knowledge of the full deformation map, as provided by DInSAR, allows to optimize the GPS \(GALILEO\ocation providing important hints for the development of geological models 3  A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This work has been partially sponsored by the CRdCAMRA, ASI and the \(Italian\We thank ESA which has provided the ERS data of the Los Angeles zone through the WInSAR data archive in collaboration with dr.

departments on average\ignificant differences were found regarding the age of the applications. The variables for the coverage of the products and processes were not included in this test because the overlap was computed using these two variables implying that there is a significant relation between the respective variables\his lends some support to proposition P2.4 stating that involvement of more users leads to greater overlap of applications. The proposition that older applications also exhibit a higher degree of overlap was not supported \(P1.4  A.2. Results from analyzing impacts of AA complexity  Impacts of interdependency-related AA complexity A Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 4\ealed a statistically significant difference in operations cost as well as maintenance cost across the three different interdependency-groups of applications. The more interdependent group \(i.e. applications with 3-7 or with 8 or more interfaces\igher median of operations \(Md=119,000 and 363,000 EUR respectively\ and maintenance costs \(Md=326,000 and 506,000 EUR respectively\ than the less interdependent group \(fewer than 3 interfaces applications \(Md=52,000 EUR operations costs and 64,000 EUR maintenance costs\. This supports the proposition \(P3.1\ that more interdependent applications also incur higher IT \(operations and maintenance\ts  Impacts of diversity-related AA complexity   Regarding OS-related diversity, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 5\howed no significant difference between the operations costs of more \(Md=93,890 n=105\d less diverse applications \(Md=131,540 n=27\09.5, z=-1.174, p=.24. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=166,400; n=121 vs Md=116,900; n =31\782, z=-.43; p=.668 To measure DBMS-related diversity, a MannWhitney U test was conducted \(Table 5\d revealed no significance difference in operations costs of more Md=129,985; n=85\d less diverse applications Md=154,777; n=16\5, z=-.237, p=.813. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=210,500 n=98 vs. Md=245,700; n=19\36, z=-.704 p=.481. Hence, the proposition \(P3.2\ that diversityrelated AA complexity leads to higher IT costs is not supported  Impacts of deviation-related AA complexity   Regarding deviation from the standard OS, a MannWhitney U test \(Table 6\revealed no significant difference between the maintenance costs and operations costs for standard-compliant \(Md=83,581 n=94 for operations cost and Md=148,300; n=113 for maintenance cost\nd non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=38 for operations cost and Md=166,400; n=39 for maintenance cost z=-1.921, p=.055 for operations cost and U=2116 z=-.371, p=.711 for maintenance cost Concerning deviation from the standard DBMS, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 6\ealed a significant difference between maintenance costs for standardcompliant \(Md=373,100; n=59\d non-standardcompliant applications \(Md=170,200; n=58 U=1303, z=-2.231, p=.026. It is remarkable that the non-compliant applications had lower maintenance costs than the compliant applications. The difference between operations costs for compliant Md=109,978; n=51\d non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=50\s not significant, U=1196.5 z=-.533, p=.594 Thus, the proposition \(P3.3\at application that deviate from technology standards incur higher IT costs is not supported. In contrast, for DBMSstandard deviation, we observed significantly lower maintenance cost for non-compliant than for compliant applications  Impacts of overlap/redundancy-related AA complexity a Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 7\ showed significant differences in operations costs across the applications with a low \(less than 34 overlaps Md=90,442; n=37\edium \(35-79 overlaps Md=55,770; n=56\ and high level of overlap/redundancy \(more than 80 overlaps Md=129,985; n=61 6.862, p=.032. It is striking to see that the applications with medium overlaps have a lower median operations cost than those with a low or high-level of overlap, implying a non-linear U-shape relation between overlap and operations cost. Interestingly, the same holds true for maintenance cost. Applications with a low degree of overlap exhibited a median maintenance cost of 96,600 \(n=59\, those with a medium level of overlap incurred a median of 81,300 \(n=58\d highly overlapping applications a median of 248,700 \(n=67 9.791, p=.007. Hence, the proposition \(P3.4\at applications with a greater degree of overlap also exhibit higher IT costs is not supported  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 12

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
