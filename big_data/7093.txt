Data Mining, Association Rules, Frequent Item Sets  
I  I NTRODUCTION   Data mining[1 a m u ltid is cip lin ar y  f i eld is a KDD  process. And its aim is to extract some interesting patterns and rules from mass data. As one of the most well-known Data mining problems, association rules mining is more and more attractive to some scientists. At present, we know lots of association rules mining technology have been successfully applied in some financial enterprises, and have exerted much more effect on the customer requirement in bank The aim of mining association rules[2 d i sco v er th e  association relationship among item sets from mass data

rules could be divided into two classes: strong rule and weak rule. Rules are called strong, if and only if they satisfy both a minimum support threshold and a minimum confidence threshold In most cases, A transaction could be denoted by a binary string d each  n u m e rical dig it den ote s th e ex i s ti n g s t ate of corresponding item. In this method the computation of the frequency  of  items is very easy, but in practice, the size of a transaction is much smaller than the size of the set

transaction. Before detailing the theory of transaction tree, we first need to acquaint ourselves with the concept of storage tree. To illustrate this method, let\220s study the following figure 1, where a complete storage tree between i1 and i3 has the formal as: brother nodes are sunwise arranged according to alphabet order, and every node is denoted by a set, which consists of two parts, namely node element and all nodes in the path from this node to the root  Fig. 1 A complete storage tree between i1 and i4 Above tree structure could be view as a set containing all paths from the root to each leaf node, and each element of this set corresponds to the all item sets occurring in some transaction Now, we introduce the concept of transaction  Transaction tree is the modified version of storage tree, and it gives a mark to every node for recording the number of the transactions containing corresponding item set.

are considered and recorded in the item table IT. For example, to examine the occurrence of i7 we first localize the position of i7 in I1 from IL, and then find i7 in I3 other than to scan I2  Fig. 3 The data structure IG Due to holding all advantages of horizontal data layout and vertical data layout, similar to H-structure, IG guarantees the implement of the algorithm that applies these two data layouts. The difference between IG and H-structure is: in IG there is a link between every occurrence and next occurrence of each item, while in H-structure, the chain table always points to the first occurrence of each item, so to fetch some item, and we have to traverse from the head of some transaction. Because the chain table in IG directly points to the same item of different transactions, when we traverse all occurrences of each item, the time needed is drastically shortened to some extent II  M INING A LGORITHM  At present, many relative algorithms have been proposed and could be group into three classes e f i rst cla s s is the improved algorithm based on Apriori algorithm, which is built upon the Boolean association rule problem proposed by Agrawal R. in 1994; the second class is partition-based algorithm, and which is high parallelable, because ultimate frequent item sets generating depends on the frequent item sets on many independent logical blocks; the last class is FP-tree frequent item sets algorithm whose proposal successfully overcomes the drawback that Apriori algorithm may brings redundant candidate item sets. The paper proposes an association rules mining algorithm based on the third class algorithm Firstly, we introduce the concept of compressed transaction tree. Because of having many same subtrees, a complete storage tree must waste lots of memory resource, so to diminish the node size of the transaction tree, we would adopt a compression method to group all transactions to share the same nodes. As shown in figure 4, the storage tree has three same subtrees t1, t2 and t3, and generating a complete storage tree needs lots of extra memory algorithm, H-Ming algorithm and OP algorithm and so forth adopt the hybrid meth at co m b i n es h o rizontal m e t hod  with vertical meth this paper w e  u s e a data s t r u ct u r e called \215IG\216, which also is hybrid method. And this structure possesses the following advantages[9   Of course, each node in the compressed storage tree needs to add a new field, which includes two parts that are the layer and the access count of the head item of each different sub item set, to store some extra information about the nodes pruned from the complete storage tree and these transactions are the subsets of all items in the item table IT. The relative position of the elements in these item sets is in accordance with the position in the item set IT. Besides, each item in one transaction is linked to corresponding item in next transaction. In other words, we use a chain table to link the first occurrences of all items, and so we could easily get the support count of every item As shown in figure 3, all frequent item sets whose support greater than the smallest support count 2 in the transaction database IT I1      Root 174 t2     t1 Item 1 3 4 5 7 is always seriously less than the maximum of the problems discovered in the frequent item sets Count 4 4 5 3 2 IL represents mass transactions in transaction database 2 4 3 4 5 7 Ignoring transaction labels and linking corresponding item in different transactions   Fig. 4 The storage tree containing three same subtrees So in the paper, we adopt a compressive technology to store the same subtrees to diminish the node size of the storage tree, as shown in figure 5, which node size is decreased to 8 nodes from 16 nodes in figure 4. For example for an n-item set, its corresponding complete storage tree has 2 n nodes, while its compressed storage tree has 2 n-1 nodes at the most, so the size of the storage tree is diminished to the half at the least. In fact, the number of all nodes in the transaction database 4 4 3 4 4 4 3 1 2 3 4 3  4 IL 1 4 5 7 1 3 4 5 1 3 4 1 3 4 I2 I5 I4 I3 D D D t3 Linking all transactions to the item table IT Item table IT storing all items occurring in the transaction database, which element has a support count. And the first occurrence of all items all link to the item table IT One-to-one mapping relation between  item labels and natural number field 


The second step is to generate a transaction tree. We utilize the information in table 1 to insert all transactions containing some 1-item set corresponding to some node into the transaction tree. For example, i7 is mapped to it1 in the transaction tree, i5 is mapped to i2 i3 is mapped to it3 and so on. As shown in figure 6  Fig. 6 The compressed storage tree of the sample database Each node all stores the count of the transactions that contain the corresponding item, so every node in the tree may be accessed many times. For example, the count \(0, 0\of the node 5 in the transaction tree denote the item set {it1, it2, it3 it4, it5} that is not occur all the time, where the first 0 means the item set starts at the zeroth layer and the second 0 means the count of the transactions that contain this item set To implement this compressed transaction tree, we need to put all access point into a array, and some layer of a access point is a array index other than storing it explicitly The third step is to generate IL in the item table IT, and traverse the transaction tree by applying depth-first algorithm Theoretically, all nodes whose transaction counts greater than 01 23 12 124 234 345 35  245  23 12 13 134  24  34 14 In figure 5, the node 3 has three access counts: \(0,1 1,1\ and \(2,1\, where the mean of the access count \(0,1\ is that there is a transaction, which head item locates the zeroth layer, and a path, which includes three nodes i1,i2 and i3, from the root to the node 3. The next access count \(1,1\eans there is a transaction whose head node locates the first layer and a path that consists of the i2 and i3 from the root the node 3. In like manner, \(2, 1\o means there is a transaction whose head node locates the second layer and a path that is composed of the root and the node 3. So if we suppose the transaction count of each node of the storage tree in figure 4 is 1, then the item sets surrounded by dash rectangles could map to the item sets of the compressed transaction tree in figure 4 we note these dash rectangles are not the parts of the data structure IG, just for illustration expediently Because the paths from the root to those different nodes correspond to the different transactions, we could group all transactions by sharing the same items, which high improves the performance of the mining algorithm Next, we would describe the mining algorithm based on the pattern growth algorithm in detail, which adopts the above compressed transaction tree Algorithm IFP-growth includes four procedures: the first procedure is to extract the 1-item sets. Firstly, we should initialize the item table IT. Because the frequent item sets meet the prior principle, which means they hold the character of anti-monotone, for mining frequent item sets, we only need 1-item sets, which are attained by scanning the transaction database and finding the item sets whose support count greater than mini-sup. Then we store these frequent 1-item sets to the item table IT. To facilitate the carryout of the next procedure we sort all elements by ascent according to their support count and denote them by the integer; the second procedure is to generate the compressed transaction tree. When we generate the compressed transaction tree, the items is denoted by their label, and insert all different transactions to the compressed transaction tree. The nodes of the compressed transaction tree correspond to the all frequent 1-itemsets. The count set of each node denotes the number of the transactions, which contain the subsets of all items in the path from the root to this node The next procedure is to traverse the compressed transaction tree to constitute the item table IT and the transaction chain IL for generating IG; The last procedure is to mine frequent item sets. In this procedure, we use a recursive function to assist mining the frequent k-item sets, where k > 2 To illustrate the above procedures, we consider the following example. Suppose mini-sup is 2, we want to mine all frequent item sets in the transaction database. The first step is to scan all transaction for attaining frequent 1-item sets Examine every item in each transaction whether is the element of the item table IT or not, if the answer is positive, and then add the count of corresponding element, otherwise we should add this item to the IT and let its count be 1. When we finish scanning the database, we get all frequent 1-item sets {1 3}, {4}, {5}, {7}. After attaining all 1-item sets, we should sort all elements in IT by ascent according to their supports and use the integer to denote them. As show in table 1 0 0  0 1  0 1 00 00 01  Fig. 5 The compressed transaction tree Count  5  11 22 30 40  10 20 30  10 20  1 0  0 0 1 0 2 3 4 24  34 2345 45 5 5  235 10 20  10  1 1 2 1 3 1  1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 3 4 4 4 234     4 1 1  4  5 123 0  1   1 1  00 01 175 item  Table 1 Item table IT index  123 3  0 0 2  1234 12345 1235 1245 0 1 3  0 1 0 1 2 0 1  124 1234 4

In figure 6, there are 3 such nodes, and it means there are 3 corresponding access points of the transaction tree. What we to do is only to link the all non-zero accesses to the corresponding lines in the transaction chain. As shown in figure 7  Fig. 7 Item Group data structure In the improved IG data structure, we put the access count of every line to a array, so the array indexes are not stored directly The last step is to mine longer frequent item sets than 1item sets.

Figure 6 Signature changes in inclusion and exclusion same or another value pointed by an downward link If the allowed range of a predicate is upward-complete i.e any value pointed hy a upward link from a value in the allowed range is also in the allowed range then the predicate has the ascending closeness property If the allowed range of a predicate is downward-complete i.e any value pointed by a downward link from a value in the allowed range is also in the allowed range then the predicate has the descending closeness property However transitivity can not be inferred automatically So such properties e.g TR\(decide have to he spec ified while defining the predicate Meta-properties are translated to fint order formulae Then common infer ence methods can infer the semantic closure of a set of constraints In the example discussed in the begin ning of this subsection DCz\(decide can be proven au tomatically hence decide\(A,,AS can be deduced from decide\(A1 Az With TR\(decide and decide\(As,Ad decide\(A1,Al can be proven We call the set of all constraints deducible from users\222 specification such as decide\(A1 Ad in this case, the semantic closure of users\222 specification With all the definitions and theorems introduced so far to decide a mining camp is now obvious If a mining camp vi olates any comtraint in the semantic closure of users\222 spec ification skip this mining camp Ifthe violated predicate is downward closed then skip all its successor as well 4 Casestudy In this section, we demonstrate how the problem size of the example in Section 1 can be greatly reduced The data set in the example contains 13 attributes If no constraint is applied, there are 1,586,131 313  ZI3 possible map pings Exhausted mining is obvious not a feasible option However, manually selecting mappings is not a good option either because it is tedious and prone to miss some inter ignore  Rec ignore Time together\(\(EventType Maint follou\({Date AMIPM fOllOW\(\(/ntrv/5 rntrul3o AMIPM grouponly\(\(Date Intrvl5 Intrul30 AMIPM item.only\(\(EventType Source Subsource Severity decide\({EventType Subsource decide\(\(Subsource Source decide\(\(EuentType Severity decide\(\(Host Site repel\({lntrvl30 lntrvl5 Figure 7 Specification System Management Events esting mappings With ASL domain experts can state the constraints in Figure 7 As stated before domain experts can specify their knowledge in a casual way without thinking tcw much about the implication The inference system will find the semantic closure of the specification as true in tention of the domain experts So many different specifications may have the same intention For ex ample follm\({Intrv/5 Intrwl30 AMIPM can be broken up to two clauses or merge with follozu\(\(Date AMIPM and become follm\(\(Date Intrvl5 IntrvlJO AMIPM With group-only Date Intrul5 Intrvl30 AMIPM already specified repel\(\(lntrvl5 IntrulBO has the same effect as decide\({Intrvl5 Intrvl30 The reduction of mining space is shown in Figure 8 The data set has 13 attributes so levels above 14 all have the Same number of mining camps The table shows the num bers of mining camps for the cases of exhausting all mining camps ignoring 2 attributes, ignoring 3 attributes and ap plying the specification in Figure I With the help of domain knowledge, the maximal num ber of mining camps of a level is reduced from 527,345 to 321 The problem becomes solvable and the resulting pat terns have better chance to he interpreted and responded to The inference system can he used alone without actually mining data it can list all the remaining mining camps in the mining space for user to specify more domain knowl edge for further reduction 5 Conclusion Advances in association rule mining has come the point to deal with common relational data with multiple at tributes.

VII S UMMARY We have shown how robustness under subsampling for common classes of itemsets can be computed efìciently without actually sampling the data The experimental results show that the number of reported itemsets can be largely reduced on many datasets in other words spurious itemsets that would not have been found in many subsets of the data are removed The approach can further be used to rank itemsets for topk mining by robustness Future work will investigate the effect of using robust itemsets on data mining tasks such as clustering classiìcation and rule generation using itemsets A CKNOWLEDGMENTS Nikolaj Tatti is supported by Post-Doctoral Fellowships of the Research FoundationÑFlanders  FWO  R EFERENCES  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A N Sw ami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases in SIGMOD  1993 pp 207Ö216  J Hipp U G¸ntzer  and G Nakhaeizadeh  Algorithms for association rule mining a general survey and comparison SIGKDD Explorations  vol 2 no 1 pp 58Ö64 2000  K W ang C Xu and B Liu Clustering transactions using large items in CIKM  1999 pp 483Ö490  H Cheng X Y an J Han and C Hsu Discriminati v e frequent pattern analysis for effective classiìcation in ICDE  2007 pp 716Ö725  F  Moerchen M Thies and A Ultsch Ef cient mining of all margin-closed itemsets with applications in temporal knowledge discovery and classiìcation by compression KAIS  2010  K Smets and J Vreek en The odd one out Identifying and characterising anomalies in SDM  2011  N P asquier  Y  Bastide R T aouil and L Lakhal Disco v er ing frequent closed itemsets for association rules in ICDT  1999 pp 398Ö416  J Pei J Han and L V  S Lakshmanan Mining frequent itemsets with convertible constraints in ICDE  2001 pp 433Ö442  T  Calders C Rigotti and J.-F  Boulicaut  A surv e y on condensed representations for frequent sets in ConstraintBased Mining and Inductive Databases  2006 pp 64Ö80  S Brin R Motw ani and C Silv erstein Be yond mark et baskets Generalizing association rules to correlations in SIGMOD  1997 pp 265Ö276  N T atti Maximum entrop y based signiìcance of itemsets  KAIS  vol 17 no 1 pp 57Ö77 2008  F  Geerts B Goethals and T  Mielik‰inen T iling databases  in Proc Discovery Science  2004 pp 278Ö289  J.-F  Boulicaut A Byk o wski and C Rigotti Free-sets A condensed representation of boolean data for the approximation of frequency queries DMKD  vol 7 no 1 pp 5Ö22 2003  T  Calders and B Goethals Non-deri v a ble itemset mining  DMKD  vol 14 no 1 pp 171Ö206 2007  T  Mielik‰inen T ransaction databases frequent itemsets and their condensed representations in KDID  2005 pp 139 164  D Xin J Han X Y an and H Cheng Mining compressed frequent-pattern sets in VLDB  2005 pp 709Ö720  A Gallo T  De Bie and N Cristianini Mini Mining informative non-redundant itemsets in ECMLPKDD  2007 pp 438Ö445  G I W ebb Disco v ering signiìcant patterns  Mach Learn  vol 68 no 1 pp 1Ö33 2007  R Gupta G F ang B Field M Steinbach and V  K umar  Quantitative evaluation of approximate frequent pattern mining algorithms in KDD  2008 pp 301Ö309  T  Calders B Goethals and M Mampae y  Mining itemsets in the presence of missing values in SAC  2007 pp 404 408  T  Uno and H Arimura  An ef cient polynomial delay algorithm for pseudo frequent itemset mining in Discovery Science  Springer 2007 pp 219Ö230  C Luccese S Orlando and G Pere go R.Casas-Garriga Mining top-k patterns from binary datasets in presence of noise in ICDM  2010  H Cheng P  S Y u and J Han A C-Close Ef ciently mining approximate closed itemsets by core pattern recovery in ICDM  IEEE 2006 pp 839Ö844  J.-F  Boulicaut A Byk o wski and C Rigotti  Approximation of frequency queries by means of free-sets in PKDD  2000 pp 75Ö85  B Goethals and M Zaki FIMI 03 frequent itemset mining implementations in ICDM 2003 Workshop FIMI  2003  A Asuncion and D Ne wman UCI machine learning repository 2007 A v ailable http://www ics.uci edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html  F  Coenen The LUCS-KDD discretised/normalised ARM and CARM data library 2003 A v ailable http www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frans/KDD/Software/LUCS_KDD_DN  Y  Zhao and G Karypis Ev aluation of hierarchical clustering algorithms for document datasets in CIKM  2002 pp 515 524  B Bringmann and A Zimmermann One in a million picking the right patterns KAIS  vol 18 no 1 pp 61Ö81 2009  J Vreek en M v an Leeuwen and A Siebes Krimp mining itemsets that compress DMKD  vol 23 no 1 pp 169Ö214 2011

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
