Abstract 
 Building accurate classiìers is very desirable for many KDD processes Rule-based classiìers are appealing because of their simplicity and their self-explanatory nature in describing reasons for their decisions The objective of classiìers generally has been to maximize the accuracy of predictions When data points of different classes have different misclassiìcation costs it becomes desirable to minimize the expected cost of the classiìcation decisions In this paper we present an algorithm for 
inducing a rule based classiìer that i shifts the class boundaries so as to minimize the cost of misclassiìcations and ii refuses to announce a class decision for those regions of the data space that are likely to contribute signiìcantly to the expected cost of decisions We compare our results with other rule based classiìers such as the C4.5 CN2 and GARC for the cases of uniform and non-uniform misclassiìcation costs of different classes 
I I NTRODUCTION Rule based classiìers build models based on simple intuitive rules extracted from data Over the years rule based classiìers like C4.5 CN2 and association rule based classiìers have 
been developed and used The rules generated by these methods are usually sets of feature-value conditions which when met predict a class Their accuracy usually falls short of more complex classiìers like the Support Vector Machines or Neural Networks but they make up for it with their simplicity and ease of interpretation Most rule induction algorithms work by iterating through the feature space nding sets of rules that split datasets into relatively pure classes In the process they seek to cover promising parts of the feature-value space to form rules and also cover every instance in the training dataset Additionally most classiìers always make a call on the class of a given test 
instance In some domains where the cost of misclassiìcation is high it is better to not assign a test instance any label than to risk misclassifying it Choosing to keep an instance undecided may be cheaper than misclassifying it Another drawback with most of the rule-induction algorithms is that they restrict a data tuple in the dataset to helping deìne only one rule or pattern This is because of the exclusive partitioning of the dataset into subsets in every iteration This is done to reduce the computational cost and to nd the smallest set of rules to classify most of the data However by doing so a classiìer can overlook signiìcant and useful rules or patterns that may have had sufìcient support 
if data tuples were available for sharing and were allowed to contribute towards justifying multiple rules When a dataset has different costs or penalties associated with misclassiìcations from different classes classiìers that blind to such non-uniform costs can perform poorly even though their overall classiìcation accuracy is high These issues can be addressed by either wrapping a cost-blind classiìer inside a meta algorithm like AdaCost or MetaCost by post processing of classiìcation rules or by building cost-sensitive classiìers from the ground 10][5][21][13 Lomax and Vadera have presented an extensive survey of cost sensitive decision tree classiìers in 
Our algorithm for rule-induction overcomes the above drawbacks by performing a systematic search on the feature space using a cost sensitive entropy-based measure for rule selection and also for pruning Our approach does not impose the single coverage constraint that is we permit a data tuple to belong to multiple sets of tuples each set becoming the basis of possibly generating a rule Thereby we generate rules that embody meaningful patterns while at the same time making sure that weak rules are not generated When a data situation corresponding to a potentially weak rule is encountered the rule is not generated and thus at deployment the classiìcation system does not make a prediction This reduces the cost of 
making wrong classiìcations The rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 we review some rule based classiìcation algorithms and cost sensitive decision trees Section 3 explains some preliminary concepts that are used in our approach followed by an explanation of our classiìcation method in section 4 A comparison of the performance on some publicly available data sets is presented in section 5 followed by the conclusions of our work and contributions II R ELATED WORK

iteratively splitting the dataset into smaller sets based on the best attribute such that one or more of the subsets formed have a higher percentage of instances belonging to one class than any other Information gain entropy or the Gini score have been used to choose the next best feature with which to split the dataset The disadvantages of these algorithms is that they work in a greedy manner and keep splitting the dataset and ignoring parts of the dataset already covered by a rule They thus continue forming classiìcation rules for only the remaining section of the dataset This approach may lead to

generation of rules that are locally optimal and may ignore some good candidates due to the exclusive splitting of data performed early in the process This greedy approach tends to reduce the number of rules generated since a more compact set of rules with somewhat lower accuracy is preferred over a much larger set of rules In contrast to the tree induction algorithms association rule mining is mostly done on binary datasets As a result most association rule based classiìers need to discretize or transform the dataset into a binary format It is recommended that each continuous feature be converted into a categorical or discrete values feature using entropy based or MDL discretization Bing Liu et al introduced the algorithm for classiìcation based on association  This algorithm e xploits par allels between building of association rules and classiìcation rules They present CBA-RG an association rule based classiìer which they show to perform comparably with C4.5 The CBA algorithm works by generating and ordering candidate association rules where the variables on the right side are always class labels It employs post-hoc pruning strategies to resolve any redundant or conîicting rules that are generated If a rule has high conìdence and support it is accepted as a classiìcation rule and the rows data tuples in the database that support the rule are removed from further participation in the algorithm They improved upon their algorithm with CBA\(2 by incorporating multiple support The reason being that in datasets where class frequencies are unbalanced a single threshold may be high for some classes and low for others One of the major issues with association rule based classiìers is that as the number of features increases the set of candidate rules that need to be generated grows exponentially Therefore efìciently generating rules and pruning off unpromising areas of the search space while maintaining high efìciency have been the main concern of these algorithms CBA uses the apriori method of rule generation whereas other approaches like CMAR and use a more efìcient FP tree based rule generation  A greedy approach to generating candidates can also be used to reduce the number of candidate rules This approach is seen in CPAR and  Chen et al have presented GARC Gain based Association Rule Classiìer based on a modiìcation of the idea used in CB It impro v es upon CB A by using information gain to reduce the number of candidate rules generated and therefore reduces the size of the nal set of rules and also the processing time GARC uses information gain to identify the attributes that best splits the database and then generates only those rules that contain this attribute It performs comparably to CBA while generating a small fraction  5 of the rules generated by CBA When using a rule based approach it is possible for two or more rules with different class labels to be applicable to the same instance Such conîicts are resolved either by deìning a precedence ordering over the rules and choosing a single rule with the highest precedence or by analyzing the correlation between high conìdence rules to make a  When compared to most other rule based approaches our approach differs primarily in the following ways We identify good quality biclusters within the data table These can be viewed as rectangular regions in the data table with all permutations of rows or columns being allowed These biclusters can overlap each other That is a tuple or a feature can be included in multiple biclusters If the quality metric of the bicluster is above some threshold a corresponding rule is generated Our method does not force class labels on instances that are prone to be misclassiìed That is tuples may not match feature-value combination for any of the good quality biclusters identiìed during learning phase In this case a class label is not announced We form a middle ground between techniques that use single trees and multiple trees bagging since we do not impose the single coverage constraint but we also do not build multiple trees to cover all important concepts embedded in the data When very strict criteria are used for accepting a bicluster to generate a rule we generate only those rules that have very high accuracy Therefore if an instance is likely to be misclassiìed none of the generated rules will match the instance and it will be labeled undecided Thabtah presents a detailed survey about the issues of concern in association rule based classiìcation and the different existing algorithms The concept of misclassiìcation costs whether uniform or non-uniform has been addressed for a long  Much effort has been put into adapting the existing cost-insensitive accuracymaximizing decision tree learning algorithms to make them cost sensitive This has been done in a number of ways such as boosting re-sampling the classes to reîect their misclassiìcation costs wrapper methods like MetaCost or incorporating misclassiìcation costs into priors   Most early approaches perform post-hoc pruning on rule sets generated by cost blind Once the set of rules is generated a misclassiìcation cost metric is computed for each rule and rule with high expected costs are discarded Other approaches included cost considerations during rule construction with existing algorithms such as C4.5CS CSGain and GINIAlteredPriors These approaches calculate and assign instances of each class a weight based on a classês misclassiìcation costs and frequency in the dataset These weights are incorporated into information theoretic measures and used to guide the decision tree      Algorithms like UBoost and AdaBoost take a boosting approach to cost-sensitive classiìcation by working with complex weight functions to build stronger classiìers from weak   MetaCost is a cost-sensiti v e algorithm that uses bagging to reduce misclassiìcation MetaCost builds a classiìer by learning

the original dataset where each subset is re-sampled from the original dataset based on misclassiìcation cost of each class Some other approached are based on the use of genetic algorithms or stochastic methods to induce decision trees or to induce multiple decision trees and then use them as an ensemble system to classify test instances A survey of costsensitive decision tree classiìers by Lomax and Vadera is presented in Our method approaches the task of cost-sensitive classiìcation by incorporating a cost-sensitive entropy based metric into a systematic search of the feature-value space This metric is used to evaluate the merit of each good bicluster identiìed in the dataset by our search algorithm We do not pre-compute weights or prior probabilities before the search starts rather the expected cost of each rule is computed as it is generated This expected cost is dependent only on the class distribution within the bicluster form which the rule is generated rather than within the entire dataset Additionally as mentioned before instances can be shared among biclusters for different rules and this helps in nding more meaningful and low-cost rules overall III P RELIMINARIES Traditionally association rule mining is done on binary datasets Therefore in order to perform association rule mining on real valued datasets the dataset needs to be transformed into a format that can be mined in this way Bing Liu et al propose discretization of values in each column using Fayyad and Iraniês MDL method  W e ha v e used the same MDL entropy based discretization for transforming values in each column from continuous to discrete in all our datasets The task of generating rules for a dataset where class labels for instances are known can be thought of as looking for feature-value patterns that match instances of one class but not the others When the class labels are unknown clustering is used to nd interesting patterns in the data across features and instances by grouping similar instances together and getting insights into the data When clustering is performed on features and instances simultaneously it is called Biclustering and it generates subsets of features and corresponding subsets of data instances All the instances included in a bicluster are described by the rule formed with the features included in the bicluster If the instances in a bicluster are predominantly from one class or the expected cost of forming a rule for the bicluster is low then this rule can be retained as a good rule for classiìcation Most classiìers are built by covering all training instances and are intended to predict the class of every test instance presented If the classes are arranged in a linearly separable manner in the data space such an approach to classiìcation works well and delivers high accuracy for most training and testing sets However in datasets where some classes or parts of them overlap in the data space and some parts of these classes donêt overlap building a classiìer that classiìes all instances of all classes with have reduced accuracy because of the overlap regions This usually results in some low quality conìdence rules It is preferable in some situations to cover a limited number of training instances as long as the conìdence in the predicted classes remains very high Also in some cases it is acceptable for a classiìer to be able to predict instances of only one  Our approach builds on this idea of accepting partial classiìcation in order to get higher accuracy or lower expected cost on the test instances that are classiìed A model that consists of only high conìdence rules reveals the highly structured and separable parts of the data space while saying nothing about regions in which instances are prone to be misclassiìed IV A PPROACH A rule is a set of constraints on features and their values A rule  is a set of feature-value pairs where feature has value  It can be read as feature has value  A rule   is applicable to an instance in the dataset if for each feature in the rule the value of the feature in the instance is the same as  The length of a rule is the number of feature-value pairs that the rule contains The support of a rule  for a class  isthe fraction of data instances that belong to the class from among all the instances that satisfy the rule  The support of a rule is the largest support value that the rule enjoys from among all the classes whose instances in satisìes The support values of a rule for different classes along with the misclassiìcation costs of instances are used to form a metric for determining the quality of the rule The support of a rule is also used as one of the pruning metrics in our approach If the support of a rule is lower than some preset minimum threshold deìned in general or for a particular class it can be discarded and no rules that are a specialization of it need to be generated The coverage of a rule is the set containing the row IDs for of all data instances of all classes that satisfy the conditions of the rule We deìne the quality of a rule as the cost-weighted entropy of itês support across instances of different classes that satisfy it or as the entropy of different misclassiìcation costs That is or  where    number of classes in the database and

is the cost of misclassifying an instance of class as belonging to that of any other class We call this entropybased metric as quality but a low value of this metric is desirable for a rule to be good As with entropy values the maximum contribution to the quality value is made by the class that should be predicted by this rule Our method assumes that the cost of misclassifying an instance is xed irrespective of which other class it gets misclassiìed as When all the misclassiìcation costs are equal say to 1 the above formula reduces to that of entropy based on support across different classes Each bicluster identiìed by our search algorithm is evaluated by this quality metric and if is considered good then a rule corresponding to the bicluster is generated A good rule is one which has low entropy since it means that most of itês support or cost comes from only one class which is the class that the rule will then predict This metric is also used to prune the search space during the candidate generation phase If the entropy of a rule is below a threshold called  we do not need to make the rule more speciìc by including more features The reason being that rules generated by further specialization may have better quality lower the entropy but will not cover any extra instances The support for any such rules after specialization can only go down Also those rules that have quality values higher than some threshold  can be discarded as unpromising rules However this threshold must be kept reasonably high to allow the intermediate rules to develop by further specializations for a few iterations before they are discarded in in Rule Generation In order to nd good rules we examine features their values and interactions among feature-value pairs in an iterative and systematic manner using the preìx based search For each candidate set of feature-value pairs we determine the set of satisfying instances consider the resulting bicluster and compute the quality\(R for the rule R that corresponds to this bicluster We accept rules that have low quality metric and continue to process the other rules by leaving them for further specializations First the set of all rules of length one are generated iterates over each feature and makes a rule for each distinct value of that feature and returns the set of all rules formed in each distinct in makeBasicRules From this set rules that have a support lower than a prespeciìed threshold are discarded Also the rules from this set that have quality metric value less than are removed from the set and are added to the set of rules accepted for the classiìer called  This new set of rules of length one represents a set of basic rules and is stored in  For the rst iteration of the algorithm all rules from the set are copied into a temporary set called  In each iteration a rule  from is specialized by adding a condition deìned by a rule from the set in the function  For example given a rule from  read as feature has value  and a rule from   the following new rule can be formed by the set union of their conditions read as feature has value and feature has value  The support for will contain those rows\(data instances which were common to both and and belonged to class  A temporary label is assigned to the new rule representing the class that it predicts i.e the class that has highest contribution to the quality metric described above Once a new rule  is formed the following conditions are checked 1 Is the entropy of the rule higher than  2 Is the support   less than the minimum support for the class it predicts If either condition is true for the new rule the algorithm continues to the next rule without adding it to the set of nal rules  If neither of those two conditions are true but the entropy of the rule is greater than it is added to the set of rules to

Figure 6 is not as signiìcant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
