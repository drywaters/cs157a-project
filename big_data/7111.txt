data set has information hidden within them researchers cannot and they have not ignored the large data set Data mining is an interdisciplinary field in Computer Science which extracts information or the hidden patterns from data Association rule mining and frequent item set mining are popular data mining techniques that requires entire data to be in main memory But large datasets does not fit into main memory To handle this drawback Hadoop MapReduce approach is used which has scalability and robustness features to handle large datasets Apriori Eclat and FP Growth are well known Frequent Itemset Mining algorithms These algorithms 
are revised to work with Big Data using Hadoop MapReduce But MapReduce framework has problems such as it stores the intermediate data in local disk So the data needs to be accessed from the local disk which results in high latency problem To address this issue Spark follows a general execution model that helps in in-memory computing and optimization of arbitrary operator graphs so that querying data becomes much faster when compared to the disk based engines like MapReduce Thus the paper focuses on enhancing the performance of Frequent Itemset Mining using Apache Spark architecture and study the performance

discovering unknown patterns in the data sets Mining tasks on large datasets are facilitated using Hadoop MapReduce framework Association-rules have always been considered to be important in various fields like crowd-mining crime\255 detection  recommender-systems and so on Three well-known algorithms to facilitate association-rule generation are Apriori Eclat and FPGrowth There are various attempts that resulted in restructuring of these algorithms in-order to handle scalability and speed with the growing size of data sets Distributed versions are available as well as MapReduce versions are developed Market-Basket Analysis 2 is a process to identify the items that are bought together as a result of which a retail store manager 
can make strategic decisions on marketing plans The term association has become important in various other fields like crowd mining  where it helps in analyzing behavior of the people in social network In medical  to identify association of symptoms to determine a disease and analyze the persistence of the disease region wise and cause of disease based on region and also various precautionary measures can be planned based on the analysis Most common relevance of the market basket analysis is in recommender\255 systems which results in increased profits in e-commerce Numerous work on market-basket analysis has been carried out which satiated the needs of 
the mentioned applicable fields Due to growing data sets the trend now is to use Hadoop for efficient data management and carrying out analytical tasks on the large data  However the problem that needs to be addressed in Hadoop's MapReduce is latency which results due to numerous read and write operations to local storage which is basically Hadoop's Distributed File System Even though resource utilization Map Reduce the read write operation overcomes the latency problem MapReduce Addressing latency will faster market-basket analysis This is good in Hadoop's is a bottleneck Spark faced by Hadoop s automatically result in increase in speed is 65 


One of the downsides of the MapReduce is that it doesn't give a proficient approach to execute calculations that need to perform numerous passes over the same data The wastefulness emerges from the way that under MapReduce operations on information must be performed by a mix of MapReduce's three primary stages map  shuffle and reduce jobs HDFS is organized similar to customary UNIX file system with the exception of that data stockpiling is dispersed over few machines C essential because the process deals with continually growing data sets which are in terabytes or petabytes This speed up can greatly change the take recommender systems e-commerce to highly profitable sector The importance of market-basket analysis in various fields raises the need for efficient algorithms to facilitate the analysis process Hadoop's MapReduce stands as a de facto solution for big data processing But to add more efficiency in terms of speed and scalability further furnishing of the existing frequent itemset mining algorithms is required and one way to achieve this is using Apache's Spark The paper addresses the objectives in three folds First to study the existing algorithms developed to process big data and generate frequent-itemsets Second  to develop the Revamped Market Basket Analysis based on FPGrowth using In-Memory Computation framework that is Apache's Spark Third  to show that Revamped Market Basket Analysis based on FP\255 Growth using Apache Spark framework is faster than MapReduce implementation of frequent itemset mining BigFIM by experimenting with different datasets of varying size and characteristics to explore variation in execution speed and with different support count that affects the number of frequent itemsets to be generated and thereby affects the execution speed II BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK is a method to find itemsets from the transaction database which occur frequently The itemset is said to be frequent if it occurs in minimum number of transactions This minimum number of transaction is indicated by support count If the item set satisfies the support count it is said to be frequent Minimum threshold is set for support count which is called as minimum support for the item set Finding frequent item sets help retail industries in making strategic plans about future trends is not proposed as a substitution to a regular file system but instead as a file system like layer for substantial distributed frameworks to utilize  Hadoop MapReduce is a programming framework which can be utilized for creating applications with requirements to process enormous amount of data MapReduce HADOOP 4 is an Apache Software Foundation scheme that basically provides two components 225 A distributed file system called HDFS Hadoop Distributed File System 225 A framework and API for building and running can also be applied in various other fields like medicine web usage mining bio informatics Once frequent itemsets are identified  association rules can be generated A rule is said to be strong if it satisfies minimum confidence which says If X  Y is a rule then confidence is number of transactions containing X that also contains Y Strong association rules are required to reveal the elements that occur together in the data sets Frequent itemset mining 3 plays a prominent role as a data mining task  It It It It It In Apache Spark A Frequent Itemset Mining B Hadoop MapReduce depends on Hadoop MapReduce and it extends the MapReduce model to proficiently utilize it for more sorts of computations  which incorporates intuitive queries and stream processing The fundamental element of Spark is its in-memory cluster computing that expands the processing speed of an application  66 the map stage  every information unit is changed and allocated a key In the shuftle stage  the information is parceled by key and sent to the reducers At long last in the reduce stage the reducers produce results for every gathering of information that has the same key Spark 5 was presented by Apache Software Foundation for accelerating the Hadoop computational computing software process Spark is not an altered version of Hadoop and is not  generally reliant on Hadoop in light of the fact that it has its own particular cluster management Hadoop is only one of the approaches to execute Spark Spark utilizes Hadoop as a part of two ways one is storage and second is processing Since Spark has its own computation for cluster management  it utilizes Hadoop for storage reason as it were Apache Spark is an exceptionally fast cluster computing technology  intended for quick calculation likewise underpins parallel execution on vast groups Clients indicate a map function that sorts out a key  value pair to produce an arrangement of intermediate key value sets  and a reduce function that deals with consolidation of all intermediate key value pairs with same key The outline is this 225 Map tasks perform a transformation  225 Reduce tasks perform an aggregation A Map Reduce work for the most part parts the data set into independent units which are handled by the map tasks in a totally parallel way The structure sorts the yields of the maps which are then contributed to the reduce tasks Ordinarily both the input and the output of the task are put in a file-system The structure deals with scheduling tasks  observing them and re-executes the failed tasks Ordinarily the compute nodes and the nodes required for storage are same which is MapReduce structure and the Hadoop Distributed File System are running on the same cluster of nodes This setup permits the framework to adequately plan tasks on the cluster where data is now present  bringing about high total transmission capacity over the cluster 


SINGLE NODE CLUSTER shows the general architecture of spark deployed on hadoop in a single node cluster It should be clear that Hadoop's elements are HDFS  Jobtracker Tasktracker Namenode Datanode and Spark's components are Driver which resembles Jobtracker of Hadoop and Executor which resembles Tasktracker Resilient Distributed Datasets RDD 6 is an integral part of Apache Spark which enables in memory computation in Spark's environment RDD is a fault tolerant collection of components which can be worked on parallely There are two approaches to make RDDs First approach is to parallelize existing collection in driver project  or it can be made by making a reference to a dataset in an external storage system  it can also read from HDFS  HBase  or any data source that offers an input in Hadoop required format Spark's utilization of RDD is mainly to accomplish speedier and effective MapReduce tasks Data Sharing is moderate in MapReduce D Related Work Fig 1 General Architecture of Spark Deployed on Hadoop in Single Node Cluster Finding association rules 7 from substantial database is one of the issues in Knowledge Discovery in Database Size and intricacy of Big Data are difficulties for fmding association rules and frequent itemset mining The entire database scan is essential in FIM it may make challenge when datasets size is scaling i.e there is persistent expansion in the data size  as extensive datasets does not fit into memory To handle this limitation  Hadoop MapReduce approach which is a de facto standard that provides scalability and robustness features to handle large datasets Apriori  Eclat and FP Growth are well known Frequent Itemset Mining algorithms Several attempts were made to improve these iterative algorithms using Hadoop MapReduce in order to enhance the performance of the algorithm in terms of scalability and speed Parallel FP Growth MRApriori  BigFIM  ClustBigFIM are some of the previous works in Hadoop MapReduce format Apriori algorithm has a disadvantage that it scans transaction every time the support count has to be updated Eclat algorithm works to overcome this problem It uses TID based scan for support count update and it is thus faster than Apriori But it involves too many join operations FP growth overcomes the problems in Apriori and Eclat algorithms as it does not involve candidate generation and scans transaction only twice MapReduce framework has problems such as it stores the intermediate data in local disk So the data needs to be accessed from the local disk which results in high latency problem Thus Revamped Market-Basket Analysis based on FPGrowth attacks the latency problem in Hadoop with it's in memory computation using spark Change of Apriori on MapReduce has been proposed by Lin et al 8 Single Pass Counting SPC  Fixed Passes Combined Counting FPC and Dynamic Passes Counting DPC which do counting step parallel by conveying distributed dataset to mappers Li et al 9 has proposed parallel variant of Apriori based algorithm with respect to MapReduce Apriori based algorithm does not work with respect to extensive datasets having long continuous itemsets Hammoud has proposed MRApriori 10 approach for fmding frequent itemsets by exchanging amongst vertical and horizontal format iteratively which takes out need of repeated scanning of data It rehashes checking for other intermediate data which decreases with iterations MREclat 11 is an altered Eclat algorithm on MapReduce system which creates a list of frequent itemsets  the list is divided into equivalence classes then for every class frequent itemsets are processed utilizing MapReduce structure Parallel FP-Growth PFP 12 used for mining tag itemsets generated web page itemsets  and requires two scans on database By utilizing MapReduce structure and its fault tolerant component  errand of mining huge scale data is changed over into other little assignments which are not subject to each other It achieved scalability and direct speedup over shared memory parallel FP algorithms Gathering methodology of PFP has issues with memory and speed to adjust the gatherings of PFP Zhou et al 13 has proposed algorithm for quicker execution utilizing single items which is likewise not a productive way Xia et al 14 has provided Improved PFP algorithm for mining frequent itemsets from huge little files datasets utilizing small files handling system Moens et a1 15 has proposed two techniques for frequent itemset mining for Big Data using MapReduce First strategy Dist-Eclat is distributed form of pure Eclat strategy which advances speed by appropriating the search space equitably among mappers Second strategy BigFIM utilizes both Apriori based strategy and Eclat with anticipated databases that fit in memory for generating frequent itemsets Riondato et a1 16 work was PARMA algorithm which discovers accumulations of frequent itemsets in brief time utilizing sampling technique  Mined frequent itemsets are inexact but appropriate  It finds samples using k-means clustering calculation and the samples are called clusters Malek and Kadima 17 proposed a novel methodology which utilizes clustering strategy for mining of frequent item sets utilizing MapReduce system with expansion as a part of execution 67 l Fig
