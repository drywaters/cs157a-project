Hence, this paper introduces a top-down algorithm in frequent neighboring class sets mining, denoted by TDA, which is suitable for long frequent neighboring class

Here, identify of different class in spatial data set is denoted by Class Identify, identify of different object instance in the same class is denoted by Object Identify, location coordinate of object is denoted by Spatial Location. We regard an object as an instance of corresponding class, and so spatial data set is made up of these instances of spatial Class Identify. Sets of Class Identify are thought as a class set, denoted by C = {C 1 C 2 C m means there are m different classes 
A  Definition and Property Definition 1 Neighboring Class Set, it is a subset of spatial class set in spatial data set, which is expressed as {C t1 C t2  C tk t k m\, denoted by NCS Let I = {i t1 i t2  i tk be an instance of neighboring class set denoted by NCS={C t1 C t2  C tk here, i tj is an instance of C tj j 1, 2, É, k Example, let {V, X, Y, Z} be a NCS, and I = {V 4 X

The course of turning used by the algorithm is expressed as follows Step1, Firstly, we define the order of class as C = {C 1 C 2  C j C m Here j is defined as bit sequence, and so each class existing in right instance has bit sequence denoted by BS j  Step2, and then, we use an exponent to denote every class if bit sequence of this class is denoted by BS j and then this exponent is equal to 1 2  j BS  Step3, we will gain a digit by computing this value, denoted by    L j BS j 1 1 2 here L is equal to Neighboring Class Set Length and namely, it is the sum of class existing in this neighboring class set According to this method, the algorithm will gain a digit by scanning every right instance and this digit also denote this corresponding NCS of right instance Now we save these digits by this data structure expressed as follows Structure neighboring class set Int Digit; // saving digit expressed as NCS of right instance Int Count; // saving the sum of same digit expressed as NCS} NCS Example, here class set is expressed as C = {V, W, X, Y Z}, the first three right instances are express as I 1 W 2 X 4  Y 3 Z 1 I 2 V 1 W 5 Y 2 I 3 W 3 X 5 Y 4 Z 2  Now we use the previous introductive method to create digital NCS database, this course is expressed as follows NCS of I 1 is expressed as {W, X, Y, Z}, and the bit sequence is expressed as {2, 3, 4, 5}, and then digit = 2 2-1  2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 30, NCS [0 i gi t =30 N C S 0  C o unt 1  NCS of I 2 is expressed as {V, W, Y}, and the bit sequence is expressed as {1, 2, 4}, and then digit = 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 4-1  11, NCS Di gi t  1 1  N C S 1  C o unt 1  NCS of I 3 is expressed as {W, X, Y, Z}, and the bit sequence is expressed as {2, 3, 4, 5}, and then digit = 2 2-1  2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 30, because NCS [0  h a s a l r ead y  sa ve d this information, and only NCS[0 C o u n t=NCS  0   Co u n t 1=2 B  The method of generating candidate frequent NCS The algorithm generates candidate frequent neighboring class set according to top-down strategy. Namely, it uses digit logical operation to generate k-candidate frequent itemsets of digit form by \(k+1\digit non-frequent itemsets. The algorithm adopts search strategy which is similar to B_UDMA  as in [7  and ITDASN as in [8 h e co ur s e  o f  ge ner at i ng i s  e x p r e s s e d as follows Suppose here are three non-frequent neighboring class sets and two frequent neighboring class sets, their length are all equal to 4, and they may generate some candidate frequent neighboring class set, their length ought to be 3 Non-frequent neighboring class set 1\NCS 1 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 5-1 23 2\NCS 2 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 15 3\NCS 3 2 1-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 29 Frequent neighboring class set 1\S 1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 30 2\S 2 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 27 Generating candidate frequent neighboring class set No. 1 NFNCS 1 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 5-1 23, these subsets of non-frequent itemsets are expressed as follows C 1 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 7 C  2 1-1 2 2-1 2 5-1 19, which is deleted by FNCS 2  C 2 2 1-1 2 3-1 2 5-1 21 C  2 2-1 2 3-1 2 5-1 22, which is deleted by FNCS 1  No. 2 NFNCS 2 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 15, these subsets of non-frequent itemsets are expressed as follows C  2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 7. \(Duplication C  2 1-1 2 2-1 2 4-1 11, which is deleted by FNCS 2  C 3 2 1-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 13

The process is expressed as follows Suppose class set is expressed as C = {U, V, X, Y, Z there are 5 neighboring class sets as follows NCS 1 U, X, Y, Z NCS 2 V, X, Z NCS 3 U, V, X, Y, Z NCS 4 V, X, Y, Z NCS 5 X, Y, Z Their digits denoting neighboring class set of right instance are expressed as {29, 22, 31, 30 and 28}. Suppose a candidate is 20 which is denoted by C-NCS = {X, Z}, and then 29&20 20, 22&20=20, 31&20=20, 30&20=20, 28&20=20. Because of this, we write 5 to support \(C-NCS D  The process of mining frequen t neighboring class set Input 1\patial class set is denoted by C = {C 1 C 2  C m  2\ Instance set is denoted by I = {i 1 i 2  i n  3\The minimal distance is denoted by d 4\The minimal support is denoted by s Output: Frequent neighboring class set Step1: Firstly, the algorithm computes the entire right instances denoted by Iê from instance set in spatial database as I by the minimal distance as d Step2: And then, forming neighboring class set database as NCS after scanning once right instance set as Iê via the introductory method in chapter A of III Step3: Using top-down strategy to generate candidate frequent NCS according to this chapter B of III. Namely, if a kcandidate is frequent neighboring class set, and it is written to FNCS which saves frequent neighboring class set, otherwise the algorithm will compute \(k-1\subset of k-candidate, and then continue to search frequent neighboring class set Step4: Output FNCS according to chapter A of III IV  T HE A NALYSIS AND C OMPARING OF C APABILITY  At present, there are very little documents of research frequent neighboring class set. Here we compare MFNCS as with TDA which is introduced by this paper as follows A  The Analysis of Capability MFNCS: this algorithm uses idea of Apriori to find frequent neighboring class set, which is made of three stages firstly, computing all the frequent 1-NCS, secondly, generating all the 2-NCS by range query, and generating all the k-NCS k>2\by iteration. The algorithm has some repeated computing and superfluous candidate frequent neighboring class set which gains some right instance of \(k+1\-neighboring class set only through connecting right instance of k-neighboring class set. As this algorithm adopts down-top strategy to generate candidate frequent neighboring class set, it is only suitable for mining short frequent neighboring class set TDA: this algorithm adopts top-down strategy to generate candidate frequent neighboring class set, which is made of three stages, firstly, computing the 1 st m-candidate frequent neighboring class set which contains all classes, and then generating \(m-1\-candidate frequent neighboring class set, let m-1\ be k, and generating all \(k-1\-frequent neighboring class set \(k>3\ by iteration. But the algorithm is only suitable for mining long frequent neighboring class set for top-down strategy B  The comparing of experimental result Now we use experiment to testify above analyses and comparison. Two mining algorithms are used to generate frequent neighboring class set from 12267 right instances whose class sets are expressed as digit from 3 to 8191 neighboring class set does not include any simple class, namely it has two classes at least, the number of spatial class set is denoted by m=13, the number of right instance included by these neighboring class set observe the discipline which is expressed as follows NCS of digit denoted by 8191 has one right instance NCS of digit denoted by 8190 has two right instances NCS of digit denoted by 8189 has one right instance NCS of digit denoted by 8188 has two right instances  Our experimental circumstances are expressed as follow Intel\(R\ Celeron\(R\ M CPU 420 1.60 GHz, 1.24G, language of the procedure is Visual C# 2005.NET, OS is Windows XP Professional The experimental result of two algorithms is expressed as Fig.1, where support is absolute. The runtime of two algorithms is expressed as Fig.2 as support and length of neighboring class set change

VII S UMMARY We have shown how robustness under subsampling for common classes of itemsets can be computed efìciently without actually sampling the data The experimental results show that the number of reported itemsets can be largely reduced on many datasets in other words spurious itemsets that would not have been found in many subsets of the data are removed The approach can further be used to rank itemsets for topk mining by robustness Future work will investigate the effect of using robust itemsets on data mining tasks such as clustering classiìcation and rule generation using itemsets A CKNOWLEDGMENTS Nikolaj Tatti is supported by Post-Doctoral Fellowships of the Research FoundationÑFlanders  FWO  R EFERENCES  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A N Sw ami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases in SIGMOD  1993 pp 207Ö216  J Hipp U G¸ntzer  and G Nakhaeizadeh  Algorithms for association rule mining a general survey and comparison SIGKDD Explorations  vol 2 no 1 pp 58Ö64 2000  K W ang C Xu and B Liu Clustering transactions using large items in CIKM  1999 pp 483Ö490  H Cheng X Y an J Han and C Hsu Discriminati v e frequent pattern analysis for effective classiìcation in ICDE  2007 pp 716Ö725  F  Moerchen M Thies and A Ultsch Ef cient mining of all margin-closed itemsets with applications in temporal knowledge discovery and classiìcation by compression KAIS  2010  K Smets and J Vreek en The odd one out Identifying and characterising anomalies in SDM  2011  N P asquier  Y  Bastide R T aouil and L Lakhal Disco v er ing frequent closed itemsets for association rules in ICDT  1999 pp 398Ö416  J Pei J Han and L V  S Lakshmanan Mining frequent itemsets with convertible constraints in ICDE  2001 pp 433Ö442  T  Calders C Rigotti and J.-F  Boulicaut  A surv e y on condensed representations for frequent sets in ConstraintBased Mining and Inductive Databases  2006 pp 64Ö80  S Brin R Motw ani and C Silv erstein Be yond mark et baskets Generalizing association rules to correlations in SIGMOD  1997 pp 265Ö276  N T atti Maximum entrop y based signiìcance of itemsets  KAIS  vol 17 no 1 pp 57Ö77 2008  F  Geerts B Goethals and T  Mielik‰inen T iling databases  in Proc Discovery Science  2004 pp 278Ö289  J.-F  Boulicaut A Byk o wski and C Rigotti Free-sets A condensed representation of boolean data for the approximation of frequency queries DMKD  vol 7 no 1 pp 5Ö22 2003  T  Calders and B Goethals Non-deri v a ble itemset mining  DMKD  vol 14 no 1 pp 171Ö206 2007  T  Mielik‰inen T ransaction databases frequent itemsets and their condensed representations in KDID  2005 pp 139 164  D Xin J Han X Y an and H Cheng Mining compressed frequent-pattern sets in VLDB  2005 pp 709Ö720  A Gallo T  De Bie and N Cristianini Mini Mining informative non-redundant itemsets in ECMLPKDD  2007 pp 438Ö445  G I W ebb Disco v ering signiìcant patterns  Mach Learn  vol 68 no 1 pp 1Ö33 2007  R Gupta G F ang B Field M Steinbach and V  K umar  Quantitative evaluation of approximate frequent pattern mining algorithms in KDD  2008 pp 301Ö309  T  Calders B Goethals and M Mampae y  Mining itemsets in the presence of missing values in SAC  2007 pp 404 408  T  Uno and H Arimura  An ef cient polynomial delay algorithm for pseudo frequent itemset mining in Discovery Science  Springer 2007 pp 219Ö230  C Luccese S Orlando and G Pere go R.Casas-Garriga Mining top-k patterns from binary datasets in presence of noise in ICDM  2010  H Cheng P  S Y u and J Han A C-Close Ef ciently mining approximate closed itemsets by core pattern recovery in ICDM  IEEE 2006 pp 839Ö844  J.-F  Boulicaut A Byk o wski and C Rigotti  Approximation of frequency queries by means of free-sets in PKDD  2000 pp 75Ö85  B Goethals and M Zaki FIMI 03 frequent itemset mining implementations in ICDM 2003 Workshop FIMI  2003  A Asuncion and D Ne wman UCI machine learning repository 2007 A v ailable http://www ics.uci edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html  F  Coenen The LUCS-KDD discretised/normalised ARM and CARM data library 2003 A v ailable http www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frans/KDD/Software/LUCS_KDD_DN  Y  Zhao and G Karypis Ev aluation of hierarchical clustering algorithms for document datasets in CIKM  2002 pp 515 524  B Bringmann and A Zimmermann One in a million picking the right patterns KAIS  vol 18 no 1 pp 61Ö81 2009  J Vreek en M v an Leeuwen and A Siebes Krimp mining itemsets that compress DMKD  vol 23 no 1 pp 169Ö214 2011

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
