the 5E 5 essentials framework can yield high performance in real-time data mining over the Internet The verification tests for the 5E were based mainly on the mining of association rules from very large databases The central idea of the 5E is to combine the following five essential elements to work naturally together a Object-based parallelism The goal is to realize the Internet power with object-based parallelism which is the natural outcome when encapsulated objects are running in parallel I b lnter-object interaction pattern There are three basic patterns 2 for cooperating 
objects to interact namely master and slaves iterative process and network processes The interaction pattern for a solution must fit the nature of the problem and a wrong choice would impede both the correctness and the performance of the final system Programming model There three basic programming models namely sequential logically non-distributed where program objects communicate only by shared memory e.g Linda\222s Tuple Space 31 and logically distributed where objects interact by message passing Choosing a wrong programming model for a solution would 
definitely lead to poor system performance as demonstrated in 4 Mobility It applies to both program and data objects It is vital in three aspects i for fault tolerance because objects can migrate to safer locations ii for load balancing because objects can migrate to less busy nodes and iii for distributed data mining when there are more data objects databases in different nodes than the data-mining program objects The third aspect is actually a form of agenda parallelism SI Hardware architecture There are two basic types of 
architectures namely physically distributed where every node in the cluster has its own disjoint primary memory and physically non-distributed where all nodes communicate by shared memory Running logically distributed so&are on physically non distributed hardware would result in poor performance because of the mismatch 4 Many data mining systems are real-time phenomena because they have to meet the following two requirements a the mining results must be correct and reliable and b thc results must be produced within a sufficiently small interval For example data mining of financial data to assist instant on-line investment 
decisions must be completed before the stringent deadlines It means that the data mining process must possess the characteristics of a hard real-time system 6 because missing any deadline may lead to catastrophic consequences. Data mining is a knowledge discovery process in which the targeted acknowledge may be represented in different forms for example association rules 7 and multimedia data SI We restricted our experiments and tests which were performed on the Internet to mining association rules 708 0-7695-0589-2/00 10.00 0 2000 IEEE

2 Motivation and Related Work The motivation of this research is to find a way to support efficient real-time data mining of very large databases over the Internet The methodology is to seamlessly combine the five essential elements to work naturally together object-based parallelism inter-object interaction pattern programming model object and data mobility and hardware architecture The three objectives to be achieved in the project are as follows a Finding the correct pattern for inter-object communications among the collaborating mobile objects in data mining Identifying the parallelization method that effectively supports both the active and passive forms of object based data mining Identifying the strength and limitations of the 5E framework Despite the importance of parallel data mining there is a lack of publications that directly address the issue Recent and relevant publications include  15,16,17,18 which however concentrate mainly on theoretical discussions with little empirical proof The literature for the five essential elements are however abundant because of their relative maturity The lack of a comprehensive methodology to exploit the synergy by the five elements over the Internet for real-time data mining of very large databases has motivated the present work b c 3 Details of Our Research The 5E research is divided into five phases as follows a Identify the suitable model for inter-object communications in data mining b Identify a suitable parallelization method to support the two forms active and passive of object-based data mining Find a stable tool to generate the very large databases necessary for the mining of association rules in the verification tests and experiments Choose a stable distributed programming system to generate the logically-distributed object-based test programs e Choose a stable platform that can support object mobility over physically-distributed hardware Since the distributed computing paradigm is shifting from cluster based to Internet web based we followed the trend by choosing an Internet/Java based distributed platform for the 5E tests and experiments In our previous work 2 three basic communication models for inter-object interactions were identified master and slaves iterative stages and process network We had also proved that a each of these models is in fact natural c d to a specific class of problems and b choosing the right inter-object communication model is the first imperative step in the formulation of correct parallel data-mining algorithms 3 I An Effective Parallelization Method The objective of a parallelization method is to eliminate the VO time needed for managing the overlay structure when a large database is too large to be completely encoded into the primary memory in a standalone system  191 The elimination is achieved by partitioning a large database into smaller blocks so that each of them can be encoded completely in the primary memories of different machines It is clear from this perspective that the parallelization process for distributed data mining is inherently data oriented and the SPMD single program multiple data 20 method \(Figure 3 is a natural choice In the SPMD approach the data mining program object A in Figure 3 is duplicated A\222s and the very large database  C is partitioned into smaller blocks C\222s for distribution to different nodes for encoding into the local primary memories B\222s Matching the SPMD method with a correct inter-object interaction model is of paramount importance for yielding high performance in parallel data mining  A  mining process B=encoded database C=large database 1 parallel unl  A\222tB+C\222 I Figure 3 Parallelization by SPMD  database partitioned and distributed but the 223miner\224 Apriori in this case\are duplicated and distributed 7 10 


3.2 A Stable Environment for Verification The environment for the tests and data collection consists of the following stable elements Apriori parallelization The stable Apriori algorithm 9 was parallelized for the Verification tests involving mining association rules from large databases In this case the parallelization is achieved by duplicating the Apriori algorithm The duplicates are then allocated to different nodes for parallel execution Aglets platform The Java-based IBM Aglets platform I21 was adopted for the parallel data mining tests over the Internet because it supports mobile agents with known stability IBM synthetic data generation code 211 The large data bases necessary for the mining experiments were generated automatically by this stable package In these experiments a large database was partitioned into smaller blocks by the SPDM concept so that each data block could be allocated to an Internet node for independent mining by the Apriori duplicate Since every participating node had an Apriori duplicate and an allocated partitioned data block the number of cooperating nodes was equal to the number of partitioned data blocks One of the participating nodes acted as the master and coordinated the slave nodes by barrier synchronization which is natural for level-based mining strategies such as the Apriori The Apriori duplicates were implemented as mobile agents nglefs in this case to run on the Aglets platform These mobile agents differ from other iitzits of parallelisni in the traditional distributed programming environments \(e.g PVM and p4 The traditional units of parallelism must be preinstalled in the predetermined nodes and locations before they can be invoked by various means that can incur high communication costs e.g. RPC remote procedure call TCP/IP programming or Java RMI remote invocation The use of mobile agents however, obviates the need of preinstallation and the result is that inter-object communications can be optimized The behaviour by the aglets includes creation cloning dispatching retraction deactivation disposal and message retransniissioti 3.3 Establishing the Reference for Comparison In order to study and to empirically evaluate the performance of the 5E framework for data mining over the Internet we needed to establish a reference so that comparisons can be made between this reference and the test results from the 5E verification exercises The reference establishment task involved a Identifying three different decoding methods for the bit-encoding scheme  191 Incorporating these methods separately into original Apriori to create three different modified versions of the Apriori Running these three different sequential versions and compare their results to identify the fastest version among them Adopting the fastest version identified in step c above as the basis for the SPDM parallelization and also as the reference for comparison with the 5E test data The test results from steps c and d would be compared so that the efficacy of the 5E framework can be verified The modification of the sequential Apriori is achieved by embedding the chosen decoding mechanism, shown as highlighted program statements in Figure 4 The ultimate aim of encoding is to represent the whole database in thc primary memory so that in the subsequent data mining operations no accesses to the original database would be necessary In reality it would be impossible to encode a very large database into the primary memory without an overlay structure It means that occasional accesses are still necessary no matter how effective the encoding method is and how efficient the access method would be Parallelization is a solution for the elimination of such overlay structures because a large database is partitioned 1 L,=[frequent-l itemsets  encode whole-db 2 For\(k=2 Lk  3 Ck=apriori-gen\(Lk 4 For\(m=O m<no-trans-in-encoded-db;m 5 decode-trans-m-for-level-k encoded-db 6 count-itemsets-for-Ck trans-m 7 Lk=[itemsets-for-Ck 2MinsupI  8 Find-association-rules-for-large-itemsets Lk Figure 4 Modified sequential Apriori algorithm modifications highlighted Bitpawer 2O 2l 2a l3 Figure 5 Every item in a transaction is represented by its 2 value X is a bit's position 711 


into blocks that are small enough to be encoded completely in the receivers primary memories for parallel acceses 3.3.1 Encoding and Decoding In the bit-encoding scheme all the items in a transaction are represented by their unique bit positions in a vector That is the whole database will be encoded into a two dimensional matrix illustrated in Figure 5 Every vector in the matrix is uniquely represented by its encoded value V C2 where X is the unique bit position of a specific item For example the Is transaction in Figure 5 is represented by its encoded value of 14 that is 2  2 23  14 For the above bit-encoding scheme we have chosen three possible decoding schemes as follows a Basic decoding For this method the following logic is executed repeatedly until i which initialized to the encoded value V is reduced 0 if\(i 22 then  i=i-zX X'h-item\(position  TRUE x=x-1 else X=X I In this case the encoded value of 14 in Figure 5 would represent the TRUE states for items in the 2 2 and 2x=3 positions of the first transaction The encoded transaction would be scanned bit by bit starting from the most significant bit Binary decoding This method is based on the basic decoding approach above except that the first step is to find the most significant TRUE position for X by binary search The aim is to slash the scanning time of the basic decoding approach by half Logarithmic decoding In this method which saves decoding time by eliminating the entire data scanning process the following logic is executed repeatedly until i initialized to the encoded value V is reduced to 0 integer\(l~g~\(i  TRUE The infeger\(/og,\(i operation converts logZ\(i into an integer by truncating whatever after the decimal point For example it yields the integer values of 3 2 and 1 from the encoded value of V  14 successively The main difference among these three methods is the time required for data scanning in the decoding process The logarithmic decoding method requires no data scanning at all and therefore should be the most efficient The database for the encoding/decoding experiments was generated by the IBM synthetic data generation package with the following specifications a number of transactions  100,000 IOOK b average number of items per transaction  10 c total number of possible items  1000 NlOOO and d number of possible b c i  i  2 1nrrgrrllog2\(1 transaction patterns  1000 In the test results illustrated in Figure 6 I marks the basic decoding method 2'Id marks the binary decoding method 31d marks the logarithmic method and Apriori marks the original Apriori By comparing the four curves it is obvious that logarithmic decoding has yielded the best performance in Figure 6 Performance difference among four decoding methods DlOOK.N200 mining the association rules from the same large database 3.4 Parallelization with Logarithmic Decoding The fastest logarithmic decoding method was adopted for the SE verification tests based on mining of association rules from very large databases.

unstable confidence rules the error in confidence on the qth block is 16.8 on average while the error in confidence for stable confidence rules is only 3.5 The errors with the insurance data are smaller because this dataset is large and thus the variance is small Note that the MSE and MAE values are not computed for trend rules as it is not reasonable to use the mean confidence as the predicted confidence in the next time period due to the trend Our trend test is mainly to give the user an indication that trends exist rather than predict the confidence of the rule in the future for which we need a larger sample \(large q and further statistical analysis Table 5 gives the corresponding results on the analysis of supports From column 2 and 3 we see that almost all stable support rules are still stable A large majority of semi-stable support rules are also still semi-stable column 4 Column 5 shows that most trend rules still exhibit trends From column 6-11 we observe that the stable support rules commit least error The results from both Table 4 and 5 confirm that stable rules and trend rules identified by our technique are indeed reliable and can be trusted in the future 6 Conclusions Association mining is an important data mining task Its application is however hampered by the fact that it often generates a large number of rules In this paper we argue that the large number of rules is only part of the problem Lack of systematic analysis procedures to help the user understand the behavior of rules is also a major issue Without understanding the behavior of a rule over time the rule cannot be used in practice This paper presented a number of statistical tests to analyze the behavior of rules Using these tests we are able to identify stable rules and trend rules and at the same time remove those unreliable unstable rules Experiment results showed that the proposed technique is very effective and efficient References Aggarwal C and Yu P 223Online generation of association rules.\223 ICDE-98,402-4 1 1 Agrawal R and Psaila G 223Active data mining.\224 Agrawal R and Srikant R 223Fast algorithms for mining association rules.\224 VLDB-94 1994 Bayardo R and Agrawal R 223Mining the most interesting rules\223 KDD-99 1999 Dong G and J Li 223Efficient mining of emerging patterns discovering trends and differences.\224 KDD 99 1999 Ganti V Gehrke J and Ramakrishnan R 223A framework for measuring changes in data characteristics\224 POPS-99 Ganti V Gehrke J and Ramakrishnan R KDD-95 1995 223DEMON Mining and Monitoring Evolving Data.\224 ICDE-2000 8 Hamilton L C Modern data analysis a first course in applied statistics Brooks/Cole, 1990 9 Han J and Fu Y 223Discovery of multiple-level association rules from large databases.\224 VLDB-95 lo Hilderman R and Hamilton H 223Principles for Mining Summaries Using Objective Measures of Interestingness.\223 ICTAI-00 2000  111 Hogg R  Craig A Introduction to mathematical statistics Macmillan Publishing 1970 12 Klemetinen M Mannila H Ronkainen P Toivonen H and Verkamo A.I 223Finding interesting rules from large sets of discovered association rules.\224 CIKM-94 1994  Liu B Hu M and Hsu W 223Multi-level organization and summarization of the discovered rules.\224 KDD-2000 14 Liu B Hsu W and Ma Y 223Pruning and summarizing the discovered associations.\224 KDD-99 15 Liu B Hsu W Mun L and Lee H 223Finding interesting patterns using user expectations.\224 IEEE Trans on Knowl  Data Eng vol 11\(6\1999  Liu H Lu H., Feng F and Hussain F 223Efficient search of reliable exceptions.\224 PA KDD-99 1999  Mann P S Introductory statistics John Wiley  Sons 1998  Megiddo M and Srikant R 223Discovering predictive association rules.\224 KDD-98 1998 19 Merz C J and Murphy P UCI repository of machine learning databases 1996 http://www.cs.uci.edu/-mlearn/MLRepository.htd 20 Ng R Lakshmanan L Han J 223Exploratory mining and pruning optimizations of constrained association rules.\224 SIGMOD-98 1998  Padmanabhan B and Tuzhilin A 223A belief driven method for discovering unexpected patterns.\224 22 Piatesky-Shapiro G and Matheus C 223The interestingness of deviations.\224 KDD-94 1994  Silberschatz A and Tuzhilin A 223What makes patterns interesting in knowledge discovery systems.\224 IEEE Trans on Know and Data Eng 24 Suzuki E 223Autonomous discovery of reliable exception rules.\224 KDD-97 1997 25 Tan P-N. and Kumar V 223Interestingness measures for association patterns a perspective.\224 KDD-2000 Workshop on Post-processing in Machine Learning and Data Mining 2000  Walpole R  Myers R Probability and statistics for engineers and scientists Prentice Hall 1993  Zaki M 223Generating non-redundant association rules.\224 KDD-2000 2000 28 Zhong N Ohshima M  Ohsuga S 223Peculiarity Oriented Mining and Its Application for Knowledge Discovery in Amino-acid Data.\224 PA KDD-2001 KDD-98 1998 8\(6\1996 pp 970-974 3 84

The MOC is shown below in Figure 10. This software is hosted on Sun workstations running the Solaris operating system. The most recent missions are OV-3 and GALEX. Both programs are running smoothly and operating as planned. ACRIMSAT has recently converted over to using the MAESTRO system for operations as well. USN is supporting the GALEX mission, including X-band pass services at Hawaii and Australia. Glory will follow this proven path. USN has also supported most of Orbital’s geo-synchronous satellite launches and on orbit checkouts    Figure 10 – Orbital’s Mission Operations Center  6  S UMMARY   In the case of the Glory program, it is concluded that reuse of many components from the VCL program not only significantly reduces the cost of the Glory mission but helps to make something of what could be shelved for an indeterminate amount of time.  By employing existing resources and knowledge from a program that was very mature, the Glory program is doing its part to contribute to cost saving measures and maximizing benefit to NASA. The Glory program provides savings of nearly $15M over a ground-up bus design effort, while mitigating significant risk on the bus portion of the mission  Glory is an ideal mission for ear th sciences in the realm of climate change research. It draws from significant flight heritage elements in both th e instruments and the spacecraft bus. It uses an existing NASA asset with minor refurbishment to save significant development costs. It uses a LV that has flown several NASA and DOD missions to date. The ground system employs flight proven hardware and software with a robust plan for backup coverage   7  R EFERENCES   NASA Facts Aerosols June 1999   NASA Godda rd Space Flight Center Glory Program Science and Mission Requirements Document  Greenbelt, Maryland, February 2, 2004  8  B IOGRAPHIES   Darcie A.
