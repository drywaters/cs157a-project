formed distributed system consisting of individual sensing nodes which can be orbital or terrestrial in situ or remote sessile or mobile and which have the ability to communicate and exchange information Sensor Webs have been demonstrated successfully in variety of environmental sensing applications including oxygen gas sensing 1 and soil moisture sensing 2 These demonstrations have also shown how the collected information can control external systems such as sprinklers how it can handle spatio-temporal sensing and how it can increase the robustness of the sensing network Our work takes 
Sensor Webs into a new phase by making them intelligent collaborative and self-aware The intelligence is added to each sensor and allows the Sensor Web to be truly adaptive to the events in the environment it senses The Sensor Web becomes a multi-agent system  1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 25102008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper 1295 Version 4 Updated December 6 2007 where individual sensor agents can collaborate form dynamic coalitions to handle tasks that a single sensor cannot and can negotiate in order to 
form the best set of coalitions that maximize the overall utlility of the Sensor Web Each sensor identifies tasks that it cannot perform and then uses the Contract Net protocol to ask other agents to assist it We applied our approach to some of the Earth Observing 1 EO-1 instruments and have shown that the agents can correctly form a Sensor Web that will satisfy the dynamically generated sensing and processing needs 2 SENSOR AGENT ARCHITECTURE Each sensor hosts an intelligent agent that adds to the sensor autonomous decision making The sensor 
agent3 consists of two basic components as shown in Figure 1 the Reasoning Component and the Communication Component The Communication component is responsible for receiving messages from and delivering messages to the other sensor agents in the Sensor Web The Reasoning component consists of four sub-components The event monitor snoops the data collected by the sensor and if it identifies interesting events it informs the Reasoning component While the event monitor reacts to events the task generator uses these events to 
predict future sensing requirements needs and parameters The Reasoning component decides whether the sensor can satisfy on its own the new sensing needs arising from the event by checking its own state represented by the agent state sub-component or whether it will require the assistance of other sensors In the latter case the agent generates task requests through its task component and contacts other agents that it believes can assist it These other agents will choose to respond to this request and if they 
respond they will do so through a bid The bid evaluator sub-component examines the bid and if satisfactory it awards the task to some other sensor agent After the task request bidding bid evaluation and task assignment phases the coalition of sensors is finalized and then the newly created Sensor Web proceeds with its sensing tasks Since the task scheduler allows the Sensor In this paper we will use agent and sensor agent interchangeably to indicate the intelligent agent associated with a specific sensor or sensors 1 


M capable agents 11 Web to schedule future tasks the sensing coalition may change over time since different sensors may exit and enter it as the sensing tasks and requirements change over time Sensor Agent Model and a variety of message protocols RDF was created in 1999 as a standard on top of the Extensible Markup Language XML for encoding metadata for the semantic web 6 The 2004 updated RDF standard moved beyond that and allows the encoding of ontological information about things in the world and their relationships between them 5 The RDF standard is supported by the World Wide Web Consortium W3C 7 task 42  A Ini ializatlon 5 Request fr bid 7 Contract awad K XU Match Maker AgenBt b3 Rd 63 Bid Ae Figure 1 Architecture of a sensor agent 3 SENSOR AGENT OPERATIONS The operations of our sensor agents are summarized in Figure 2 A sensor is initialized by its sensor description represented in SensorML 3 SensorML is a standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium that provides a description of sensor systems This description allows an agent to be aware of is own capabilities As the sensor senses the environment its event monitors may identify an event or set of data that necessitate additional sensing and processing tasks that cannot be performed by the sensor The sensor agent will attempt to identify the sensors that can perform these tasks by contacting a Matchmaker The Matchmaker provides the sensor agent with the names and contacts of the sensors it believes can perform the necessary tasks Next the sensor agent composes bid requests for these sensor agents and asks them to bid for the tasks When bids are submitted it evaluates them and then it awards the sensing or processing contract to the best suited sensor The process of contract award leads to the formation of a coalition of sensors that can collaborate to perform complex sensing tasks i.e it leads to the formation of a Sensor Web All agent communicative acts follow the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents FIPA and Resource Description Framework RDF standards 4 5 FIPA is an IEEE Computer Society standards organization that promotes agent-based technology and the interoperability of its standards with other technologies 4 FIPA defines among others the message parameters for multi-agent systems including the contents and semantics of a message Figure 2 Operations of a sensor agent Sensor Representation Sensors in our work are represented using a subset of SensorML 3 In our work we chose to represent some of the instruments on EO1 Specifically we represent the Advance Land Imager ALI Hyperion and LEISA/Atmospheric Corrector LAC The sensor representation is simpler than one that is possible through a complete SensorML formalism actually some of these instruments have no complete SensorML description yet and our goal was to represent the basic sensor capabilities so as to allow reasoning For example the Advanced Land Imager ALI sensor of EO-1 is a multispectral imager with a spectral range from 0.4 to 2.4 ptm ALI covers from the visible to the near infrared to the short-wave infrared spectrum and has a resolution of 30 m except for its panchromatic band that has a resolution of 10 m Our representation refers to ALI's sensing capabilities in terms of the bands resolution signal to noise ration etc plus capabilities of the vehicle such as on-board processing and storage Event Monitoring and Generation of Tasks A sensor operates in some standard mode sensing its environment processing the data and sharing some parts of it with users and other sensors At the same time the sensor agent uses event monitors to identify events of interest Events of interest are driven by the satisfaction of a logical condition involving state data4 data-driven events Data4 State data are any data that are associated with the agent or the 2 33 Request for agents wh[o ca Event Mionitoring 0.I X  r Agenit1 43harces ot per frm a 


driven events can be instantaneous and conditioned on the current values of state variables that reflect the current state of the world or continuous for example trends or averages involving those variables Continuous data-driven events require storage of previous value\(s in some form For example an event condition that checks on a running average or a trend would be classified as continuous since prior state information would have to be stored The event monitor is developed as a collection of active conditional elements that match against the state variables of the sensor For example an instantaneous event monitoring rule would be if SOIL-TEMP  1000F then ACTIVATE-AGENT indicating that if the sensed parameter soil temperature is above 100 degrees Fahrenheit the sensor agent should be activated Or if FREE-DISC-SPACE  1000 then ACTIVATE-SPRINKLER Such a rule requires that the event monitor store historical soil temperatures for at least the last 30 minutes The interesting event data are also shared with the task generator The task generator identifies which tasks cannot be satisfied by the sensor and generates task requests The Matchmaker The Matchmaker is a centralized repository of sensor agent capabilities and needs 8 When sensor agents enter the multi-agent Sensor Web environment they advertise their sensing and processing capabilities to the Matchmaker An advertisement example is given below to allow for readability we have stripped the FIPA and RDF tags and we are showing only the messages our program will print out ALI Pan Registering provided services Matchmaker:Agent ALI Pan registered urn:ogc:def:classifier:SpectrumI Visible urn:ogc:def:classifier:intendedApplicationI CloudSensing urn:ogc:def:classifier:intendedApplicationI LandSensing This Matchmaker capabilities registration message comes data it is collecting through its sensor\(s from the ALI Panchromatic sensor and indicates that it can sense in the visible spectrum and can sense clouds and land Capabilities registered with a Matchmaker are always described on a high level There are two reasons for that First detailed capabilities might change over time for example the area sensed by a mobile sensor such as one on a space vehicle Second an agent requesting a capability may be willing to settle for something worse than what it asked for for example it may like imagery with 100 m resolution but anything under 1 km resolution might be acceptable compared to no data If all capabilities were advertised in perfect detail it would become impossible to make compromises between requested and available sensor services In addition to capabilities agents may register requests with the Matchmaker A request indicates that the requesting agent is looking for others that can satisfy its needs by performing the required tasks The following is an example of a registered need Manager Requesting agents with my required services urn:ogc:def:classifier:sensorSpectrumI ACTIVATEAGENT indicating that if the sensor parameter free disc space is less than 1000 units bytes Kbytes etc the sensor agent should be activated Note that state variables can be both internal to the sensor i.e its own state tasks status and external to it e.g sensed data requests by other sensors A continuous event monitoring rule would be if SOIL-TEMP increased by 50 in 30 minutes then SWIR urn:ogc:def:classifier:intendedApplicationI LandSensing This message asks for help from agent\(s who can perform sensing of land using a short-wave infrared sensor When the Matchmaker receives a request for capabilities it looks at the capabilities that agents have registered with it and sends the list of capable agents to the requesting agent Contractingfor Sensing and Processing Tasks Our work is based on the seminal research on Contract Nets described in 9 and 10 In the Contract Net protocol agents request that others submit bids for completing specific tasks and then evaluate these bids to identify the most capable agent Our work adopts this approach and adapts it to the environment of Sensor Webs After one of our sensor agents has generated a task and has received from the Matchmaker a list of agents that could perform it it contacts these agents directly with a request for bids Each bid request consists of a task abstraction and a bid specification The task abstraction is a description of the task in finer level of detail than the one sent to the Matchmaker but still not completely specified since the requesting agent may need to make tradeoffs when it receives the task bids What the task abstraction indicates to the agents receiving the bid request is that if they cannot satisfy at least that requirement they should not bid The bid specification indicates the contents of the response to the bid These are the items the bid requesting agent manager will use to evaluate the submitted bid The 3 


following is an example of a bid request Manager:Sending Instrument meets task abstraction Sending bid Quality signalToNoiseRatio='GOOD Double resolution='30.0 The bid requesting agent receives bids and waits a currently predefined period of time before it starts evaluating them the waiting time is used in lieu of requiring agents to respond with a will not submit a bid message The evaluation is based on the bid specification and the bid submitting agent that meets the required specifications the closest is assigned the task contract The use of a Contract Net protocol for sensor task assignment achieves a number of goals First only sensor agents that can perform the task respond to a bid request limiting the communication overhead of the system Second by advertising general needs the requesting agent can use internal domain-specific evaluation criteria to assign the task to a sub-optimal agent but to one who can still provide a satisfactory solution this allows us to deal with over-constrained task requests that have no optimal solution Third the approach makes optimal use of the sensor network by exchanging the minimum possible number of messages and by assigning a task to the most capable and available sensor Finally the approach responds to a changing environment that requires a dynamic allocation of tasks and which leads to the formation of an adaptive intelligent Sensor Web 4 RELATED WORK Some work has started to add to Sensor Webs the ability to adapt and react to the environment For example Jain et al 11 discuss how the DeSiDeRaTa adaptive resource management strategy could be used by constellations of satellites to dynamically reconfigure their computational load Some other work has looked at changing the configuration of a sensor web using mobile sensors to improve sensing a thermocline 12 The work by Chien et al with the EO1 system showed how to dynamically configure its sensors based on user requests 13,14 There is also a lot of work making proposals of how Sensor Webs could be best used such as the proposal described in 15 Our work differs from these and many other similar efforts We implement a general intelligent adaptive and testable mechanism to form coalitions of pods that can perform sensing tasks Our approach is not specific to some particular sensing task or sensor type Our work is applicable to all Sensor Web tasks since it develops the overall Sensor Web formation methodology and individual components such as the specific event monitors or particular sensor capabilities can be changed for different types of Sensor Webs and sensors Our work touches upon the areas of event monitoring Active database systems provide event alerters triggers that notify applications of interesting data events 16 However an alert mechanism can only let an agent know about relevant changes but it does not support an agent whose information needs change due to changes in an environment as our proposed event monitoring There has been some previous work in using multi-agent systems to control suites of sensors For example Soh et al describe forming coalitions of sensors to track moving vehicles in real time 17,18 Modi et al approach a similar sensor coalition problem from the perspective of distributed resource allocation 19 while Horling et al use the Task Analysis Environmental Modeling and Simulation TAEMS language to quantitatively describe alternate ways a goal can be achieved and consequently allow alternate ways of assembling sensors in a coalition 20,2 1 This and similar work in sensor networks deals with sessile homogeneous sensors which are dedicated to a single sensing task e.g tracking vehicles and where the goal of the multi-agent architecture is to pick the best sensors for the task Our work in Sensor Webs deals with heterogeneous sensors which can be mobile and which must come together into a dynamic coalition to satisfy an a priori unkown dynamically formulated task There is work in multi-agent reconnaissance for example see 22 23 and 24 but this work focuses on task planning task coordination and task precedence and not on forming sensing coalitions of heterogeneous sensing assets Finally there are some proposals for multi-agent reconnaissance for planetary exploration but no concrete system has been deployed 25 5 CONCLUSIONS In this paper we describe how a combination of a Matchmaker and Contract Net architecture allows for the dynamic formation of Sensor Webs In our approach 4 out bid requests task abstraction Integer wavelength='1200 bid specification signal-To-NoiseRatio resolution This example bid request indicates that the bid submitting agent must be able to sense at 1200 nanometer wavelength If an agent is going to submit a bit it must indicate its signal to noise ratio and its resolution at that frequency which means that the bid requester will use these two parameters to evaluate bids before awarding the task to another sensor agent Sensor agents receiving a bid request decide if they can perform the task by looking at the task abstraction and if their requested sensing or processing capabilities are not already allocated If they can respond to a bid request they do so by submitting a bid as the one below which was sent from the Hyperion sensor agent of EO1 Hyperion 


sensors use SensorML to represent their abilities and then register these with a central capability repository the Matchmaker The sensor agents actively monitor the environment and when it is so required they post task needs with the Matchmaker These needs indicate tasks that they cannot complete on their own and for which they need the generation of a Sensor Web After the Matchmaker provides them with the agents who could satisfy these needs the agents use the Contract Net protocol to request and evaluate bids for these tasks Under this protocol agents submit bids for the completion of tasks and the bid requesting agent uses domain-specific criteria to evaluate these bids and then award task contracts thus recruiting agents to the Sensor Web In our work we used the EO-1 sensing instrument ALI Hyperion and LAC as potential sensors and have shown how the overall approach allows for the formation of a Sensor Web Future work will expand the Contract Net protocol by allowing negotiation for the use of limited constrained resources and by allowing sensors to share their resources among many requests by agents We will also compare our approach to the formation of a Sensor Web with other competing ones such as ones based on a Service Oriented Architecture 26 REFERENCES 1 Delin K and S.P Jackson 2000 Sensor Web for in situ Exploration of Gaseous Biosignatures Proc IEEE Aerospace Conference Big Sky MT 465-472 2 Teillet P R Gauthier G Fedosejevs M Maloley A Chichagov and G Ainsley 2003 A Soil Moisture Monitoring Sensorweb Demonstration in the Context of Integrated Earth Sensing Proc of SPIE vol 5151 Earth Observing Systems VIII William L Barnes Ed 63-73 3 Botts M ed 2002 Sensor Model Language SensorML for In-site and Remote Sensors OpenGIS Interoperability Program Report OGC 02-026 v 07 Open GIS Consortium Inc 4 FIPA 2007 Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents www.fipa.org last accessed October 20 2007 5 Lassila 0 and R Swick eds 1999 Resource Description Framework RDF Model and Syntax Specification Recommendation W3C 6 W3C 2007 www.w3.org last accessed October 21 2007 7 XML 2007 www.xml.org last accessed October 21 2007 8 Kuokka D and L Harada 1996 Integrating Information via Matchmaking J of Intelligent Information Systems vol 6 no 2-3 261-279 9 Smith R 1980 The Contract Net Protocol HighLevel Communication and Control in a Distributed Problem Solver IEEE Trans on Computers vol C29,no 12 1104-1113 10 Smith R and R Davis 1981 Frameworks for Cooperation in Distributed Problem Solving IEEE Trans on Systems Man and Cybernetics vol SMC11 no 11 61-70 11 Jain S L Welch D Chelberg Z Tan D Fleeman D Parrott D Pfarr M Liu and C Shuler 2002 Collaborative Problem Solving Agent for On-Board Real-Time Systems Int Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium 12 Zhang B G Suhkatme and A Requicha 2004 Adaptive Sampling for Marine Microorganism Monitoring IEEEIRSJ Int Conf on Intelligent Robotics and Automation 13 Chien S R Sherwood D Tran B Cichy G Rabideau et al 2005 The Autonomous Sciencecraft Embedded Systems Architecture IEEE Int Conf on Systems Man and Cybernetics Hawaii USA 14 Chien S B Cichy A Davies D Tran G Rabideau et al 2005b An Autonomous Earth Observing Sensorweb IEEE Int Conf on Systems Man and Cybernetics Hawaii USA 15 Koratkar A J Grosvenor J Jung and J Geiger 2005 Autonomous Multi-sensor Coordination The Science Goal Monitor Proc of SPIE vol 5659 293-300 16 Hanson E.N and Noronha L.X 1999 Timer-driven Database Triggers and Alerters Semantics and a Challenge SIGMOD Record vol 28 4 11-16 17 Soh L-K C Tsatsoulis and H Sevay 2003 A Satisficing Negotiated and Learning Coalition Formation Architecture in Distributed Sensor Networks A Multiagent Perspective V Lesser C.L Ortiz Jr and M Tambe Eds Boston Kluwer Academic Publishers 109-138 18 Soh L-K and C Tsatsoulis 2005 A Real-Time Negotiation Model and a Multi-Agent Sensor Network Implementation Autonomous Agents and MultiAgent Systems vol 11 no 3 215-271 19 Modi P.J P Scerri W-M Shen and M Tambe 2003 Distributed Resource Allocation in Distributed Sensor Networks A Multiagent Perspective V Lesser C.L Ortiz Jr and M Tambe Eds Boston Kluwer Academic Publishers 219-256 20 Horling B R Mailler J Shen R Vincent and V Lesser 2003 Using Autonomy Organizational Design and Negotiation in a DSN in Distributed Sensor Networks A Multiagent Perspective V Lesser C.L Ortiz Jr and M Tambe Eds Boston Kluwer Academic Publishers 139-184 21 Horling B R Vincent R Mailler  J Shen R Becker K Rawlins and V Lesser 2001 Distributed Sensor Network for Real Time Tracking Proc of the 5th Int Conf on Autonomous Agents Montreal Canada ACM Press 417-424 22 Giovanini L J Balderud and R Katebi 2007 Autonomous and Decentralized Mission Planning for Clusters of UUVs Int J of Control 80:7 11695

This recipe for ontologizing the data is a more detailed explanation of what is shown pictorially in Figure 3 It is important to realize that essentially all that is happening in this process is that the data are being extracted through parsing and then combined with the template ontology to form an encoded output just as the figure shows The steps listed above will be discussed in further detail in the subsequent paragraphs of this section The first step in ontologizing the data was to read the ontology into the Java program In order to perform this and all other actions required to manipulating the ontology the Jena Semantic Web Framework package or Jena was used.5Jena is an open-source Java Framework that serves as a programmatic environment for RDF RDFS OWL and SPARQL while also including a rule-based inference engine ref By reading a template ontology into Jena the user can programmatically create instances populate properties perform queries or perform a myriad of other tasks on the ontology Jena served as the backbone of our program With the ontology read in and ready to accept data in Jena we now turn to combining the relevant data with the template ontology to produce the structured output as shown in Figure 3 To this end steps 2 and 3 are essentially the same as steps 4 and 5 with only the source of the information being different For football the parsing of the files was made simpler by the fact that each player and play was given its own line in their respective files and the files were simply ASCII-text written in a format that was consistent from team to team for the rosters and within a play type in the play-to-play files That is each roster was structured in exactly the same way regardless of the team and each unique type of play had the same structure within a game and between games As a result traditional parsing techniques were used to parse the files For the rosters this simply meant that Java tools such as readLine and StringTokenizers were used The play-by-play was understandably much more complex but was parsed with a combination of using regular expressions to match the type of play and then using built in Java functions to perform further sentence examination This same methodology was used in the combat simulation program For structured delimited output tools such as readLine and StringTokenizers were used Conversely for freeform chronological accounts of events regular expressions were used to perform the coarse matching while built-in Java functions were used for the precise extraction of information within a sentence While parsing the play-by-play file or the output files in the simulation domain is quite time consuming to write and difficult to get perfected it is conceptually the easiest at a high level The program simply examines a line determines if it matches a pattern extracts the necessary information and stores it in data structures until it is put into the ontology 7 5 htp.H Jena.sourceforge.nlet As mentioned earlier Jena handled all interactions with the ontology including combining the extracted data with the template ontology We refer to the original ontology as the template ontology because it provides the definition of the structure that holds the data but has not yet been realized with actual instances of the data thereby serving as a template for the associated classes When the combination of actual data with the template structure happens we say we have an output ontology which can then be queried using SPARQL Thus in order to transition from the template ontology to the output ontology we need to create instances of the event classes and fill in their properties Creating an instance of an RDF class in Jena follows the same pattern regardless of the domain First the template of the class is found in the ontology using the getOntClass function This template is then used to create a specific instance of the class using the createlndividual function Now that an individual is created its properties are set by either using the addProperty or setPropertyValue functions depending upon whether the property can have more than one value or not The getProperty and createTypedLiteral functions are typically required to provide the arguments when using either of the property-filling functions This same methodology can literally be used for creating any instance of a RDF function in Jena and serves as the substance to the magic referred to originally in Data Integration Manager of Figure 2 To further clarify the process we will now discuss the specifics of the how the template ontology was transformed into the output ontology for the football example As mentioned in the steps for ontologizing the data above the input files or the rosters of the teams in the case of football were put into the ontology first When the roster file was opened an instance of the Team class was created and the name property populated using the methodology described in the previous paragraph Then the information for each individual player was read one at a time As mentioned previously the Player class was used to represent a player in the ontology As a result an instance of the Player class was created for all the individuals on the roster and the setPropertyValue function of Jena was used to set its properties By repeating this for every player on the roster all the actors in the scenario were put into the ontology Once the definition of an individual Player was completed the Player was added to the team using the addProperty function which was used to allow for multiple Players to be on the same team With the input files completely parsed the event log files were parsed next In both domains the majority of the information came in the form of ASCII-text strings that included the actors the action performed and the context of action For football this information typically included the involved players names the type of play the game situation and the stats about the play such as the yards that were gained As mentioned above regular expressions were 7 


used to match the type of the play and Java functions extracted the specific information However to be useful this information must be matched with the ontology To this end the type of play was translated into a specific subclass of the PlayType class while the context of the play was used to determine the appropriate subclass of the Play class and to fill in the properties of these two classes The names of the players involved in the play were used to find the actual instances of the specified Player in the ontology taken from the roster files By reading the rosters and creating the teams first we can leverage the actors in this way when ontologizing the events of the game This helps protect the validity of the data by ensuring that all references to an individual actor refer to the same entity regardless of how they are referred to in individual events This point is best clarified with an example To use the previous example from the Boise St vs Oklahoma game by referring back to the input files we ensure that all references in the play-by-play to Jared Zabransky Zabranksy number 5 for Boise St or any other tangent reference to a property are referring to the same Player in the ontology Maintaining data integrity in this way goes to the heart of using an ontology which strives to eliminate all reference ambiguity in the data The final step established above for ontologizing the data was to write the data to permanent storage The necessity of performing this step is predicated upon whether a database connection was established in the beginning or not In the early development of both domains we represented the ontology using Jena s memory model which stores the model and its associated triples in memory However given that combat simulations can produce many gigabytes of data with the number ever growing an alternative was required as every time the program was run with the memory model it crashed due to running out of heap space As Figure 2 suggests establishing a database connection quickly became one of the few viable options Towards these ends an Oracle lOg database was used to house the data due to Oracle's commitment in the 10g and the subsequent release of the 1 Ig to store RDF triples uniquely as opposed to performing a conversion to a traditional relational database every time Putting the information into the database had the desired benefit of greatly expanding the constraint on file size Additionally once the database was established optimizations could be performed on the data storage to improve the access speeds of common queries By putting the information in a sufficiently large database parsing becomes a truly one-time expense where it never has to be repeated If a database is used the program no longer has to read in the template ontology at the beginning and then write the output ontology to a file for permanent storage at the end Instead the program can simply establish a connection to the database when started and it then has access to all of the preexisting data including the template ontology 7 ANALYSIS Up to this point we have described in extensive detail the problem definition how the template ontology was created and how the data was extracted and combined with the template ontology to form the structured output We will now examine the methods we used to analyze the data For both domains the major obstacle to performing analysis of significant depth is the massive amount of data associated with the event In order for analysts to answer substantive questions they must be able to efficiently filter the data for the information pertinent to the question at hand To achieve this data filtering we used SPARQL.6 The benefit of SPARQL for our application is that it allows for the easy creation of what we referred to as N-th order queries that filter the data to preciously what we need in accordance with the ontology By N-th order queries we mean a SPARQL query that has multiple layers or orders of filtering that restrict the data This is best seen through an example For illustrative purpose we will again use the Boise St vs Oklahoma game Let's say an analyst was interested in finding out if Boise St had any big pass plays when they were deep in their own territory The occurrence of such plays would speak to Boise St.'s ability to use big plays to change the game as well as to provide some barometer for how conservative their play calling on offense was As such the analyst might develop a SPARQL query that has an equivalent English sentence of Give me all the completed passes thrown by Boise St where they were on their own 25 or less that went for 15 or more yards This particular query is a fifth-order query Explicitly the layers of filtering are 1 completed pass 2 Boise St 3 own side of the field 4 less than 25 yardline and 5 gained 15 or greater yards To answer the posed question such an occurrence occurred twice in the Boise St vs Oklahoma game The first was a 19 yard gain from Jared Zabransky to Legedu Naanee starting at the Boise St 17 at the beginning of the second quarter and the other was a 36 yard completion from Zabransky to Derek Schouman starting at the 22 yardline on the last drive of regulation The ability to perform such N-th order queries is absolutely critical to operations analysis in combat simulations A sample question an operations analyst might ask for in a scenario is Give me all the times a F-22 on a DCA mission was shot and killed at by a specific SAM type within a geographic region bounded by minimum and maximum latitudes and longitudes This is a ninth-order query where the layers are 1 shot fired 2 kill resulted 3 target of F-22 4 attacker of a specific SAM type such as SA-10 5 F-22 mission of DCA 6 shot location greater than minimum latitude 7 shot location less than maximum latitude 8 shot location greater than minimum longitude and 9 shot location less than a maximum longitude Given unstructured nature of the output data from most 8 6htro ii uerV 8  1 11 I_ 


simulations answering such questions previously required extensive datamining that could take at least hours if not days to perform and was highly susceptible to error However a SPARQL query could return the results in tenths of seconds for small data sets and minutes for very large datasets Plus if the parse is well formed and properly debugged there is no chance for errors either returning a false positive or an omission Another tremendous benefit received from the structuring of the data and querying it with SPARQL is the increased ease of debugging the definition of the scenario This is not necessarily a problem in football but it is a significant issue in combat simulation The very large scenarios blessed by the government to represent certain encounters of interest have thousands of platforms each individually created with unique properties As such even a low error rate yields a non-trivial amount of mistakes some of which could profoundly affect results Many man-hours are sunk into validating the details of a scenario such as the networks of the IADS or the command chain of platforms all of which is tedious Several well placed SPARQL queries can help greatly reduce the scenario debugging time and make the debugging less cumbersome in the process One of the lone downsides to employing the abovedescribed methodology for data mining and analysis in the combat simulation domain is the lack of familiarity of most analysts with these techniques While the learning curve is shallow schedule and mindset challenges limit most seasoned analysts ability to learn about Java RDF ontologies and SPARQL To help facilitate the creation of N-th order queries we developed a GUI to wrap around the code in the combat simulation domain The GUI was developed using NetBeans Matisse GUI developer and made creating N-th order queries simply a manner of selecting the desired options on the GUI As a result the analysts did not need to be Java programmers with extensive RDF knowledge in order to use the program Instead they simply needed to have knowledge of the domain which is already a prerequisite for performing the analysis 8 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The combat simulation domain is faced with the problem of having several different tools that represent data that is fundamentally the same in their own unique way The domain requires a method for combining disparate data into a common ontology as well as a way to then mine through the masses of data and filter out only that which is relevant to the current analysis In this paper we proposed a solution to this problem using RDF ontologies to commonly represent the domain and SPARQL queries to filter the results Due to the propriety classified nature of the work however we developed and presented a solution to a similar domain that being analyzing college football College football was chosen due to its similarities to the combat simulation domain which include 1 the output comes from a variety of sources represented in their own unique way but typically from ASCII text chronological log files 2 both domains contain ASCII lists of actors performing actions specific to the domain 3 both domains allow for a limited number of actions yet require tremendous ontological flexible within the actions and actors and 4 both domains require analysts to apply many-order filters to extract the desired in-depth information The bulk of the paper focused on the specifics of how the ontology was created how the ontology was combined with the data and finally the methods used in querying the data To these ends Stanford's Protege was used to create the ontology A Java program was then used to parse the data from input and output files after which the information was combined with the template ontology through the use of the Jena Semantic Web Framework or Jena The data were stored in an Oracle lOg database for permanent storage SPARQL was then used to query the data with a GUI assisting in this process The work yielded some significant conclusions SPARQL provided a simple methodology for creating the N-th order queries required by both domains Furthermore the execution of these queries provided access to data and answers to questions in seconds that required hours or days to get previously This drastic reduction in time and increase in the ease of use could literally transform the modem day combat simulation analyst from a glorified data miner back into an analyst Abstracting away the data mining and post-processing allows the analyst to focus on the forest instead of the type of bark on the trees in the forest Furthermore the unification of several sources into a common ontology allows for the analyst to be an expert in the entire domain not an expert in a specific tool Furthermore the encoding of the output into an ontology helps ensure the validity of the data and provides for additional scenario debugging assistance The validity of the data is augmented by the fact that the ontology eliminates all ambiguity in which entity is being used regardless of how it was referenced as well as any ambiguity in the definition of a certain event The assistance in debugging the scenario comes from the use of SPARQL queries on the input to the scenario such as verifying the members of a network in the IADS or the command chain of the platforms The SPARQL queries help provide quick access to the information and allow it to be displayed in a manner that is less cumbersome to crosscheck This allows for faster debugging of the input scenario

 12 7  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  This research task started with an all-FORTRAN implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm converted it to C code, and developed a number of H W/SW systems on the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA The execution ti me of the all software C implementation of the FTIR spectrometry algorithm was recorded and used for comparison as a base case Two software-based optimizations were applied that reduced the executi on time by more than 4.5x These included modifying the cod e to use all single-precision math library functions no n-ANSI when dealing with single-precision data and utilizi ng the IBM Performance Libraries  Perflib  to improve the speed of all single and double-precision arithmetic The idea of using a DP-only Perflib was introduced and then used in conjunction with the single-precision APU-FPU to fu rther improve system performance The bulk of the research dealt with looking into ha rdwarebased improvements to the FTIR spectrometry system  These included the Xilinx APU-FPU, and a single-pre cision dot-product co-processor The APU-FPU delivered significant speedup for all single-precision floati ng-point operations The dot-product co-processor although ineffective in the FTIR spectrometry system due to poor spatial locality of the data, showed nearly a 2x im provement over the APU-FPU when working with smaller, sequent ially accessed data sets Furthermore it was implemented  as a load/store-based APU-connected FCM thus establishin g a reference for creating similar APU co-processors T he design of a non-system-bused CPU-coupled co-process or is frequently overlooked in design guides yet it is a  very effective way to offload software routines to hardw are implementation The ML410 development board on which all of this w ork was conducted, hosts the V4FX60 hybrid-FPGA contain ing two PPC405 processors This research task focused o n optimizing the performance of the FTIR spectrometry  algorithm on a single PPC405 core, however, the des ign can be extended to utilize both available cores. Figure 16 on the following page shows a dual-core design that can be  implemented on the ML410 board The two PPC405 processors each have dedicated PLB interfaces but s hare a common OPB. On the common OPB, the processors need to negotiate access to the RS232 UART and SystemACE CF  controller. This negotiation can be done through du al-ported shared BRAM accessible by each processor from thei r respective PLB. The ML410 board has two external me mory interfaces that are both utilized in this concept PPC405 CPU0 uses the DDR2 DIMM 256 Mbytes while PPC405 CPU1 utilizes the DDR on-board component memory 64  Mbytes\. Each of the processors has some dedicated on-chip memory OCM connected through OCM interface The instruction side OCM is particularly necessary so e ach processor can store its own boot code in its own on chip memory as booting both processors from external mem ory may not be possible Both processors have their own FPUs connected on dedicated FCB interfaces Since the processing of individual interferograms is a comple tely independent task an up to 2x reduction in executio n time may be possible with a dual-core system However o ne bottleneck that may limit the speedup is negotiatin g access to the shared CF card controller Additional improvement to the overall performance o f the FTIR spectrometry system may be possible by rewriti ng the software in C. The automatic conversion from FORTRA N to C using f2c most likely does not produce optimal code, and it is certainly not appealing to read Some functio ns may also need to be rewritten with an optimized pattern  of data access This can help in cases such as the dot-prod uct coprocessor Further performance improvement may be achieved by trying a different compiler one that is specifical ly targeted for the embedded PPC405 processor A V2P performanc e study done at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center concluded that using the WindRiver Diab DCC 5.2 com piler provides a 38 performance increase over the GNU-GC C 3.4 compiler The comparison was based on running a  Dhrystone benchmark application on a 400 MHz PPC405 design The GNU-GCC compiler achieved 458 DMIPS while the WindRiver Diab DCC achieved 628 DMIPS as  reported by Xilinx\ [10   Implementing additional hardware co-processors may result in the further reduction of execution time Using t he dotproduct design as a reference the FFT function fo r example can be implemented in the hardware This w ill help in the spectrum computation component of the s oftware processing. It may be necessary to re-arrange the d ata access pattern for optimal co-processor performance to av oid the pitfall seen when deploying the dot-product core Finally, no embedded processing system is complete without an OS. Linux is a good choice and is supported by X ilinx in EDK It is important to first finalize the hardware  design prior to deploying the OS Support for the APU may be lacking in Linux and getting the OS to recognize th e hardware FPU may be a project in itself For the FTIR spectrometry algorithm this research task started the process of moving from an all software system to a mixed HW/SW implementation on the V4FX60 hybridFPGA In the best case a more than 8x speedup was achieved compared to the FTIR base system This implementation, although nearly 2x faster the V2P s ystem at NASA JPL still lags behind the current state-of-th e-art space processor  the BAE RAD750 However the marg in between the two was narrowed down significantly and with further research as suggested above will most lik ely be eliminated altogether Directly benefiting from the  work presented in this paper is a 3-year JPL technology

OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
