A Mining Method of Frequent Tree Sequences Chen Jianguo, Liu Li, Chen Cheng, Zhang Cheng School of Information Science Engineering, Lanzhou Univers ity, Lanzhou, 730000, China chenjg08@lzu.cn, liulnd@lzu.edu.cn chenchen09@lzu.cn zhangc_10@lzu.cn Abstract With the development of frequent items and frequent sequences mining the technology of data mining turns to solve the problem of structural pattern mining. In this paper, we introduce transf ormation rules and define a new representation of tree sequen ces by using transformation sequences. Then we propose an efficient approach to enumerate frequent transformation subsequences FTSs trees from a given set of tree sequences. Its fundamental performance has been evaluated by using artificial datasets Keywords-data mining; tree sequen ce; frequent tree subsequence frequent transformation subsequence I I NTRODUCTION In recent years data mining of complicated structures such as trees  o lecules, XML doc um ents and relational databases has attracted a lot of researchers Especially the idea of disc overing characteristic patterns  various structure d data has recent ly led to a large number of specialized algorithms for mining trees, graphs and sequences e 6 m e thod to mine frequent subsequences from graph sequence data and we extend its way to find frequent subsequences of trees from a set of tree sequences The primary objective of th is paper is to establish a framework to mine a comple te set of frequent tree subsequences from a given set of observed sequences of trees. We introduce a representation of tree sequences using transformation rules of the tree 
sequences data. Then we propose a method to mine frequent tree subsequences through mining frequent transformation subsequences II R EPRESENTATION F ORMALISM A labeled tree t is represented as where 002\003  tVELf 004 005 1 2 3  n Vvvvv 004 006 V 007 is a set of nodes 002\003\002\003 005   Evvvv 004 006 V 010 is a set of edges, and is a set of labels such that L  fV E L 011\012   and are sets of nodes edges and labels of t, respectively. An observed tree sequence is represented as d where the superscript integer of each t represents the ordered step of the observation. We assume that each node v is mutually distinct from the others in any  unique ID in d. To represent the differences between and   Vt Et  i t  1 i 007\013  Lt 1  2  tt 014 n  n t 013\015 t

For example we use a transformation to insert a node having a label between the k th and k+1 th intrastates in the i th interstate.

The results indicated by ‘–’ in the table were not obtained due to intractable computation time over one hour. The upper half of the table indicates that the computation time of both the minging algorithm and Gaston are exponential to the average length of  s eq d provided by the settings of  and  The main reason of the computation time increase along the average length is considered to be the increase of the numbers of FTSs in both cases.

GA is stochastic search algorithm modelled on the process of natural selection which underlines biological evolution. GA has been successfully applied in many search, optimization, and machine learning problems.GA works in an iteration manner by generating new populations of strings from old ones. Every string is the encoded binary, real etc., version of a candidate solution .An evaluation function associates a fitness measure to every string indicating its fitness for the problem. This type of representation is relative to position. Presence of 1 at ith position indicates occurrence of the item in transaction[i   Similarly presence of 0 at jth position indicates absence of item in transaction   For example Bit pattern for A can be given as 1010101111 based on its availability in the transactions in table V. Hence conjunction and disjunction of few rules can be evaluated and its relative count could be calculated as follows    M  Boolean Operation on b it pattern for few rules TABLE X   Items Operation Result Count A and C 1010101111} and 0010101001 001010100 1 4 A or C 1010101111} or 0010101001  101010111 1  5 A or C and E  1010101111} or 0010101001}\ and  0111111111  001010111 1  6 N  Genetic operators  Genetic Algorithm uses genetic operators [7 t o g e ne rat e  the offspring of the existing population. This section describes three operators of Genetic Algorithms that were used in GA algorithm: selection, crossover and mutation 1\ Selection: The selection operator chooses a chromosome in the current population according to the fitness function and copies it without changes into the new population.GA algorithm used route wheel selection where the fittest members of each generation are more chance to select 2\ Crossover: The crossover operator, according to a certain probability, produces two new chromosomes from two selected chromosomes by swapping segments of genes 3\ Mutation: The mutation operator is used for maintaining diversity. During the mutation phase and according to mutation probability, 0.005 in GA algorithm value of each gene in each selected chromosome is changed III  C ONCLUSION  This paper proposed an integrated algorithm for useful and effective association rule mining to capture rare but not frequent items; using generic algorithm to derive all possible conjunctive& disjunctive rules sets using genetic algorithm; lift factor to analyse the strength of derived rules. This approach is novel because  Genetic Algorithm is used in generating rule set  An integrated approach is proposed in combining  Multiple minimum support  Conjunction and disjunction rule generation  Lift factor to validate the result set IV  F UTURE W ORK  The major challenge in this approach is ‘time taken’. In future it is planned to integrate UML model /multi level data mining to analyse the dataset based on their hierarchy before they get into the algorithm. Besides planning to identify the redundant item sets in the early stage to avoid the time taken during rule set generation. And there is also a plan to compare the proposed algorithm with other existing algorithms if any 6 o v a li dat e th e r o bu stn e ss  and ef f e ctiv en ess   T h e sc o p e of

sensitive patterns through mining Most research in this area focuses on hiding itemsets and association or classi\003cation rules 15 Unlik e t hes e w orks  w e cons ider sequential patterns that are more challenging to hide than itemsets due to their complex semantics Abul et al introduced the p roblem of s e quential p attern hiding and proposed a deletion-based method that minimally affects the

Based Sequence Hiding   an algorithm that addresses these limitations identi\003es symbols to delete by performing search on graphs that represent matchings between sensitive patterns and transactions However due to the high computational cost of graph search searches only a small part of the graph and does not minimize the distortion needed to avoid side-effects Besides employing permutation addresses the shortcomings of to better preserve data utility Speci\003cally it avoids the expensive graph search while incurring minimal side-effects and distortion by I favoring the sanitization o f transactions that incur a small number of side-effects through the use of and II replacing sensitive patterns with permutations that prevent side-effects and minimize Cayley distance through the use

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con“gurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con“gure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef“ciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/˜manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
