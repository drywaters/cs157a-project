Finding Robust Itemsets Under Subsampling Nikolaj Tatti University of Antwerp Antwerp Belgium nikolaj.tatti@ua.ac.be Fabian Moerchen Siemens Corporate Research Integrated Data Systems 755 College Road East Princeton NJ 08540 USA fabian.moerchen@siemens.com Abstract Mining frequent patterns is plagued by the problem of pattern explosion making pattern reduction techniques a key challenge in pattern mining In this paper we propose a novel theoretical framework for pattern reduction We do this by measuring the robustness of a property of an itemset such 
as closedness or non-derivability The robustness of a property is the probability that this property holds on random subsets of the original data We study four properties closed free nonderivable and totally shattered itemsets demonstrating how we can compute the robustness analytically without actually sampling the data Our concept of robustness has many advantages Unlike statistical approaches for reducing patterns we do not assume a null hypothesis or any noise model and the patterns reported are simply a subset of all patterns with this property as opposed to approximate patterns for which the property does not really hold If the underlying property is monotonic then the measure is also monotonic allowing 
us to efìciently mine robust itemsets We further derive a parameter-free technique for ranking itemsets that can be used for topk approaches Our experiments demonstrate that we can successfully use the robustness measure to reduce the number of patterns and that ranking yields interesting itemsets Keywords pattern reduction robust itemsets closed itemsets free itemsets non-derivable itemsets totally shattered itemsets I I NTRODUCTION Frequent itemset mining was rst introduced in the context of market basket analysis and has been used since to address many data mining problems such as frequent pat 
tern mining association rule generation clustering 3 classiìcation temporal data mining 5 and outlier detection The mining of itemsets is a core step in these methods that often dominates the overall complexity of the problem The number of frequent itemsets can be extremely large even for moderately sized datasets complicating a manual analysis or further automated processing steps Researchers have proposed many solutions to reduce the number of patterns reported depending on the context in which the patterns are used or the process in which the data was generated for example closed itemsets to avoid redundant association rules constrained itemsets to incorporate prior knowledge condensed representations 
to answer frequency queries with limited memory marginclosed itemsets for e xploratory analysis and surprising itemsets 11 or top-k patterns 12 for itemset ranking Many of reduction techniques have a drawback of being fragile For example given a non-closed itemset X  adding a single transaction to dataset containing only X will make X closed In this paper we introduce a novel theoretical framework that uses this drawback to its advantage Given a property of an itemset closedness or non-derivability for example we can measure robustness 
of this property A property of X is robust if it holds for many datasets subsampled from the original data We demonstrate that we can compute this measure analytically for several important classes of itemsets closed free 13 non-deri v able  and totally shattered itemsets 15 Computing rob ust itemsets under subsampling turns out to be practical for free non-derivable and totally shattered itemsets for closed itemsets the test for robustness is prohibitively expensive A possible drawback of our approach is that it depends on a parameter 002  the probability of including a transaction in a subsample In addition to providing reasonable guidelines to 
choose 002 we introduce a technique making us independent of 002  We show that there is a neighborhood near 1 in which the ranking of itemsets does not depend on 002  We further demonstrate how we can compute this ranking without actually discovering the exact neighborhood or computing the measure for the itemsets We give exact solutions for free and totally shattered itemsets and provide practical heuristics for closed and non-derivable itemsets In the remainder of this paper we describe related work and motivate our approach in Section II Itemsets robust 
under subsampling and algorithms to nd them are described in Section III Section V demonstrates how the subsampling approach can reduce the number of reported itemsets signiìcantly The results are discussed in comparison with approximate itemsets in Sections VI II R ELATED WORK AND MOTIVATION The design goal of condensed representations of frequent itemsets is to be able to answer all possible frequency queries approximately For example non-derivable itemsets e xclude an y itemset whose support that can be derived from others in the condensed representation using logical rules exactly or approximately

This is useful to support further mining tasks such as generation of association rules where the frequencies of all subsets of a closed itemset are needed to determine the conìdence of all possible rules For other tasks knowing the frequency of all frequent itemsets is less useful because there is a large redundancy in the set of frequent itemsets All frequent itemsets can be grouped into equivalence classes where all itemsets in a class are observed in the same set of transactions The maximal element of each equivalence class is a closed itemset No more items can be added to this set without losing some transactions The minimal elements of the equivalence class are free itemsets or generators No items can be taken out without adding transactions However even the number of closed and free itemsets can still be very large for low minimum support thresholds It can be further reduced by clustering itemsets representing similar sets of transactions enforcing itemsets to ha v e a minimum margin of difference in support or ranking itemsets by signiìcance 11 17 18 The above approaches have in common that the complete dataset is considered and no assumption on potential noise are made In fault tolerant approaches the strict deìnition of support requiring all items of an itemset to be present in a transaction is relaxed see  assuming that items can present or absent at random in the transactions These approaches can reveal important structures in noisy data that might otherwise get lost in a huge amount of fragmented patterns One needs to be aware though that they report approximate support values and possibly list itemsets that are not observed as such in the collection at all or with much smaller support Also the design goal is not to reduce the number of reported patterns only considers closedness in combination with fault tolerance Unlike the approaches based on signiìcance 11  18 we do not assume a statistical null hypothesis We also do not assume any noise model such as ipping the values of a matrix independently Instead our goal is to study robustness of a given property based on subsampling transactions III R OBUST ITEMSETS A Notation and deìnitions In this section we review the preliminaries and introduce the notation used in the paper A binary dataset D is a multiset of transactions binary vectors of length K  The i th element of a transaction represents by an item a i  a Bernoulli random variable We denote the collection of all items by A   a 1 a K   An itemset X is a subset of A  Given a transaction t and an itemset X  we deìne t X to be the binary vector obtained by keeping only the items occurring in X  Given an itemset X  x 1 x N  and a binary vector v of length N  we deìne the support sp  X  v  D   t 002 D  t X  v  to be the number of transactions in D  where items in X obtain values of v  We often omit D from notation when it is clear from the context In addition if v contains only 1s we simply write sp  X   Note that sp  X  coincides with the traditional deìnition of a support for X  Discovering frequent itemsets that is itemsets whose support exceeds some given threshold is a well-studied problem E XAMPLE 1 Throughout the paper we will use the following toy dataset D  002 003 00001 01011 11111 01011 11111 10000 004 005 containing 5 items a  b  c  d  and e  and 6 transactions as a running example As an example for this dataset we have sp  ab   sp  ab 1    1  We say that a function f mapping an itemset X to a real number f  X  is monotonically decreasing if for each Y 003 X we have f  Y  004 f  X   Closed Itemsets An itemset X is closed  if there is no Y 002 X such that sp  X  sp  Y   i.e they are maximal among the itemsets having the same support We deìne a predicate 003 c  X  D  006 1 if X is closed in D 0 otherwise  Free Itemsets An itemset X said to be free if there is no Y 003 X such that sp  X  sp  Y   i.e free itemsets are minimal among the itemsets having the same support We deìne a predicate 003 f  X  D  006 1 if X is free in D 0 otherwise  A vital property of free itemsets is that they constitute a downward closed collection allowing efìcient mining with an Apriori-style algorithm see Theorem 1 in E XAMPLE 2 Closed itemsets in our running example are a  e  bde  and abcde  On the other hand itemsets a  b  c  d  e  ab  ad  and ae are free Non-derivable Itemsets An itemset X is said to be derivable  if we can derive its support from the supports of proper subsets of X  otherwise an itemset is called nonderivable  We deìne a predicate 003 n  X  D  006 1 if X is non-derivable in D 0 otherwise  P ROPOSITION 3 An itemset X is derivable if and only if there are two vectors v and w with v having odd number of 0 s and w having even number of 0 s and sp  X  v  sp  X  w

Proof To verify whether an itemset is derivable we compute bounds for the frequency by using the inclusionexclusion principle An itemset is derivable if and only if the upper and lower bounds are equal We can show that the upper bound is equal to u  sp  X in v sp  X  v   where v has odd number of 0s Similarly the lower bound is equal to l  sp  X   min w sp  X  w   where w has even number of 0s see Itemset is deri v able if and only 0 u  l min v sp  X  v in w sp  X  w   Corollary 3.4 in states that non-deri v able itemsets are downward closed hence we can mine them using an Aprioristyle approach We say that an itemset X is totally shattered if sp  X  v   0 for all possible binary vectors v  In other words every possible combination of values for X occur in D  Again we deìne a predicate 003 s  X  D  006 1 if X is totally shattered in D 0 otherwise  Totally shattered itemsets are related to VCdimension we can sho w that a totally shattered itemset is always free and non-derivable but not vice versa E XAMPLE 4 Itemset ab in the running example is totally shattered Itemset ac is non-derivable but not totally shattered because sp  ac 0    0  It is easy to see from the deìnition that totally shattered itemsets constitute a downward collection hence they are easy to mine using an Apriori-style approach B Measuring robustness In this section we propose a measure of robustness for itemsets with a predicate 003  Intuitively we consider an itemset robust if the predicate is true for many subsets of the database In order to deìne the measure formally we rst deìne a probability for a subset of D  D EFINITION 5 Given a binary dataset D  and a real number 002  0 005 002 005 1  we deìne a random dataset D 002 obtained from D by keeping each transaction with probability 002 or otherwise discarding it Let S be a subset of D  The probability of D 002  S is equal to p  D 002  S  002  S  1  002   D  S   1 D EFINITION 6 Given a binary dataset D  a real number 002  and an itemset predicate 003  we deìne the robustness to be the probability that 003  X  D 002   that is r  X  003 D 002  p  003  X  D 002   1  007 003  X  S  p  D 002  S   For notational clarity we will omit D and 002 when they are clear from the context E XAMPLE 7 Consider itemset ab in our running example Let 002 1  3  Note that sp  ab 0    sp  ab 1    1 and sp  ab 0    sp  ab 1    2  In order for ab to still be totally shattered on a subset each of these supports needs to stay greater than zero The probability of this event is equal to 1  3  1  3  1  2  3  2  3  1  2  3  2  3  25  729  because for the rst two cases we need to sample the single transaction upholding the property and for the other two cases we need to make sure we do not skip both of the two transactions we need to uphold the property Our main goal is to mine itemsets for which the robustness measure exceed some given threshold that is nd all itemsets for which r  X  003 D 002  004 004  Let us rst consider the effect of 002 Ifweset 002 1  then r  X  003 D 002  003  X  D   Naturally we expect that when we lower 002 then the robustness would decrease This holds for predicates that satisfy a speciìc property D EFINITION 8 We say that a predicate 003 is monotonic w.r.t deletion if for each itemset X  each dataset D  and each transaction t 002 D it holds that if 003  X  D   then 003  X  D  t   P ROPOSITION 9 Let 003 be a predicate monotonic w.r.t deletion Then r  X  003 D 002  005 r  X  003 D 005   for 002 005 005  Proof We will prove the proposition by induction over  D   Proposition holds trivially for  D  0  Assume that theorem holds  D   N and let D be a dataset with  D   N 1  Fix t 002 D and deìne a new predicate 003 t  X  S  003  X  S 006 t    where S is a dataset 003 t is monotonic w.r.t deletion Otherwise if there is a dataset S  a transaction u 002 S an itemset Y violating the monotonicity then S 006 t   the same transaction u and the itemset Y will violate the monotonicity for 003  Moreover since 003 is monotonic w.r.t deletion it holds that 003  X  S  005 003 t  X  S   This in turns implies that r  X  003 S 002  005 r  X  003 t S,\002   2 Let us write D 002  D  t   Then we have r  X  003 D 002 1  002  r  X  003 D 002 002  002 r  X  003 t D 002 002  005 1  005  r  X  003 D 002 002  005 r  X  003 t D 002 002  005 1  005  r  X  003 D 002 005  005 r  X  003 t D 002 005   r  X  003 D 005   where the rst inequality holds because of Equation 2 and the second inequality holds because of induction assumption This proves the proposition

It turns out that all the predicates we considered in Section III-A are monotonic w.r.t deletion P ROPOSITION 10 Predicates 003 c  003 f  003 n  and 003 s are monotonic w.r.t deletion Proof An itemset is not totally shattered if there is a binary vector v such that sp  X  v  D   This immediately implies that sp  X  v  D  t    Thus 003 s is monotonic w.r.t deletion Similarly Proposition 3 implies that 003 n is monotonic w.r.t deletion An itemset X is not free if there is x 002 X such that there is no transaction u 002 D for which u x 0 and u y 1 for all y 002 X  x   If this holds in D  then it holds for D  t   This makes 003 f monotonic w.r.t deletion Similarly an itemset X is not closed if there is x 002 X such that there is no transaction u 002 D for which u x 0 and u y 1 for all y 002 X  If this holds in D  then it holds for D  t   This makes 003 c monotonic w.r.t deletion E XAMPLE 11 The itemset bd is not closed because its superset bde is always observed when bd is observed No matter which transaction we delete one with or without bde  this will not change Note however that bde can become non-closed if transactions 2 and 4 are deleted because then abcde will have the same support of 2 In order to mine all signiìcant patterns we need to show that the robustness measure is monotonically decreasing This is indeed the case if the underlying predicate is monotonically decreasing P ROPOSITION 12 Let 003 be a monotonically decreasing predicate Then r  X  003 D 002  is also monotonically decreasing Proof Let Y and X be itemsets such that Y 007 X  Then r  X  003 D 002  is 007 003  X  S  p  D 002  S  005 007 003  Y  S  p  D 002  S  r  Y  003 D 002   which proves the proposition C Computing the measure In this section we demonstrate how to compute the robustness measure for the predicates Computing the measure directly from the deìnition is impractical since there are 2  D  number of subsets of D  It turns out that computing free non-derivable and totally shattered itemsets has practical formulas while the robustness measure for closed itemsets has no practical formulation see Table I To facilitate the analysis we introduce the following function Given an itemset X and a set of binary vectors V 003 0  1   X  we deìne o  X V 002  010 v 003 V 1  1  002  sp  X  v   Table I C OMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF ROBUSTNESS AND ORDERS  C OMPUTING MEASURES IS EXPLAINED IN S ECTION III-C C OMPUTING ORDERS IS EXPLAINED IN S ECTION IV K IS THE NUMBER OF ITEMS  C IS THE NUMBER OF FREQUENT CLOSED ITEMSETS  predicate measure order order estimate free O   X   O   X    totally shattered O 2  X   O 2  X    closed O 2 K  X   O 2 K  X   O  002 002 C 2 002 002  non-derivable O 2  X   O 2 2  X   O 4  X   P ROPOSITION 13 Given an itemset X  let V be the set of  X  vectors having  X  1 ones and one 0 The robustness of a free itemset is r  X  003 f 002  o  X V 002   Proof Given an item x 002 X  deìne a random variable T x  sp  X  x   D 002   sp  X  D 002   X is still free in D 002 if T x is true for all x 002 X  T x is true if and only if D 002 contains a transaction t with t x 0 and t y 1 for y 002 X  x   There are sp  X  v  D  such transactions where v 002 V is the vector for which v x 0  p  T x  is the probability of not removing all these transactions thus p  T x   1  002  sp  X  v  D   Since each of these transaction is missing only one x 002 X  there is no common transactions between different events T x  making them independent Thus we can conclude r  X  003 f 002  011 x 003 X p  T x  o  X V 002   P ROPOSITION 14 Given an itemset X  let V be the set of all binary vectors of length  X   The robustness of a totally shattered itemset is r  X  003 s 002  o  X V 002   Proof Given a binary vector v 002 V  deìne a random variable T v  sp  X  v  D 002   0  X is still totally shattered in D 002 if T v is true for all v 002 V  p  T v  is the probability of not removing all these transactions thus p  T v   1  002  sp  X  v  D   Again since no transaction can contribute to different T v being true the random variables are independent and we obtain r  X  003 s 002  011 v 003 V p  T v  o  X V 002   Note that this formula in this proposition corresponds directly to Example 7 We will now consider closed itemsets Unlike with free/totally shattered itemsets there is an exponential number of terms The key problem is that closure depends on the items outside the itemset whereas other predicates consider only the items inside the itemset P ROPOSITION 15 The robustness of a closed itemset is r  X  003 c 002  007 Y 004 X   1  Y  X  1  002  sp  X   sp  Y   Proof Given an item y 002 X  deìne a random variable T y  sp  X 006 y   D 002  sp  X  D 002   X is still closed in

To compute e  Y X   rst note that e  X X  If Y 016  X  then using the following identity 007 Y 002 Y 003 002 X Y 003  cl  Y 003  e  Y 002 X  007 Z 004 X   1  Z    X  0 we arrive to e  Y X   007 Y 002 Y 003 002 X Y 003  cl  Y 003  e  Y 002 X   4 Thus we can compute e  Y X  from e  Y 002 X   where Y 002 is a closed subset of Y  This is convenient because when computing e  Y X   say for a k  we have already computed all the subsets of Y for previous coefìcients E XAMPLE 27 Consider itemset e in our running example There are two closed supersets of e  namely bde and abcde  having the supports 4 and 2  respectively Using the update equations we see that e  e e   e  bde e   1  and e  abcde e  As sp  e   we see that the non-zero coefìcients a i are a 0 1 and a 1   1  The problem with this approach is that we can still have an exponential number of closed itemsets Hence we chose to estimate the ranking by only using frequent closed itemsets and estimate the remaining itemsets to have a support of 0  This estimation is achieved by removing all closed nonfrequent itemsets from the sums of Eqs 3 and 4 and adding an itemset containing all the items and having the support 0  The code for this estimation is given in Algorithm 1 Algorithm 1 Algorithm for estimating coefìcients of the polynomial given in Proposition 15 input  X an itemset C  frequent closed itemsets output   a k   coefìcients of the polynomial 1 if A 002C then add A to C with sp  A   2 C\017 Y 002C X 003 Y   3 L\017 sets in C ordered by the subset relation 4 e  X X  017 1  5 for Y 002L do 6 e  Y X  017 016 Z 003C Z 002 Y e  Z X   7 k 017 sp  X   sp  Y   8 a k 017 a k  e  Y X   Algorithm 1 takes O  C 2  time In practice this is much faster because an average itemset does not have that many supersets Now that we have a way of estimating a k from frequent closed itemsets we can given two itemsets X and Y  search the smallest k for which the coefìcients differ in order to apply Lemma 20 Note that if the index of the differing coefìcient say k  is such that sp  X   k is larger or equal to the support threshold then a k is correctly computed by our estimation and our approximation yields a correct ranking D Non-derivable itemsets In this section we will discuss how to estimate the ranking non-derivable itemsets The ranking for non-derivable is particularly difìcult because we cannot use Proposition 22 to avoid expanding the polynomial given in Proposition 17 We cannot expand the polynomial since it has O 2 2  X   terms Moreover we cannot use the estimation trick done with closed itemsets because the problem is the exponential number of combinations of subsets of  X   Hence we resort to a simple heuristic First note that we can rewrite the measure as o  X 002 V  o  X 002 W   o  X 002 V  o  X 002 W   where V and W are as deìned in Proposition 17 This formulation implies that any term of form 1  002  002 v sp  X  v   where v sums either over a subset of V or a subset of W is canceled out On the other hand the terms having the form 1  002  sp  X  v  sp  X  w   where v 002 V and w 002 W  will be among the smallest ones Hence we propose the following margin vector to use as a heuristic D EFINITION 28 Given a dataset D and an itemset X we deìne a non-derivable margin vector mv  X  D 003 n  to be a sequence of 4  X  1 integers sp  X  v  D  sp  X  w  D   where v is a binary vector having odd number of ones and w is a binary vector having even number of ones ordered in the increasing order We will rank itemsets by comparing their margin vectors We should stress that this is heuristic since unlike with free and totally shattered itemsets we have no guarantee that terms containing more than two supports will cancel out and not disrupt the ranking Nevertheless this ranking makes sense in the light of Proposition 3 an itemset is derivable if and only if one the entries in the margin vector is 0 If the entries in the margin vector are large then the itemset is far away of being derivable E XAMPLE 29 Consider itemset ac in our running example We have sp  ac 0    3  sp  ac   sp  ac 1    1  and sp  ac 0    0  Thus the margin vector is equal to 0  2  0+3  1+2  1+3 2  3  3    V E XPERIMENTS In this section we present our experiments 1 A Datasets We used datasets from three repositories The 10 FIMI datasets include lar ge transaction datasets deri v ed from trafìc data census data and retail data Two datasets are synthetically generated to simulate market basket data The datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository represent classiìcation problems from a wide 1 The implementation of our algorithms is given at http://adrem.ua.ac.be implementations

variety of domains We used the itemset representations of 29 datasets from the LUCS repository Finally we used 18 text datasets shipped with the Cluto clustering toolkit but converted to itemsets using a binary representation of words in documents discarding the term frequencies B Reducing the number of patterns The goal of the rst experiment is to show that this new constraint for itemsets can signiìcantly reduce the number of itemsets reported in the results by removing itemsets that are spurious in the sense that they are unlikely to be observed on many subsamples Throughout this section we will use 003 to indicate the threshold for the support A rst question is how the parameters should be chosen The smaller we set 002  the stricter the ltering will be 002 should not be very close 1 because otherwise brittle itemsets that could lose their predicate by removing only a few transactions still have a high likelihood of being found This implies that robustness values are packed close to 1 when 002 is large and this might lead to problems due to oating point arithmetics So a small 002 is important to emphasize the quantitative difference between itemsets of various robustness however too small 002 will skew the distribution towards 0 too much which can lead to computational issues The larger the minimum robustness the stricter the ltering will be The robustness threshold is more application dependent but it should not be close to zero otherwise no reduction will be observed We did a parameter study for the itemset version of the Zoo dataset that describes 101 animals with 42 boolean attributes The number of itemsets reported is shown in Figure 1 One can see how smaller 002 and larger robustness thresholds reduce the numbers of free itemsets by almost 2 orders or magnitude The transition is very smooth showing that the parameters can be chosen without unexpected effects The results for non-derivable and totally shattered itemsets and other datasets were very similar Min.

VII S UMMARY We have shown how robustness under subsampling for common classes of itemsets can be computed efìciently without actually sampling the data The experimental results show that the number of reported itemsets can be largely reduced on many datasets in other words spurious itemsets that would not have been found in many subsets of the data are removed The approach can further be used to rank itemsets for topk mining by robustness Future work will investigate the effect of using robust itemsets on data mining tasks such as clustering classiìcation and rule generation using itemsets A CKNOWLEDGMENTS Nikolaj Tatti is supported by Post-Doctoral Fellowships of the Research FoundationÑFlanders  FWO  R EFERENCES  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A N Sw ami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases in SIGMOD  1993 pp 207Ö216  J Hipp U G¸ntzer  and G Nakhaeizadeh  Algorithms for association rule mining a general survey and comparison SIGKDD Explorations  vol 2 no 1 pp 58Ö64 2000  K W ang C Xu and B Liu Clustering transactions using large items in CIKM  1999 pp 483Ö490  H Cheng X Y an J Han and C Hsu Discriminati v e frequent pattern analysis for effective classiìcation in ICDE  2007 pp 716Ö725  F  Moerchen M Thies and A Ultsch Ef cient mining of all margin-closed itemsets with applications in temporal knowledge discovery and classiìcation by compression KAIS  2010  K Smets and J Vreek en The odd one out Identifying and characterising anomalies in SDM  2011  N P asquier  Y  Bastide R T aouil and L Lakhal Disco v er ing frequent closed itemsets for association rules in ICDT  1999 pp 398Ö416  J Pei J Han and L V  S Lakshmanan Mining frequent itemsets with convertible constraints in ICDE  2001 pp 433Ö442  T  Calders C Rigotti and J.-F  Boulicaut  A surv e y on condensed representations for frequent sets in ConstraintBased Mining and Inductive Databases  2006 pp 64Ö80  S Brin R Motw ani and C Silv erstein Be yond mark et baskets Generalizing association rules to correlations in SIGMOD  1997 pp 265Ö276  N T atti Maximum entrop y based signiìcance of itemsets  KAIS  vol 17 no 1 pp 57Ö77 2008  F  Geerts B Goethals and T  Mielik‰inen T iling databases  in Proc Discovery Science  2004 pp 278Ö289  J.-F  Boulicaut A Byk o wski and C Rigotti Free-sets A condensed representation of boolean data for the approximation of frequency queries DMKD  vol 7 no 1 pp 5Ö22 2003  T  Calders and B Goethals Non-deri v a ble itemset mining  DMKD  vol 14 no 1 pp 171Ö206 2007  T  Mielik‰inen T ransaction databases frequent itemsets and their condensed representations in KDID  2005 pp 139 164  D Xin J Han X Y an and H Cheng Mining compressed frequent-pattern sets in VLDB  2005 pp 709Ö720  A Gallo T  De Bie and N Cristianini Mini Mining informative non-redundant itemsets in ECMLPKDD  2007 pp 438Ö445  G I W ebb Disco v ering signiìcant patterns  Mach Learn  vol 68 no 1 pp 1Ö33 2007  R Gupta G F ang B Field M Steinbach and V  K umar  Quantitative evaluation of approximate frequent pattern mining algorithms in KDD  2008 pp 301Ö309  T  Calders B Goethals and M Mampae y  Mining itemsets in the presence of missing values in SAC  2007 pp 404 408  T  Uno and H Arimura  An ef cient polynomial delay algorithm for pseudo frequent itemset mining in Discovery Science  Springer 2007 pp 219Ö230  C Luccese S Orlando and G Pere go R.Casas-Garriga Mining top-k patterns from binary datasets in presence of noise in ICDM  2010  H Cheng P  S Y u and J Han A C-Close Ef ciently mining approximate closed itemsets by core pattern recovery in ICDM  IEEE 2006 pp 839Ö844  J.-F  Boulicaut A Byk o wski and C Rigotti  Approximation of frequency queries by means of free-sets in PKDD  2000 pp 75Ö85  B Goethals and M Zaki FIMI 03 frequent itemset mining implementations in ICDM 2003 Workshop FIMI  2003  A Asuncion and D Ne wman UCI machine learning repository 2007 A v ailable http://www ics.uci edu/~mlearn/MLRepository.html  F  Coenen The LUCS-KDD discretised/normalised ARM and CARM data library 2003 A v ailable http www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~frans/KDD/Software/LUCS_KDD_DN  Y  Zhao and G Karypis Ev aluation of hierarchical clustering algorithms for document datasets in CIKM  2002 pp 515 524  B Bringmann and A Zimmermann One in a million picking the right patterns KAIS  vol 18 no 1 pp 61Ö81 2009  J Vreek en M v an Leeuwen and A Siebes Krimp mining itemsets that compress DMKD  vol 23 no 1 pp 169Ö214 2011

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
