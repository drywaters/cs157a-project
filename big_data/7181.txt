M Marjani et al  Big IoT Data Analytics Architecture Opportunities and Open Research Challenges  FIGURE 4 Example of use cases and opportunities for big IoT data analytics architecture IoT data Various devices connect to the Internet in a smart environment and share information Moreover the cost of storing data has been reduced dramatically after the invention of cloud computing technology Analysis capabilities have made huge leaps Thus the role of big data in a smart city can potentially transform every sector of the economy of a nation Hadoop with YARN resource manager has offered recent advancement in big data technology to support and handle numerous workloads real-time processing and streaming data ingestion C RETAIL AND LOGISTICS IoT is expected to play a key role as an emerging technology in the area of retail and logistics In logistics RFID keeps track of containers pallets and crates In addition considerable advancements in IoT technologies can facilitate retailers by providing several bene\034ts However IoT devices generate large amounts of data on a daily basis Thus powerful data analytics enables enterprises to gain insights from the voluminous amounts of data produced through IoT technologies Applying data analytics to logistic data sets can improve the shipment experience of customers Moreover retail companies can earn additional pro\034t by analyzing customer data which can predict the trends and demands of goods By looking into customer data optimizing pricing plans and seasonal promotions can be planned ef\034ciently to maximize pro\034t D HEALTHCARE Recent years have witnessed tremendous growth in smart health monitoring devices These devices generate enormous amounts of data Thus applying data analytics to data collected from fetal monitors electrocardiograms temperature monitors or blood glucose level monitors can help healthcare specialists ef\034ciently assess the physical conditions of patients Moreover data analytics enables healthcare professionals to diagnose serious diseases in their early stages to help save lives Furthermore data analytics improves the clinical quality of care and ensures the safety of patients In addition physician pro\034le can be reviewed by looking into the history of treatment of patients which can improve customer satisfaction acquisition and retention VI OPEN CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS IoT and big data analytics have been extensively accepted by many organizations However these technologies are still in their early stages Several existing research challenges have not yet been addressed This section presents several challenges in the 034eld of big IoT data analytics A PRIVACY Privacy issues arise when a system is compromised to infer or restore personal information using big data analytics tools although data are generated from anonymous users With the proliferation of big data analytics technologies used in big IoT data the privacy issue has become a core problem in the data mining domain Consequently most people are reluctant to rely on these systems which do not provide solid servicelevel agreement 050SLA\051 conditions regarding user personal information theft or misuse In fact the sensitive information of users has to be secured and protected from external interference Although temporary identi\034cation anonymity and encryptions provide several ways to enforce data privacy 5256 VOLUME 5 2017 


M Marjani et al  Big IoT Data Analytics Architecture Opportunities and Open Research Challenges  decisions have to be made with regard to ethical factors such as what to use how to use and why use generated big IoT data Another security risk associated with IoT data is the heterogeneity of the types of devices used and the nature of generated data such as raw devices data types and communication protocols These devices can have different sizes and shapes outside the network and are designed to communicate with cooperative applications Thus to authenticate these devices an IoT system should assign a non-repudiable identi\034cation system to each device Moreover enterprises should maintain a meta-repository of these connected devices for auditing purposes This heterogeneous IoT architecture is new to security professionals and thus results in increased security risks Consequently any attack in this scenario compromises system security and disconnects interconnected devices In the context of big IoT data security and privacy are the key challenges in processing and storing huge amounts of data Moreover to perform critical operations and host private data these systems highly rely on third party services and infrastructure Therefore an exponential growth in data rate causes dif\034culty in securing each and every portion of critical data As previously discussed existing security solutions 050Karim 2016 86\051 are no long applicable to providing complete security in big IoT data scenarios Existing algorithms are not designed for the dynamic observation of data and thus are not effectively applied Legacy data security solutions are speci\034cally designed for static data sets whereas current data requirements are changing dynamically 050Lafuente 2015\051 Thus deploying these security solutions is dif\034cult for dynamically increasing data In addition legislative and regulatory issues should be considered while signing SLAs With regard to data generated through IoT the following security problems can emerge 050a\051 timely updates dif\034culty in keeping systems up to date 050b\051 incident management identifying suspicious traf\034c patterns among legitimate ones and possible failure to capture unidenti\034able incidents 050c\051 interoperability proprietary and vendorspeci\034c procedures will pose dif\034culties in 034nding hidden or zero day attacks 050d\051 and protocol convergence although IPv6 is currently compatible with the latest speci\034cations this protocol has yet to be fully deployed Therefore the application of security rules over IPv4 may not be applicable to protecting IPv6 At present no answer can address these challenges and manage the security and privacy of interconnected devices However the following guidelines can overcome these adversities 050a\051 First a true open ecosystem with standard APIs is necessary to avoid interoperability and reliability problems 050b\051 Second devices must be well protected while communicating with peers 050c\051 Third devices should be hardcoded with the best security practices to protect against common security and privacy threats B DATA MINING Data mining methods provide ef\034cient and best-\034tting predictive or descriptive solutions for big data that can also be generalized for new data The e v olution of big IoT data and cloud computing platforms has brought the challenges of data exploration and information extraction Ho we v er  for the overall big IoT data architecture Figure 5 presents the primary challenges related to processing and data mining Exhaustive data reads/writes The high-volume highvelocity and high-variety qualities of big IoT data challenge exploration integration heterogeneous communication and extraction processes The size and heterogeneity of data impose new data mining requirements and diversity in data sources also poses a challenge  Furthermore compared with small data sets large data sets comprise more abnormalities and ambiguities that require additional preprocessing steps such as cleansing reduction and transmission 83 Another issue lies in the e xtraction of e xact and knowledgeable information from the large volumes of diverse data Consequently obtaining accurate information from complex data requires analyzing data properties and 034nding association among different data points Researchers have introduced parallel and sequential programming models and proposed different algorithms to minimize query response time while dealing with big data FIGURE 5 Big data mining issues in IoT VOLUME 5 2017 5257 


M Marjani et al  Big IoT Data Analytics Architecture Opportunities and Open Research Challenges  Moreover researchers have selected existing data mining algorithms in different manners to 050a\051 improve single source knowledge discovery 050b\051 implement data mining methods for multi-source platforms and 050c\051 study and analyze dynamic data mining methods and stream data Hence parallel k means algorithm and parallel association rule mining methods are introduced Ho we v er  the need to de vise algorithms remains to provide compatibility with the latest parallel architectures Moreover synchronization issues may occur in parallel computing while information is exchanged within different data mining methods This bottleneck of data mining methods has become an open issue in big IoT data analytics that should be addressed C VISUALIZATION Visualization is an important entity in big data analytics particularly when dealing with IoT systems where data are generated enormously Furthermore conducting data visualization is dif\034cult because of the large size and high dimension of big data This situation shows underlying trends and a complete picture of parsed data Therefore big data analytics and visualization should work seamlessly to obtain the best results from IoT applications in big data However visualization in the case of heterogeneous and diverse data 050unstructured structured and semi-structured\051 is a challenging task Designing visualization solution that is compatible with advanced big data indexing frameworks is a dif\034cult task Similarly response time is a desirable factor in big IoT data analytics Consequently cloud computing architectures supported with rich GUI facilities can be deployed to obtain better insights into big IoT data trends Different dimensionality reduction methods have been introduced as a result of complex and high-dimensional big IoT data 88 Ho we v er  these methods are unsuitable for all types of presented data Similarly when 034negrained dimensions are visualized effectively the probability to identify observable correlations patterns and outliners is high Moreo v er  data should be k ept locally to obtain usable information ef\034ciently because of power and bandwidth constraints In addition visualization software should run with the concept of reference locality to achieve ef\034cient outcome in an IoT environment Given that the amount of big IoT data is increasing rapidly the requirement of enormous parallelization is a challenging task in visualization Thus to decompose a problem into manageable independent tasks to enforce concurrent execution of queries is a challenge for parallel visualization algorithms At present most big data visualization tools used for IoT exhibit poor performance results in terms of functionality scalability and response time To provide effective uncertainty-aware visualization during the visual analytics process avoiding uncertainty imposes a considerable challenge Furthermore se v eral important issues are addressed such as 050a\051 visual noise most data set objects are closely related to one another and thus users may perceive different results of the same type 050b\051 information loss applying reduction methods to visible data sets can cause information loss 050c\051 large image observation data visualization tools have inherent problems with respect to aspect ratio devise resolution and physical perception limits 050d\051 frequently changing image users will not notice rapid data changes in an output and 050e\051 high performance requirements high performance requirements are imposed because data are generated dynamically in an IoT environment Moreover methods supported by advanced analytics enable interactive graphics on laptops desktops or mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets Real-time analytics is another consideration highlighted in IoT architectures Several guidelines on visualization in big data are presented such as 050a\051 data aw areness i.e appropriate domain expertise 050b\051 data quality cleaning data using information management or data governance policies 050c\051 meaningful results data clustering is used to provide high-level abstraction such that the visibility of smaller groups of data is possible and 050d\051 outliers should be removed from the data or treated as a separate entity Reference suggested that visualization should adhere to the following guidelines 050a\051 the system should provide special attention to metadata 050b\051 visualization software should be interactive and should require maximum user involvement and 050c\051 tools should be built based on the dynamic nature of the generated data D INTEGRATION Integration refers to having a uniform view of different formats Data integration provides a single view of the data arriving from different sources and combines the view of data Data inte gration includes all processes in v olv ed in collecting data from different sources as well as in storing and providing data with a uni\034ed view For each moment different forms of data are continuously generated by social media IoT and other communication and telecommunication approaches The produced data can be categorized into three groups 050a\051 structured data such as data stored in traditional database systems including tables with rows and columns 050b\051 semi-structured such as HTML XML and Json 034les and 050c\051 unstructured data such as videos audios and images Good data offer good information however this relationship is only achieved through data integration Inte grating diverse data types is a complex task in merging different systems or applications Ov erlapping the same data increasing performance and scalability and enabling realtime data access are among the challenges associated with data integration that should be addressed in the future Another challenge is to adjust structures in semi-structured and unstructured data before integrating and analyzing these types of data Information such as entities and relationships can be extracted from textual data by using available technologies in the eras of text mining machine learning natural processing and information extraction However new technologies should be developed to extract images videos and other information from other non-text 5258 VOLUME 5

extractors on the same text Hence managing and integrating different extraction results from a certain data source require other techniques VII CONCLUSION The growth rate of data production has increased drastically over the past years with the proliferation of smart and sensor devices The interaction between IoT and big data is currently at a stage where processing transforming and analyzing large amounts of data at a high frequency are necessary We conducted this survey in the context of big IoT data analytics First we explored recent analytics solutions The relationship between big data analytics and IoT was also discussed Moreover we proposed an architecture for big IoT data analytics Furthermore big data analytics types methods and technologies for big data mining were presented Some credible use cases were also provided In addition we explored the domain by discussing various opportunities brought about by data analytics in the IoT paradigm Several open research challenges were discussed as future research directions Finally we concluded that existing big IoT data analytics solutions remained in their early stages of development In the future
