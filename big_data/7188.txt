Mining Weighted Negative Association Rules from Infrequent Itemsets Based on Multiple Supports He Jiang school of information shandong polytechnic university Jinan, China jianghe09@126.com Xiumei Luan school of mechanical and automotive engineering shandong polytechnic university Jinan, China lxm@spu.edu.cn Xiangjun Dong school of information shandong polytechnic university Jinan, China d-xj@163.com Abstract  The existing researches for association rule mining most use the single minimum support However, in practical applications, the occurrence frequency of each itemset is 
different We should set different minimum support for itemsets In association rule mining, if the given minimum support is too high,then the items with low frequency of appearance couldn t be mined Otherwise if the given minimum support is too low,then combination explosion may occur. We support the technique that allows the users to specify multiple minimum supports to reflect the natures of the itemsets and their varied frequencies in the database. It is very effective for large databases touse algorithm of association rules based on multiple supports. The existing algorithms are mostly mining positive and negative association rules from frequent itemsets But  the negative association rules from infrequent itemsets are ignored. Furthermore We set different 
weighted values for items according to the importance of  each item Based on the above three factors, an algorithm for mining weighted negative association rules from infrequent itemsets based on multiple supports\(WNAIIMS\roposed in this paper Keywords-multiple minimum su pport, infrequent itemset weight, negative association rule I I NTRODUCTION In association rule mining, two threshold values should be set firstly: minimum support and minimum confidence The entire data mining is processing under the two threshold value restriction. Therefore, support and confidence play the important role in the mining process Support threshold value becomes a key factor in association rules mining. In statistical significance, minimum support 
defines the lower limit value that association rules need to cover the number of events samples.This lead to setting the only one support for different attributes to the data sample in date mining. That is to say different attributes of the data sample have the same minimum probability. For example we are interested in transactions that some may occur very frequently, but others may occur very sparse. Then there is a problem in the existing association rule mining, if the given minimum support is too high, then the items with low frequency of appearance canêt be mined Otherwise, if the given minimum support is too low,then a large number of non-meaningful data association will be filled in the mining process.Usually the mining strategy is to cover the greater 
probability affairs but abandon the small probability transactions. To solve this problem, We set different minimum supports based on different  probability of the datasets The existing algorithms are mostly mining positive and negative association rules from frequent itemsets. Literature  i n i ng positiv e and neg ative association rules from the frequent itemset on  multiple supports.But the negative association rules from infrequent itemsets are ignored . In fact, more negative association rules exist in the nonfrequent item set According to the importance of different items. set different weight values for each items.This can make the association rules more meaningful Based on the problems offered above,an algorithm for 
mining weighted negative association rules from infrequent itemsets based on multiple supports\(WNAIIMS\ is proposed.Experimental results show that the algorithm is efficient and feasible II P ROBLEM S TATEMENT AND R ELATED W ORK A Weighted Association Rules Weighted Association Rules is as follows: there are n records and m items. Let I  i 1 i 2 i m be a set of items and W  w 1 w 2 w m  w i 001\031

A pair X, w  X called a weighted item where X 001\031 I is an item and w  X  001\031 W is the weight associated with X A transaction is a set of weighted items, each of which may appear in multiple transactions with different weights A dataset may therefore be defined as a set D of transactions Given a weighted itemset X and a set of transactions referred to as D we say X has support in D if s

weighted itemset X is always less than or equal to the support of any of its generalization There are several different fo rmulations for the weighted support of the rule X 002 Y according to the different demand where X 003 I, Y 003 I and X 004 Y  005 The left-hand side\(LHS\f the rule is called the antecedent, while the right-hand side\(RHS\ called the consequence. In this paper the following form is used sup\(X 002 Y\untD\(X 002 Y\|D wsup\(X 002 Y\g w 1 w 2 w p sup X 002 Y  where p is the itemsê count of the itemset X avg w 1  w 2 w p is the average value of the weight of itemset X 006 Y and sup  X 002 Y pport of itemset X 006 Y before the item is associated with weight An itemset is said to be weighted-frequent \(large\f its support is larger than a given value \(also called minimum weighted support \(wminsup The confidence of the WAR de noted as conf is the ratio of the weighted support of X 001 Y over the weighted support of X The weighted support of X 001 Y  wsup the transactions is larger than wminsup, furthermore when X appears in a transaction Y is likely to appear in the same transaction with a probability conf X 002 Y is a valid rule if its weighted support wsup  X 002 Y eighted confidence wconf  A 002 B eet minimum weighted support \(wminsup and minimum weighted confidence \(wminconf B The introduction of multiple minimum supports Under multiple minimum supports conditions,recursive nature of apriori algorithm is no longer valid and the existing algorithms cannot be applied. The following example can prove this Suppose that there is a transaction database DB containes four properties A, B, C, D The multiple minimum support for each property is MIS  A  M IS  B 25 MIS  C 06 MIS  D 0.08 By scan two-highfrequent itemsets,we can obtain sup  A,B 12,Obviously A,B is less than the required minimum support A and B According to Apriori algorithm  A, B will be abandoned as a non-high-frequent itemset.However, after introducing the multiple minimum support strategy, from the new definition,we can find that the minimum support required of attributes C and D are only 0.06 and 0.08 respectively,they are both less than 0.12  A ,B, C and A,B,D should remain three-highcandidate-frequent itemsets.This shows that apriori nature is no longer valid after introducing the multiple minimum support strategy.The single minimum support cannot fully express the difference be tween mining object its own characteristics and the actual frequency.The minimum support set too high or too low cannot achieve good mining results.So in this paper we introduce the multiple minimum support strategy in data mining. The approach not only avoid generating too many rules of no practical significance,but also can mining low frequency rules effectively The multiple minimum support strategy is a data mining method that on the basis of maintain previously support define,set different minimum supports for different transaction itemsets.According to the characteristics of their own affairs,each requires its own minimum support C The definition of multiple minimum support For a given transaction database 002 let I ={i 1 i 2 i m  as the set of all transaction items. setting a minimum support MIS  i m  for each item i m  MIS  I    MIS  i 1  MIS  i 2  002  002 MIS  i m  III WNAILMS A LGORITHM All association rule mining algorithms similar to classical Apriori algorithm.The generating candidate sets are all based on Apriori nature.

For any  item i in the itemset I determine whether the support of j that after i in the itemset I meet WMIS of the current item.if meet the condition, Both will be composed of two sets into two focused on the candidate two itemset that composed of the two items  insert into candidate two itemset In candidate-gen,first, take out an itemset i from L k-1 in order, Then compare with all items  that  behind I one by one.If you concentrate on two items, in addition to other items outside the last one are the same.If in addition to the last item,the other items are all the same in two items. then Link  these two items  in order. And inserted the itemsets into C k After generating the candidate items,we also need pruning step. remove itemsets than users not interest from the candidate itemsets Pruning processing algorithm is as follows for each itemset c 010 C k do for eaeh k-1 bsets of c do if c  1  011 s  WMIS  c  2  WMIS  c  1   th en  if s 011 WL k-1 en delete from C k  For any k-1 subset of candidate k itemset,If the subset of current k-1 itemsets contains the current candidate k or when the two smallest of current k candidate items have the same value of WMIS and is a non-frequent itemset, its supersets \(the current k candidate itemsets\ot be frequent,then remove the current k candidate itemsets from the candidate itemset If SC count is equal or greater than c MS in the functions of getWFrequent and getWINFrequent item i in candidate itemsets is outputed to WL k as a frequent itemset otherwise i is outputed to WNL k Rules' generation is similar to references[2 IV E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS We  run the algorithms on a simulated  dataset to test the WNAIIMS algorithm.

results show that excluding itemset supports below minsup generally has little effect on clustering results particular for smaller values of minsup However there is some degradation in metric values for higher levels of minsup Here 223degradation\224 means that metric values are smaller when some itemset supports are excluded corresponding to a poorer clustering match to frequent itemsets We offer the following interpretation for the minsup dependent degradation in clustering metric Members of frequent itemsets are typically frequently cited documents overall Such frequently cited documents are likely to appear in many itemsets even less frequent itemsets Thus there are likely to be many itemsets below minsup that contain these frequently cited documents Excluding itemsets below minsup then removes the supports that these itemsets contribute to the summations in computing hybrid distances 5 Summary and Conclusions We have proposed a new methodology for visualizing association mining results A central component in the methodology is a new class of inter-item distances computed directly from itemset supports While the distances are computed from supports of itemsets of arbitrary cardinality they still retain a simple pairwise structure These hybrid pairwisehigher-cardinality distances thus allow the direct application of standard visualization tools such as clustering dendrograms However they require much less complex user interaction compared to that of working directly with all frequent itemsets The hybrid distances are computationally feasible via fast algorithms for computing frequent itemsets We provided a theoretical guarantee that under the new hybrid distances consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets is attainable independent of the clustering criterion We proposed the application of the hierarchical clustering dendrogram for association mining visualization which enables quick comprehension of complex distance relationships among items We also introduced new augmentations of the dendrogram to support the visual mining process by adding item descriptive text and graphical symbols for members of frequent itemsets We tested the effects of our new hybrid distances on hierarchical clustering dendrograms for large numbers of test cases with data extracted from the Science Citation Index In particular we compared dendrograms between a variety of hybrid distance formulas and standard pairwise distances in terms of a metric that measures consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets For the majority of the test cases metric values were higher for our hybrid distances indicating better consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets We also conducted experiments showing that excluding itemset supports below some minimum value has relatively little effect on itemset/cluster consistency so that it is reasonable to apply fast algorithms for computing the frequent itemsets needed for the hybrid distances This is the first known application of clustering for the visualizing association mining results The pairwise structure of the new hybrid inter-item distances allows the visualization of frequent itemsets of arbitrary cardinalities The nonlinear transformation of itemset supports helps ensure consistency between clusters and important frequent itemsets making frequent itemsets less likely to be obscured during visualization As a more basic contribution this work represents a first step towards the unification of association mining and clustering visualization 6 References l M Henzinger 223Link Analysis in Web Information Retrieval,\224 Bulletin of the Technical Committee on Data Engineering 23 special issue on Next-Generation Web Search pp 3-8 September 2000  J Kleinberg, \223Authoritative Sources in a Hyperlinked Environment,\224 in Proceedings of the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms January 1998, pp 3 H Small 223Co-citation in the Scientific Literature A New Measure of the Relationship Between Two Documents,\224 Journal of the American Society of Information Science 24 pp. 265-269, 1973 4 J Hartigan Clustering Algorithms John Wiley  Sons New York, 1975 5 R Agrawal T Imielinski A Swami 223Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases,\224 in Proceedings of the 1993 International Conference on the Management of Data Washington DC, May 1993, pp. 207-216 161 R Agrawal R Srikant 223Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules,\224 in Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Databases Santiago Chile September 1994, pp. 487-499 7 E Garfield Citation Index Its Theory and Application in Science Technology and Humanities John Wiley  Sons New York, 1979 8 H Small 223Macro-Level Changes in the Structure of Co-Citation Clusters 1983-1989,\224 Scientometrics 26 pp 5-20 1993 668-677 432 


which works off the circumstance lattice sweeping it level wise and is very expensive as well In the full paper we develop efficient algorithms for computing the Armstrong Basis suppressed here for lack of space 7 Discussion and Conclusions Recently there has been interest in mining long pattern s In this context algorithms for mining maximal frequent sets have been proposed Bay98 AAPOO This is relevant because of our interest in minimal circumstances However these algorithms operate in a different lattice and the mech anisms of the algorithms appear different Given our interest in the Armstrong Basis, these algorithms might offer yet an other way to efficiently find maximal frequent itemsets as sociated with a circumstance in that context The recent ly proposed FP-tree method HPYOO PHMOO has obvious relevance for circumstance mining and also for the compu tation of the Armstrong Basis We are currently exploring efficient algorithms for the Armstrong Basis based on the FP-tree method Finally as previously noted mining for cir cumstances in which a given pattern \(like frequent itemset holds has a close relationship with cube computation For lack of space we refer the reader to the recent paper BR99 which surveys many of the cube methods and which also describes the BUC algorithm In conclusion basing pattern mining on a clear sepa ration between item attributes and circumstance attributes pays its dividends the close ties with the cube computa tion paradigm and between cube computation and mining of i-anti-monotone patterns open up new and promising di rections for future work As motivated earlier, finding mini mal for c-monotone patterns circumstances under which a pattern holds for a specific itemset is useful in its own right The framework developed in this paper goes far beyondjust support-based mining of frequent itemsets This is achieved using properties of patterns on the bilattice of circumstances and itemsets Finally we proposed a useful notion of Arm strong Basis with which we can find \(say minimal circum stances where a pattern holds for an itemset and then find which other itemsets satisfy the pattern under these circum stances This is in the spirit of mining the result of min ing one of the important problems identified by Imielinski and Mannila in their seminal paper ImMa96 Just as data cube is an important operator for supporting queries involv ing multiple group-bys for queries involving migration be tween itemsets and circumstances Armstrong Basis can pro vide effective support More work is needed for its efficient computation and its use in answering such mining queries AS951 AAPOO R Agrawal and R Srikant Mining sequential pattem s ICDE\22295 pp 3-14 R Agrawal C C Aggarwal and V V V Prasad Depth first generation of long pattems KDD 2000 to appear R J Bayardo Efficiently mining long pattems from databases SIGMOD 22198 pp 85-93 K S Beyer, R Ramakrishnan: Bottom-Up Computa tion of Sparse and Iceberg CUBES SIGMOD 22299 pp S Brin R Motwani, and C.

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
