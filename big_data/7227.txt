model cloud-based service network data analysis I I NTRODUCTION The capability of modern applications e.g social networks computer networks wireless sensor applications of generating and collecting data has been rapidly increasing Since data mining focuses on studying effective and efìcient algorithms to transform huge amounts of data into useful and actionable knowledge the interest in data mining is continuously growing both in the industrial and research domains Industries are attracted by the business opportunities arising from the exploitation of the extracted knowledge while researchers are interested in the challenging issues coming from the application of data mining techniques to new scenarios Different data analytics tools rely on data mining 
algorithms to gain interesting insights from large volumes of semi-structured or unstructured data Data mining techniques allow extracting previously unknown interesting patterns such as groups of data objects cluster analysis unusual objects anomaly detection and dependencies association rule mining The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union under the FP7 Grant Agreement n 318627 Integrated Project mPlane When dealing with huge data collections like those of Big Data the computational cost of the data mining process and in some cases the feasibility of the process itself can potentially become a critical bottleneck in data analysis For example association rule mining algorithms which nd application in a wide range of different domains 
including medical images biological data 3 and network trafìc data are characterized by computationally intensive tasks Thus parallel and distributed approaches can be adopted to increase the mining efìciency and improve algorithm scalability The current trend explored by cloud providers such as Windows Azure is offering an increasingly heterogeneous portfolio of online services in the cloud spanning traditional IaaS Infrastructure-as-a-Service and PaaS Platform-as-a-Service as well as business analyticsoriented cloud-based tools Association rule mining is a two-step process i Frequent itemset extraction and ii association rule generation from frequent itemsets Since the rst phase represents the most computationally intensive knowledge extraction task 
effective solutions have been widely investigated to parallelize the itemset mining process both on multi-core processors 7 8 9 and with a distrib uted architecture 10  12 13 Ho we v er  when a lar ge set of frequent itemsets is extracted the generation of association rules from this set becomes a critical task The challenge of our work is to design and develop an association rule mining framework as a SaaS Software-asa-Service service model to offer a data analytics service to cloud users To our knowledge the association rule generation from frequent itemsets on a distributed architecture has not been investigated yet and represents a core contribution of this work More speciìcally this paper presents a cloud

task since a huge amount of interesting knowledge can be automatically mined to effectively support both service providers and Internet applications To proìle network communications we analyzed trafìc metrics and statistical measurements computed on trafìc ows The results showed the effectiveness and efìciency of the S E AR U M architecture in mining interesting patterns on a distributed computing model The paper is organized as follows Section II describes previous works Section III describes the problem statement addressed in this paper Section IV presents the S E AR U M architecture while a preliminary evaluation of our approach is reported in Section V Finally Section VI draws conclusions and discusses future extensions of the proposed approach II R ELATED WORK The mining task in association rule extraction entails two subtasks the frequent itemset generation and the subsequent association rule extraction The former subtask is more computationally intensive than the latter and it has been paid more attention by the research community leading to the deìnition of efìcient algorithms Initial parallel and distributed itemset extraction stemmed from algorithms based on the Apriori approach Further improvements include FP-Tree which e xploits preìxtree-like structures and a multi-tree approach proposed in P arallel processing o ws perform a sequence of three steps rstly a horizontal subset of the data is analyzed then a local FP-Tree is built nally the mining process is carried out on the local FP-Tree The candidate pattern bases from different processing ows are then merged together The good efìciency and scalability of this approach are counterbalanced by large memory requirements and node traversal redundancy with a high number of parallel processing ows  proposes an enhanced v ersion of the mer ging algorithm speciìcally addressing the cluster computing environment  discusses a tree partition approach based on a single tree In the context of very large datasets different constraints have been proposed in the parallel itemset extraction algorithm by leading to good scalability on a 32processor cluster Better hardware resource exploitation and improvement of the itemset extraction on multiple-core processors have been addressed by 9 A path tiling technique has been devised to enhance the FP-Tree algorithm in terms of performance by improving the temporal locality of data accesses at different memory levels Cache hint optimization was rstly addressed by this technique in which then found application also in the parallel itemset mining context Large-scale mining based on the MapReduce paradigm is based on algorithms that distrib ute data and computation across a distributed architecture  A parallel FP-Gro wth algorithm has benn proposed in The algorithm named PFP  aimed at supporting efìcient query recommendation for search engines PFP consists of two separate MapReduce jobs i.e no computational dependencies exists between them and achieves an almost linear speedup proposes some improvements with respect to particularly addressing efìcient load balance strategies thus achieving higher speedup and better performance III P ROBLEM STATEMENT Let D be a dataset whose a generic record r is a set of features Each feature also called item  is a couple attribute value  Since we are interested in analyzing statistical features computed on trafìc ows each feature models a measurement describing the network ow e.g Round-Trip-Time  RT T  number of hops An itemset is a set of features The support count of an itemsets I is the number of records containing I  The support s  I  of an itemset I is the percentage of records containing I  An itemset is frequent when its support is greater than or equal to a minimum support threshold M inSup  Association rules identify collections of itemsets i.e set of features that are statistically related i.e frequent in the underlying dataset Association rules are usually represented in the form X 002 Y  where X also called rule antecedent and Y also called rule consequent are disjoint itemsets i.e disjoint conjunctions of features Rule quality is usually measured by rule support and conìdence Rule support is the percentage of records containing both X and Y It represents the prior probability of X 003 Y i.e its observed frequency in the dataset Rule conìdence is the conditional probability of nding Y given X  It describes the strength of the implication and is given by c X 002 Y  s  X 002 Y  s  X   Given a dataset D  a support threshold M inSup  and a conìdence threshold M inConf  the mining process discovers all association rules with support and conìdence greater than or equal to M inSup and M inConf  respectively Furthermore to rank the most interesting rules we used the lift index which measures the symmetric correlation between antecedent and consequent of the extracted rules The lift of an association rule X 002 Y is deìned as lift\(X  Y  c X 002 Y  s\(Y  s X 002 Y  Y 1 where s X 002 Y  and c X 002 Y  are respectively the rule support and conìdence and s X  and s Y  are the supports of the rule antecedent and consequent If lift\(X,Y itemsets X and Y are not correlated i.e they are statistically independent Lift values below 1 show a negative correlation between itemsets X and Y while values above 1 indicate a positive correlation The interest of rules having a lift value close to 1 may be marginal In this work the mined rules are ranked according to their lift value to focus on the subset of most positively or negatively correlated rules

IV T HE S E AR U M ARCHITECTURE S E AR U M consists of a series of distributed jobs run in the cloud Each job receives as input the result of one or more preceding jobs and performs one of the steps required for association rule mining Currently each job is performed by one or more MapReduce tasks run on a Hadoop cluster The S E AR U M architecture contains the following jobs described in details in the subsequent sections  Network measurement acquisition  Data pre-processing  Item frequency computation  Itemset mining  Rule extraction  Rule aggregation and sorting Since our case study is based on network trafìc analysis we thoroughly describe the S E AR U M architecture in this application scenario Furthermore in the current design S E AR U M addresses a speciìc class of association rules whose consequent consists of a single item A Network measurement acquisition The rst step to analyse network trafìc is is collecting network measurements To this aim a passive probe is located on the access link vantage point that connects an edge network to the Internet The passive probe sniffs all incoming and outgoing packets owing on the link i.e packets directed to a node inside the network and generated by a node in the Internet and vice versa The probe runs Tstat 18 a passi v e monitoring tool allo wing netw ork and transport layer measurement collection Tstat rebuilds each TCP connection by matching incoming and outgoing segments Thus a ow-level analysis can be performed A TCP ow is identiìed by snooping the signaling ags SYN FIN RST The status of the TCP sender is rebuilt by matching sequence numbers on data segments with the corresponding acknowledgement ACK numbers To evaluate the S E AR U M cloud-based service in a realworld application we focus on a subset of measurements describing the trafìc ow among the many provided by Tstat The most meaningful features selected with the support of domain experts are detailed in the following  the Round-Trip-Time  RT T  observed on a TCP ow i.e the minimum time lag between the observation of a TCP segment and the observation of the corresponding ACK RT T is strongly related to the distance between the two nodes  the number of hops  Hop  from the remote node to the vantage point observed on packets belonging to the TCP ow as computed by reconstructing the IP TimeTo-Live 1 1 The initial TTL value is set by the source typical values being 32 64 128 and 255  the ow reordering probability  P  reord   which can be useful to distinguish different paths  the ow duplicate probability  P  dup   that can highlight a destination served by multiple paths 2  the total number of packets  NumPkt  the total number of data packets  DataP kt  and the total number of bytes  DataBytes  sent from both the client and the server separately the client is the host starting the TCP ow  the minimum  W inM in  maximum  W inM ax  and scale  W inScale  values of the TCP congestion window for both the client and the server separately  the TCP port of the server  Port   the class of service  Class  as deìned by Tstat e.g HTTP video VoIP SMTP etc Based on measurements listed above an input data record is deìned by the following features RT T  Hop  P  reord   P  dup   NumPkt  DataP kt  DataBytes  W inM ax  W inM in  W inScale  Port  Class  To obtain reliable estimates on reordering and duplicate probabilities only TCP ows which last more than P 10 packets are considered This choice allow focusing the analysis on longlived ows where the network path has a more relevant impact thus providing more valuable information B Data pre-processing This step performs the following two activities  Value discretization  Transactional format conversion Associaton rule mining requires a transactional dataset of categorical values The discretization step converts continuously valued measurements into categorical bins Then data are converted from the tabular to the transactional format An example is reported in Table I Automatic discretization approaches can exploit state-ofthe-art techniques e.g clustering statistical-based algorithms etc to select appropriate bins depending on data distribution These approaches yielded poorly signiìcant bins on network data considered in this study More speciìcally the most frequent values were split into too many bins with respect to the real applicative interest Hence discretized bins are xed-size and determined by domain experts based on the signiìcance in the networking context The xed-size bins have been determined as follows  RT T  a bin each 5 ms for values from 0 ms to 200 ms an additional bin for values higher than 200 ms  Hop  a bin for each value from 1 to 20 an additional bin for values exceeding 20  P  reord   a bin each 0.1 from 0 to 1  P  dup   a bin each 0.1 from 0 to 1 2 P  reord  and P  dup  are computed by observing the TCP sequence and acknowledgement numbers carried by segments of a given ow We refer the reader to for more details

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental
