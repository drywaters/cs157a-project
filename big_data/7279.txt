military avionic, missile and space applications and the increased data rates advanced FPGA\222s are transmitting and receiving data, the need for ruggedized and qualified fiber-optic components is becoming extremely important.  Design engineers considering fiber-optic signal distribution want the same or better reliability from a fiber-optic system that they have with an electronic signal dist ribution system.  They also require the Built-In-Test \(BIT and Fault Detection \(using optical refractometry\ability that is present in electrical signal distribution systems.

Combined with a corner-turn lens that mates to the parallel optic MT ferrule a small profile \(5 mm height\ransceiver module is realized Figure 1 shows the transceiver with evaluation board  Figure 1 \226 Transceiver, pigtail and eval bard configuration The fiber pigtail contains 50 micron core ribbon fiber with a silicon-based coating for protection.

 3 4  S INGLE E VENT U PSET T ESTING  SEU Set-Up The schematic of the test set-up is shown in figure 4.  Two quad transceivers were used in this set-up.  The \221transceiver under test\222 was placed in a radi ation beam and another was place outside of the beam. Seri alizer/deserializer \(SERDES devices drove four data channels into the transmit-side of the transceiver in the radiation beam \(on left side of figure The transceiver converted this data to optical signals that were brought into the receiver side of a second transceiver not in the beam  The output of the receiver was input back into the SERDES, closing the data loop.  The SERDES had a self-check feature, transmitting a pseudo random bit stream of length 7 \(PRBS7\tern and checking for errors against the received pattern.  A computer was set-up to monitor errors.  The computer also monitored the devices current supply draw and temperat ure.  To test the receiver the loop was repeated in reverse direction \(as shown in the right side of the Fig. 4 SERDES SERDES ERROR CHECK Transceiver in BEAM Transceiver not in BEAM SERDES OUT SERDES IN 4 4 4 fiber optic link electrical link electrical link SERDES OUT SERDES IN 4 4 4 4 fiber optic link electrical link electrical link SERDES IN SERDES OUT 4 4 4 fiber optic link electrical link electrical link TX RX RX TX  Figure 4: Schematic of SEU test set-up The SERDES device used in this testing was a Texas Instruments TLK2051, capable of data rates between 1.5 Gbps to 2.5 Gbps  Since heavy ions do not penetrate the normal transceiver packaging materials, provisions were made to allow direct access to the silicon-on-sapphire \(SOS packaging method normally places a \223thermal plug\224 near the surface of the transceiver IC For this test, the thermal plug was removed and the package was re-designed to remove heat from the non-circuit side of the SOS substrate Figure 5    Figure 5 also shows the method of packaging for radiation testing. The high speed signal I/O was provided by SMA cabling along the perimeter of the PCB.  There are four differential pairs \(8 cables\ electrical data entering the transceiver and four differential pairs with data exiting Transceiver circuit containing 225 4 VCSEL drivers 2254 receivers 1 x 4 PIN array 1 x 4 VCSEL array  Fig. 5: Bottom side of PCB.  The thermal plug was removed to provide beam access to the IC  The 8 fiber channels \(4 tran smitting and 4 receiving connected to transceiver in a 6\224 long ribbon cable.  This ribbon cable is looped up and connected to another longer cable that connects the two transceivers  Since the penetration of heavy ions into GaAs is roughly 30 microns, the radiation is not reaching the VCSEL or PIN device, whose GaAs substrates are 200 microns thick Therefore, this radiation testing was isolated to the transceiver circuitry  SEU TESTING RESULTS Heavy ion SEU testing was performed at the Tandem Van de Graaf facility at Brookhaven National Labs.  We performed testing on four parts with particle LETs from 13.14 \(Cl to 81.28 \(Au\eV-cm 2 mg.   The transceiver link was tested at data rates of 1.6 Gbps, 2.0 Gbps and 2.5 Gbps and at supply voltages of 3.15 V, 3.3 V and 3.45 V The temperature of the part within the chamber was 55 327 10 7 ions/cm 2 except for SN 4, which was tested at a flux of 1 260 C The transmitted optical power was fixed at -3 dBm with 7 dB extinction ratio on each transmitter channel.   The beam particle flux was set to 1 327 10 5 ions/cm 2 s and the testing was run for 100 seconds for a total fluence of 1 327 10 7 ions/cm 2 s \226 it was found that this level began to degrade the part, so the remainder of the parts were tested at 1 327 10 5 ions/cm 2 s  To determine a cross-section \(the sensitivity to upsets summed up the errors that occurred within the transmitter receiver and control logic.  In other words, any error that occurred within the part is counted as an upset.  Figure 6 shows the test results.    The four parts we measured showed consistent results across the LET range tested

We tested 4 devices at rates ranging from 1.6 to 2.5 Gbps per channel on 4 transm it and 4 receive channels running simultaneously.  This plot is a summation of any error occurring in the transmit path, receive path or in ternal configuration logic   The data is assumed to follow a Weibull distribution, which is curve fit to SN 2 at 2.5 Gbps and 1.6 Gbps.  Using the xaxis intercept as an estimation of SEU threshold, we find at 2.5 Gbps threshold is above 20 Mev/gm/cm 2 and at 1.6 Gbps the threshold is above 25 Mev/gm/cm 2   5  T OTAL D OSE T ESTING  Total-dose radiation testing was completed using a Co-60 gamma source at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, CA \(figure 7   Figure 7: Physical setup of test hardware in radiation beam   Two irradiation runs were completed.  \223Experiment #1\224 accumulated a dose of roughly 30 kRad\(Si\ \223Experiment 2\224 accumulated a dose of 100 kRad\(Si generally followed MIL-STD-883 Method 1019.7, however these were not intended as a qualification test. The dose rate in both cases was maintained at 23 rad/minute.   A transceiver module, referred to here at the Device Under Test \(DUT\rradiated in both experiments.  This device was operated at room temperature during radiation  Experiment #1 showed that the transceiver had good fundamental radiation hardness.  In particular, both the Tx and Rx high speed performance, including Rx sensitivity were comparable to pre-radiation levels.  However, this experiment did show radiation sensitivity in regards to various precision analog functionalities.  This result was somewhat unexpected given the known properties of Silicon-on-Sapphire \(SOS her investigation revealed that a key difference between the transceiver module construction and prior SOS application is the lack of a ground plane at the back of the SOS die.  The ground plane is believed to provide a discharge path for ionized charge To test the effect of the ground plane, we added an auxiliary AUX\ent #2.  The AUX board is a stripped down module in which the lens and fiber coupling have been removed to expose the back of the SOS die.  The back of the die was coated with conductive silver epoxy cured\ch was connected to electrical ground.  In Experiment #2 the DUT and AUX boards were exposed to 100 kRad radiation.  The AUX data shows that the grounding of the SOS die eliminates the majority of the radiation effects  Some radiation sensitivity did remain in the VCSEL power monitoring function. This effect was seen to saturate at approximately 20 kRad.  Mitigation of this effect by preirradiation of the modules would be an option  6  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper shows fiber optic transceiver performance over temperature along with initial characterization SEU and Total Dose radiation testing.  LET\222s greater that 20 Mev/mg/cm 2 were observed although the GaAs VCSEL and PINs probably were not properly radiated as heavy ions might not have penetrated through the 200um GaAs substrates.

frames that fall in each one of the subintervals Finally the program uses the number of frames in each subinterval to plot an approximation of the pdf We note that the number of intervals in range of frame types will correspond to the number of points of the pdf approximation This means that if the number of intervals is small then the plot of the approximate pdf will have a small number of points generating some difficulty in trying to determine an approximate pdf for that frame type On the other hand if the number of frames is too large then there is a very good chance that most of the intervals will have a very small number of frames that fall inside of them resulting in a very choppy plot for the pdf approximation Determining a good number of intervals for each type of frames depends in the number of the frames of that type being analyzed Another problem with such an approach is that by changing the number of intervals for the frame type being analyzed in the case in which the number of frames of that type is small the pdf plot generated can change significantly This is due to the fact that a large number of frames may fall on one side of the boundary of such an interval In the case in which one changes the number of intervals these frames will now fall inside a different interval There are some benefits however for using this Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer First of all it provides a very quick plot which is a rough approximation of the frame size distribution Although the approximations generated by the Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer are better the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer generates plots order of magnitude faster Also the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer provides statistics to the user for each type of frames such as mean and variance of frame sizes minimum and maximum frame size Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer In the previous subsection we presented a program which generates a quick and rough approximation of the frame size distribution given the input data from the video traces The problem with that analyzer was that the distribution generated by the program is highly dependent on the quantization level of the ranges of the frame sizes and is generally not a smooth function due to the limited number of frames in the data sets scenario each one of the frames analyzed should be assumed not to have a size which is deterministic but rather comes from a distribution which is centered on that frame size One such distribution generally used for this type of filtration is a Gaussian normal distribution The benefits of using such a filtration are as follows  The distribution generation will not need to use a quantization technique so the program will not suffer from the quantization issue  The frame size distribution generated using such a filtration method will smooth out some of the noise due to the limited number of data points  We have seen that gamma distributions tend to be a good approximation for frame size distribution of each type Since gamma distribution is a smooth function by filtering some of the statistical noise using a filtration it will enable us to better determine the parameters for the gamma distribution which best approximate video for specific mission scenarios Frame Distribution Fitting Tool This tool is used in conjunction with the Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer in order to approximate by a gamma distribution the pdf of the frame sizes for all three types of frames Using this tool the user is able to adjust the two parameters describing the gamma distributions particularly the mean and the K-value which directly influences the variance of the distribution In particular a larger scale will make the distribution taller and narrower For all the data sets the mean of the gamma approximation was taken to be equal to the mean of the true data The K-value was adjusted accordingly in order to best fit the approximation to the true data Analyzed data In this section we present statistical data for the various scenarios proposed This data was gathered using the tools described in the previous sections In Table 2 we provide for each scenario analyzed the mean and the variance of the frame sizes of the I P and B frames We also provide the K-value for the gamma distribution which is centered and the data mean and best approximates the statistical data We plot the approximate gamma distributions for the various types of frames for each one of this scenarios in Figure 3 In this section we present a program which does not suffer from the quantization issue of the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer Also this program filters out some of the statistical noise which is due to the limited data sets We motivate the intuition for this filtration as follows While making a video of a certain mission scenario a small change in the footage i.e the introduction of a small object in the picture may cause a small change in the encoded frame sizes For this reason while trying to derive a generic distribution to characterize a particular type of video 8

Figure 5 Statistically multiplexed traffic We note that in this case we would be able to utilize some of the free channel space for other types of transmissions which may be more delay tolerant see Figure 6 For example in this figure the bottom blue transmission can be thought to be a file which is packetized and needs to be transmitted down from the spacecraft We consider this file to be delay tolerant i.e the data is not needed right away down on the ground and it has a lower priority then the other traffics needed to be transmitted The delay tolerant packets will be transmitted only when the channel is not being fully utilized as to fill in the gaps available in the channel bandwidth This technique will delay the arrival of the delay tolerant traffic but will enable us to more fully utilize our channel bandwidth m T]T m Figure 6 Telemetry traffic along with delay tolerant traffic being sent via a channel We note in above scenario that although the delay tolerant traffic was transmitted at time 0 none of it was able to be transmitted until time 1 Also we note that the final delay tolerant traffic packet was transmitted 9 time instances later then it was received For this reason a buffering scheme must be devised such that all the delay tolerant traffic may be buffered until enough bandwidth for transmission exists Since no specific data was available on the dynamics of the various telemetry type traffics we developed a generic telemetry model which is formed by two types of traffic one constant bit rate which represents the sensory information which is constantly being transmitted down to the ground and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents file download and periodic data updates We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to telemetry constant bit rate  peak of intermittent transmission We will also assume that the intermittent transmission file transfer will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new files are ready to be transferred Using the above model we created a Matlab based tool for synthesizing traffic for simulation purposes The traffic generated by this tool is output to a file in a format which can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 5 COMMAND TRAFFIC MODEL The model for the command will be similar in spirit to the model which we have proposed for telemetry We see the data transmitted for command to be formed by two different types of transmission One constant bit rate which represents calls to various preloaded spacecraft subroutines and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents subroutine uploads to the spacecraft We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to command and we also assume that the intermittent transmission subroutine upload will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new subroutines are ready to be transferred Using this model we have developed a Matlab based traffic synthesizing tool The traffic provided by this tool can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 6 CONCLUSIONS This work has resulted in the development of a suite of traffic models that captures the fundamental types that will be in the space communications environment and in particular These models provide the capability to investigate the new IP-based communications functions and resulting performance that are required by the human exploration missions of NASA's Constellation Program and the Space Communications and Navigation SCaN network's ability to support them Four prototypical traffic models have been developed from which any number of streams may be generated 1 audio/voice 2 real-time motion imager live video 3 telemetry including both regular periodic data as well as intermittent file downloads and 4 command including periodic data as well as intermittent subroutine uploads The voice traffic model stochastically parameterizes calls talk times and talk spurts Multiple audio analysis tools were developed to assist in the derivation of parameters from data samples taken from relevant space missions Using these tools parameters of probability distributions were fit to data taken from Shuttle/ISS archives 12     n 


The characterization of motion imagery video traffic involved the stochastic characterization of I P B-frames of MPEG-4 sequences Several Matlab tools were developed to support video analyses wherein ISS and Shuttle specific mission video sequences were used to derive parameters for the associated model A general stochastic model was derived for data telemetry enabling broad parametric applicability ranging among constant bit stream periodic or bursty patterns This same general model through proper selection of parameters may also be used to model command data flow traffic Matlab programs were developed to enable each of the traffic types above to be synthesized and saved into a file for use by SCaN simulation for performance analyses Example flows were generated for a LEO case and an Ascent case and results illustrated using the SCaN Simulator These analyses show the need for such traffic models to determine packet loss including speech intelligibility and latency arising from both statistical multiplexing and potential use of DiffServ prioritization techniques when peak offered loads may undergo transient overload conditions 7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration REFERENCES 1 Esther Jennings and David Heckman Architecture Modeling and Performance Characterization of Space Communications and Navigation SCaN Network using MACHETE submitted to 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 1-8 2008 2 Michael Hammer and James Champy Reengineering the Corporation New York Harper Business 1993 3 G Edward Bryan Not All Programmers Are Created Equal 1994 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings February 5-12 1994 4 Voice Activity Detection Using Generalized Gamma Distribution in Advances in Artificial Intelligence part of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 3955 2006 5 Athina Markopoulou Fouad Tobagi and Mansour Karam Assessment of VoIP quality over Internet backbones In Proceedings of INFOCOM 2002 6 John Daigle and Joseph Langford Models for Analysis of Packet Voice Communications Systems IEEE JSAC SAC-4 6 1986 7 Harold Stem and Kim-Kwok Wong Modeling the on-off patterns in conversational speech including short silence gaps and the effects of interaction between speaking parties Vehicular Technology Conference 1994 8 0 Rose Statistical Properties of MPEG video traffic and their impact on traffic modeling in ATM systems Institute of Computer Science Report 101 University of Wurzburg 1995 BIOGRAPHY Tudor Stoenescu received a BS in Electrical Engineering  and an MS in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 1999 and a MSE and PhD in  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of Michigan in 2001 and 2004 respectively After receiving his PhD Dr Stoenescu accepted a Postdoctoral Scholar position in Information Science and Technology at California Institute of Technology In 2006 Dr Stoenescu joined the Telecommunications Architecture Group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory Dr Stoenescu's current research interests lie 13

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
