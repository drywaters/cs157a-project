Against the limitation of the classical algorithm for mining association rules Apriori algorithm, proposes an efficient algorithm to save time consumption. According to the three levels of reducing the number of non-frequent sets, avoiding calculating the items that is not existed and reducing the database redundancy items to improve the Apriori algorithm, saving lots of time and space in the algorithm process. Experiments results show that this algorithm can quickly and effectively mining association rules and help to identify potential, malicious attacks,   safeguard the overall network security situation Keywords-component; network security situation; data mining; association rules; apriori algorithm I  I NTRODUCTION  With the expanding of the network and the improving of concealment of aggressive behavior, the traditional and single defense equipment or testing equipment has been unable to satisfy the requirement of security problem which resulting enormous challenges in network security. Network Security Situation Awareness also known as NSSA 1  proposed as a new technology can be able to integrate all aspects of the security factors and predict the future development trends of network situation by obtaining understanding, and showing these security factors. However the large-scale network has some characteristics that is multinode, large volumes of data and complexity branches, and there must be many useless warning information so that the system can hardly analyze and evaluate the security of network situation accurately with the tendency of complication of the network intrusion and aggressive behaviors. In order to monitoring of network security in time and keeping the security of network situation, there is an efficiently data mining techniques can be used to identify the malicious aggressive behaviors through gathering integrating and analyzing the complexity warning information. There is a efficiently algorithm proposed in this paper which is mainly dealing with the section of processing association rules in data mining through researching on Apriori algorithm. It can keep the NSSA in real time and also make the network safety II R ELATED C ONCEPTIONS  A Network Security Situation Awareness NSSA originated from the situational awareness of air traffic supervisory. In the nineties of last century, Tim Bass firstly put forward the concept of NSSA in the literat and introduced it into the field of information technology security, which is used for the study of the next generation of intrusion detection system. NSSA means obtaining understanding and displaying security elements that can cause change of the network situation in the large-scale network environments, and it also could predict the development trend of the future  manager Situation visualization display Response and Early Warning Threat evaluation Situation evaluation Event Correlation Target identification Data preprocessing Process optimization control and management Netflow IDS Firewall  Figure 1 NSSA framework map As shown in figure 1, it is a typical frame structure of NSSA, which divides the realization of the NSSA into eight parts:1.

B Association Rules As one of the main techniques of data mining association rule mainly discovers the relationship that maybe exists among things from the back of data, and reveals the unknown dependence between data items. Whatís more association rule is the earliest technique used in intrusion detection and some other fields in network security. The association rule can be got by finding the association among the data items so that it can implement a function that inferring one data object from another, just as    12 1 associate aa a a nn    That is to say the trend or the behaviors in future can be predicted by the data mining, and make decisions that based on the known knowledge, so it could be used in the field of the situation awareness In order to ensure the real-time, the large-scale network always directly read unified events from the buffer, then makes a real-time association and inputs the unified events outputs the alarming message. But for the complex events the association rule must to be used as an auxiliary input. In a word, the implementation of the modules of the associated events can be more flexible and scalable by the detection which based on the extracted association rule of NSSA, so the potential and malicious attacks can be able to identify quickly and effectively, then ensures the overall NSSA C Progress of Mining Association Rules The core task of data mining is how to extract the association rule of NSSA from a large number of data which generated by the network[5 Th en, an i m p eccable r u l e  ba se will be established by taking advantage of the technique of the data mining of the association analysis which can be used to analysis the formatting data and generate the rules and input to the rule base in the intrusion detection As shown in Figure 2, it is the main structure of rule base in the data mining, and it details the Figure 1 about the data preprocessing and event correlation and target recognition All kinds of the information that collected by the data preprocessing should be standardized and normalized, and a record without redundant data in a specific format can be generated, then it can be used by the data mining. In addition the quality of the processing results will have a direct effect on the extracted feature of the users and the accuracy of the rules which have been deduced. Classification means getting the character of userí behavior and rules that extracted by data processing, and matches it with the rules or patterns which is exist in the knowledge base, so it can judge whether the administrator should be informed, and achieves the dynamic prevention 6 The rule base need to be updated when faced with new rules or patterns 7 and the rules in the base need to be merged as well, then the automatic learning and updating of the rule base will be come true Normal data  Data Collection Data preprocessing Data Classification Matching rules Administrator Judge decisions Data processing Production rules Abnormal data Storage rules Selfrule  Figure 2 Data mining structure based intrusion detection As a means of decision support, the rules that new added to the data base could timely detect the attacks in the network. The sample space of correlation analysis will be decreased by merging the events and rules so that the event that the same thing be alarmed repeatedly can be avoided and makes the association rule mining technique more practical in the NSSA system III D EFICIENCY IN A PRIORI A LGORITHM  A Association Analysis and Definitions Association analysis could detect various intrusion correlations of intruders, which will be able to export some unknown coordinated attack mode, thus constructing a new collaborative intrusion rules to ensure the large-scale network security. Taking TCP packets captured as an example, formatting it as a service type, source IP address destination IP address, source port number, destination port number and other attributes, there must be relevance between each other, so, we can use association analysis to mine the attributes and find their correlation, moreover, we need to establish association rules and retain the rules that meet minimum support and minimum confidence. Assuming        _ 1 _ 2  _  Ii i in  is a collection of items containing n elements. Given a transaction database that is      _ 1 _ 2  _   Dt t t n  where each transaction t is a non-empty subset belonging to I i.e tI  and there is a unique identifier I D Transaction I D corresponding with it Implication form is as follows that is about association rules to be mined   XYXIYIXY   1 Where X is called the premise of association rules Y is called the conclusion of association rules. The support and confidence of them are defined as follows    sup sup  TX Y XYXIYIXY portXY portXY T     2 sup    sup   p ort X Y confidence X Y port X    3 2013 2nd International S y mposium on Instrumentation and Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation \(IMSNA 768 


  TX Y   indicates the number of records about XY   contained in the database T represents the total number of records. The statistical significance of association rules in the entire data set is measured by support, and the degree of credibility about association rules is measured by the degree of confidence B Defects of Apriori Algorithm Apriori algorithm based on frequent item sets take the iterative approach of searching layer by layer, this algorithm is simple and easy to realize, but there are some insurmountable drawbacks. Firstly, there are too many times to scan the database: each system generates a candidate set the database must be scanned once, that is to say generation of length N frequent items, you need to scan N times. But usually there is a large number of transaction data in the database, and there is little memory capacity, which will certainly lead to overload of system I/O, so that each scan of the database longer, inefficient Secondly, calculation will produce a large number of intermediate itemsets: Apriori algorithm produce candidate sets C k through 1 L k   C k consist of 1 k C L k  k-itemsets, when k  increases, the number of candidate k itemsets generated increases exponentially, In particular, calculating some C k  that do not meet the requirements will spend a lot of time and system resources Thirdly ,with the increasing of the sample mined, some rules of the original rule base may have not meet the definition of the frequent item sets , and they wonít be used in future ,if we donít take some measures to deal with, the efficiency of system will gradually decrease for the affection of redundant items IV T HE I MPROVEMENT OF A PRIORI A LGORITHM  To deal with the deficiency in Apriori algorithm, there is a lot of improvement methods have been proposed by other scholars 8 Most of them have been improved the system efficiency through reducing the times of scanning the database. Aiming at the deficiency of the second and third part in Apriori algorithm talked above, there is a better algorithm represent as follows 1. The superset of non-frequent itemsets is a non-frequent as well due to the characteristics of downward closure in Apriori algorithm. That means if there is a sub-itemsets not exist in 1 L k  it is a non-frequent itemsets and we should remove it. This can reduce the scale of the potential frequent itemsets and accelerate the process of generating frequent itemsets 2. If frequent k-itemsets could produce k+1 itemsets, then the number of itemsets of the frequent k-itemsets will be greater than k According to this definition, we should scan the number of itemsets in 1 L k  at first, and if there exist a 1 Lk k   so that means canít produce frequent L k+1  itemsets, we mark it as C k and we can return C k  directly That is, when connection of the two itemsets and generated C k for the each item t in it, we need to determine whether 1 Lk k   it is no longer need to calculate C k if itís true for it and save the time for calculate C k After this, the item t  would not exist in C k so we could know Ct k  and delete t from C k reduce the size of C k and so does the C k+1 Thus, this can improve efficiency of the execution of the Apriori algorithm 3. It can produce L k through using L k-1 in this paper According to the knowledge of mining process, when calculate the support degree of the k-itemsets which length is greater than the k All those transactions in database have already exist in L k so it turns to be redundant. Thus, after calculating the k-itemsets, we should remove the transactions which length is k Therefore, we could reducing the number of data in database, the time of scanning database and improving the efficiency in this algorithm Algorithm is described as follows  INPUT: Transaction Database The Minimum Support Threshold OUTPUT: The Frequent Itemset In APRIORI BEGIN All Frequent Itemsets 1-Itemsets  Cycling Iterat 01 i Dminsup LD find_frequent_1_itemset D  L 1 on Until No k-Itemsets Can Be Found 02   Usin 03 g To Produce The Returned Is The Set Of All Frequent Itemsets 04 for k =2 k LL k-1 k apriori_gen minsup   L  k-1 L L LD return  kk L 1 U i=1  L k-1 S  05 Function apriori_gen minsup\BEGIN The Effect Of The Function Is Using to trive For 06   end C k apriori_gen minsup for each itemset do k L k L k-1 L k-1 LL  1k-1 for ea        ch item L L  2k-1 L set do 1 L  1   L  2 L  2       L  k 1   L if c has_infrequent k-1  t h en 12 12 1 2 L _subset c UL  12 if  L t D t h e n k-1  012\012\012  When Is Not In The Itemset Must Be Non-frequently The Calculation Can Reduce After The Is Deleted Directly    c c delete c L k-1       Return An Empty Directly Is Not Need   Calculat  ed   esle for each tr if L t k\then k-1 ansaction C k        return delete t esle subset t   for e C  k  C ach cand  i C  tk date    Delete All The Transactions Which Have  Length   Of   cC t delete C  t count  L  c C   kk c.count >= mins while e p l u k t     Function apriori_gen minsup\END Function  has_infreque  nt_subset c BEGIN To Judge Whet   L  k-1  her  In 07 L k-1  ngth\(\=k L k  dele L k-1 te t return c ha     Function has_infrequent_subset c EN   L  k D APRIOR  1 I s_infrequent_subset c or each k-1 subset s of c if then return TRUE return FALS L  k-1 f cL kE  1   END  In order to verify the improvement of the efficiency of this algorithm, we contrast the original Apriori algorithm and 2013 2nd International S y mposium on Instrumentation and Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation \(IMSNA 769 


the improved algorithm through the experiment simulation We compares the number of the association rule in data mining and the rest event in database between these two algorithms under a fixed number of database transactions the results is showing in the figure 3 and figure 4  Figure 3 The number of association rules of mining along with the change of time  Figure 4 The change of tran saction number in database The result represents that the improved association rule mining algorithm for mining association rules can be more efficient, and deleting the database of redundant events in real-time in the process of mining in the same time. It is also reducing the time of scanning transactions, improving the execution efficiency of the algorithm, and most importantly saving the time and the space required in this algorithm Then, it also enhanced the rule base of self-learning and the ability to automatically update, and ensured the completeness and effectiveness of the rule base. This can make the system more efficient identify potential, malicious attacks, the security of the whole network security situation V C ONCLUSIONS  The application of the association rule data mining techniques in the large-scale network situational awareness especially in the intrusion detection have been introduced in this paper. It is mainly detailed the connection between the network security situational and the association rules, and proposed an efficient algorithm which based on the deficiency of the Apriori algorithm and reduced the time consumption. This algorithm is improved from three levels it is reducing the number of the non-frequent itemset and avoiding to calculate the itemset that donít exist and decreasing the database redundancy. It greatly reduces the time of association rule data mining, and it is dependable and easy to implement and significantly better than that of the Apriori algorithm in efficiency. Although, we have made many progresses, to be a perfect NSSA system, it is difficult to implement the automatic learning and defense of the system and extend dimension of the data in the association rules. Thus, we still need to make more research on dealing with these problems A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported by the Chongqing electric power company of science and technology project in 2013; the National Natural Science Foundation \(No.61309032 R EFERENCES  1 Wei  Y, Lian Y F   and Feng D G A Ne twork S e curity Situational Awareness Model Based on Information Fusion,î Journal of Computer Research and Development, 2009, 46, pp.353-362 2 T i m  B a ss, ìI n t r u s i on Detection  S y stem s and Multisen sor Data Fusion,î Communications of the ACM, 2000, 43, pp.99-105 3 S ervin L, Dordes T Network Situa tional Assessm e nt an d Auto m a ti c Policy Change,î IEEE Journals & Magazines, 2007, 9, pp.18-23 4 J a m es  Llinas, Chr is toph er Bow m a n  etal R evi s iting the JDL  Data Fusion Model II,î in International Conference on Information Fusion 2004, pp.1218-1230 5 Liu M X Zhang Q  Y and Zha o H, e t a l  N etw o r k Se c u ri ty  S itu a tion Assessment Based on Data Mining,î in Adelaide, Australia, 2008 pp.542-545 6 A lcar az Cri s tina  and Lopez etal Wide-Ar ea Situational Awareness for Critical Infrastructure Protection,î IEEE Journals Magazines, 2013, 46, pp.30-37 7 Y a n Xu, Zha o Yang D o ng a n d L i n Gua n  eta l  P reventive D y na m i c Security Control of Power Systems Based on Pattern Discovery Technique,î IEEE Journals & Mag azines, 2012, 27, pp.1236-1244 8 L i N   Z e ng L   a n d He Q eta l   P ara llel I m ple m e n tation of A p r i o r i Algorithm Based on MapReduce,î in 13th ACIS International on IEEE, 2012, pp.236-241 9 S h w eta M, Ga r g D K Mining E f f i cient Associatio n R u le s  Through Apriori Algorithm Using Attributes and Comparative Analysis of Various Association Rule Algorithms,î International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering ISSN, 2013, pp.2277 1 B u ffa A   M a da y  Y  a n d Pa te ra  A  T etal   A p r io r i conver g e n c e o f the greedy algorithm for the parametrized reduced basis method ESAIM: Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis, 2012, 46 pp.595-603 1 Ka ra bata k  M Ince M C  A n expe r t s y s t e m  f o r d e tection of bre a s t  cancer based on association rules and neural network,î Expert Systems with Applications, 2009, 36, pp.3465-3469  2013 2nd International S y mposium on Instrumentation and Measurement, Sensor Network and Automation \(IMSNA 770

correlation patterns of larger size are found compared with contrast patterns While these tendencies do not always hold in general from the theoretical aspect the results show that the condition of relative cohesiveness  004 S   for a pattern set S is easier to satisfy than that of relative impact  002 S   in these datasets A set of correlation and contrast patterns having the same base patterns will give great help in the analysis of obtained patterns which in turn derive deep understanding of target dataset We assess the ratio of BPs to which conditional correlation and contrast patterns are associated The results are shown in Table III In the table columns CP 003 CP 002 and CP 003\002 denote the percentages of BPs having CP 003 CP 002 and both of them respectively We can observe that there are many BPs having no conditional correlation and contrast pattern On the other hand since the value of CP 003\002 is nearly equal with the smaller value of CP 003 and CP 002 in almost all cases we can conclude that BPs having conditional contrast patterns have a tendency to be associated with conditional correlation patterns An example of conditional correlation and contrast patterns

patterns in the gure have one extra edge representing a link formation pattern in common Although the precise assessments are not made the patterns might capture a process of communication diffusions and the common edge might play a key role for the diffusion V R ELATED W ORK In this paper we employ a link formation pattern as an element of correlation and contrast patterns A concept of link formation in a time evolving graph is proposed in  and an algorithm L FR-Miner is de v e loped to mine link formation rules However LFR-miner restricts base patterns to have only edges directly connected to the extra edge An algorithm GERM deri v es a g raph e v olution r ule  GER which might be regarded as a set of link formation patterns Different from the patterns in this paper a GER requires the extra edges have the same relative timestamps in common Furthermore neither correlation nor contrast is considered Correlation patterns HP and contrast patterns CP 002 can be viewed as an upgrade of hyperclique patterns   4 and conditional contrast patterns  into the g raph domain

respectively We deﬁne the correlation and contrast measures by adjusting those measures in itemset mining to a single graph setting with time information On the other hand the deﬁnition of a correlation pattern CP 003 by pseudo clique is original in this paper While a wide variety of graph patterns in time evolving graphs and graph sequences is proposed recently 2   m ost o f t hem w ith fe w e xceptions d o not consider correlation and contrast at all An algorithm CorSSS  enumerates a correlated patterns i n a g raph sequence However CorSSS takes a sequence of subgraphs as a pattern and the target is very different In  a correlated spatio-temporal pattern representing changes in an evolving graph is proposed While focuses on the correlation o f changes the time of link formation has been paid attention in our proposal To the best of the authors knowledge there is no proposal on contrast pattern mining in a time evolving graph VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we discuss the problem of mining correlation and contrast patterns of link formations in a time evolving graph To solve the problems we develop a top-down enumeration framework in which base patterns are mined by a graph miner and combinations of link formations are discovered by an itemset and a pseudo clique enumeration algorithms The experiments by real world datasets show the feasibility of the proposed framework As future work further experiments with large-scale datasets and careful evaluation of the quality of obtained patterns are necessary Furthermore developing correlation and contrast patterns based on other criteria e.g k plex is one of important future work R EFERENCES  M  B erlingerio F  Bonchi B  B ringmann and A  G ionis Mining graph evolution rules in Proc of the European Conference

 1   1   l  1 i 2  i  Hence the true frequency count of any item occurring on some input stream must be C  l  1 j  x 1  tc  j    j    where  is a small quantity 3  The number of items present in each input stream is thus n  C 4  Since synopses for d l  1  x input streams are transmitted through a node at level x  the load on the most heavily loaded link\(s is L  x  d l  2  x  n C  Clearly the maximum value of L  x  is achieved when   0  The expression for L  x  can be simpliìed to L  x  1  l  1 j  x 1  j  d x  j 1  Now our expression for the worst-case load on any link can be reduced to W  T    max x 0  1 l  2  L  x   We desire to minimize W  T   subject to the constraints  2   l  1  0 and  l  1 j 2  j   1 It is easy to show that this minimum is achieved when L 0  L 1    L  l  2  Solving for  2   l  1  we obtain  i   1  d  1  l  2   d  1 d  2  i  l  2 and  l  1   1  d  l  2   d  1 d  Translating to error tolerances we set  i   1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d for all 2  i  l  1  This setting of  2  l  1 minimizes worst-case communication load on any link We term this strategy MinMaxLoad WC Under this strategy the maximum possible load on any link is L wc   l  2   d  1 d d   1 counts per epoch Lastly we note that MinMaxLoad WC remains the optimal precision gradient even if nodes of the same level can have different  values Informally since with worst-case inputs all incoming streams have identical characteristics maximum link load cannot be improved by using non-uniform  values for nodes at a given level we omit a formal proof for brevity 2.1.4 Good Precision Gradients for Non-Worst-Case Inputs Real data is unlikely to exhibit worst-case characteristics Consequently strategies that are optimal in the worst case may not always perform well in practice In terms of minimizing the maximum communication load on any link the worst-case inputs are ones in which the set of items occurring on each input stream are disjoint When this situation arises a gradual precision gradient is best to use as shown in Section 2.1.3 Using a gradual precision gradient some of the pruning of frequency 3 Recall that we allow the frequency of an item to be a real number 4 More precisely each stream contains  n C  items of weight 1 each and one item of weight  n C  n C   Note that each input stream contains at most one item with weight less than 1 as stipulated earlier counts is delayed until a better estimate of the overall distribution is available closer to the root thereby enabling more effective pruning In the opposite extreme when all input streams contain identical distributions of item occurrences there is no beneìt to delaying pruning and performing maximal pruning at the leaf nodes as in strategy SS2 is most effective at minimizing communication In fact it is easy to show that SS2 is the optimal strategy for minimizing the maximum load on any link when all input streams are comprised of identical distributions we omit a formal proof Note however that SS2 still incurs a high space requirement on the root node R since it sets  1    We posit that most real-world data falls somewhere between these two extremes To determine where exactly a data set lies with regard to the two extremes we estimate the commonality between input streams S 1 S m by inspecting an epoch worth of data from each stream We compute a commonality parameter   0  1 as   1 m   m i 1 G i L i  where G i and L i are deìned over stream S i as follows The quantity G i is deìned as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i and also at least   S  times in S  S 1  S 2  S m  where  S  denotes the number of item occurrences in S during the epoch of measurement The quantity L i is deìned as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i  Hence commonality parameter  measures the fraction of items frequent enough in one input stream to be included in a leaf-level synopsis by strategy SS 2 that are also at least as frequent globally in the union of all input streams A natural hybrid strategy is to use a linear combination of MinMaxLoad WC and SS2 weighted by   The strategy is as follows set  i 1       1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d        for 2  i   l  2  and  l  1 1       1  d  l  2   d  1 d         We term this hybrid strategy MinMaxLoad NWC for non-worstcase Commonality parameter  1 implies that locally frequent items are also globally frequent and SS2 modiìed to use  1   is a good choice Conversely  0 indicates that MinMaxLoad WC is a good choice For 0  1  a weighted mixture of the two strategies is best 2.1.5 Summary The precision gradient strategies we have introduced are summarized in Table 3 Sample precision gradients are illustrated in Figure 3 3

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
