Environment problem such as the frequent water pollution accidents has become one of the most notable emergency management problems for our government. When there is an emergency water pollution event, it is important to make an effective emergency decision according to the information of real-time event and the appropriate response can mitigate the environment pollution and costs. Because decisions may need to be taken very quickly and with limited information

I I NTRODUCTION H EADING 1 After decades of rapid growth of economic, China is now 
facing acute environment problems and the increasingly worsening water pollution as w ell as frequent water pollution incidents has become one of th e most notable environmental problems. The severe water pollution accidents occurring one after another and their associated costs were striking reflections of the weakness of the envi ronmental emergency prevention and response system in China. Although China has 
Stepping up Environmental Protection\216 and the \215National Plan for Environmental Emergency R esponse\216\ to prevent and 
control water pollution, water pollution has not been contained effectively on the whole, and the problem is still serious Including the Songhua River Water Pollution Incident, a high

number of sudden water pollution accidents had taken place in recent years. Once there is a water pollution accident occurred the impacts on the human health, environment and society will become more difficult and more costly to control. If the emergency response is not appropriate, it could have crossboundary effects such as the domino effect[1-3   In the process of emergency rescue, bad decisions can have very serious consequences. This stems from the inherently unstable nature of emergencies. But decisions must be taken as soon as possible in limited time, incomplete information and decision pressure of real-time situation. The need for decisionmaking skills increases dramatically in water pollution emergencies. There are three constraints which pose particular problems for managers in emergencies. The first of these is the 
time constraint, the second one is limited information on which decisions have to be taken and the third is the decision load constraint, which springs from the very large number of decisions which emergency managers have to take   The emergency decision-making of a sudden water pollution accident is a multi-criteria decision making problem experts of each department of safety engineering are needed The amount of emergency management objectives in a sudden water pollution accident is large, the items of emergency decisions and their relationships are shown in figure 1. In such a multi-criteria decision making with group decision problems generally there arise situations of conflict and agreement among the experts as each expert has his own opinion or estimated rating under each criterion for each alternative 
Hence, finding a group consensus function of aggregating these estimated ratings to represent a common opinion is an important issue The purpose of this paper is to introduce a method of combining the individual opinions to form an emergency decision of sudden water pollution accident[5   Sin c e  t h e  subjectivity, imprecision and vagueness in the estimates of a given quantity enter into multi-criteria decision making problems of a sudden water pollution accident, fuzzy set theory is helpful in dealing with the fuzziness of human judgement quantitatively[6-8   In th is a r ticl e th e f u zzy g r ou p de cisi on  theory was used to make effective emergency decisions of a sudden water pollution accident Figure 1 Emergency decision items in a sudden water pollution accident II M AKING EMERGENCY DECISIONS OF WATER POLLUTION

Figure 2 shows the process of choosing emergency decision items of a sudden water pollution accident Figure 2 The procedure of making emergency decisions of sudden water pollution accident The rating of each criterion is described by some linguistic terms, which provide a more natu ral way to express the rating for assessing candidate items. These linguistic terms can be manipulated with fuzzy set theory and they can be interpreted as specific fuzzy numbers that allow us to perform the trade off analysis among various criteria.

The types of sudden water pollution accidents are various such as drainage of accidents caused by chemical industry, wastewater treatment plants and warehous e of dangerous chemicals. When there is an emergency event of a sudden water pollution accident which took place in chemical industry, the real-time situation is very comp lex and it is keep ch anging. It is very important to make emergency decisions according to the onsight situation of the event. For the three constraints which pose particular problems for managers in emergencies: time constraint, limited information and decision load constraint, it is hard for the decision maker to choose the best plans among several candidate items. So it is valuable of using simple and shortcut methods to help the decision maker An example of making an emergency decision of a sudden water pollution accident is used to illustrate the method. There are many items in decision-making of the accident such as

In Figure 2 0 024 Note that the assumption of independence between objects is not always true since in some applications the locations of objects can be dependent For example two classmates might go to the lecture theatre at the same time and we can infer one location from the otherês Furthermore the locations of an object at two consecutive timestamps are normally constrained by a speed limit i.e the current location of an object depends on its location at a previous timestamp More sophisticated models using conditional probabilities e.g a Markov model might be used in these scenarios If such knowledge is available it can be integrated into our techniques by modifying Equation 1 Recall that given thresholds  and wesay  is frequent if  and  In the uncertain scenario co-occurrence of the objects at the timestamps is no longer certain Instead cooccurrence is described by a  For example in Figure 2 the of for objectset is 0 144 0 456 0 096 0 304 Let be the timestamps that objects of are in the same cluster the probability that and is called the and it is denoted as  The frequentness probability is interpreted as the probability that objects of are in the same cluster for at least timestamps that satisfy gap constraint An uncertain spatio-temporal sequential pattern is denoted as co-occurrence of the objects at is uncertain Using a conìdence threshold  we formally deìne a as follows is called a iff and  Find for a spatiotemporal database of uncertain clusters the complete set of probabilistic frequent spatio-temporal sequential patterns The main computational challenge of our mining task is the calculation of frequentness probabilities for candidate patterns This is detailed in the next section III C ALCULATING F REQUENTNESS P ROBABILITIES A simple way to compute the frequentness probability is to enumerate all possible worlds of and sum up the probabilities of possible worlds with and  2 Table I S UMMARY OF THE USE OF NOTATIONS  In Figure 2 if we set 2 and 1 for pattern wehave 0 696 As mentioned before as the size of increases the number of possible worlds increases exponentially up to where is the number of clusters for which 0 With the assumption that timestamps in are mutually independent 20 we can simplify the calculation as follows   3 where  1   The computation of via Equation 3 needs to enumerate combinations of where  which is still inefìcient and the computation cost still increases exponentially with respect to the total length of the trajectory In Figure 2 to calculate for pattern  the combinations of fulìlling 2 1 are   and   0 6  0 24  1 0 Thus             0 696 To avoid the exhaustive enumeration of possible worlds or different combinations of mutually independent timestamps we propose a dynamic programming approach to efìciently calculate the frequentness probability We rst introduce some notations which are summarized in Table I Let be the rst timestamps of  where  The probability that occurs at least

approach As shown in Figure 3 we start from the bottom layer and store internal results for further calculations until we reach the leftmost node of the top layer In each layer  thus the width of each layer is 1 For 1 there are 1 layers in total For 1 we still need one internal layer i.e three layers in total Figure 4 a provides a zoom in of the internal layer 1 In each column  only those need to be calculated and stored The rightmost node of each row gets the for its column where Lemma 2 For example gets 2 for column 3 Whilst the leftmost node of each row gets for its column which is calculated as follows of the upper-left node is where get the maximum value of  The difference in between the upperleft node and other leftmost nodes is  Then of each leftmost node is equal to minus that difference Also 0 Thus 0  For example gets 2 4 3 1 for column 3 As shown in Figure 4 a each internal layer can be seen as a parallelogram with 1 and 1 Thus the number of nodes in each layer is given by 1 1 1 It is a quadratic function that reaches its peak for 2 Figure 4 b shows the number of nodes per internal layer for calculating  0 15  is minimal when 0or  and maximal when 2 Intuitively 0 means all the timestamps of are consecutive without a gap While means there is no gap constraint with  In this case timestamps are treated as a set and can be seen as transactions in frequent itemset mining We now state a key theorem for the computational complexity of our method to compute probabilistic frequentness are  To calculate  we need one bottom layer and one top layer and 1 internal layers or one internal layer for 1 Thus the total number of nodes needed is 2 1 1 1 1 for 1 or 2 1 1 1 for 1 Thus it requires time and space Our dynamic programming approach can check probabilistic support in linear time with respect to the length of the trajectory  This is a substantial improvement over the naive approach of enumerating all possible worlds Example 10 in Appendix shows how to use our approach to calculate from Figure 1 where  2 Assuming parameters In this subsection we explore and discuss probabilistic monotonicity criteria related to our formulation We also show that how these monotonicity criteria can be used as a probabilistic pruning technique to further reduce the computation cost of our dynamic programming approach  Lemma 4 indicates that increasing the tail gap allowed in a sequence increases the chance a pattern fulìlls the tail gap constraint In contrast Lemma 5 shows that increasing the minimum number of timestamps required in a sequence decreases the chance a pattern fulìlls threshold  Compared to the support monotonicity criterion of uncertain frequent itemset mining Lemma 5 e xtends the criterion by applying gap constraints to two sides of the equation Based on Lemma 4 and Lemma 5 we have  Lemma 6 suggests that the frequentness probability of the upper-left node of the th internal layer is no less than that of the upper-left node of the 1 th internal layer if  Lemma 7 indicates that under the setting of  the frequentness probability of the upper-left node of the 1 th internal layer is no less than that of the leftmost node of the top layer Recall that only patterns with are of interest in our task Together with Lemma 6 we now have the following probabilistic pruning rule During the bottom-up computation of  where  if the frequentness probability of the upper-left node of an internal layer  where 1  is less than 002  then this pattern can be pruned IV M INING P ROBABILISTIC F REQUENT S PATIO TEMPORAL S EQUENTIAL P ATTERNS We introduced a linear time solution to calculate the frequentness probability We now need to efìciently enumerate different combinations of objectsets with in to nd all patterns which are probabilistic frequent in an

It has been shown that the Apriori algorithm which uses a breadth-ìrst strategy is promising for identifying frequent itemsets in both certain and uncertain transaction databases The antimonotonicity of support also called the Apriori property can reduce the search space and thus speed up the mining process In order to apply an Apriori-based algorithm we rst need to show that the anti-monotonicity property still holds for the frequentness probability with gap constraint    Lemma 8 provides a pruning technique for bottom-up pattern searching That is if does not fulìll the probabilistic threshold then does not fulìll the probabilistic threshold if  We call this the Apriori pruning rule Similar to the classical Apriori algorithm our algorithm using breadth-ìrst implementation also involves two main steps a join step and a prune step The join step is responsible for generating new candidates In the prune step we calculate the frequentness probability for each candidate and extract probabilistic frequent patterns where  We start with an objectset containing a single object then iteratively generate new candidates by a join operation In each iteration we scan the database to calculate the frequentness probability for each candidate Next we output those patterns satisfying and probabilistic support Finally we use the Apriori pruning rule to eliminate those candidates with  Patterns discovered from the database in Figure 1 with the setting of 2 3 2 0 1 82  43  39  24  10 The process is shown in Figure 5 a One bottleneck of the Apriori algorithm is that the join step becomes time-consuming for a large number of candidates In our depth-ìrst implementaAlgorithm 1 Depth-ìrst implementation 1 Calculate the frequentness probability for each 1objectset and insert into if maximum object in    for each Extend    5 maximum object in CalculateFrequentnessProbability     9 if Apriori property  if    tion we simplify the candidate generation by simply adding one object to the objectset to form the 1 objectset which does not require a join operation Such a search order also carries over from a smaller objectset to a larger objectset It means the depth-ìrst implementation also can take the advantage of the Apriori property in the generation of candidate 1 objectset from objectset Algorithm 1 shows the depth-ìrst implementation We rst select frequent 1-objectsets line 1 and then recursively generate candidate 1 objectset from objectset line 5-12 At each iteration only the frequent objectsets are extended Apriori property line 10 We use a bucket tree structure to store candidate patterns and Figure 5 b shows an example of using the depth-ìrst implementation to nd patterns from the database in Figure 1 The tree grows from left to right Each bucket store a pattern represented by the path from root For example the bottom-left bucket represents the objectset  The tree stops growing once it encounters the infrequent pattern Compared with the former implementation the depth-ìrst strategy does not fully use the downward closure of the probabilistic support This is due to the fact that the depthìrst implementation does not know all frequent objectsets before considering the 1 objectset This may lead to a bigger search space For example Figure 5 b needs to calculate the frequentness probability of 20 candidates compared to 17 candidates of Figure 5 a The frequentness probabilities of three candidates  and are not calculated by the former implementation since they contain infrequent subset  and respectively V E XPERIMENTS We rst consider large synthetic datasets to test the efìciency of our dynamic programming approach for computing the frequentness probability Then we use both synthetic datasets and real-world vehicle tracking datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our two Apriori-based algorithms All

We rst use synthetic datasets with varying parameter settings to test the performance of our dynamic programming approach The size of the datasets varies from 10 timestamps to 10 6 timestamps The probability that an objectset occurs at is randomly chosen as  0 1  All results are the average of ten runs The probability threshold is 0.9 Both and gap constraint were set to 10 unless stated otherwise Abbreviations used in our gures 1 Basic basic approach of probability calculation c.f Equation 3 2 DP our dynamic approach 3 DP+Pruning our dynamic approach with pruning c.f Section III-B 4 BFS the breadth-ìrst implementation of our algorithm 5 DFS the depth-ìrst implementation of our algorithm Figure 6 a compares the performance of our dynamic programming approach against the basic method The elapsed time of the basic method increases exponentially when increases The elapsed time of the basic method is out of the scale from the gure if is less than 50 In fact the total number of combinations of timestamps in the basic method has already reached 10 10  Thus the basic method is not practical The scalability of our proposed dynamic approach is illustrated in Figure 6 b The performance of proposed approach is very promising as increases the running time grows in a linear trend as in line with our time complexity theorem c.f Theorem 1 To isolate the effect of the maximum gap constraint on the running time we turn off the minimum timestamp threshold by setting 1 This minimizes the effect of on the running time The running time for calculating is shown in Figure 6 c where varies from 0 to 9999 The running time reaches a peak at 5000 the mid point which is consistent with our analysis from Figure 4 b In Section III-B we showed that the probabilistic pruning rule can be applied if  Using this setting for  we test the running time with three different values of as shown in Figure 7 Setting a strict 75 threshold the probabilistic pruning rule shows a signiìcant speed up In contrast if we apply a relatively loose  then the two lines in Figure 7 a overlap since patterns in such a setting more likely fulìll the probabilistic threshold and cannot be pruned Two real-world vehicle trafìc datasets 3 and synthetic datasets generated by the Brinkhoff generator 4 were used to evaluate our two Apriori-based algorithms for mining probabilistic spatio-temporal frequent sequential patterns The settings for our two real-world dataset are as follows 1 a bus dataset recording 2 school 3 http://www.rtreeportal.org 4 http://www.fh-oow.de/institute/iapg/personen/brinkhoff

buses collecting and delivering students around Athens for 108 days and consisting of 145 trajectories 2 a truck dataset recording 50 trucks delivering concrete to construction sites around Athens over 33 days and consisting of 276 trajectories To increase the size of moving objects we considered each distinct trajectory as the ID of an object yielding 145 buses with 1713 timestamps and 276 trucks with 2449 timestamps This is a common pre-processing method The timestamp update frequenc y w as set to every 30 seconds Any second of a timestamp falling into the range 0 30 was normalized to 15 and to 45 otherwise For example the timestamp 23:22:22 gets normalized to 23:22:15 and 23:22:58 to 23:22:45 The soft clusters at each timestamp are obtained by the fuzzy means clustering algorithm with 2 and 0 01 where is the weighting exponent and is the termination criterion Each object is assigned a belongingness probability by the fuzzy clustering algorithm The number of clusters at each timestamp is drawn from 2 We rst ran our algorithms on the datasets with 2 10 and 0 5 The number of found patterns is illustrated in Figure 8 a The largest object cluster we discovered from the bus dataset has 6 objects compared to 4 for the truck dataset In addition 2-objectsets and 3objectsets are a dominant proportion of the patterns found in the truck dataset whilst the size of objectsets in the bus dataset is more uniform We further test the effect of the probabilistic threshold on the running time and number of patterns found see Figure 8 b and c respectively As increases the Apriori rule has more effect and thus the running time of both implementations decreases The effect is more obvious for the truck dataset With a smaller search space the breadth-ìrst implementation outperforms the depth-ìrst implementation for both datasets In Figure 8 c the truck dataset returns more patterns than the bus dataset does for lower  However as increases the number of patterns found in both datasets decreases signiìcantly especially for the truck dataset There are only 25 patterns found in the truck dataset with 0 95 We use the map of Oldenburg as input map data To control the exact size of the objectset we test we vary the number of objects from 100 to 1000 and set the number of newly generated objects at each timestamp to zero The maximum number of timestamps is set to 10000 To make moving objects last longer thus the data has more timestamps we set the speed divided by 250 which is the default value for slow Other parameters were set as default In order to test the effect of the probabilistic distribution of belongingness probabilities on our algorithms we assign the belongingness probabilities to objects manually rather than by applying a fuzzy clustering algorithm We rst apply DBSCAN with 2 and 0 05 to obtain certain clusters at each timestamp denotes the minimum number of objects in a cluster with a radius of  Then we assign the belongingness probability to each object The belongingness probabilities of these datasets were assigned according to two different distributions 1 Each object was assigned a probability according to a uniform distribution in the range of 0.5 2 Each object w as assigned a probability according to a normal distribution with a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.2 in the range of 0 if the probability is outside the range we assign the boundary value of 0 or 1 The parameters of our algorithms are set as 2 10 and 0 5 The results are shown in Figure 9 Again the algorithm using the breadth-ìrst implementation generally outperforms the depth-ìrst implementation The elapsed time for each of the two different probabilistic distributions is not signiìcantly different However there are many more patterns found in the datasets that use a uniform distribution than the datasets with a normal distribution as shown in Figure 9 c VI C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we have formulated and studied the problem of mining probabilistic frequent spatio-temporal sequential patterns in uncertain databases We proposed a dynamic programming approach for computing the frequentness probability with linear time complexity This is a somewhat surprising result Linear time support checking has been shown to be possible for uncertain itemsets However sequences have a more complex structure than itemsets and gap constraints add even further complexity We further introduced and evaluated two Apriori-based algorithms using breadth-ìrst and depth-ìrst implementations for efìcient enumeration of all probabilistic frequent spatiotemporal sequential patterns from uncertain databases In our further study we aim to extend our current approach to be able to handle the trajectory data where the identity of objects is uncertain A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research is funded by the Australian Research Councilês Discovery Grant project number DP110100757 A PPENDIX The calculation of in Figure 1 where

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
