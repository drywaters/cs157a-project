The experiments further validate the feasibility and rationality of this method. The setting of minimum support will affect the number of web browsing patterns, which has a great impact on the forensic investigation. However, the experiments are not perfect. For example, the experimental results were not intuitive, and the meaning of parameters is not clear enough Currently, we carried out some useful exploration and research in the behavior pattern mining. However identification of crime patterns has not been taken into account and only some initial results have we achieved. Many technologies are still implemented in the lab. There are many practical issues needed further study. There are also many problems waiting for us to solve. The construction of the behavior pattern library will gradually improve in the future studies A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research work has been supported by the National Nat ural Science Foundation of China \(No 61103175,61300103\ the Technology Innovation Platform Pro ject of Fujian Province\(No.2009J1007\ the Natural Science Fo undation of Fujian Province \(No. 2012J01265\, and the Science and Technology Project of Fuzhou\(2013-G94\ Corresponding Author: Prof. Guo Long Chen, cgl@fzu.ed u.cn R EFERENCES  1  Bennie Fei M.Sc, Jan Eloff, Martin Olivier, and Hein Venter, ìAnalysis of Web Proxy Logs,î Advances in Digital Forensicss II:IFIP Advances in Information and Communication , 2006, vol. 222, pp. 247-258 2  Cooley R, Tan P N, and Srivastava J, ìDiscovery of interesting usage patterns from web data,î Web Usage Analysis and User Profiling Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2000, pp. 163-182 3  Yu-Shiang Hung, Kuei-Ling B.

This is because we cannot consider whole data and must identify when a data becomes obsolete or invalid As the old information of a data stream may be no longer useful or possibly invalid at present.  In order to support various requirements of mining data stream, the mining window or the interesting recent range of a data stream needs not to be defined static but must be flexible. Based on this range, a data mining method can be able to identify when a transactions becomes stale or needs to be disregarded  In this paper, we have investigated the problem of mining frequent itemset over data stream using flexible size sliding window model and proposed a new algorithm for this problem. The size of sliding window is adaptively adjusted based on the amount of observed concept change in the underlying properties of incoming data stream. The size of window enlarges or increase when there is no significant amount of change observed. While the window size reduced or decrease when there is considerable amount of concept change or significant change in set of frequent itemsets occurs Based on the value of given by user, the size of window is being controlled. After every pane insertion the set of frequent itemsets are updated and value of concept change is calculated. If the value exceeds the given minimum change threshold the window gets smaller by deleting all the obsolete information before a point defined called checkmark  Experimental results shows that our algorithm tracks the concept change efficiently while mining data stream and is more adaptive to recent frequent itemsets than fixed size sliding window models or time fading window models. For the future work, we are trying to enhance the performance by using fuzzy sets for minimum change threshold value so that the values like low, medium, high and very high instead of certain value between ranges of 0 to 1 R EFERENCES  1                    H.

Our experiments show that YAFIM is about 18 faster than Apriori algorithms implemented in MapReduce framework Furthermore, we can achieve a better performance in both sizeup and speedup for different datasets. In addition, we also evaluated YAFIM for medical application and revealed that YAFIM outperforms MRApriori about 25 speedup  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is funded in part by China NSF Grants \(No 61223003\, and the USA Intel Labs University Research Program R EFERENCES  1
