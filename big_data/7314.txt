2.1 Apriori Association Rule Mining Algorithm    21 22221 112 11 3 Where 0,0 IB has confidence c in the transaction set D the value of percentage of D contains affairs B and affairs A at the same time is c similar to the conditional probability  roved Matrix Sortin contains the j-th item in itemset I then the matrix value of the i-th row and j-th column is 1 the 1  each transaction has an identifier called TID Association rule is an form The basic conception of association rules algorithm is set I is data item D is task-related transaction database set each element T in the D is a set of items and  the element  Rule  as equation 1 and equation 2  sup njDi if miDi if A j j ij Z Hong et al n improved Apriori algorithm which uses support count matrix to generate frequency itemsets 16 J Pavon D Oguz et al proposed an algorithm called Matrix Apriori combining the best f eatures of both Matrix Apriori utilizes simple structures such as matrices and vectors in the process of generating frequency patterns and it also minimizes the number of candidate sets thus achieving a more efficient calculation than Apriori and FP-growth The proposed algorithm can be easily extended to incorporate multiple minimal supports defined by the user with the aim of improving method efficacy 17 18 A Z e ng el at proposed a measure of cosine similarity which treated as an interest threshold moreover proposed an improved Apriori algorithm called Sim-Apriori based on similarity 1 The study shows that the shortcomings of Apriori algorithm are mainly the requirement of repeatedly scanning the database and generate a larger numbers of candidate itemsets problems above improvements of association rules mainly aim at improving the Apriori algorithm efficiency and database scanning time The matrix algorithm scans the database one time and changes the item value to Boolean improved the efficiency but not deletes the unwanted item and affair which increased the calculation However the improved efficiency of the Apriori algorithms and matrix algorithm are low to a certain extent therefore this paper proposed an improved matrix sorting index association rule data mining algorithm under the premise of scanning database only once utilize matrix multiply and sorting index which greatly improved the efficiency of the algorithm and supports updating mining This paper presents an improved matrix and sorting index association rule data mining algorithms called IMSIA of matrix the idea is Combine the advantage of matrix algorithm high efficiency in k-frequency generation and high information search speed of sort index convert the transaction database to transaction matrix then no longer scan and use the transaction database directly research on the affairs matrix delete the initial matrix obtained pruning matrix before the deletion of the matrix in which the numbers were placed in two sequences for subsequently search table after the deletion update the two mark sequences Multiply the deletion of the matrix with its transpose matrix obtained by the new matrix analyze their data on the triangle and search the sequences to determine the two-frequent item sets Base on the two-frequent item sets create sort index matrix using sorting index matrix to down connections and finally get all of the frequency itemsets ij A 1  2 Set of items called itemsets itemset contains k items is called a k-itemset If the item set to meet the minimum support minSup then called frequency itemsets Rules also meet the minimum support threshold and minimum confidence threshold is called a strong rule that is the association rules Mining association rules is to find the given minimum support and minimum confidence of all the conditions of implications which namely strong association rules Apriori algorithm using an extent-first search strategy level-wise iterative search item set space Firstly scan the transaction database once calculate support of each data item and generate candidate itemsets C l  and utilize support threshold to produce frequency 1-itemsets L 1  Connect L 1 and itself get candidate itemsets C 2 then search the database twice calculate the support of candidate itemsets C 2  compare the support of each candidate itemset with minsup obtain the L 2  And so on until you cannot find frequency k-itemsets the algorithm search end Rule p g mn

Rule Data Mining Algorithm i.e both A and B in D It is the probability of  ij A 2Im njmiIA ij  501 BAP  21 called affair vector Association rule have two properties Property 1 A record does not

each column represents an item If the affair The basic idea of the matrix algorithm is to scan the transaction database set D to a Boolean matrix arrange the transaction database D contain m items and n affairs The entire database can be represented by the items matrix namely as equation 3 and  is defined as equation\(4   BA 


3 L k  the process of data mining is down connection the sorting index matrix When k  3 start a scan from the first row R1 in the last column of the itemsets index number as the goal go to the row of the index number Rx connected the 2-itemset corresponds to R1 and Rx to 3-itemset Use the smaller support number of two 2-itemset as su pport number of the connected 3-itemset In the way by row until scanned the last row all the frequent 2-itemset is connected get all frequent 3-itemsets Then determine whether to continue generating frequency 4-itemset depending on the association rule property When k>3 as following steps to generate frequency k-itemset 1 Start scanning the established sort index matrix from the first row R1 and down the connection If the row does not contain 1 and the row exactly has the k-2 same index number y then directly jumps to the corresponding row R y of index number and connects this row and k-1 itemset of R y as kitemsets If the row does not meet the conditions of  According to the two association rule properties to delete the invalid items and affairs in matrix A and derive matrix B and update sequence  itemset of V to replace non-zero elements of the j-th itemset use the next position number as index to replace the original column value 1 Assign the last non-zero elements of current column with 1 When frequency k itemsets k  1,2  n Afterwards delete the properties of the matrix but beforehand have to mark the affair with the corresponding sequence of items marked for exclusion after deletion of the matrix S=A*A T can be obtained by multiplying 2.3 Im 2.4 Improved Adaptive Sorting Index Matrix The following are the main step assigned to the affair matrix and generate frequency 2-itemset search the affair database D and initial the affair matrix A fill the sequences item mark r roved Affairs Matrix Multi  1,2   m Vj minsup i<j search the sequence mark obtain the frequency 2-itemset lication and Mark Sequence Search Analysis ij S ij S 3 Use 1-itemset L 1 of in descending order as the columns of the matrix and descending order frequently k-1 item set as rows to establish a sort index matrix If a line item set I 1 corresponds to a value of 1 and I 3 is 1 the row represents a 2-itemset I 1 I 3  Where in each row frequent k-1 itemset for each itemset is also in accordance with the support number decreasing order to arrange Since the sorting rule has a great influence on sorting index result and usually the way to fix the rule by author which could not choose the optimal sorting rule the adaptively choice of optimal sorting rule between confidence and support is proposed in this paper By calculating the support and the confidence of each itemset compare the value of minsup and minconf if the quantity of matched itemset less then choose the corresponding minsup or minconf as the sorting rule if the database only give one parameter in that way choose the given parameter as the default sorting rule For each column save all the row number of non-zero elements to array A in order If the number of items in a column containing the index is less than the minimum support threshold then delete the column and the column corresponding frequent itemsets of itemset row For each column row number value of 1 c L r L 502 with minsup If  Multiply the matrix B with matrix B T S=B*B T  analysis upper triangular matrix of S Compare the value of r L c L c L L p p  and affair mark The Apriori algorithm need to calculate the candidate itemsets C k and then execute a pruning operation to frequent itemsets L k  that generate frequency itemsets will produce a large set of candidates and find each frequency itemsets have to scan the database once which take up a lot of memory space and CPU processing time it is difficult to adapt to massive data mining Matrix Association Rule Mining algorithm does not delete the non-frequency items and affairs and also need to search the data to find the frequency itemset which increase the calculation While these algorithms have been able to reduce the number of candidate sets or through pruning strategies to improve mining efficiency but still not completely solved the problem of candidate set produce Since the most important feature of the index is to speed up information retrieval Through index number to leaping search itemsets if the line does not meet the condition of down connection then does not need to scan it again which improved the speed of itemsets mining With the defect of large calculation in the apriori algorithm of generating 2-frequent itemsets Matrix association rule mining algorithm converts a affair database to a affair matrix by matrix operations the upper triangular matrix formation were analyzed to obtain the frequency itemsets eliminating connecting steps and pruning step in Apriori algorithm greatly reduced high calculation time of generating frequency itemsets The IMSIA algorithm is proposed in this paper which combined the advantages of index and improved matrix association rule avoid the generation of candidate sets and solve the problem of multiple scans of the database Firstly delete the useless items and affairs and use sequence search to get frequency matrix The step as follows The affair database is converted into Boolean database affair matrix D and the matrix corresponding to the ranks of the marker sequence affairs and saved to the corresponding entry in a table set up a database affair and contain m*n items the corresponding marker sequence and  Since the apriori algorithm needs to search the database and generate the candidates which occupies large memory and increased I/O costs Because of the most important feature of the index is to speed up information retrieval and the sorting index storage the number which occupies little memory and through index number to leaping search itemsets if the line does not meet the condition of down connection then does not need to scan it which reduced the search time index quantity memory usage and I/O expense This paper at the basis of improved matrix algorithm and combined the improved adaptive sorting index matrix which only scan the database one time and not need to generate candidates and adapt to choose the sorting rule to sort which improved the calculation efficiency and raised the performance of mining association The step as follows when the k of frequency itemsets is more than 2 then use the improved adaptive sorting index matrix by adapting to choose optimal sort rule and traversing the index number to leaps search the k-itemsets k

Compare running time of different supports show in Figure 4 Which can be seen under the same data sets T  1000 I  30 the running time of proposed IMSIA algorithm at each support is always less than Apriori algorithm and Matrix algorithm which means that proposed IMSIA algorithm before computing frequency 2-itemset firstly delete useless item and affair decrease the amount of unnecessary

This is because we cannot consider whole data and must identify when a data becomes obsolete or invalid As the old information of a data stream may be no longer useful or possibly invalid at present.  In order to support various requirements of mining data stream, the mining window or the interesting recent range of a data stream needs not to be defined static but must be flexible. Based on this range, a data mining method can be able to identify when a transactions becomes stale or needs to be disregarded  In this paper, we have investigated the problem of mining frequent itemset over data stream using flexible size sliding window model and proposed a new algorithm for this problem. The size of sliding window is adaptively adjusted based on the amount of observed concept change in the underlying properties of incoming data stream. The size of window enlarges or increase when there is no significant amount of change observed. While the window size reduced or decrease when there is considerable amount of concept change or significant change in set of frequent itemsets occurs Based on the value of given by user, the size of window is being controlled. After every pane insertion the set of frequent itemsets are updated and value of concept change is calculated. If the value exceeds the given minimum change threshold the window gets smaller by deleting all the obsolete information before a point defined called checkmark  Experimental results shows that our algorithm tracks the concept change efficiently while mining data stream and is more adaptive to recent frequent itemsets than fixed size sliding window models or time fading window models. For the future work, we are trying to enhance the performance by using fuzzy sets for minimum change threshold value so that the values like low, medium, high and very high instead of certain value between ranges of 0 to 1 R EFERENCES  1                    H.
