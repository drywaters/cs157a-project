Disease prediction plays an important role in data mining. There are different types of diseases predicting in data mining namely heart diseases, lung cancer and breast cancer  This paper analyzes the heart disease predictions using classification algorithms. These hi dden patterns can be used for health diagnosis in medicinal data. Data mining technology afford an effective approach to latest and indefinite patterns in the data. The information which is identified can be used by the healthcare administrators to get better services. Heart disease was the most important reason of victims in the countries like India, United States. Data mining techniques like Association Rule Mining, Clustering, Classification algorithms such as  5 algorithm, Neural Network [8  use d to explore th e different kinds of heart based problems   Dat a m i ni ng t echni que s l i k e C 4 5 al g o r i t h m and  K-means clustering are used for validating the accuracy of medicinal data. These algorithms can be used to optimize the data storage for practical and legal purposes II  RELATED  WORK  The data mining techniques includes different works to explore a variety of diseases such as Cancer Diabetes Heart diseases. Heart disease is the most important reason of fatality in the UK, USA, Canada, and Engl and [2 Heart d i sease k ills individual in each 32 seconds in the world. Jyoti Soni et al proposed three different supervised machine learning algorithms for heart disease prediction. They are NaÔve Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, and Decision tree. Thes e algorithms have been used for analyzing the heart disease. Tanagra is the data mining tool used for classifying these medi cal data and these data are calculated using 10 fold cross validation. Naive Bayes algorithm performs well when compared to other algorithms [3  Genetic algorithm have been used in [6  t o red u ce t h e definite data size to obtain the best possible subset of attribute which is essential for heart disease prediction. Classification is supervised learning method to extract models relating main classes of data. Decision Tree NaÔve Bayes and Classification via clustering are the three cla ssifiers used to analyze the occurrence of heart dis ease for the patients. Shekar et al proposed new algorithm to mine association rules from medical data based on digit sequence and clustering for heart attack prediction the entire data base is divided into partitions of equal size, each partition will be called cluster. This approach reduces main memory requirement since it consider only a small cluster at a time and it is s III  MATERIALS  AND  METHODS A  Data Preprocessing  Cleaning and filtering of th e data might be necessarily carried out with respect to the data and data mining algorithm employed so as to avoid th e creation of deceptive or inappropriate rules or patterns. In preprocessing first it selects an attribute for selecting a subset of attributes with good predicting capability. It handles all missing values and investigates each possibility. If an attribute has more than 5% missing values then the records should not be deleted and it is advisable to impute values where data is missing, using a suitable method

B  K-means Clustering  Grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group is more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Clustering is an unsupervised learning. The algorithm clusters informationís into k group s, where k is considered as an input parameter. Next it assigns each informationís to clusters based upon the observationís proximity to the mean of the cluster. The clusterís mean is then more computed and the process will continue again. The k-means algorithm is one of the simplest clustering techniques and it is commonly used in medical imaging and related fields. The steps involved in Kmeans algorithms are as follows  Choose the number of clusters, k  Randomly create k clusters and find the cluster midpoint  Consign each point to the closest cluster midpoint  Recompute the new cluster midpoints  Iterate the above two steps until various convergence condition is met   The preprocessed data is clustered using k-means to cluster relevant data in the heart disease database shown in Table I.Kmeans algorithm produces a specific number of separate, nonhierarchical clusters. It is a simplest algorithm and performs faster than other clustering algorithms. It allows run on huge databases. It is mainly suitable for globular clusters C  MAFIA  The association rule mining problem is a main predicament in the data mining field with various realistic applications such as user medical data analysis, intrusion detection  MAFIA is used for mining maximal frequent item sets from a transactional database [4 Th is algo rith m is m a in ly efficien t  when the item sets in the database are very long. The search strategy of this algorithm integrat es a depth-first traversal of the item set lattice with efficient pruning mechanisms. A 006C I an item set, and call A a k-item set if the cardinality of item set A is k. Let database X be a multiset of subsets of I, and let support A\be the fraction of item sets B in X such that A 006C B.If support\(A\inSup, then A is a frequent item set, and indicate the set of all Frequent Item sets\(M FI\ FI. If A is recurrent and no superset of A is frequent, then A is a Maximally Frequent Item set, and denotes the set of all Maximally Frequent Item sets by MFI  MAFIA efficiently stores the transactional database as a series of vertical bitmaps, where each bitmap represents an item set in the database and a bit in each bitmap represents whether or a given customer has the corresp onding item set. Initially, each bitmap represents an item set in database. The item sets that are checked for frequency in the database become recursively longer and the vertical bitmap representation works perfectly in conjunction with this item set extension D  C4.5 Algorithm  Classification is an unsupervised learning used to predict the class of objects whose class label is unknown. It is used for creating classification rules by means of decision trees from a given data set   Decision tree is used as a prognostic model. C4.5, C5.0 CART, ID3 are methods for building decision trees  It is an extension of the basic ID3 algorithm. By using C4.5, decision trees can be building from a set of training data with the information entropy. It is a statistical classifier. It outputs can be in the form of if then rules A.Sample Algorithm    Test for base cases  For  each  element  n,determine  the  normalized information gain from separating on n o  Let n_best be the element with the highest normalized information gain  Construct a decision node that breaks on a best  Recur on the sublists found by separating on n_best, and attach these nodes as children of node  TABLE I.

This is because we cannot consider whole data and must identify when a data becomes obsolete or invalid As the old information of a data stream may be no longer useful or possibly invalid at present.  In order to support various requirements of mining data stream, the mining window or the interesting recent range of a data stream needs not to be defined static but must be flexible. Based on this range, a data mining method can be able to identify when a transactions becomes stale or needs to be disregarded  In this paper, we have investigated the problem of mining frequent itemset over data stream using flexible size sliding window model and proposed a new algorithm for this problem. The size of sliding window is adaptively adjusted based on the amount of observed concept change in the underlying properties of incoming data stream. The size of window enlarges or increase when there is no significant amount of change observed. While the window size reduced or decrease when there is considerable amount of concept change or significant change in set of frequent itemsets occurs Based on the value of given by user, the size of window is being controlled. After every pane insertion the set of frequent itemsets are updated and value of concept change is calculated. If the value exceeds the given minimum change threshold the window gets smaller by deleting all the obsolete information before a point defined called checkmark  Experimental results shows that our algorithm tracks the concept change efficiently while mining data stream and is more adaptive to recent frequent itemsets than fixed size sliding window models or time fading window models. For the future work, we are trying to enhance the performance by using fuzzy sets for minimum change threshold value so that the values like low, medium, high and very high instead of certain value between ranges of 0 to 1 R EFERENCES  1                    H.
