Abstract 
In this paper we present a novel algorithm called FMiner to mine the complete set of frequent itemsets by pattern growth The F-Miner algorithm uses two new compact data structures Ascending FP-Tree AFP-Tree and Frequent Pattern Forest FP-Forest to represent the conditional databases When we construct an AFP-Tree the items in frequent 1-itemset are ordered in frequency ascend

ing order The AFP-Tree structure is traversed in top-down depth-\002rst order The root of the AFP-Tree is not 224null\224 but an item which can identify this tree AFP-Tree has a onedimensional array which stores the counts of every treenode's item except root-node In F-Miner we need many AFP-Trees to store a conditional database these trees construct one forest called FP-Forest We test our algorithm versus several other algorithms on real world datasets such as BMS-POS The experimental results show that our algorithm is an ef\002cient algorithm on both sparse and dense databases

Frequent itemset mining is a fundamental and essential problem in data mining and can be used in many data mining applications These applications include association rules analysis correlations analysis classi\002cation clustering outlier analysis and many other important discovery tasks Since the pioneering work in the problem of ef\002ciently generating frequent itemsets has been an active research topic

itemset is frequent all of its

algorithm still suffers from two main problems of repeated I/O scanning and high computational cost One major hurdle observed with most real datasets is the sheer size of the candidate frequent 2itemsets and 3-itemsets One innovative approach of discovering frequent itemsets in transactional databases 
 representing frequent patterns that alleviates the multi-scan problem and improves the candidate itemset generation The algorithm requires only two full I/O scans of the dataset to build the pre\002x tree in main

mining on existing test-cases of a system to suggest highly relevant feature locations uniquely related to features Similar to existing dynamic analysis based feature location techniques, FLMiner makes use of scenarios. However, it has the following improvements over the existing techniques: \(a\t doesn't require users to create scenarios users can simply tag existing test-cases with the features they execute; \(b\ it doesn't require a distinct scenario for each feature, test-cases can execute multiple features and a feature can be executed in multiple test-cases; \(c\ it doesn't require users to perform cleanup on the execution-traces of scenarios due to feature dependencies FLMiner provides users guidance on the quality of the suggested feature locations and whether the results can be improved if more labeled test-cases are provided for a feature. Furthermore, it provides an end-to-end automated process to locate features from the execution of test-cases automatically to outputting feature location suggestions On fuzzy inputs, where a scenario can execute multiple features and a feature might be executed by multiple scenarios, our technique yields results, on average, within 83 97% of the results provided by a well-known successful technique [17 on b as e cas e in pu ts  a  dis tin c t s cen a r i o f o r  each feature Based on experiments on three case studies labeled test-cases yield the results described above, where there are  features. Furthermore, more labeled examples yield better results As future work, FLMiner can be complemented with static analysis to yield better results, as in [6, 17, 18   It c a n  also be improved to work for non-functional features Currently, we evaluate FLMiner against [1 b y  c o m b inin g execution traces of scenarios for each feature. As future work, we plan to evaluate it on the whole test-suite of each case study. As part of this experiment, we also plan to evaluate how fast it converges and stops for asking for more labeled test-cases. Finally, we plan to evaluate the interaction of developers and FLMiner to assess the usefulness of FLMinerês guidance on labeling test-cases as input VII A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was supported in part by NSF Grants CNS0932403 and 0729029, as well as a generous donation of phones by Qualcomm VIII R EFERENCES  1

Figure 6 is not as signiìcant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
