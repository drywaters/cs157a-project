Data Mining techniques have been applied to almost all areas such as Education, health care, Stock market, etc. Since the data size is getting increased exponentially maintaining high performance plays a major challenge in the field of data mining. The data may be in structured format or unstructured format and hence the research on extracting the frequent pattern which is repeated in an iterative fashion seems to be really difficult. The paper aims at evaluating the performance of a Hadoop single node cluster with respect to Big Data. Apriori based Association rule mining algorithm was used to find the frequent patterns and then their rules. Finally the time taken to perform the entire data mining task was found and the performance is evaluated  Keywords 227 Big Data, Hadoop, Data Mining, Frequent Item Sets, Cluster   I  INTRODUCTION In our day to day life the need of data and the process of applying are relatively huge. Due to this enormous development in the recent times the data may be in structural format or semi structural format and the volume of data gets increased simultaneously. There may be various mining process, but in parallel they have their own limitations such as time frequent, data accessibility When it comes to Big Data [7 s n o t an ea s y ta sk  to  find their associations with the normal mining process e n ce to ov ercom e t h at t h e perf or m a n c e  is done in Hadoop. With the concept of 223MapReduce\224 we can easily associate the relative terms and generate the frequent item set in less time sequence. Searching in Big Data and extracting the relevant information is not an easy task to be achieved II  REVIEW OF EXISTING WORK  Real-time Analytical Processing \(RTAP was used in stream computing to improve business responses \(i.e., data in motion\. It can be implemented in Big Data but the need of this analytical processing and where it is being applied gets differed from it [2 s a p p lied in d a ta in g e st io n  and processed in real time streaming, data queried in online fashion and RAM based processing A. Map Reduce Framework  Is one of the Google\222s assets provided to the world. Due to this framework the distributed programming has become an easy way for  execution and retrieving the information from the Big Data. It became more popular due to these advantages and it is freely accessible. The wide range of usage and the availability needed in the industry has to provide Map Reduce with relative efficient and easy to use data mining methods Sandy Moens et al pro pos ed a  m odel relate to Frequent Item set Mining, it implements two mining methods for large datasets. They are DistEclat and Big FIM. It deals with the speed and the optimization through which scalability is defined on large data sets. In this frequent item sets are mapped and mined using these methods with K-fIs algorithm Xindong Wu et al en t a m odel  related to data mining in Big Data using HACE theorem. They have explained about the data driven models, Big Data revolution, Big Data processing

It explains that while extracting the data should have some pattern from that mining, which  is applied and analyzed. It may relate to any field or any traditional architecture, but we have to define the structure and methods to implement using various algorithms and tools to extract it   The concept involved in MapRedu  mapping and splitting va rious nodes in Hadoop Distributed File System. The reduced job is like it combines those data tuples from the data node. That is, through which it generates a new name node for each process it gives the direct access to the data node. Once the mapped process gets initiated later the reduced job will be performed. By this process the MapReduce improves the performance and the real time access  Figure 1 III  PROPOSED SYSTEM  The implementation of MapReduce can be done in the Apache Hadoop framework. Which is an open source tool. It is a data set cluster in which data can be stored and processed e t e r o g e n e ous Bi g Data is the main source to be executed in this framework. During the implementation the retail data is converted/considered as the Big Data source and the storage medium in Hadoop Distributed File System n ce t h i s dat a i s proces s e d i n t h e  framework, then the MapReduce is implemented by considering all the data which is split into multiple nodes termed as name node and the data node. Both have the details of mapped data through which data is easily accessed. The analyzing factor plays a major role in mining Big Data.

They are interrelated and both are used to provide the efficient mining process to find the associations existing in Big Data Initially, all the datasets are extracted from the Transaction system, which is the information processing system that involves the collection modification and retrieval of all the data. It also includes reliability, consistency and supports the transaction process. Various processes are involved such as Bach processing, real time processing, Time sharing and Transaction processing using this process the data can be easily used in further processing methods  Node1  Node2   Node3   Mapping Process Node1    Reduce Node2    Reduce Node3    Reduce  Output

Only the relevant information will be present in this module    Big Data Engine is the backbone of this process model. Through this all the associations and the item sets are extracted and sorted out. The modules inside this Engine are Hadoop, HDFS  and MapReduce. Hadoop Distributed File System is the file system for Hadoop through which data is stored and accessed.

File system counters contains the information about the number of files read, written, read operation, write operation and large read operation. Initially, these processes take place in two layers, one on file system and the other in HDFS C. Job Counters  Using the extraction process, the performance is found.  Performance is evaluated by launching the data, mapping it and reducing it further. The time take for the process was in milliseconds. The process remains the same, even if the data size varies D.

Performance and Speed are the two major factors to be considered for Big Data.  When Big Data is implemented on this platform, there was a small difference in performance and the speed  Initially we moved our retail data set from local host to HDFS. The data set can be of any format and any size. From HDFS the data set in a MapReduce framework were extracted. The execution time for the whole process is about 15sec The total time spent by all mappings in occupied slots is in milliseconds and the total time spent by all reducing in occupied slots is also in milliseconds When the process was repeated, the time taken for mapping and reducing was decreased. From this, it can be inferred that Big Data on Hadoop environment is more efficient.  The performance evaluation graph will describe the real time difference of mapping and reducing \(Figure 4 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 4000 Mapped reduced 1st process 2nd process 3rd process  Fig. 4 Performance Graph of Mapping and Reducing VI  CONCLUSION  It's based upon performance evaluation in the Hadoop single node cluster. The resultant output is obtained by the same performance. Based on the processor and the size of the data set the performance and the execution may differ in the multiple node clusters. But in this execution, the performance level is high and the execution time is very less and while repeating the same process the execution time keeps on reducing, that results in the performance in Hadoop with Big Data REFERENCES 1   Moens, S.; Aksehirli, E.; Goethals, B., "Frequent Itemset Mining for Big Data Big Data, 2013 IEEE International Conference on vol., no., pp.111,118, 6-9 Oct. 2013 2   A.Bog, \223Benchmarking transaction and Analytical Processing Systems", In-Memory Data Management Research, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-38070_3, SpringerVerlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014 3   J.

Retail is a sparse dataset  consists of product sales data from retail stores Each transaction in the Retai dataset represents purchase information from one consumer at a time The details of the datasets are presented in gure 6 The programming language used to implement all the three algorithms is java and run in 3.3 GHz Intel processor 4 Gbyte memory and Windows 7 32bit OS Figs 7…9 show results of runtime experiments regarding the real and synthetic datasets shown in gure 6 In these gures we can observe that IHT-growth outperforms the others in all of the cases IHT-growth uses the proposed header tree structure to store the 1-frequent items instead of the older header table to minimize access times to search items As a result its advantages have a positive effect on reducing runtime in whole experiments Especially in the case of Retail dataset the difference of runtime between our algorithm and the others is much more than the other datasets  In all experiments FP-growth shows the worst performance Note that IHT-growth method can be used with any fptree mining to improve its ef“ciency We suggested here two methods to implement the new algorithm If we dont know the number of items in advance the First method is suggested In this experiments we used the second method By using the second method we can create a more ef“cient BSHTree because all the items with highest frequency will be appeared on the top of the BSHTree By using this method the run time can be improved by minimizing the searching time of items while sorting out the transactions VI CONCLUSION This study proposes an ef“cient transaction processing method during the transaction scanning time By applying the ef“cient binary search tree the mining time drastically reduced The new transaction sorting method is also improves the performance of mining The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the fp-growth and IFP-growth two well known and widely used algorithms Here we used a BSHTree after the rst scan to store the items with support count While using the BSHTree we used the actual names of items as keys This method can be applied to improve the mining process with any frequent itemset mining algorithm which is using a header table R EFERENCES  Jia wei H an Jian Pei and Y iwen Y in Mining Frequent P atterns without CandidateGeneration,SIGMOD 00 Proceedings of the 2000 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data.Pages 1-12  Gw angb umPyun a Unil Y u n a  K eun Ho Ryu  E f cient frequent pattern mining based on Linear Pre“x tree Knowledge-Based Systems 55 2014 125…139  Y uh-JiuanTsay a T ain-Jung Hsu a Jing-Rung Y ub,FIUT  A n e w method for mining frequent itemsets,Information Sciences 179 2009 1724 1737  K e-Chung Lin I-En Liao  Zhi-Sheng Chen An impro v e d frequent pattern growth method for mining association rules Expert Systems with Applications 38 2011 5154…5161  F an-Chen Tseng An adapti v e approach to mining frequent itemsets ef“ciently Expert Systems with Applications 39 2012 13166…13172  R Agra w al T  Imielinski A.N Sw ami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases in Proceedings of the ACMSIGMOD Conference on Management of Data pages 1993 pp 207…216  R Agra w al R Srikant F ast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules very Large Data Bases\(VLDB 1994 487499  Xiaobing Liu K u n Zhai W itold Pedrycz An impro v e d association rules mining method,Expert Systems with Applications 39 2012 13621374  Qiao yongwei,Y ang Hui Dong T ingjian,Research On QAR Data Mining Method Based On Improved Association Rule,Physics Procedia 24 2012 1514-1519  T  Hu S.Y  Sung H Xiong Q Fu Disco v ery of maximum length frequent itemsets Information Sciences 178 1 2008 69-87  G Lee U Y un K Ryu Sliding windo w based weighted maximal frequent pattern mining over data streams Expert Systems with Applications 41 2 2014 694-708  S.K T anbeer  C.F  Ahmed B.S Jeong Y  Lee Ef cient single-pass frequent pattern mining using a pre“x-tree Information Sciences 179 5 2008 559583  V S Tseng C.W  W u B.E Shie P S Y u  UP-Gro wth an ef cient algorithm for high utility itemset mining Knowledge Discovery and Data mining KDD 2010 253-262  T  W u  Y  Chen J han Re-e xamination of interestingness measures in pattern mining a uni“ed framework Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery DMKD 21 3 2010 371-397  J Han H Cheng D Xin X Y an Frequent pattern mining current status and future directions Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery DMKD 15 1 2007 55-86  Zaki Mohammed J Naren Ramakrishnan and Lizhuang Zhao Mining frequent boolean expressions application to gene expression and regulatory modeling International Journal of Knowledge Discovery in Bioinformatics IJKDB 1.3 2010 68-96 1084 2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing Communications and Informatics ICACCI

paying a price of a slightly worse ratio for subsets Taken together the price of having more subsets is preferred because subsets contain only items actually in the assembly while superset and overlap patterns also contain unrelated items The 002rst and second row of 002gure 8 correspond to the instance and the pattern-based approach for graded synchrony The third corresponds to the instance-based approach for binary synchrony Comparing the diagrams for unrelated patterns our graded method detects all injected patterns 050\002rst and second rows\051 while the binary method also produces unrelated pattern In 050Borgelt et al 2015\051 it is demonstrated that the instance-based approach yields slightly better results than the pattern approach However this approach does not consider the precision of synchrony Surprisingly using only the pattern-based approach with a graded notion of synchrony yields a better ratio for overlap and superset patterns 7 CONCLUSIONS In this paper we presented a method to detect frequent synchronous patterns in event sequences using a graded notion of synchrony for mining patterns in the presence of imprecise synchrony of events constituting occurrences and selective participation 050incomplete occurrences\051 Our method adapts methods presented in the literature to tackle selective participation using binary synchrony especially the instancebased approach which looks at instances of patterns to improve the detection by removing instances that are likely chance events checking the precision of synchrony of these instances We demonstrate in our experiments that using a graded notion of synchrony for support computation helps to simplify the detection of selective participation because a pattern-based approach yields better results or at least equally good results as an instance-based approach This is a considerable advantage since identifying the individual pattern instances is costly and thus it is desirable to avoid it ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The work presented in this paper was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness 050MINECO Grant TIN2012-31372\051 and by the Principality of
