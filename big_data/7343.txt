  1 LIDAR versus Satellite-Measured Optical Thickness of a Wildfire Aerosol David S. Stoker, Gilda Fathi, Pavel Ionov, Steven M. Beck The Aerospace Corporation 2350 E. El Segundo Blvd El Segundo, CA  90245 david.s.stoker@aero.org  Abstract 227A dual UV, Rayleigh/nitrogen Raman LIDAR system was developed for the purpose of profiling aerosols at vertical ranges between 0.025 and 5 km.  The 355 nm LIDAR was operated in El Segundo, California during June and July 2008, during a period of intense wildfire activity in Northern California 1,2 From the two independent measurements we calculated th 
e particle backscatter, and using the humidity-correct ed LIDAR backscatter-toextinction ratios given by Ackerm  we cal cul a t e d aerosol optical thickness \(AOT\rofiles.  Preliminary validation studies revealed th at under most conditions the calculated LIDAR AOT data agreed with total AOT measured from a collocated sun photometer, except for cases when high-altitude smoke from wildfires was present To account for high-altitude smoke, a two-layer atmospheric model was assumed, where the lower layer\222s AOT was calculated using the backscatter-to-extinction method and the high-altitude AOT was found through direct attenuation of the Raman signal.  A comparison of AOT measurements from the ground-based LIDAR and the 
MODIS \(Aqua and Terra\ed during the peak period of transport of smoke from Northern California, between 19 June 2008 and 2 July 2008.  While the LIDAR and Sun Photometer were found to be in good agreement, it was found that the MODIS overpasses consistently indicated a larger AOT  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION 1  2  M ETHODS 1  3  R

differentiate clouds from aerosols \226 usually by identifying and removing areas of high scatter that also have high levels of water vapor.  It is assumed, however, that vertical aerosol 1  1 978-1-4244-2622-5/09 25.00 \2512009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1415, Versi on 6, Updated Nov 2, 2008 distributions are homogeneous \226 something that is often not the case.  In fact, this case is certainly violated in areas such as Southern California where coastal marine aerosol layers may be superimposed with wildfire smoke plumes.  Such a scenario is not uncommon and inconsistencies between ground-based and remote satellite measurements are often 
observed.  While non-uniformities in background are known to play a role in the accuracy of MODIS optical depth in the western US, we would also like to know the effect of vertical aerosol inhomogenaeities on AOT retrieval accuracy.  In order to answer th is question it is necessary to establish a reliable ground-based data source that can independently measure AOT and identify whether there is an inhomogeneous aerosol layer  A number of methods exist for quantifying AOT and because they utilize different a pproaches, they tend to have different accuracies and biases, and they behave differently under different atmospheric conditions.  For instance LIDAR, because it is an active remote sensing approach, is most sensitive at night when solar background radiation is low.  Sun photometers, on the other hand, operate best at 
midday when the sun is brightest.  These measurement techniques, when combined with a satellite observation comprise a set of orthogonal approaches that can provide an approximation of the true AOT, and can be used to determine conditions under which one or more may deviate 2  M ETHODS  The general approach of the study involved establishing a self-consistent ground-based AOT measurement that could also be used to detect vertical aerosol distributions.  For the AOT measurement, we used a CIMEL sun photometer identical to those used with AERONET[2].  To detect the vertical distribution of the aerosol layer, we used LIDAR 
First, agreement between the ground-based LIDAR and the sun photometer was established.  Following that measurements were made prior to and during a period of time in July 2008 when a wildfire plume originating in northern California was observed in southern California Because the methods of sun phot ometry as well as remote satellite observations of AOT have been treated extensively in other documents, this section focuses on the steps required in order to achieve agreement of the ground-based sensors.  Furthermore, because the method used to extract AOT from the LIDAR data relied on assumptions inherent in Mie calculations, we used the initial comparison between 


  2 the LIDAR and the sun photometer as a means to estimating the type of aerosol in the LA basin and the accuracy of the chosen Mie parameters.  As a result, what follows in this section is primarily a description of the LIDAR apparatus and the data reduction procedure. Instead of solely measuring the aerosol optical thickness by comparing the experimental nitrogen backscatte r \(which measures the total molecular and aerosol losses\comparing it to the theoretical molecular backsca tter, we used an extraction method that uses a lookup table to determine the optical thickness from aerosol backscatter.  For the lookup table we used the maritime LIDAR ratio, corrected for relative humidity and wavelength developed by Ackerm   The LIDAR was based on a 355 nm, tripled YAG laser source and a 30 inch Cassegrain receiver and has been described in detail elsewhere.  The system has been described el The det ect or was confi gured t o  measure both Rayleigh \(355 nm\nitrogen Raman scattering \(387 nm\ypical return is shown in Figure 1 The Rayleigh backscatter clearly shows the presence of the aerosol layer through an increase in the backscatter signal with respect to molecular scattering.  The Raman backscatter is primarily determined by the density of nitrogen in the atmosphere \(which falls off in altitude\ut any optically thick aerosol layers will show up as an additional decrease in the return from higher altitudes.  Both the Rayleigh and Raman signals are lower at close range due to a lack of overlap between the telescope field of view and the transmitted beam  The aerosol backscatter was obtained by dividing the two LIDAR returns to produce the LIDAR backscatter in units of molecular backscatter intens ity which is useful because it is not affected by the low altitude overlap function.  The normalization was performed in \221clean air\222 conditions near 5 km.  Figure 1 shows the value of C\(z 1, the experimentally determined particle backscatter in units of molecular backscatter, plus the molecular backscatter.  This value along with the particle to backscatter ratio are needed to calculate optical depth of the aerosol layer  The particle scatter must be combined with the LIDAR ratio in order to determine the AOT.  The LIDAR ratio is a parameter that relates the attenuation of an unknown medium to the backscatter intensity[4 is essen tially is related to the scattering angular distribution, or phase function.  If the exact particle shape and index of refraction were known, one could use Mie theory to calculate the phase function, or exact distribution of the scattering.  In practice, extinction is smaller than predicted by Mie theory because of the forward peaking of the scattering coefficient and forward scattered photons never actually leave the beam.  Also, sideways scattered photons may scatter a second time and return to the beam.  Such a calculation has been performed for mixtures of typical aerosols in order to determine the LIDAR extinction to backscatter ratio.  The LIDAR ratio of desert aerosols has been verified in experiments[5 Th e ratio fo r m a ritim e aero so l s h a s b een  measured to be much larger than those predicted by calculations[6  In  th e case o f so m e m aritim e aero s o l s, th e mean LIDAR ratio at 532 nm was found experimentally to be closer to 60, not 20 as predicted by Ackerm The discrepancy may be due to regional compositional differences and further study is clearly needed in order to determine the correct LIDAR ratio for all conditions and locations  Figure 1 Typical pair of Raman eigh  backscatter returns.  Also shown is the derived backscatter ratio   The LIDAR ratio \(extinction to backscatter pp 002 003  which is known quite accurately to be 8.4  The first experimental step involved isolating the backscatter.  It was advantageous to have both the Raman and Rayleigh scatter at nearby wavelengths, which ensured that the molecular extinction wa s the same in each return Because attenuation was the same for each, dividing the 002 003   where p stands for particle, was used to compare the measured backscatter to the ex tinction of a Nd:YAG laser The type of aerosol was most important for determining the value of the LIDAR ratio.  In the case of this study, a maritime aerosol was expected, which has four main components: water soluble soot, and the accumulation and the coarse mode of sea salt.  For this aerosol, Ackermann calculated a LIDAR ratio to be between 20 and 24 for typical levels of humidity.  As a comparison, a desert aerosol was reported to have a larger LIDAR ratio closer to 50.  As a figure of merit, these numbers can be compared to the extinction to backscatter of Rayleigh scattering from atmospheric molecules RR

The green data are from sun photometer measurements taken in the early morning  Rayleigh scatter by the Raman scatter produced a curve that was equal to unity everywhere that molecular scattering took place, and slightly greater wherever aerosol scattering occurred.

The result was then compared to local simultaneous measurements of AOT from the sun photomet The resul t s of t h e com p ari s on are shown i n  Figure 2.  After performing wavelength corrections, good agreement was found between the instruments when the sun was near zenith.  However, during sunrise and sunset deviations were often observed which were attributed to the fact that the LIDAR was not sa mpling the same parcel of air unless the sun was directly overhead  Using the mechanism above allowed us to accurately measure temporal changes in AOT with high resolution under typical marine aerosol conditions in Southern California.  However, during the June 2008 Northern California fires, we measured significant deviations between the LIDAR and the sun photometer \(Figure 3 deviation was caused by the smoke having an effectively different LIDAR ratio compared to the marine layer.  To account for the difference, we separated the return into a low-altitude response \(taken to be below 1 km\was assumed to behave as a marine layer, and a high-altitude response. Instead of calculating a separate LIDAR ratio for smoke, the upper layer was assumed to have an unknown LIDAR ratio  and the known molecular Rayleigh backscatter-to-extinction ratio were used to determine the particle extinction coefficient 4.8 CS Rp 002\002 002  The ASR is useful because it removes the significan ce of small changes in the shape of the overlap function that occurred from slight alterations in beam pointing, and furthermore, it automatically normalizes the data by the actual molecular extinction profile  The first step to AOT retrieval was to calculate the particleto-molecular backscatter 1 212 Rp zC  


  4  Figure 4 \(a\-altitude \(<1 km\as measured using the aerosol backscatter \(b 1 km, circles\the theoretical molecular and experimental Raman returns above about 1.2 km To account for the AOT of the upper layer, the Raman LIDAR return was compared to a theoretical molecular LIDAR return at the same wavelength as shown in Figure 4 The difference between the tw o was used to measure the optical depth of the suspended aerosol directly.  When the higher altitude channel was added to the AOT calculated from the marine layer below 1.0 km, a much better agreement between the sun photometer and LIDAR was obtained, as shown in Figure 3.  The fact that the two-layer model showed a significant improvement in the fit to the sun photometer measurement was an indication that the suspended particles had a much larger LIDAR ratio  The two-layer method was used to calculate AOT from the LIDAR data under all conditions.  In all measurements concurrent data was acquired from the sun photometer Ground-based temperature and pr essure data were acquired with a collocated weather station \(Vaisala WTX-501 which was used to make humidity corrections to the atmospheric index of refraction and fed back into the LIDAR backscatter-to-extinction model  Measurements were performed during the late morning and early afternoon at times corresponding to the MODIS \(Aqua and Terra\overpasses of Southern California, between about 18:00-22:00 UTC.   M ODIS optical densities were acquired from the NASA MAPSS \(MODIS Aerosol Products Subset Statistics\ine database, derived from collection 5 of the level 2 data 3  R ESULTS  During the period of intense wildfire activity in Northern California, between 19 June 2008 and 2 July 2008 a distinct smoke plume was observed in the LIDAR backscatter ratio  Figure 5 Particle backscatter \(in units of molecular scatter er aerosol \(below 1.0 km an elevated smoke plume at ~ 2.0 km as shown in Figure 5, and remained clearly visible for several days.  During this period the measured sun photometer AOT was compared to the MAPSS AOT data for UCLA, reported at 550 nm.  The sun photometer data was not corrected for wavelength, but rather the closest wavelength \(500 nm\o the reported MODIS data was selected.  The results of the comparison are shown in Figure 6\(a\he sun photometer data clearly tracked to the MODIS AOT values, though overall the sun photometer reported consistently lower values.   This was true even for the sun photometer\222s 550 nm measurements.  Because optical densities will increase monotonically with shorter wavelength, an adjustment from 500 to 550 nm will show an even larger discrepancy between the MODIS and sun photometer AOT  LIDAR-derived AOT values were also directly compared to MODIS AOT data, with similar results, as shown in Figure 7\(b\ Because the LIDAR AOT was measured at 355 nm the Deep_Blue_Angstrom_Exponent was used to convert the Aqua and Terra AOT to 355 nm.  The Deep Blue Angstrom Exponent was derived, as the name suggests from measured AOT close to UV wavelengths between 412-470 nm.  Prior to using the deep blue values, the Angstrom Exponent for 470-670 nm was used in the sun photometer comparisons.  The Deep Blue exponent was on average about 1.6 times larger than the visible exponent Even when the visible exponent was used, we found that the scaled AOT values from 550 nm were larger than the ground-based measurements  In all the data, the LIDAR data, sun photometer, and MODIS values correspond to temporal uncertainties no less than 20 minutes.  Having good temporal overlap was essential, as large changes in AOT values were observed in as little as 30 minutes

Hourly Beta-Attenuation Mass Monitor BAM\2.5 readings were found to be roughly unchanged during the period of peak AOT measurements from 24 June to 26 June  4  C ONCLUSIONS   For ideal marine climate conditions, the Ackermann model for the LIDAR ratio was successfully applied to calculate vertical optical depth distributions from aerosol scattering ratio profiles.  We found that good agreement between sun photometer and LIDAR was obtained under those conditions when the aerosol distribution was uniform However, in cases where the marine climate was not ideal the Ackermann model was useful only at low altitudes  When the LIDAR ratio of aloft material was unknown, as in the case examined in this repor t, the AOT must be measured directly.  Direct AOT measurements at low altitude are not  Figure 7 LIDAR vs. MODIS AOT values observed between 19 June and 2 July 2008  trivial, because they require comparing the experimental Raman return to a theoretical 221pure\222 molecular scattering return \(accounting also for Rayleigh attenuation\ the low altitude return is plagued by the overlap factor which is difficult to quantify and can change on a daily, if not hourly basis.  Direct measurements tu rned out to be straightforward because the aloft material wa s well-above the point where the LIDAR overlap function reaches unity.  At low altitudes, the Ackermann approach was preferred because it required knowing only the ratio of two of the LIDAR quantities that shared a common overlap factor, and as a result the measurement becomes insensitive to even large instabilities in pointing that otherwise would be a detriment to a purely direct measurement of AOT via a single Raman LIDAR  AOT profiles are particularly useful for characterizing air quality in the western US where heterogeneous boundary layers are common.  In the case of forest fires, total column AOT measurements may indicate high levels of particulate matter, but without the vertical profiles available with 


  6 LIDAR, one doesn\222t know if they are contained in the mixing layer or above it.  In general, aerosol vertical profiles provide more information on where/when upper tropospheric and stratospheric plumes \(such as Asian yellow dust and wildfire smoke\er into the boundary layer and become a health risk.   In this study, we found that the smoke plumes had an immeasurably small impact on air quality, even though there was a cl ear increase in the remote measurements of AOT  Acknowledgements This work was sponsored by The Aerospace Corporation's Independent Research and Development Program  R EFERENCES  1.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

As the absorption is greatly affected by the molecular structure of the material, citations should al so indicate the material as a subscript to the term 223rad\224, as in rad Si indicating Silicon equivalency.  For the purposes of this paper, radiation equivalency always assumes Silicon For completeness, it should be noted that System International replaced the \223rad\224 with the unit Gr ay \(Gy\nd having an equivalency of 100 rads = 1 Gy [27 How e v e r   the use of rads, kilorads, megarads remains in the industry vernacular and is used in this document Moore\222s Law Named after Fairchild Semiconductor technologist Gordon Moore, Moore\222s law was derived from empirical data which shows that the dimensions of basic memory cells will shrink by approximately 50% of the previous value every 30 to 36 months.

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
