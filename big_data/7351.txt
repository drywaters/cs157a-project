Efficient Sanitization of Informative Association Rules with Updates SHYUE-LIANG WANG RAJEEV MASKEY AYAT JAFARI Department of Computer Science New York Institute of Technology New York New York 10023 EMAIL Abstract-We propose here an efficient data-mining algorithm to sanitize informative association rules when the database is updated i.e when a new data set is added to the original database For a given predicting item an informative association rule set 16 is the smallest association rule set that makes the same prediction as the entire association rule set by confidence priority Several approaches 
to sanitize informative association rules from static databases have been proposed 27][28 However frequent updates to the database may require repeated sanitizations of original database and added data sets The efforts of previous sanitization are not utilized in these approaches In this work we propose using pattern inversion tree to store the added data set in one database scan It is then sanitized and merged to the original sanitized database Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach out performs the direct sanitization on original and added data sets with similar side effects 
Keywords-privacy preserving data mining informative association rules maintenance I INTRODUCTION In the past decade data mining has developed into an important technology of identifying patterns and trends from large quantities of data Successful applications of data mining have been demonstrated in marketing business medical analysis product control engineering design and scientific exploration among others While all of these applications of data mining can benefit commercial social and human activities there is also a negative side to this technology the threat to data privacy For example through data mining one is 
able to infer sensitive information including personal information or even patterns from nonsensitive information or unclassified data Privacy-preserving data mining is a novel research direction in data mining and statistical databases where data mining algorithms are analyzed for the side effects they incur in data privacy 25 There have been two types of privacy concerning data mining The first type of privacy called output privacy is that the data is minimally altered so that the mining result will not disclose certain privacy Many techniques have been proposed for the output 
privacy 1],[6]TZUNG-PEI HONG Department of Electrical Engineering National University of Kaohsiung Kaohsiung Taiwan Email t 9],[20]-[21],[23],[25 For example perturbation blocking aggregation or merging swapping and sampling are some alternation methods that have recently been proposed The second type of privacy input privacy is that the data is manipulated so that the mining result is not affected or minimally affected 10]-[12],[15],[24 For example the reconstruction-based technique tries to randomize the data so that the original distribution or patterns of the data can be reconstructed The cryptography-based techniques like secure multiparty computation allow 
users access to only a subset of data while global data mining results can still be discovered In output privacy given specific rules or patterns to be hidden many data altering techniques for hiding association classification and clustering rules have been proposed For association rules hiding three basic approaches have been proposed The first approach 9 23 26 hides pre-selected rules one rule at a time It first selects transactions that containing items in a pre-selected rule It then tries to modify transaction by transaction until the confidence or support of the pre-selected 
rule fall below minimum confidence or minimum support The modification is done by either removing items from the transaction or inserting new items to the transactions The second approach 19]-[21 deals with groups of pre-selected restricted patterns or association rules at a time It first selects the transactions that contain the intersecting patterns of a group of pre-selected restricted patterns Depending on the disclosure threshold given by users it sanitizes a percentage of the selected transactions in order to hide the restricted patterns The third approach 27 deals with hiding certain constrained classes of association 
rules Once the proposed hiding items are given the approach integrates the rule selection process into the hiding process It hides one rule at a time by calculating the number of transactions required to sanitize and modify them However databases may be updated frequently or occasionally It is non-trivial to maintain the hidden association rules when the database is updated New rules and/or already hidden rules may arise and need to be hidden In this work we are interested in improving the efficiency of 1-4244-0555-6/06/$20.00 2512006 IEEE ICIA 2006 Page 331 


hiding informative association rules when the transaction database is updated i.e when a transaction data set is added to the original database This problem is referred to as the maintenance of hiding informative association rules One possible approach to the maintenance problem is to rerun the hiding algorithms on the whole updated database However this approach has some obvious disadvantage All the computation done initially at sanitizing the original database is wasted and has to be computed again from scratch Therefore more efficient algorithms for hiding informative association rules utilizing the information from the old sanitization process are quite desirable In this work we propose using pattern inversion tree to store the added data set in one database scan It is then sanitized and merged to the original sanitized database Numerical experiments show that the proposed approach out performs the direct sanitization on original and added data sets with similar side effects The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents the statement of the problem and the notation used in the paper Section 3 presents the proposed algorithm for the maintenance of sanitizing informative association rule sets that contain the specified predicting items Section 4 shows an example for the proposed algorithm Section 5 shows the experimental results of the performance and various side effects of the proposed algorithm compared with direct sanitization approach Concluding remarks and future works are described in section 6 II PROBLEM STATEMENT A Informative Association Rule Sets The problem of mining association rules was introduced in 2 Let I   i1 ji2  in  be a set of literals called items Given a set of transactions D where each transaction T in D is a set of items such that T c I an association rule is an expression X  Y where X c I Yc I and X n Y  s0 The X and Y are called respectively the body left hand side and head right hand side of the rule An example of such a rule is that 90 of customers buy hamburgers also buy Coke The 90 here is called the confidence of the rule which means that 90 of transaction that contains X hamburgers also contains Y Coke The confidence is calculated as X U Y 1/1 X 1 where IX is the number of transactions containing X and IXcAl is the number of transactions containing both X and Y The support of the rule is the percentage of transactions that contain both X and Y which is calculated as X U Y N where N is the number of transactions in D In other words the confidence of a rule measures the degree of the correlation between itemsets while the support of a rule measures the significance of the correlation between itemsets The problem of mining association rules is to find all rules that are greater than the user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence As an example for a given database in Table 1 a minimum support of 33 and a minimum confidence of 70 nine association rules can be found as follows B=>A 66 100 C=>A 66 100 B=>C 50 75 C=>B 50 75 AB=>C 50 75 AC=>B 50 75 BC=>A\(50 100 C=>AB\(50 75 B=>AC\(50 75 where the percentages inside the parentheses are supports and confidences respectively Table 1 Database D TID Items T  ABC T2 ABC T3 ABC T4 AB T5 A T6 AC However mining association rules usually generates a large number of rules most of which are unnecessary for the purpose of prediction For example given predicting itemset P  tC for prediction the rule set that contains only two rules C=>A 66 100 C=>B 50 75 will generate the same predicted itemset Q  tA B as the nine association rules found from Table 1 Therefore an informative association rule set 16 can be informally defined as the smallest association rule set that makes the same prediction as the entire association rule set by confidence priority Formally given an association rule set R and a predicting itemset P we say that the prediction for P from R is a sequence of items Q Using the rules in R in descending order of confidence generates the sequence of Q For each rule r that matches P i.e for each rule whose antecedent is a subset of P each consequent of r is added to Q After adding a consequence to Q all rules whose consequences are in Q are removed from R The following is the definition of informative association rule set Definition Let RA be an association rule set and RA the set of single-target rules in RA A set R is informative over RA if 1 R C RA 2  r E R there does not exist r E R such that r c r and conf\(r conf\(r and 3 V r E RA R 3 r E R such that r  r and conf\(r conf\(r From this definition the informative association rules are basically single target rules such that there is no subset rule with higher confidence and for any non-informative singletarget rule there is an informative association rule with higher confidence Page 332 


B Problem Description The objective of data mining is to extract hidden or potentially unknown and interesting rules or patterns from databases However the objective of privacy preserving data mining is to hide certain sensitive information so that they cannot be discovered through data mining techniques 1],[4][12],[18 In this work we are particularly interested in improving the efficiency of hiding informative association rules when the transaction database is updated i.e when a transaction data set is added to the original database Assuming new added data set is given we propose an algorithm to efficiently Sanitize Informative association rules with Updates SIU More specifically given a transaction database D minimum support minimum confidence a set of predicting items X a sanitized transaction database D and a new data set A  the objective is to minimally modify the updated database D  D  A  such that no informative association rules containing X on the left hand side of the rule will be discovered As an example for a given database D in Table 1 a minimum support of 33 a minimum confidence of 70 and a hidden item X C if transaction T1 is sanitized from ABC to C and transaction T6 is sanitized from AC to C then the following rules that contain item C on the left hand side will be hidden C=>A 330 500 C=>B 330 500 However four rules B=>C 33 66 AB=>C 33 66 C=>AB 33 50 B=>AC 33 66 are lost and a new rule A=>B 50 75 is added as side effects The sanitized database D is shown in Table 2 Table 2 Databases before and after sanitization TID D D T1 111 001 T2 111 111 1 T3 111 111 T4 110 110 T5 100 100 T6 101 001 Table 3 New data set A TID A T7 101 T8 101 Tg 110 When a new data set A in Table 3 is added to the database D if transaction T6 is sanitized from AC to C and T7 is sanitized from AC to C by directly sanitizing the updated database D using DSC algorithm in 28 then the following rule containing item C on the left hand side will be hidden C=>A 44 66 However two new rules are generated A=>B 77 71 and AC=>B 33 75 There is no hiding failure and no lost rule III PROPOSED ALGORITHM In order to hide an association rule X=>Y we can either decrease its supports  X N or X U Y I/N  to be smaller than pre-specified minimum support or its confidence I X U Y  X  to be smaller than pre-specified minimum confidence To decrease the confidence of a rule two strategies can be considered The first strategy is to increase the support count of X i.e the left hand side of the rule but not support count of X u Y The second strategy is to decrease the support count of the itemset X u Y For the second strategy there are in fact two options One option is to lower he support count of the itemset X u Y so that it is smaller than pre-defined minimum support count The other option is to lower the support count of the itemset X u Y so that X U Y  X is smaller than pre-defined minimum confidence In addition in the transactions containing both X and Y if we decrease the support of Y only the right hand side of the rule it would reduce the confidence faster than reducing the support of X In fact we can pre-calculate the number of transactions required to hide the rule If there are not enough transactions exist then the rule cannot be hidden To decrease support count of an item we will remove one item at a time in a selected transaction by changing from 1 to 0 To increase the support count of an item we will add one item by changing from 0 to 1 We will adopt the second strategy of decreasing the support count of the itemset X u Y i.e sanitize the transactions that contain the itemset X u Y In order to hide informative association rules we will consider hiding association rules with 2 items x=>z where x is a predicting item and z is a single large one-item In theory informative rules may have more specific rules that contain more items e.g xY  z where Y is a large itemset However for such rule to exist its confidence must be greater than the confidence of x=>z i.e conf\(xY=>z  conf\(x=>z or IxYzl  conf\(x=>z  IxYl For higher confidence rules such as conf\(x=>z  1 there will be no more specific rules In addition once the more general rule is hidden the more specific rule might be hidden as well To reduce the number of database scanning in generating large or frequent itemsets in association rule mining a onescan of database method was proposed in 14 The basic idea is to construct a tree structure called Pattern tree P-tree and a frequency list which contains the frequency counts of each item in one database scan The pattern tree is then restructured to a compact Frequent-Pattern tree FP-tree proposed by 13 which can store more information in less space A FP-tree based pattern growth method FP-growth is used to find all the large tiemsets from the FP-tree In 28 we proposed a Pattern-Inversion tree PI-tree based on the pattern tree to sanitize informative association rules with one database scan A PI-tree is similar to a P-tree except the following Each node in a PI-tree contains three fields item name or item number number of transactions containing the items on the path from the root to current node and list of transaction ID that contains all the items on the path from the root to current node For example the PI-tree for the Page 333 


six transactions in Table 1 is shown in Figure 1 The frequency list is L  A:6 B:4 C:4 Figure 1 Pattern Inversion Tree for Database in Table 1 The construction of a PI-tree contains two steps In step one we read transactions one by one from database Each transaction is sorted according to item name or item number and inserted into the PI-tree The frequency list is updated accordingly In the second step we sort the frequency list according to item support counts first Then the PI-tree is restructured similar to the first step Each branch of the original PI-tree is sorted according to the new frequency list and inserted to a restructured PI-tree We will adopt the proposed PI-tree and DSC algorithm 28 to store and sanitize informative association rules To sanitize the informative association rules of updated database D  there are two possible approaches One approach is that we can re-run any hiding algorithm on the updated database D directly The second approach is to process the newly added data set A incrementally and combined it with the sanitized result of original database D For second approach an informative association rule in D does not have to be an informative association rule in A  and vise versa However if all informative association rules in D and in A are sanitized then all informative association rules are sanitized in the updated database D We will adopt the second approach to sanitize the informative association rules Based on the strategies described above we propose a datamining algorithm for the maintenance of sanitizing informative association rules SIU The basic steps of the algorithm are described as follow Algorithm SIU Input 1 a sanitized database D i.e pattern inversion tree PI and frequency list L 2 min support 3 min confidence 4 a set of hidden items X 5 added data set A Output a sanitized database D D  D   where rules containing items of X on LHS will be hidden 1 Build the Pattern Inversion Tree PiA for A according to L and new items in A 2 Build sorted frequency list La for 3 Sanitize all informative association rules of the form U x y in A according to La to obtain PiA  and La 4 Update frequency list L by adding L to L 5 Merge PI-tree PI to PI 6 Restructure PI according to L 7 Output sanitized database D IV EXAMPLE Using the same example database D and sanitized database D with minimum support of 330 and minimum confidence of 70 in Table 2 when the data set A shown in Table 3 is added the result of running proposed SIU algorithm is as follows In step one the pattern inversion tree PIA for A has two branches rootA:3 C:2:[T7 T8 rootA:3 B:1:[Tg In step two the sorted frequency list La A:3 C:2 B:1 is built In step 3 to hide C=>A 66 100 transaction T7 is sanitized from AC to C The sanitized PIA  tree has three branches root A:2 C:1:[T8 root A:2 B:1:[Tg and root C 1 T7 In step 4 the updated frequency list for D is L  A:6 C:6 B:4 In step 5 the merged PI tree has 3 branches root A:6:[T5 B:4:[T4,Tg C:2:[T2 T3 root A:6:[T5 C:1:[T8 and root C:3:[TI T6 T7 In step 6 the restructured PI tree according to L remains unchanged The sanitized database D hides C=>A 33 50 There are no new rules generated no hiding failure and one lost rule BC=>A 22 100 V NUMERICAL EXPERIMENTS In order to better understand the characteristics of the proposed SIU algorithm numerically we perform a series of experiments to measure various effects and compare with the direct sanitization DSC algorithm proposed in 28 The following effects are considered time effects side effects database effects and item ordering effects For time effects we measure the running time required to hide one and two predicting items i.e one and two informative association rule sets respectively For side effects we measure the hiding failure new rules generated and lost rules The hiding failure side effect measures the number of informative association rules that cannot be hidden The new rule side effect measures the number of new rules appeared in the transformed database Page 334

Park Driving Park  VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  We have proposed a framework for mining interesting chronicles or narratives from multi-year consumer media collections, including themes related to the calendar date. The media in the collection is analyzed by a variety of algorithms to generate metadata of different types. We use metadata based on camera capture information, low-level image processing semantic image understanding, facial processing and event clustering to gather a large set of diverse metadata. The media and associated metadata are represented as a transaction database, and frequent itemset mining is employed to detect frequently occurring groups of images that share several meta             Figure 7. An example of temporal recurring groups detected data in common. A confidence and interest measure relevant to the consumer domain is used to determine the quality of the frequent itemsets, and create a  list of the top "themes" within the collection. Since a variety of metadata types are included for every media in the collection, we are able to capture a broad variety of recurring themes without a priori knowledge of the themes in a given collection. Because the system also discovers frequent patterns that the user may be unaware of, the system seems to display çintelligenté behavior by providing unexpected groupings that could not have been extracted by merely searching We also detect calendar-related recurring themes in multiyear collections. We define collections in terms of events, and represent them in an appropriate two-dimensional temporal space. We use density-based clustering followed by filtering to reduce the number of false matches in a group. Our approach detects personal special dates such as birthdays and anniversaries, seasonal activities and holidays celebrated. Since both the calendar-based groups and feature-based thematic groups detected are strictly data-driven \(with no a priori assumptions about a userês collection\ they are customized to the type of content in specific userês collections Further work in this area includes a user study to evaluate user reaction to these automatically generated narratives from their collection. Some of the user studies will focus on using the output of our method for slideshow-based reliving of a collection. We also plan to gather more collections with people and location metadata. Another direction of exploration is in improving the performance of scene, material and object classifiers by incorporating contextual information from seemingly unrelated metadata, as suggested by the frequent itemsets detected by our system. Also, further improvement of the precision of detecting recurrent themes can be obtained by incorporating the discrimination power of different features into the confidence score to avoid making groups based on generic features R EFERENCES  1  N.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
