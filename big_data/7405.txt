Mining Actionable Combined High Utility Incremental and Associated Patterns Jingyu Shao Australian National University Canberra member  IEEE Xiangfu Meng College of Electronic and Information Engineering Liaoning Technical University member  IEEE Longbing Cao Advanced Analytics Ins titute University of Technology Sydney senior member IEEE Abstract 227High Utility Itemsets\(HUI Mining instead of Frequent Pattern Mining FIM has been an attractive theme in data mining domain for over a decade since it can be regarded as an alternative way for researchers to identify actionable patterns In addition the necessity of decision-making actions and behaviororiented strategies based on large amount of informative data impels the signi 336 cance of discovering actionable patterns to be widely admitted The current HUIM research focus has been on improving the ef 336 ciency to make algorithms faster and more stable However the coupling relationships between items in given itemsets are ignored For example the utility of one itemset might be lower than the manager expected until one additional item takes part in and vice versa the utility of an itemset might drop sharply when another one joins in What\222s more it is not occasional to 336 nd out that quite a lot of redundant itemsets sharing the same underlying item are presented based on existing academic HUI mining methods Store managers would not make expected pro 336 ts based on such results which makes the results not actionable at all To this end here we introduce a new framework for mining actionable patterns called Mining Utility Associated Patterns MUAP whichaimsto 336 nd high utility incremental and strongly associated item/itemset with combined incorporating criteria The outputs of this algorithm are convincing on real datasets as well as synthetic datasets Keywords high utility patterns mining Combined pattern mining actionable knowledge discovery I I NTRODUCTION As it has been proved that there exists a large gap between academic research topics and real world business and industrial challenges t he al gori t h ms and a pproaches des i gned for academic purposes do not always satisfy real user needs in terms of solving business and industrial problems   2 Although algorithms such as UP-growth C H U D 4 a nd 200 A combined framework for discovering actionable knowledge from a utility database Based on a series of novel de 336 nitions such as utility growth which have never been used in previous work we theoretically prove that the proposed representation is effective and the patterns discovered are really actionable and useful for decision-making 200 An ef 336 cient algorithm called MUAP\(Mining Utility and Associated Patterns is proposed for mining actionable patterns of high utility increment and high dependence We systematically analyse the relationship between underlying itemsets and derivative itemsets based on both utility and frequency criteria 200 Two effective strategies are applied to enhance the performance of MUAP Based on the framework we propose a global pruning strategy to generate utility increase patterns from underlying itemsets An equation is also proposed as a local approach for selecting patterns with the highest weighted values which is a hybrid measurement of both utility growth and dependence calculation The rest of this chapter is organised as follows In section 2 we present two tables to describe some preliminaries and an extended comparison table is constructed based on an itemset\222s utility s upport and con 336 dence In section 3 we demonstrate the problem in this chapter including a case study and an abstract combined model In section 4 we mainly talk about our MUAP approach in terms of two strategies A global utility growth tree structure is p roposed to select all the utility incremental candidates and a local Coe strategy is proposed 1164 2016 IEEE/CSAA International Conference on Aircraft Utility Systems \(A\US ijing,China 978-1-5090-1087-5/16/$31.00\2512016 IEEE d 2 HUI 5 can d i sco v e r t h e co m p lete set o f h ig h u tility itemsets ef 336 ciently they usually generate a large number of patterns many of which are redundant and useless for making decision-oriented strategies Real valuable patterns that managers or retailers might be interested in may be ignored or buried amongst thousands of similar patterns In a word they are not actionable Accordingly the concept of actionable knowledge discovery is proposed by Cao 6 t o s e l ect pat t e rns t hat d el i v er decision-making informative massages to managers and retailers The process of mining such patterns is called discovering actionable patterns Instead of mining those patterns of high frequency the actionable knowledge discovery approach mines patterns of high probability for decision-making purposes and impact-targeted activities are discovered Such patterns may not be frequent but may lead to eith er impact-oriented exceptional behaviours or impact-contrasted exceptional behaviours For business purposes retailers or supermarket managers seek products that are more pro 336 table than others thus they make combined product strategies Such combined products might not be of high utility or frequency but the additional products may hold a strong association with the underlying product which can increase pro 336 tability Thus they cannot be selected via academic approach es which focuses on discovering frequent or high utility patterns This is also a challenge for designing an actionable combined pattern mining framework especially in this work Designing an actionable representation of patterns to satisfy both utility and frequency criteria is a challenging task and extracting such patterns is even harder The contributions of our proposed method include 


c<m  containing a particular identi 336 er TID is a subset of   to select one actionable pattern among a cluster of candidates composed of the same underlying itemsets In section 5 we show some experimental results and we have a smart summary in section 6 II R ELATED W ORK A High Utility Pattern Mining HUIM In 2004 the concept of High Utility Pattern Mining was 336 rst presented in During recent 1 0 y ears  quite lar g e n umbers of approaches have been studied based on the TransactionWeighted Utilization TWU and the property of TransactionWeighted Downward Closure TWDC suchas Two-Phase by Liu et al IHUP by Ahmed et al UP-Growth 3 CHUD for closed mining 11  TKU for top-k mining  2 HUP  a nd HUIM by Liu and Qu I n a ddi t i on Cao et al regarded this framework as an alternative solution for enhancing pattern actionability 7 Re g a rd in g t o e x i stin g more complex situations the framework of mining high utility sequential itemsets and high utility episodes turns out to be distinguished such as USpan  and UP-Span 16 One of the recognized algorithms to discover high utility pattens is the UP-Growth  However because of the coinc idences sometimes the results generated by those fast HUI mining algorithms are not reliable and representative for business people to take actions This shortage makes the algorithms more academic than practical Hence we proposed a balanced combined framework of both utility incremental and frequency associated criteria to avoid the occasional results from the utility measurement B Combined Pattern Mining 223Combined Association Rule CAU is 336 rst proposed by as a c oncept a nd w a s e xt ended b y 18 for furt h er interpretation Combined rules mining provides an alternative and fast access method for abstracting association rules from several large datasets When solving real business problems it is necessary to solve such scenarios that some of the features are not in the same dataset and it is not feasible to merge two datasets For example it\222s not easy to merge two datasets with 223customer name gender age suburb nationality\224 and 223 customer name gender annually income debt debt repayment method and repayment period\224 into one set if we only want to analysis the relation between age and debt To construct patterns composed of related constituents from different datasets respectively is a more feasible way than merging two large datasets in data mining domain The high impacted and target oriented combined pattern was proposed in Thes e p at t e rns m ay not be frequent  b ut contain important business impaction that is applicable for making business strategies and taking actions These patterns won\222t be detected by existing academic pattern mining methods which can only 336 nd patterns with high frequency The basic structure of combined patterns is represented in 1 For the characters in each equation of 1 A is one itemset B is another itemset and C is the combined pattern consisting of both A and B  In business perspective C can be the different levels of risk the appearance of fraud or the existence of outliers However this structure so far is only applied in the frequency framework TABLE I D ATA BA S E S AMPLE TID Transaction TU 1 1 1 1 2 2 1 3 3 1 1 1 2 2 has 4 items 2    which must be a positive number The items in an itemset are different from those in a sequential itemset or data stream and is disordered In addition these items are listed in alphabetical order without a loss of generality An l-length itemset is de 336 ned as it contains 002 002 002

A transaction record can be regarded as a utility itemset The quantity utility QU of I is denoted as  A  E  A  E  A B C and F  1 3 2 and 5  perspectively From table II the unit pro 336 t of each utility item is  A 5    and  F 1   thus the 336 nal utility itemset composed of each utility item in transaction 4 can be presented as  and the transaction utility of this 1165 D     and  and denoted as A 2 The Transaction ID TID is denoted as 2 2 T i T i i 004I  In this way an single item is also an 1-length itemset Table I gives details to 336 ve separate transactions as well as their transaction utilities in a utility database Take the third transaction as an example this utility itemset is a 5-length itemset because it contains 5 utility items  C 1 k m  denoted as X  T m n c k in transaction c is composed of an item k and its associated positive integer It is denoted as k k i in the o  o o a  a a a contains o if and only if there exists integers m o a o a  This containment concept is also suitable for utility itemsets with the same denotation And also o is a sub-\(utility-\itemset of a and a is the super-\(utility-\set of o  For example transaction 002 003 004 003 005 X

is called an Underlying Itemset  which keeps invariant in all equations V T C C  On the other hand variety underlying itemsets with the same additional itemset lead to different analysis results For example the support of the itemset A  if he sells it with product E  the customer has a probability of 33 to purchase this product but the pro 336 t of this product package will double from say 20 to 40 By contrast when this retailer wants to make a promotion sale for product E with the same strategy the customer might be highly likely to purchase A at the same time that E is purchased and the pro 336 tofthis package thereby increases from 30 to 40 B An Abstract Model A Representative Combined Pattern with Utility Increment and Strong Association Here we illustrate the application of actionable

of itemsets here each rule is also an itemset and rule a b 002 003 004 003 005 006 E  whose utility is 14 to    002  is an item with utility of 14 and support of 100 because it appears in all the transactions   to 40 the association rule 5 is a sub-itemset of both 2 and 4 and its transaction utility is 9 Furthermore the transaction weighted utility of itemset 2  4 and 5  De 336 nition 1 In 2 the itemset 1 1 2 2 0 1 0 2 002  holds a con 336 dence of 80 which is really high This association rule also represents a utility increment of 27 say from 002 A  100 Nil 14  B C F  is 51 because it appears in three transactions   002    C  BC  whose utility is 41 By contrast although itemset   is associated with a high utility increment from 14    maintains a low con 336 dence of 20 which means customers might not be likely to purchase   the same time they purchase   is only 20 support and th e utility is 40 Two rules     B  20 25 40 1 itemset is 24 In addition U  U X  3 Once a cluster of rules have been mined with combinations of the same underlying itemset an d several additional itemsets we begin to select the most interesting pattern among all the rules This pattern has a balance of both the high utility increment from the underlying itemset to the derivative itemset and high association between the underlying itemset and the additional itemset In the next section we 336 rst propose a global strategy to discover all the utility increment patterns in the original database then we demonstrate a local strategy of mining the most interesting combined pattern from a cluster of rules V T HE MUAP A PPROACH In this section we mainly focus on Mining High Utility Increment and Strong Associa tion Patterns Our approach is based on two strategies 1 One global strategy is proposed to discover all utility incremental patterns with clusters based on speci 336 c underlying itemsets 2 One local strategy based on each cluster of patterns is proposed to measure the interestingness of each of the rules This strategy is composed of a variety of additional itemsets and the same underlying itemset A Mining Global Utility Incremental Itemsets Based on UGTree UG-Tree Our algorithm is proposed based on a tree structure with utility growth and association rule mining thus all branches whose utility decreases would be discarded from the proposed UG-Tree the 336 rst time The utility of node in a speci 336 c branch varies which means the increment of utility might be negative The pruning process starts from the external towards to the 336 rst node whose u tility increment is positive This reorganized tree after above processing is called the UGTree whichisshowninFig.1 1166 002 E 002 002 T BE and rule B C E BE B E    A  A  E  E  C  C  C  20 20 40 26  CB 002 E A 002 002 002

The architecture enables discovery or interesting patterns with data from different domains related to Telecom Network Monitoring. The architecture is composed of five sub-modules: Data Analyzer, Mining Controller, Data Miner, Combiner, and Episode Analyzer. Each sub-module is described in detail along with implementation approach  functions in turn. The approach leverages and combines frequent itemset discovery over data streams, association rule learning, frequent sequential pattern mining, and frequent temporal pattern mining techniques while also making use of distributed processing platforms to achieve high-volume throughput. To test the functionality of the model, three classic pattern mining algorithms, namely, NewMoment PrefixSpan, and HTPM, are implemented Their performances are compared in terms of different parameter settings by executing the algorithms with a simulated streaming dataset Fig.10

the master Each data owner will also send his set of real transactions IDs to a semi-trusted third-party server The third-party server is assumed not to be colluding with any data owner but it cannot be trusted to hold the raw data The master generates association rule candidates from the joint database containing ctitious data For each rule candidate X  Y  the master sends the ID lists of the transactions containing X  Y and the transactions containing X to the third-party server The server veriÞes if the rule is qualiÞed or not Similar to our solutions a semi-trusted third-party is utilized for the mining However unlike our solutions a data owner i.e the master does the majority of the computational work Therefore we can hardly say that such a solution is an outsourced mining solution Though ctitious data are added in datasets to lower data usability the master is able to learn signiÞcant information about other data owners raw data from the received datasets In cont rast our solutions do not leak such information as we do not rely on one particular data owner to undertake the computations and we also encrypt the datasets All existing solutions with the exception of  d o not utilize a third-party server to server to compute the mining result Some solutions  13 us e a s y mmet r i c encryption to compute the supports of itemsets while other solutions 28]Ð[30 us e a s ecure s cal ar product p rot o col  a s et intersection cardinality protocol or a secret sharing scheme to perform these computations A majority of these solutions expose exact supports to all data owners resulting in the leakage of information about the data owners raw data  The only exception is one of s s o l u t i ons  I n  13 t here are two privacy-preserving solutions for frequent itemset mining The rst solution exposes exact supports which is not desirable The second solution does not expose exact supports However association rules cannot be mined based on the result of second solution because conÞdences cannot be computed without the exact supports In addition this solutionÕs method cannot be used to mine association rules because securely computing conÞdence is more complicated than computing support In comparison with this solution our frequent itemset mining solutionÕs computational complexity is signiÞcantly lower Our solutions do not expose exact supports or conÞdences to data owners Different from existing solutions based on homomorphic encryption we use symmetric homomorphic encryption instead of asymmetric homomorphic encryption and the manner in which we use homomorphic encryption also differs from existing solutions In our approach we use homomorphic encryption to create ERVs and build our secure outsourced comparison scheme B Privacy-Preserving Outsour ced Association Rule Mining and Frequent Itemset Mining Privacy-preserving outsourced frequent itemset mining and association rule mining have been studied in the setting of a single data owner  19]Ð[21 I n e xi s t i n g s ol ut i ons  the data owner outsources thei r data and the mining task to the cloud but at the same time wish to keep the raw data secret from the cloud Generally

data owner inserts ctitious transactions in the encrypted database to conceal the item frequency After inserting the ctitious transactions any item in the encrypted database will share the same frequency with at least k  1 other items The data owner sends the encrypted database of both the real and ctitious transactions to the cloud The cloud runs a classic frequent itemset mining algorithm and returns the result frequent itemsets and their supports to the data owner The data owner revises these itemsets supports by subtracting them with these itemsets corresponding occurrence counts in the ctitious transactions respectively Finally the data owner decrypts the received itemsets with the revised supports higher than the frequency threshold an d generates association rules based on found frequent itemsets Our solutions use their techniques to conceal the raw data from the cloud and mitigate frequency analysis attack that can be undertaken by the cloud Using these techniques

on encrypted items but it is vulnerable to frequency analysis attacks Applying this solution to vertically partitioned databases will also result in the leakage of the exact supports to data owners In this paper our adversary model is different We assume the cloud has knowledge of the item frequencies instead of chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs and our solutions are resilient to frequency analysis

solution for vertically partitioned databases This allows the data owners to outsource mining task on their joint data in a privacy-preserving manner privacypreserving manner Based on this solution we built a privacypreserving outsourced association rule partitioned databases Our solutions protect data ownerÕs raw data from other data owners and the cloud Our solutions also ensure the privacy of the mining results from the cloud Compared with most existing solutions our solutions leak less information about the data owners raw data Our evaluation has also demonstrated that our solutions are very efÞci ent therefore our solutions are suitable to be used by data owners wishing to outsource their databases to the cloud but require a high level of privacy without compromising on performance To realize our solutions an efÞcient homomorphic encryption scheme and a secure outsourced comparison scheme were presented in this paper Both schemes have potential usage in other secure computation applications such as secure data aggregation beyond the data mining solutions described in this paper Demonstrating the u tility of the p roposed homomorphic encryption scheme and outsourced comparison scheme in other settings will be the focus of future research A PPENDIX I NSERTING F ICTITIOUS T RANSACTIONS  s A LGORITHM  An algorithm to counter frequency analysis attacks on the outsourced database encrypted with a substitution cipher was proposed in F or the purpos e o f c oncealing t he item frequency this algorithm inserts ctitious transactions in the database to be oursourced The goal is to ensure that each item share the same frequency with at least k  1 items The algorithm is summarized as follows also see  Firstly the data owner scans the database to count each individual itemÕs support  Secondly the data owner groups items considering the supports and co-occurrence of items The data owner sorts items in decreasing order of support Starting from the rst of the sorted item list i.e the item with the highest support the data owner assigns every k adjacent items to a new created group If there are less than k unassigned items remaining these items will be assigned to the last created group The data owner swaps items from different groups to ensure that all items in the same group do not occur together in the same transaction  Thirdly for each item in each group the data owner calculates the difference between the itemÕs support and the highest support in the group The difference is deÞned as the noise of the item  Fourthly to achieve k anonymity frequency the data owner generates ctitious transactions based on the result of the third step The number of an itemÕs occurrences in the ctitious transactions is equal to its noise calculated in the third step After inserting the ctitious transactions all items in the same group share the same support A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Quach Vinh Thanh the Associate
