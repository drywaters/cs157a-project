There are two types of items contained in dataset i.e. frequent and infrequent Infrequent item-sets are nothing but items which are rarely found in database. Mining frequent items in data mining are very helpful for retrieving the related data present in the dataset Using transactional dataset as an input dataset the weighting function is calculated. The inf requent weighted itemset support value is calculated by using th e minimum support value. Then addition of processes is carried out for all the systems separately Then merge the two systems and summate the values which are minimal. Finally, three systems are combined and summate the values which are minimal among th e three. The threshold value for the dataset is calculated a nd the systems combination is filtered. If the addition value is greater than the threshold value it means, the combination of systems are not considered. Else, it is considered for the next procedure. The equivalent weighted transaction dataset is then calculated from transaction dataset And the infrequent weighted itemset minimum support value is then find out. After that find the threshold value for the equivalent weighted data itemset. And get the satisfied system summations. Then an infrequent weighted itemset miner is used to find the common systems that p resent in the tw o results. Here we are applying UP Growth and UP Growth plus algorithms to find the minimal infrequent itemsets from the transactional database. By Using these algorithms we can find the infrequent weighted itemset. And from the infrequent weighted itemset mining the final result of minimally infrequent itemset is calculated Keywords\227 Infrequent Itemset mining, Association Rule Mining, weight, Correlation I  I NTRODUCTION  Association rule mining is very transpiring today as there is growth in finding frequent itemsets as well as infrequent itemsets in transactional databases. Association rule mining good example is If a customer buys butter and bread, customers buy milk as well. The Association rule mining goal is to find correlation in different data sets from database. Itemset mining is very necessary in data mining used for finding the re lationships in the dataset Frequent itemset mining is finding frequently occured items in a transactional database where as infrequent itemset mining is finding rare transactions in the database Apriori technique/algorithm used to find frequent itemsets in a transactional database. This is the first popular algorithm in associationrul e mining. Apriori algorithm takes more computational time to find frequent itemsets For frequent itemset mining, support must required Support values can be calculated on the basis of frequency of items present in the par ticular transactional database There are mainly two techniques used to find frequent itemsets support and confidence II  E XISTING S YSTEM  The disclosure of infrequent and weighted itemsets,   i.e the Infrequent Weighted Item se ts from given transactional weighted datasets. The Infre quent Weighted Itemset\(IWI support measure is characterize as a weighted frequency of occurrence of an itemset in the analyzed data. The measure, IWI-support-min depends on a minimum cost function value. i.e. the presence of an itemset in a given transaction dataset. And it is w eighted by the utility of its least interesting item. The IWI-support-max Function depends on a maximum cost function. And it is used to find maximum number of utilization of items from given transactional dataset. Equivalent weighted transaction dataset is use for the mechanism to find out equivalent weighted itemsets. It is generated from the transaction dataset. IWI Miner is used for find the common items that occur in the transaction dataset and the equivalent weighted transaction dataset IWI Mining is used to gain the frequent items from the transaction dataset. Thus the presence of an itemset in a given transaction is weighted by the weight of that most interesting item A  Existing Advantages  200  IWI Mining is applied on transaction dataset for gaining the frequent items 200  Equivalent weighted transaction dataset is use for the process 200  IWI Miner algorithm is carried out for mining high utility item sets 2663 200  IWI miner can able to discover the infrequent and weighted item set 


200  Memory is more required 200  Accuracy is not concluded in the final utility item set 200  The higher processing time is needed 200  Too many scans are needed  III  P ROPOSED S YSTEM  The two algorithms, named UP-Utility Pattern Growth and UP-Growth+ are proposed and a compact Catalog structure, termed UP-Catalog \(Utility Pattern Catalog proposed as well for discovering high utility itemsets and preserving sensitive information relevant to utility patterns within databases. There are mainly two Scans are carried out. First is for generating Elements of UP Catalog. And then second is for reco gnizing transaction. DLU Discarding Local Unpromising Items constructing a Local UP-Catalog and DLN \(Decreasing Local Node \ are used during construction of a Local UP-Catalog and for reconstructing the Catalog   A  Proposed System Advantages  200  Good compact in memory usage 200  High utility itemsets are adequately identified 200  UP-Growth reduces the number of candidates effectively 200  The time required for execution is minimized B  Proposed System Disadvantages  200  In case of when the database contains huge transaction datasets or long high utility itemsets in the transactions the situation may become worse  IV  SYSTEM  ARCHITECTURE  Frequent itemset mining is very important area area in data mining. It is used to find sp ecific relationships between the various items present in transa ctional databases. Frequent pattern mining is used to solve the variety of issues likeexploring association rules sequential itemset patterns correlations and so more.  A transactional database belongs to transactional data which is the combination of various items called an itemset in which have frequent presence of occurrence in a database. In existing mechanism, there are large set of potential high utility item sets are generated and therefore their mining performance is degraded consequently. As a result, there is a absent of mining performance with these huge number of potential high utility itemsets and also hi gher processing time .There are mainly, two novel algorithms as well as a compact data structure for effectively iden tifying high utility itemsets are proposed. In this mechanism, high utility itemsets is preserver in a Catalog-based data structure named UPCatalog \(Utility Pattern Catalog\plementing such a new approach in proposed system called UP-Growth Utility Pattern Growth\, for extracting high utility item sets and preserving sensitive information relevant to utility patterns within given transactional databases. The only two scans are carried out for generating elements of UP-Cat alog and then transactions are reorganized. DLU\(Discarding Local Unpromising Items\ucting  Local-UP-Catalog utilities and DLN \(Decreasing Local Node Constructing a Local UP-Catalog. And these utilities are again used for reconstructing the Catalog. Mining process implemented through Disca rding Local Unpromising Items and Decreasing Local Node Utilities strategies. The experimental result predicts those not only reduce the number of candidates adequately but also outperform other algorithms. Using our proposed approach, generation of 2664 200  Candidate item sets can be extracted efficiently with only two scans of the database    Figure 1:  Infrequent Weighted  Itemset Process   B  Existing Disadvantages  200  Not eligible for huge number of potential high utility itemsets 200  Rule Generation of candidates is more efficient 200  Enormous candidate item sets required more space which degrades the mining performance 


Candidates become more efficient and memory requirement is degraded High utility item sets are efficiently extracted. UP growth not only reduces the number of candidates adequately but also minimizes  the execution time  Figure 2:  System Architecture of Infrequent Weighted itemset  V  A LGORITHMS M ETHODOLOGY    A  IWI Miner and MIWI Miner algorithms  Algorithm 1 IWI-Miner\(T    Input: T, a weighted transactional dataset Input a maximum IWI-support threshold Output: F, the set of IWIs satisfying  1  F Initialization scan T  and count the IWI-support of each item 2  countItem IWI-support\(T 3  Tree a new empty FP-tree; /*Create the initial FPtree from T 4  For all weighted transaction  t q in T do 5  TE q EquivalentTransactionSet\(t q  6  For all transaction  te i in TE q do 7  Insert te j in tree 8  End for 9  End for 10  F IWIMining\(Tree null 11  Return F     Algorithm 2 IWIMining\(T prefix  Input: Tree, a FP-tree Input A maximum IWI-support threshold Input: prefix, the set of items/projection pattern with respect to which Tree has been generated Output: F, the set of IWIs extending prefix 1  F  2  For all item i in the header table of Tree do 3  I=prefix U {i}/*generate a new itemset I by joining prefix and I with IWI-support set to the IWI-support of item i If I is infrequent store it 4  If IWI-support\(I then 5  F F U {I 6  Enf if Build I\222s conditional pattern base and I\222s conditional FP=tree 7  condPatterns generateConditionalPattern Tree,I 8  Tree I createFP-tree\(condPatterns Select the items that will never be part of any infrequent  itemset 9  prunableItems identifyPrunableItems\(Tree I   Remove from Tree I the nodes associated with prunable items 10  Tree I pruneItems\(Tree I prunableItems 11  If Tree I  then 12  F F U IWIMining \(Tree I  I mining 13  End if 14  End for 15  Return  F   Algorithm 1 is presented for IWI Miner pseudo code . The first steps i.e. lines 2-9 of Algorithm 1 is used to generate the FP-tree affiliated with th e input weighted data set T Then, at line 10 the recursive mining process is invoked on the constituted FP-tree. The FP-tree is initially occupied with the set of equivalent transactions given out from T For each weighted transaction dataset, the effective equivalent set is generated by applying function equivalent transaction Set at line 5, is implements the transactional data set equivalence transformation. Once a compact FPtree description of the weighted data set T has been generated, the recursive itemset mining process is executed \(Algorithm 1, line 10\.

Then, at line 7-8 the FP-tree projected with respect to I is produced and the IWI Mining technique is recursively applied on the projected tree to mine all infrequent extensions of I at line 12.

It is for differentiate the relevant-sufficient itemsets. UP Growth and UP Growth++ mining are proposed conveniently and efficiently. The discovered patterns are used in real time. For user query the related items are discovered by using existing methods take more time. By using our methodology the related items for the given query is find out between the shortened period Discovering the frequent itemsets are the output for this project system. We are extr acting the infrequent items on the basis of the frequent weight of the items. The frequent items are committed. And display the infrequent items in the dataset   Acknowledgment  The authors would like to thanks the Department of Computer Engineering Wadia College of Engineering Research, Pune, India for the guidance and cooperation   References  1  Agrawal R, Imielinski T, &Swami , A. \223Mining association rules between sets of items in large Databases\224.

Compactness is the main advantage of the proposed hardware architecture Although it is a compact design both versions accelerate the frequent itemset mining problem and speedup can be achieved VII C ONCLUSIONS In this paper a search strategy for frequent itemset mining that nds all the frequent itemsets regardless of the number of different items The proposed search strategy ts well for hardware implementations because it splits the search space into separate equivalence classes making disjoint sets of the original dataset In consequence the amount of itemsets stored in the memory is reduced this is an advantage for memory constrained scenarios like in the hardware architecture development Another advantage of the partition into separate equivalence classes is that the equivalence classes can be distributed among a set of processor elements to parallelize and distribute the workload The most remarkable feature of this architecture is that gets a 4x to 12.7x speedup despite its compactness Based on the results obtained in this research it is possible to implement an array of processor elements in other words scale up the proposed dual-core architecture from 2 to processor elements to get a better speedup A CKNOWLEDGMENT Martin Letras is supported by the Mexican National Council for Science and Technology CONACyT scholarship number 298024 R EFERENCES  Rak esh Agra w al T omasz Imieli  nski and Arun Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In

    Fig. 8. Comparative Analysis Classification Algorithms V  CONCLUSION Associative Classification techniques are used to make better decision in critical situations. The proposed associative classification called as Classification of microarray gene expression data using associative classification and gene expression intervals used to clas sify the gene expression with gene intervals in affected gene expression. The experimental results are carried out by using the gene expression of breast cancer. The associative classification on gene expression data obtained the best prediction and accuracy of the classification result. The proposed algorithm was tested with two class and multi class data sets. The classification algorithm was compared with the classical classification algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, SVM, and Decision Tree. After the comparison of traditional classification algorithms, as per the view of possible error rates the Associative Classification algorithm is best for biological data. The results of this work are used to drug designer for cancer diseases. The proposed algorithm works on gene expression data. In future, it will be implemented on hadoop and big data mining for biological data VI  R EFERENCES  1   Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Elsevier 2002 2   Second Edition PicasetOy Helsinki, 2005 3  Nagata, K., Washio, T., Kawahara, Y. and Unami, A  prediction from toxicogenomic data based on class association rule  ELSEVIER journal Toxicology Reports, vol.41, no.10 pp. 1133-1142, 2014 4  Garcia, S., Luengo, J., Sáez, J.

on items contained in each item group When the number of pivots increases the entire database is split into a ner granularity and the number of partitions increase correspondingly Such a ne granularity leads to a reduction in distance computation among transactions On the other hand when the pivot number k continues growing the number of transactions mapped into one hash bucket signiÞcantly increases thereby leading to a large candidate-object set and high shufßing cost see Figs 3b and 3c Consequently the overall execution time is optimized when k is 60 for both algorithms see Fig 3a 6.2 Minimum Support Recall that minimum support plays an important role in mining frequent itemsets We increase minimum support thresholds from 0.0005 to 0.0025 percent with an increment of 0.0005 percent to evaluate the impact of minimum support on FiDoop-DP The other parameters are the same as those for the previous experiments Fig 4a shows that the execution times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp decrease when the minimum support is increasing Intuitively a small minimum support leads to an increasing number of frequent 1-itemsets and transactions which have to be scanned and transmitted Table 2 illustrates the size of frequent 1-itemsets stored in FList and the number of nal output records of the two parallel solutions under various minimum-support values Fig 4a reveals that regardless of the minimum-support value FiDoop-DP is superior to Pfp in terms of running time Two reasons make this performance trend expected First FiDoop-DP optimizes the partitioning process by placing transactions with a high similarity into one group rather than randomly and evenly grouping the transaction Fig 4b conÞrms that FiDoop-DPÕs shufßing cost is signiÞcantly lower than that of Pfp thanks to optimal data partitions offered by FiDoop-DP Second this grouping strategy in FiDoop-DP minimizes the number of transactions for each GList under the premise of data completeness which leads to reducing mining load for each Reducer The grouping strategy of FiDoop-DP introduces computing overhead including signature-matrix calculation and hashing each band into a bucket Nevertheless such small overhead is offset by the performance gains in the shufßing and reduce phases Fig 4a also shows that the performance improvement of FiDoop-DP over Pfp is widened when the minimum support increases This performance gap between FiDoop-DP and Pfp is reasonable because pushing minimum support up in FiDoop-DP lters out an increased number of frequent 1-itemsets which in turn shortens the transaction partitioning cost Small transactions simplify the correlation analysis among the transactions thus small transactions are less likely to have a large number of duplications in their partitions As a result the number of duplicated transactions to be transmitted among the partitions is signiÞcantly reduced which allows FiDoop-DP to deliver better performance than Pfp 6.3 Data Characteristic In this group of experiments we respectively evaluate the impact of dimensionality and data correlation on the performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp by changing the parameters in the process of generating the datasets using the IBM Quest Market-Basket Synthetic Data Generator 6.3.1 Dimensionality The average transaction length directly determines the dimensions of a test data We conÞgure the average transaction length to 10 40 60 and 85 to generate T10I4D 130 blocks T40I10D 128 blocks T60I10D 135 blocks T85I10D 133 blocks datasets respectively In this experiment we measure the impacts of dimensions on the performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp on the 8-node Hadoop cluster The experimental results plotted in Fig 5a clearly indicate that an increasing number of dimensions signiÞcantly raises the running times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp This is because increasing the number of dimensions increases the number of groups thus the amount of data transmission sharply goes up as seen in Fig 5b The performance improvements of FiDoop-DP over Pfp is diminishing when the dimensionality increases from 10 to 85 For example FiDoop-DP offers an improvement of 29.4 percent when the dimensionality is set to 10 the improvement drops to 5.2 percent when the number of dimensions becomes 85 In what follows we argue that FiDoop-DP is inherently losing the power of reducing the number of redundant transactions in high-dimensional data When a dataset has a low dimensionality FiDoop-DP tends to build partitions Fig 4 Impact of minimum support on FiDoop-DP and Pfp TABLE 2 The Size of FList and the Number of Final Output Records Under Various Minimum-Support Values minsupport 0.0005 0.001 0.0015 0.002 0.0025 FList 14.69k 11.6k 9.71k 6.89k 5.51k OutRecords 745 588 465 348 278 XUN ET AL FIDOOP-DP DATA PARTITIONING IN FREQUENT ITEMSET MINING ON HADOOP CLUSTERS 109 


each of which has distinct characteristics compared with the other partitions Such distinct features among the partitions allow FiDoop-DP to efÞciently reduce the number of redundant transactions In contrast a dataset with high dimensionality has a long average transaction length therefore data partitions produced by FiDoop-DP have no distinct discrepancy Redundant transactions are likely to be formed for partitions that lack distinct characteristics Consequently the beneÞt offered by FiDoop-DP for highdimensional datasets becomes insigniÞcant 6.3.2 Data Correlation We set the correlation among transactions i.e corr to 0.15 0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 0.65 and 0.75 to measure the impacts of data correlation on the performance of the two algorithms on the 8-node Hadoop cluster The Number of Pivots is set to 60 see also Section 6.1 The experimental results plotted in Fig 5c clearly indicate that FiDoop-DP is more sensitive to data correlation than Pfp This performance trend motivates us to investigate the correlation-related data partition strategy Pfp conducts default data partition based on equal-size item group without taking into account the characteristics of the datasets However FiDoop-DP judiciously groups items with high correlation into one group and clustering similar transactions together In this way the number of redundant transactions kept on multiple nodes is substantially reduced Consequently FiDoop-DP is conducive to cutting back both data transmission trafÞc and computing load As can be seen from Fig 5c there is an optimum balance point for data correlation degree to tune FiDoop-DP performance e.g 0.35 in Fig 5c If data correlation is too small Fidoop-DP will degenerate into random partition schema On the contrary it is difÞcult to divide items into relatively independent groups when data correlation is high meaning that an excessive number of duplicated transactions have to be transferred to multiple nodes Thus a high data correlation leads to redundant transactions formed for partitions thereby increasing network and computing loads 6.4 Speedup Now we are positioned to evaluate the speedup performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp by increasing the number of data nodes in our Hadoop cluster from 4 to 24 The T40I10D 128 blocks dataset is applied to drive the speedup analysis of the these algorithms Fig 6 reveals the speedups of FiDoop-DP a nd Pfp as a function of the number of data nodes The experimental results illustrated in Fig 6a show that the speedups of FiDoop-DP and Pfp linearly scale up with the increasing number of data nodes Such a speedup trend can be attributed to the fact that increasing the number of data nodes under a xed input data size inevitably 1 reduces the amount of itemsets being handled by each node and 2 increases communication overhead among mappers and reducers Fig 6a shows that FiDoop-DP is better than Pfp in terms of the speedup efÞciency For instance the FiDoop-DP improves the speedup efÞciency of Pfp by up to 11.2 percent with an average of 6.1 percent This trend suggests FiDoopDP improves the speedup efÞciency of Pfp in large-scale The speedup efÞciencies drop when the Hadoop cluster scales up For example the speedup efÞciencies of FiDoopDP and Pfp on the 4-node cluster are 0.970 and 0.995 respectively These two speedup efÞciencies become 0.746 and 0.800 on the 24-node cluster Such a speedup-efÞciency trend is driven by the cost of shufßing intermediate results which sharply goes up when the number of data nodes scales up Although the overall computing capacity is improved by increasing the number of nodes the cost of synchronization and communication among data nodes tends to offset the gain in computing capacity For example the results plotted in Fig 6b conÞrm that the shufßing cost Fig 5 Impacts of data characteristics on FiDoop-DP and Pfp Fig 6 The speedup performance and shufßing cost of FiDoop-DP and Pfp 110 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS VOL 28 NO 1 JANUARY 2017 


is linearly increasing when computing nodes are scaled from 4 to 24 Furthermore the shufßing cost of Pfp is larger than that of FiDoop-DP 6.5 Scalability In this group of experiments we evaluate the scalability of FiDoop-DP and Pfp when the size of input dataset dramatically grows Fig 7 shows the running times of the algorithms when we scale up the size of the T40I10D data series Figs 7a and 7b demonstrate the performance of FiDoop-DP processing various datasets on 8-node and 24-node clusters respectively Fig 7 clearly reveals that the overall execution times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp go up when the input data size is sharply enlarged The parallel mining process is slowed down by the excessive data amount that has to be scanned twice The increased dataset size leads to long scanning time Interestingly FiDoop-DP exhibits a better scalability than Pfp Recall that see also from Algorithm 1 the second MapReduce job compresses an initial transaction database into a signature matrix which is dealt by the subsequent process The compress ratio is high when the input data size is large thereby shortening the subsequent processing time Furthermore Fidoop-DP lowers the network trafÞc induced by the random grouping strategy in Pfp In summary the scalability of FiDoop-DP is higher than that of Pfp when it comes to parallel mining of an enormous amount of data 7R ELATED W ORK 7.1 Data Partitioning in MapReduce Partitioning in databases has been widely studied for both single system servers e.g and distributed storage systems e.g BigTable PNUTS[31 The existing approaches typically produce possible ranges or hash partitions which are then evaluated using heuristics and cost models These schemes offer limited support for OLTP workloads or query analysis in the context of the popular MapReduce programming model In this study we focus on the data partitioning issue in MapReduce High scalability is one of the most important design goals for MapReduce applications Unfortunately the partitioning techniques in existing MapReduce platforms e.g Hadoop are in their infancy leading to serious performance problems Recently a handful of data partitioning schemes have been proposed in the MapReduce platforms Xie et al  developed a data placement management mechanism for heterogeneous Hadoop clusters Their mechanism partitions data fragments to nodes in accordance to the nodes processing speed measured by computing ratios In addition Xie et al  designed a data redistribution algorithm in HDFS to address the data-skew issue imposed by dynamic data insertions and deletions CoHadoop is a H a d oop s lightweight extension which is designed to identify relateddataÞlesfollowedbyamodiÞeddataplacement policy to co-locate copies of those related les in the same server CoHadoop considers the relevance among les that is CoHadoop is an optimization of HaDoop for multiple les A key assumption of the MapReduce programming model is that mappers are completely independent of one another Vernica et al  broke such an assumption by introducing an asynchronous communication channel among mappers T his c hannel e nables the m appers to see global states managed in metadata Such situationaware mappers SAMs can enable MapReduce to exibly partition the inputs Apart from this adaptive sampling and partitioning were proposed to produce balanced partitions for the reducers by sampling mapper outputs and making use of obtained statistics Graph and hypergraph partitioning have been used to guide data partitioning in parallel computing Graph-based partitioning schemes capture data relationships For example Ke et al applied a graphic-execution-plan graph EPG to perform cost estimation and optimization by analyzing various properties of both data and computation Their estimation module coupled with the cost model estimate the runtime cost of each vertex in an EPG which represents the overall runtime cost a data partitioning plan is determined by a cost optimization module Liroz-Gistau et al proposed the MR-Part technique which partitions all input tuples producing the same intermediate key co-located in the same chunk Such a partitioning approach minimizes data transmission among mappers and reducers in the shufße phase The approach captures the relationships between input tuples and intermediate keys by monitoring the execution of representative workload Then based on these relationships their approach applies a min-cut k-way graph partitioning algorithm thereby partitioning and assigning the tuples to appropriate fragments by modeling the workload with a hyper graph In doing so subsequent MapReduce jobs take full advantage of data locality in the reduce phase Their partitioning strategy suffers from adverse initialization overhead Fig 7 The scalability of FiDoop-DP and Pfp when the size of input dataset increases XUN ET AL FIDOOP-DP DATA PARTITIONING IN FREQUENT ITEMSET MINING ON HADOOP CLUSTERS 111 


7.2 Application-Aware Data Partitioning Various efÞcient data partitioning strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of parallel computing systems For example Kirsten et al  developed two general partitioning strategies for generating entity match tasks to avoid memory bottlenecks and load imbalances Taking into account the characteristics of input data Aridhi et al proposed a novel density-based data partitioning technique for approximate large-scale frequent subgraph mining to balance computational load among a collection of machines Kotoulas et al built a data distribution mechanism based on clustering in elastic regions Traditional term-based partitioning has limited scalability due to the existence of very skewed frequency distributions among terms Load-balanced distributed clustering across networks and local clustering are introduced to improve the chance that triples with a same key are collocated These selforganizing approaches need no data analysis or upfront parameter adjustments in a priori Lu et al studied k nearest neighbor join using MapReduce in which a data partitioning approach was designed to reduce both shufßing and computational costs In LuÕs study objects are divided into partitions using a Voronoi diagram with carefully selected pivots Then data partitions i.e Voronoi cells are clustered into groups only if distances between them are restricted by a speciÞc bound In this way their approach can answer the k-nearest-neighbour join queries by simply checking object pairs within each group FIM for data-intensive applications over computing clusters has received a growing attention efÞcient data partitioning strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of parallel FIM algorithms A MapReducebased Apriori algorithm is designed to incorporate a new dynamic partitioning and distributing data method to improve mining performance This method divides input data into relatively small splits to provide exibility for improved load-balance performance Moreover the master node doesnÕt distribute all the data once rather the rest data are distributed based on dynamically changing workload and computing capability weight of each node Similarly Jumbo adopted a dynamic partition assignment technology enabling each task to process more than one partition Thus these partitions can be dynamically reassigned to different tasks to improve the load balancing performance of Pfp Uthayopas et al  investigated I/O and execution scheduling strategies to balance data processing load thereby enhancing the utilization of a multi-core cluster system supporting association-rule mining In order to pick a winning strategy in terms of data-blocks assignment Uthayopas et al incorporated three basic placement policies namely the round robin range and random placement Their approach ignores data characteristics during the course of mining association rules 8F URTHER D ISCUSSIONS In this study we investigated the data partitioning issues in parallel FIM We focused on MapReduce-based parallel FPtree algorithms in particular we studied how to partition and distribute a large dataset across data nodes of a Hadoop cluster to reduce network and computing loads We argue that the general idea of FiDoop-DP proposed in this study can be extended to other FIM algorithms like Apriori running on Hadoop clusters Apriori-based parallel FIM algorithms can be classiÞed into two camps namely count distribution and data distribution  For the count distribution camp each node in a cluster calculates local support counts of all candidate itemsets Then the global support counts of the candidates are computed by exchanging the local support counts For the data distribution camp each node only keeps the support counts of a subset of all candidates Each node is responsible for delivering its local database partition to all the other processors to compute support counts In general the data distribution schemes have higher communication overhead than the count distribution ones whereas the data distribution schemes have lower synchronization overhead than its competitor Regardless of the count distribution or data distribution approaches the communication and synchronization cost induce adverse impacts on the performance of parallel mining algorithms The basic idea of Fidoop-DPÑgrouping highly relevant transactions into a partition allows the parallel algorithms to exploit correlations among transactions in database to cut communication and synchronization overhead among Hadoop nodes 9C ONCLUSIONS A ND F UTURE W ORK To mitigate high communication and reduce computing cost in MapReduce-based FIM algorithms we developed FiDoop-DP which exploits correlation among transactions to partition a large dataset across data nodes in a Hadoop cluster FiDoop-DP is able to 1 partition transactions with high similarity together and 2 group highly correlated frequent items into a list One of the salient features of FiDoopDP lies in its capability of lowering network trafÞc and computing load through reducing the number of redundant transactions which are transmitted among Hadoop nodes FiDoop-DP applies the Voronoi diagram-based data partitioning technique to accomplish data partition in which LSH is incorporated to offer an analysis of correlation among transactions At the heart of FiDoop-DP is the second MapReduce job which 1 partitions a large database to form a complete dataset for item groups and 2 conducts FP-Growth processing in parallel on local partitions to generate all frequent patterns Our experimental results reveal that FiDoop-DP signiÞcantly improves the FIM performance of the existing Pfp solution by up to 31 percent with an average of 18 percent We introduced in this study a similarity metric to facilitate data-aware partitioning As a future research direction we will apply this metric to investigate advanced loadbalancing strategies on a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster In one of our earlier studies see for details we addressed the data-placement issue in heterogeneous Hadoop clusters where data are placed across nodes in a way that each node has a balanced data processing load Our data placement scheme can balance the amount of data stored in heterogeneous nodes to achieve improved data-processing performance Such a scheme implemented at the level of Hadoop distributed le system HDFS is unaware of correlations among application data To further improve load balancing 112 IEEE
