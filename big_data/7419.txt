An algorithm is then proposed for the fast mining frequent weighted utility itemsets The experimental results on both sparse and dense databases show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods Keywords: Data mining, frequent weighted utility itemsets, WUN-set I  I NTRODUCTION  Mining frequent itemsets \(FI\plays an important role in data mining, and thus many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem such as Apriori [1 w t h 7 FPGrowth* [6   Ecl a t 2 6 dE cl at 27  DB V-F I 2 1 P re post    NSF I [2 3  FI N [3  a nd Pre post  4  Al l  t h ese m e t hod s  are carried out on binary databases, in which all items are treated uniformly. It is different from binary databases that quantitative databases have attr ibutes such as quantity and profit of each item in transacti ons. For example, a customer buy 2 loaves of bread \(4$ for each loaf\and 3 bottles of milk 1$ for each bottle\permarket, the binary database reflects only items appearing in the transaction are bread and milk without regard to quantities or prices, by contrast, the quantitative database reflects all these factors. Quantitative dadabases \(QDB\re often found in pratical applications and intelligent systems. There are many approaches for mining knowledge from QDB, such as mining high utility itemsets 12, 5, 14, 11, 10, 13  m i ni ng f req ue nt wei ghe d i t e m s et s 1 7  19, 24, 25, 20, 9, 15 and  min i n g frequ e n t w e igh t ed  u t ilit y  itemsets \(FWUI\8, 22, 16  In recent studies, Vo et al. [22  pr opo sed a M W I T FW U I algorithm which adopted the IT-tree approach for mining FWUI, although this is rather quite time-consuming as the memory usage is not optimal. Ng uyen et al d a  MBiS-FWUI algorithm based on the MBiS structure, an improvement of DBV structure [2  whi c h r e m oved al l 0b i t s  from bit-vector, keeping only 1-bits segments. MBiS-FWUI shows more efficiently th an MWIT-FWUI on sparse databases. In this paper, we propose a method based on the WUN-set structure, an extension of Nodeset structur  solve the problem of mining FWUI from QDB. First, we use the same definition of FWUI proposed by Khan et al. [8  th e reason is that this approach satisfies the downward closure property. Then, the database is scanned and compressed on the WUN-tree, thereby extracting the WUN-sets of 1-itemsets registered on tree. The WUN-set of a 2-itemset is obtained by considering the descendant-an cestor relationship between each pair of WUN-codes in WUN-sets of two corresponding 1itemsets. The WUN-set of a k itemset k  3\btained from the intersection of two corresponding k 1\temsets which has a linear complexity. Next some theorems are developed to compute quickly the weighted utility support of an itemset based on its WUN-set, and, in some cases, determine its value without computing the WUN-set. We use a set-enumeration tree [18 to o p tim ize th e s earching process and remove branches which only contain unsatisfying itemsets. The experimental results on both sparse and dense databases show that the proposed method is more effective than existing methods The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 reviews the related works. Section 3 presents the WUN-set structure, concepts, definitions and related theorems Section 4 develops the WUN-Miner algorithm for mining FWUI. The experimental results on many different databases are shown in section 5, and then the conclusion and future research directions  are presented in section 6 II  RELATED  WORKS  Khan et al.

As it scans the database only once, this method is more effective than previous ones that adopt the Apriori approach However, the drawback of this method is that it needs a lot of memory to store tidsets Nguyen et al  pr op o s ed a MBiS structure, an improvement of DBV structur e, to mine FWUI.

There are a total of six transactions in set T  t 1  t 2  t 3  t 4  t 5  t 6 and six items I  A  B  C  D  E  F as shown in Table 1A. The set of weights W 0.8, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9, 0.2, 0.3}, as shown in Table 1B. Transaction t 1 2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 0} means that customer t 1  buys two item A one item B three item D four item E and does not buy item C or F   Table 1  An example of QDB A B Transaction Database Item weight Transaction A B C D E F Item Weight t 1  2 1 0 3 4 0 A 0.8  t 2  0 5 0 0 1 1 B 0.1  t 3  1 3 0 0 0 3 C 0.5  t 4  3 1 1 0 2 0 D 0.9  t 5  1 1 2 1 2 0 E 0.2  t 6  0 4 2 1 1 1 F 0.3 Definition 2 The transaction weighted utility twu a transaction t k is defined as follows       1 where w j is the weight of item i j in transaction t k   is the quantity of item i j in t k   S  t k e number of items in t k  Example 2 According to the formula \(1\he twu values of transactions in Example 1 are calculated as shown in Table 2 Table 2  The twu values of transaction in Table 1 Transaction Formula twu t 1  0.8 2 + 0.1 + 0.9 3 + 0.2 4\ / 4 1.30 t 2  0.1 5 + 0.2 + 0.3 0.33 t 3  0.8 + 0.1 3 + 0.3 3\ / 3 0.67 t 4  0.8 3 + 0.1 + 0.5 + 0.2 2\ / 4 0.85 t 5  0.8 + 0.1 + 0.5 2 + 0.9 + 0.2 2\ / 5 0.64 t 6  0.1 4 + 0.5 2 + 0.9 + 0.2 + 0.3 0.56 Sum of twu values \(s umtwu  4.35 Definition 3 The weighted utility support wus f an itemset X is defined as follows       2 where t  X he set of transactions containing X  Example 3 The wus values of itemset AB in Example 1 is calculated using formula \(2\follows   We use a threshold called minwus for mining FWUI. An itemset which has wus values greater than or equal to minwus  is called FWUI according to the minwus threshold. Mining FWUI from QDB is the problem of finding all FWUI which satisfy a given minwus threshold  Definition 4 WUN-tree\A WUN-tree is a tree consisting of one root labeled as \223null\224, and a set of child nodes as the children of the root, where each child node is a tuple itemname, child-list, pre, pos, weight  item-name is the name of node, which is the name of the item representing the node child-list is a list of child nodes of the current node pre is the order when traveling the tree towards top-down-left-to-right pos is the order when traveling the tree towards top-downright-to-left weight is the weight of the node, which is determined by the total twu values of the transactions passing that node Based on Definition 4, the algorithm for building a WUNtree is shown in Algorithm 1 Algorithm 1  WUN-tree construction  Input A QDB and a threshold minwus  Output WUN-tree, the frequent weighted utility 1-itemsets I 1  Method name Construction_WUN_Tree  QDB  minwus  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Scan QDB for the first time and calculate twu values of the transactions wu s values of the 1-itemsets and sumtwu  I 1 set of 1-FWUIs having wus  minwus  Sort I 1 in frequency descending order Scan QDB for the second time to build the WUN-tree  Create the root of a WUN-tree Tr and label it as "null  for each transaction t in QDB do  P set of items i  i  i I 1 are arranged in order of I 1  Call Insert_Tree  P  Tr insert P into the tree Scan WUN-tree to generate pre and pos values of each node Procedure Insert_Tree  P  Tr   11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 if P   p 1 is the first element of P   Consider the child nodes belong to child-list of Tr  if node N having N.name  p 1 name then  N.weight  twu  P   else, create a new child node of Tr as N where N.weight  twu  P  and N.name  p 1 name   Call recursive function Insert_Tree  P p 1  N   Example 4 Consider QDB in Table 1 with minwus 0.5 After scanning QDB for the first time, we have I 1 as shown in Table 3B, which are the 1-itemsets having wus values not smaller than minwus The items in each transaction are removed if they don\222t belong to I 1 and the remaining items are arranged in descending order of wus values \(Table 3A Applying Algorithm 1, a WUN-tree is built as shown in Figure 1. We find that the transactions t 1 and t 5 have the same prefixes B  E  A  D re integrated into same branch of the tree. The WUN-tree thus re presents the entire database with a high degree of data compression, and this means that the size of a WUN-tree is quite small compared to that of an IT-tree Table 3  QDB in Table 1 after applying minwu s 0.5 A  B Sorted transaction database  I 1 Transaction B E A D twu Item wus t 1  1 4 2 3 1.30 B 1  t 2  5 1 0 0 0.33 E 0.85  t 3  3 0 1 0 0.67 A 0.80  t 4  1 2 3 0 0.85 D 0.57  t 5  1 2 1 1 0.64   t 6  4 1 0 1 0.56   sumtwu 4.35   Definition 5 WUN-codes of tree nodes\ The WUN-code of a node in the WUN-tree is a triple of values pre  pos  weight f that node Example 5 Consider WUN-tree in Figure 1, node E having WUN-code \(2, 3, 3.68 pre 2 is the order of node E when traveling the tree towa rds top-down-left-to-right pos 3 2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Ä SM\C 2016 | October 9-12, 2016 Ä Budapest, Hungary SMC_2016    001366

The pos  value is used to determine quickly the descendant-ancestor relationship between two WUN-codes when building WUNset of a 2-itemset Theorem 2 Given an item A whose WUN-set is WS  A   The wus value of item A is calculated as follows   3 Proof Assume that an item A is registered on n nodes in the WUN-tree. Let T i be the set of transactions containing item A and register A on the node x i  y i  w i ccording to the way the WUN-tree is built, we have  a T i T j  with i j  b Let T  A e the set of all transactions containing item A  according to \(b\have   c According to formula \(2\ we have  d So, according to \(a\nd \(c\ve       e Then, according to \(d\ and \(e\, we have  So, Theorem 2 is proven Definition 7 WUN-sets of 2-itemsets\ Given any two items A 1 and A 2 such that A 1 is before A 2 according to the I 1  ordering. The WUN-set of 2-itemset A 2 A 1 denote as WS  A 2 A 1 a subset of A 2 222s WUN-set, which is defined as follows  WS  A 2 A 1  pre k  weight k  a node registering A 1 which is an ancestor of the node corresponding to pre k  weight k  Example 7 According to Example 6, we have WS  E  2, 3 3.68 WS  A 3, 1, 2.79\, \(6, 4, 0.67\} and WS  D  5, 2, 0.56 And as shown in Table 3B, item E  is before A and A is before D according to the I 1 ordering.

For example, with QDB in Table 3 we have a set-enumeration tree like Figure 2. We note that when traveling the set-enumer ation tree the prefixes of itemsets in a branch are the same Therefore, in order to save memory, we don\222t need to save all of the itemsets, and instead just saving the same prefix and the list of last items is enough For example, consider the tree in Figure 2, to present the class of itemsets DA  DE  DB we need only save the prefix D and the list of last items A  E  B   Figure 2  The set-enumeration tree of QDB in Table 3 Applying the definitions and theorems presented in the previous section, we propose the WUN-Miner algorithm for mining FWUI from QDB, as shown in Algorithm 2 Algorithm 2  WUN-Miner algorithm  Input  The weighted database QDB and a threhold minwus Output FWUI the set of all frequent weighted utility itemsets Method name WUN-Miner_Algorithm  QDB  minwus  1  Call Construction_WUN_Tree  QDB  minwus generate Tree and I 1 2  Scan Tree to generate WUN-sets of items in I 1 3  Let FWUI I 1 4  Create WUS_2FWUI float I 1 size I 1 size 5  Scan the WUN-tree by the pre-order traversal 6  for each node N registering item i x do 7  for each ancestor of N  N a registering item i y do 8    N  weight 9  for x = I 1 size downto 2 do 10  Pre 2   i x  11  L 2   12  for y =x1 downto  1  do 13  if     minwus sumtwu   then 14  L 2   i y 15  FWUI   i x i y 16   1-FWUI_Intersection    17  if |L 2 0 then 18  Call Find_FWUI  Pre 2  L 2   19  return FWUI  Function 1-FWUI_Intersection  WS1  WS 2  20  WS3   21  x 1 22  while x   WS1 do 23  check false 24  y 1 25  while y   WS2   check false\do 26  if WS1 y  pre  WS2 x pre and WS1 y pos  WS2 x pos hen 27  check true 28  y  29  if check true then 30  WS3   WS1 x pre  WS1 x weight  31  x  32  return WS3  Procedure Find _ F W U I  Pre k  L k  S k  33  Pre next  Pre k 34  for i  L k size downto 2 do 35   Pre next  i 36   L next  37   S next  L k 38  for j  i 1 downto 1 do 39   WS ij  WS i   WS j 40  if wus  WS ij  minwus then 41  if wus  WS ij  wus  WS i  42   S next  j 2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics Ä SM\C 2016 | October 9-12, 2016 Ä Budapest, Hungary SMC_2016    001368

 Miner uses less memory than MWIT-FWUI and MBiS-FWUI on dense databases Accident and Connect. In contrast, for sparse database, such as Retail and Sale_Fact_Sync, WUNMiner uses more memory than MBiS-FWUI. The reason is that the fragmentation of data on sparse databases leads to an inefficient compression of data on WUN-tree, especially with a very small threshold VI  CONCLUSIONS  AND  FUTURE  WORK In this paper, we develop the WUN-Miner algorithm for fast mining FWUI from QDB based on the WUN-set structure an extension of Nodeset structure  Fi rst we i m pl em ent t h e  compression and representation of data on the WUN-set structure while ensuring the down ward closure property. Then some theorems are proposed for fast computing or determining immediately the wus values of itemsets, and thus mining FWUI by using the set-enumeration tree experimental results on both sparse and dense databases show that the proposed algorithm is more efficient than existing methods of mining FWUI In the future work, we are going to improve and apply the Nodeset structure for mining data on the others types of databases, such as incremental database or hierachical database REFERENCES   1  R.

The architecture enables discovery or interesting patterns with data from different domains related to Telecom Network Monitoring. The architecture is composed of five sub-modules: Data Analyzer, Mining Controller, Data Miner, Combiner, and Episode Analyzer. Each sub-module is described in detail along with implementation approach  functions in turn. The approach leverages and combines frequent itemset discovery over data streams, association rule learning, frequent sequential pattern mining, and frequent temporal pattern mining techniques while also making use of distributed processing platforms to achieve high-volume throughput. To test the functionality of the model, three classic pattern mining algorithms, namely, NewMoment PrefixSpan, and HTPM, are implemented Their performances are compared in terms of different parameter settings by executing the algorithms with a simulated streaming dataset Fig.10

LI et al  PRIVACY-PRESERVING-OUTSOURCED ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ON VERTICALLY PARTITIONED DATABASES 1859 the publication of this seminal work a number of privacypreserving association rule mining or frequent itemset mining solutions have been published in the literature see 11   1 3   28]–[31 The most relevant work is the privacy-preserving association rule mining solution presented in I n t hi s s ol ut i on a d at a owner known as the master is responsible for the mining The other data owners known as slaves insert ctitious transactions to their respectiv e datasets and send the datasets to the master Each data owner will also send his set of real transactions IDs to a semi-trusted third-party server The third-party server is assumed not to be colluding with any data owner but it cannot be trusted to hold the raw data The master generates association rule candidates from the joint database containing ctitious data For each rule candidate X  Y  the master sends the ID lists of the transactions containing X  Y and the transactions containing X to the third-party server The server veriﬁes if the rule is qualiﬁed or not Similar to our solutions a semi-trusted third-party is utilized for the mining However unlike our solutions a data owner i.e the master does the majority of the computational work Therefore we can hardly say that such a solution is an outsourced mining solution Though ctitious data are added in datasets to lower data usability the master is able to learn signiﬁcant information about other data owners raw data from the received datasets In cont rast our solutions do not leak such information as we do not rely on one particular data owner to undertake the computations and we also encrypt the datasets All existing solutions with the exception of  d o not utilize a third-party server to server to compute the mining result Some solutions  13 us e a s y mmet r i c encryption to compute the supports of itemsets while other solutions 28]–[30 us e a s ecure s cal ar product p rot o col  a s et intersection cardinality protocol or a secret sharing scheme to perform these computations A majority of these solutions expose exact supports to all data owners resulting in the leakage of information about the data owners raw data  The only exception is one of s s o l u t i ons  I n  13 t here are two privacy-preserving solutions for frequent itemset mining The rst solution exposes exact supports which is not desirable The second solution does not expose exact supports However association rules cannot be mined based on the result of second solution because conﬁdences cannot be computed without the exact supports In addition this solution’s method cannot be used to mine association rules because securely computing conﬁdence is more complicated than computing support In comparison with this solution our frequent itemset mining solution’s computational complexity is signiﬁcantly lower Our solutions do not expose exact supports or conﬁdences to data owners Different from existing solutions based on homomorphic encryption we use symmetric homomorphic encryption instead of asymmetric homomorphic encryption and the manner in which we use homomorphic encryption also differs from existing solutions In our approach we use homomorphic encryption to create ERVs and build our secure outsourced comparison scheme B Privacy-Preserving Outsour ced Association Rule Mining and Frequent Itemset Mining Privacy-preserving outsourced frequent itemset mining and association rule mining have been studied in the setting of a single data owner  19]–[21 I n e xi s t i n g s ol ut i ons  the data owner outsources thei r data and the mining task to the cloud but at the same time wish to keep the raw data secret from the cloud Generally data items in the database are encrypted using a substitution cipher prior to outsourcing Reference  propos ed a s ol ut i o n t o c ount er frequency analysis attack on substitution cipher However a

data owner inserts ctitious transactions in the encrypted database to conceal the item frequency After inserting the ctitious transactions any item in the encrypted database will share the same frequency with at least k  1 other items The data owner sends the encrypted database of both the real and ctitious transactions to the cloud The cloud runs a classic frequent itemset mining algorithm and returns the result frequent itemsets and their supports to the data owner The data owner revises these itemsets supports by subtracting them with these itemsets corresponding occurrence counts in the ctitious transactions respectively Finally the data owner decrypts the received itemsets with the revised supports higher than the frequency threshold an d generates association rules based on

 the cloud rather than the data owners cancels out ctitious transactions in a privacy-preserving manner and the underlying techniques are our homomorphic encryption secure comparison and ciphertext

on encrypted items but it is vulnerable to frequency analysis attacks Applying this solution to vertically partitioned databases will also result in the leakage of the exact supports to data owners In this paper our adversary model is different We assume the cloud has knowledge of the item frequencies instead of chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs and our solutions are resilient to frequency analysis attacks C Other Related Work Other than the settings of vertically partitioned databases and cloud/third-party-aided mining privacy-preserving frequent itemset mining and association rule mining have

solution for vertically partitioned databases This allows the data owners to outsource mining task on their joint data in a privacy-preserving manner privacypreserving manner Based on this solution we built a privacypreserving outsourced association rule partitioned databases Our solutions protect data owner’s raw data from other data owners and the cloud Our solutions also ensure the privacy of the mining results from the cloud Compared with most existing solutions our solutions leak less information about the data owners raw data Our evaluation has also demonstrated that our solutions are very efﬁci ent therefore our solutions are suitable to be used by data owners wishing to outsource their databases to the cloud but require a high level of privacy without compromising on performance To realize our solutions an efﬁcient homomorphic encryption scheme and a secure outsourced comparison scheme were presented in this paper Both schemes have potential usage in other secure computation applications such as secure data aggregation beyond the data mining solutions described in this paper Demonstrating the u tility of the p roposed homomorphic encryption scheme and outsourced comparison scheme in other settings will be the focus of future research A PPENDIX I NSERTING F ICTITIOUS T RANSACTIONS  s A LGORITHM  An algorithm to counter frequency analysis attacks on the outsourced database encrypted with a substitution cipher was proposed in F or the purpos e o f c oncealing t he item frequency this algorithm inserts ctitious transactions in the database to be oursourced The goal is to ensure that each item share the same frequency with at least k  1 items The algorithm is summarized as follows also see  Firstly the data owner scans the database to count each individual item’s support  Secondly the data owner groups items considering the supports and co-occurrence of items The data owner sorts items in decreasing order of support Starting from the rst of the sorted item list i.e the item with the highest support the data owner assigns every k adjacent items to a new created group If there are less than k unassigned items remaining these items will be assigned to the last created group The data owner swaps items from different groups to ensure that all items in the same group do not occur together in the same transaction  Thirdly for each item in each group the data owner calculates the difference between the item’s support and the highest support in the group The difference is deﬁned as the noise of the item  Fourthly to achieve k anonymity frequency the data owner generates ctitious transactions based on the result of the third step The number of an item’s occurrences in the ctitious transactions is equal to its noise calculated in the third step After inserting the ctitious transactions all items in the same group share the same support A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Quach Vinh Thanh the Associate
