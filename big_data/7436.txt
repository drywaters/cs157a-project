An Improved FP-growth Algorithm Based on Compound Single Linked List   Ding Zhenguo, Wei Qinqin, Ding Xianhua School of Computer Science & Technology Xidian University Xiían, China 710071   Abstract FP-growth algorithm is one of the most efficient approaches for frequent item set mining. In this article, an improved FP-growth algorithm based on Compound Single Linked List is proposed.  There are two contributions in the new algorithm. One is to use the sequencing table and single linked list as the main data structure, the other is that it does not need to generate conditional  FP-tree. An experiment is conducted to compare the efficiency between the original one and the improved one. It shows that the new one improves the algorithm both in runtime and the main memory consumption  Keywords- association rules, FP-growth, compound single linked list I   I NTRODUCTION  With the rapid development of the information technology and the exponential series increasing of information, how to efficiently mine the hidden information in mass data? It becomes the core and the key in data mining technology [1 Association rule plays an important part in the field of data mining, which is used to mine the association rules in a given data set and is put forward by R.Agraawa l fi r s t   I t di vi d e s  the mining process into two steps: \(1\ind all frequent itemsets 2\nerate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets As we can see, in many cases the Apriori candidate generateand-test method reduces the size of candidate sets significantly and leads to good performance. However, it may suffer from two nontrivial cost   1  m a y ne e d t o g e ne ra t e  a hu ge  number of candidate sets. \(2\ It may need to repeatedly scan the database and check a large set of candidates by pattern matching. For improving the efficiency of Apriori, many variations of the Apriori algorithm have been proposed. For example, Hash-base technique[4 Tran s acti o n re du ct i o n   Partitioni  S a m p l i ng[6    D y na m i c i t e m se t co unt i ng and so on. However, generating candidate sets are still inevitable Han  8  9   1 0 pr o pos e d a c o m p l e t e l y  di f f e r e n t an d  efficient algorithm to mine frequent items without generating candidate sets: FP-growth. It just need scan database twice and mining frequent patterns in the constructed FP-tree. A study on the performance of the FP-growth method shows that it is efficient and scalable and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm. However, it has its own problems during mining frequent itemsets, mass of conditional pattern trees are generated recursively. It cost a lot of time to generate and release these trees. Besides, FP-tree and the conditional pattern tree need to traverse from top to down, but mining frequent pattern is in an opposite way. Finally, traversing in couple ways and a larger memory space is needed to main these tree The article proposes an improved FP-growth algorithm based on compound single linked list. The algorithm introduces the compound single linked list to improve the structure of the FP-tree. The improved FP-growth is mined in one direction using the header table in the former FP-tree, storing them in a sequence table, ordering the frequent itemsets in descending sequence according to the min_sup, then a compound single linked list is formed. Through traversing each transactionís frequent itemsets stored in its single linked list, mining the frequent patterns directly without generating conditional FPtree. Through the comparison between the improved algorithm and the former FP-tree, it shows that the new one improves the algorithm both in runtime and the main memory consumption II  FPGROWTH ALGORITHM  2.1 The description of the FP-growth Let I = {a1, a2, . . . , am} be a set of items, and a transaction database DB=<T1, T2, . . . ,Tn>, where Ti \(i 001\031 1 . . . n  s a  transaction which contains a set of items in I . The support1 \(or occurrence frequency\ a pattern A, where A is a set of items is the number of transactions containing A in DB.

a It consists of one root labeled as ìnullî, a set of itemprefix subtrees as the children of the root, and a frequent-itemheader table b Each node in the item-prefix subtree consists of three fields: item-name, count,  and node-link, where item-name registers which item this node represents, count registers the number of transactions represented by the portion of the path reaching this node, and node-link links to the next node in the FP-tree carrying the same item-name, or null if there is none c Each entry in the frequent-item-header table consists of two fields, item-name and head of node-link \(a pointer pointing to the first node in the FP-tree carrying the itemname 2 The second step: mining frequent patterns using FPtree Construction of a compact FP-tree ensures that subsequent mining can be performed with a rather compact data structure However, this does not automatically guarantee that it will be highly efficient, so a strict and reasonable FP-growth is needed to make it find all the frequent patterns efficiently, exactly and completely. [10  Constructing FP-tree recursively, and increasing the frequent itemsets it contains. If conditional FP-tree only contains a path, then creating frequent itemsets it contains. As the following Fig 5 shows It is efficient and scalable for mining frequent patterns, and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm. However, it needs to traverse in couple ways and generates lots of conditional FP-tree III  T HE IMPROVED FPGROWTH ALGORITHM BASED ON COMPOUND SINGLE LINKED LIST  3.1 The steps to construct the compound single linked list 1 The first scan of database is the same as the FP-tree The scan of the database derives the set of frequent items \(1itemsets\ and their support counts \(frequencies\ The set of frequent items is sorted in the order of descending support count. This resulting set or list is denoted L and an item header table is built 2 The second scan of database is different from the FPgrowth. It is processing the items in each transaction in L order and then inserting the items in each transaction into the single linked list recursively. The itemsí order in each single linked list is according to L order 3.2 The realization of the pseudocode of the improved algorithm 1 Define storing structure Header table Itemid Support count Node-link    Frequent itemsets FreItem pointer Single linked list Item count pointer 2.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
