Association Rules Algorithm Research in Optical Warning System  Hu Chaoju 1 Peng Min 1  1 Information processing library, North China Electric Power University of Computer Science and technology Baoding071003 002 China KellerPeng2007@126.com   ABSTRACT: Mining association rules with multiple minimum supports is an important research aspect of data mining. In this paper we propose a database partition method to mine the frequent item sets, and use MIS-tree to store the crucial information about frequent patterns. We use the CFP-growth algorithm to mine local frequent patterns and insert them into the global frequent pattern. The experiment on OASN shows that the method is effective to predict the optical warning level KEYWORDS: database par tition; MIS-tree; frequent pattern CFP-growth I  INTRODUCTION Data mining association rules was put forward by Agrawal etc. since 1993, it caused the academic extensive concern  In recent years, the data mining technology causes extensive attention by experts and scholars in artificial intelligence and database field. It is an important research topic to discover the association rules in transaction database. The purpose of correlation analysis is to mine the hidden rules and to discovery all the strong rules in database. People have studied out kinds of fast algorithms for mining association rules such as Apriori, AprioriTid AprioriHybrid and DHN etc. Those algorithms need to scan database too many times and analysis static data, generate many candidate sets. The timeliness and spatiality grow with database increasing, especially in long mode data mining J.Han proposed a FP-growth algorithm to generate the frequent set which compress the frequent sets in FP-tree to store the association rules, use the FP-tree to generate the frequent sets 1 But FP-growth generates lots of FP-tree which need vast memory and occupy great CPU processing time when transaction database is dense. With the increasing of the FP-tree, it will cause the memory cannot load 1-item which the FP-tree mapped, l eads to the algorithm cannot work efficiently In this paper, we propose a database division method to solve the frequent pattern trees take up great space and time We divide database into several sub databases and use MIStree to load frequent pattern information, the MIS-tree mining processing is similar to the FP-tree. In the MIS-tree data sets sort by the minimum set in nonincreasing order, we use CFP-growth to get sub sets frequent patterns, then join these local frequent patterns to get the global frequent pattern. In the paper, we analyzed CFP-growth algorithm proposed CFP-growth algrithmm based on database division. We use the algorithm in optical warning system to mine association rules between the light powers and its attributes. From the experiments we found the algorithm is valid II  DATABASE  PARTITION A  Relevant Concepts Assume I is all items set, D is transaction database, X is item set. T is Xís sub item, each transaction has an only identify TID. If X contains k items, then we call it k-item User can definite a minimum supporting value min_sup which less than the transactions of D   Definition1 Support: The item sets support is the percentage of item set Xís accounts in D. The association rule XY 000 support is  s XY D 002 If the item setís support is above the min_sup that the user giving, the item set is frequent set Definition2 confidence: The item sets confidence presents the association rule XY 000 density in D. We use c to present X Y 000 confidence, c defines in Equation\(1  sup    sup   c port X port Y  1 Definition3 Insert data into frequent item set: When we insert series set S into X, it defines as follows 1\The generation item set   XX S 003 002  2\The support S in X is If SX 004 then sup   sup    port S port X S count   If SX 005 then sup    p ort S S count   B  Relevant Theorems and Properties We divide D into several sub database, they are satisfied with the following theorems Theorem1 Suppose that the conditional frequent pattern tree   M IS tree a a F 004 s global frequent item set is L\(MIS-tree|a\en   F LLMIStree 006 006 004  000 2 F is the set that make up by the global frequent item This theorem proves that we can excavate global frequent item through conditional frequent pattern Theorem2 Suppose that the conditional frequent pattern tree is  M IS tree a i  and its local frequent item set is , then

It defined as follows 4  1. It consists of one root labelled as ìnullî, a set of item prefix sub-trees as the children of the root, a MIN frequent item header table which contains all items in F 2. Each node in the item prefix sub-tree consists of three fields: item-name, count and node-link, where item-name registers which item this node presents, count registers the number of transactions represented by the portion of the path reaching this node, node-link links to the next node in the MIS-tree carrying the same item-name, or null if it is none 3. Each entry in the MIN frequent item header table consists of three fields: item-name, itemís minsup MIS\(a i  and head of node-link which points to the first node in the MIS-tree carrying the item-name 4. All the items in the table are sorted in non-increasing order in items of their MIS value B  MIS-tree Construction  Algorithm We need to scan database twice in order to construct the MIS-tree, the algorithm describe as follows Input: transaction database D, classification structure table S, minimum support upper limit a, lower limit b Output:MIS-tree Input S and scan D, add each itemís ancestor in D to D and delete the mehrmals ancestor.

We analyze the light power and decide the warning level according to the reference values. In this paper we mine association rules in light power by dividing ZYOC and using CFP-growth algorithm. We read about 15000 light power records from ZYOC, divide the database into five sub database, transactionís average length is about 50.

threshold support for Mushroom Connect and Chess databases V CONCLUSION In this paper we have studied the issue of mining frequent BDD from databases We have presented a new efﬁcient algorithm that mines frequent itemsets The algorithm is built based on a canonical form called T REE S UP BDD The experiments showed that the proposed algorithm performs in polynomial way instead of the exponential growth shown by other algorithms Experiments led on real data show very promising results compared to the literature results Then we will propose a parallel version of this algorithm under cluster of PC’s The idea is to construct Tree-SupBDD in parallel Indeed the construction method leads to a natural parallelization in the sense where each processor of a parallel architecture can construct locally its ordered structure Once the local structures are constructed a master processor can merge them to derive a global Tree-SupBDD Detailed results of such parallelization are under study A

the average length of a transaction In addition M USHROOM  C ONNECT and C HESS are known to be dense with long maximal itemsets We present performance comparisons of our algorithm against the fastest Apriori implementation and the latest developed FP-growth algorithm For dense datasets statistics are illustrated by Figure 3 recapitulate performances for MUSHROOM  CONNECT and CHESS respectively We notice that the execution time is polynomial dependent of the number of items Also execution times obtained for the MUSHROOM base are lower than those obtained for the CHESS This difference can be simply explained by the density highlighted by the corresponding number of nodes of the considered bases In the sequel we are also interested in the study of another aspect putting the focus on the possibility to manipulate less threshold support We remarked that our algorithm can generate frequent itemsets with low thresholds compared with FP-growth and Apriori However this possibility tends to stagnate reaching a given density of transactions database Our experiments showed that a better performance is obtained when using T REE S UP BDD-M INE  As shown in Figure 3 our algorithm is very efﬁcient for low thresholds values  


mining phase. The notation used in this 2 main phases is defined in table 2 Figure 2. Original Mining Phase Algorithm For the first iteration k 1\inal database phase as shown in figure 2, itemse ts are scanned to an original database and obtained their support count. Then, frequent itemsets are found as line 3. The remaining infrequent itemset are computed to obtain two values: the probability tolerance threshold of an itemset ptt X d the probability of an expected itemset ProbEF X as line 5 and 6 respectively. After that, the support count of the minimum of ProbEF X i.e DB  is obtained from  line 7. This DB  indicates the possible minimum support count of expected frequent itemset Next, an infrequent itemsets which its support count is less than s*|DB| and greater than or equal to DB  is collected to the set of expected frequent itemset as line 8. In addition, candidate 1itemsets are obtained from line 9 For the second iteration and beyond \(k  2\, the apriori_gen concept is used to generate candidate kitemsets. Unlike apriori_gen the candidate k-itemset of the proposed algorithm is generated by DB k F 1   DB k EF 1    DB k F 1   DB k EF 1  as line 13. After the candidate k-itemsets are obtained, the other steps is performed as the first iteration as line 14 and C k>=2 does not collect. These steps of k  2 iteration are operated until candidate k-itemset cannot generate. When the original mining phase is ended, all outputs of this phase are DB k F  DB k EF  DB C 1  DB  as line 17. These out puts are used in the next phase Figure 3. Incremental Mining Phase Algorithm The incremental mining phase, there are 2 main tasks in this phase k=1 iteration and k  2 iteration For the iteration of k=1 an increment database, db, is scanned and updated the support count of itemsets as shown in line 2. Then frequent 1-itemsets of updated  Algorithm1: Original Mining Phase Input: DB, |db Prob pl  s  Z Output DB k F  DB k EF  DB C 1  DB  1 k 1 2  scan DB for all X  C k and obtain DB x  3 DB k F X DB x   s 012 DB 4  for {X DB x  s 012 DB 5   calculate ptt x using equation \(14 6   calculate probability of expected itemset X ProbEF X       using equation \(12 7 DB  min DB x   ProbEF x  Prob pl  8 DB k EF  X | s 012 DB DB x   DB   9 DB C 1 X DB x   DB   10 end 11 k 2 12 while  DB k F  DB k EF 1 13 C k  DB k F 1   DB k EF 1    DB k F 1   DB k EF 1   14 repeat line 2-8 15 k 16 end while loop 17 Return DB k F  DB k EF  DB C 1  DB  Algorithm2: Incremental Mining Phase Input: DB, db Prob pl s DB k F  DB k EF  DB C 1  DB   Z Output UD k F  UD k EF  UD C 1  UD  1 k 1 2  scan db and updating support count to obtain UD x  3 UD k F X UD x   s 012 UD 4  for {X UD x  s 012 UD 5 calculate ptt x    using equation \(14 6   calculate probability of expected itemset X ProbEF X       using equation \(12 7 UD  min DB x   ProbEF x  Prob pl  8 UD k EF  X | s 012 UD UD x   UD   9 UD C 1 X UD x   UD   10 end 11 for k = 2 12 while UD k F 1   13   Generating Candidate itemset \( \ 3 14   repeat line 2-8 15   for X  new k C   new k C is obtained from line 12 16  Temp_scanDB X db x   DB  1   s 012 UD 17 end 18   k 19  end while loop 20 end 21 if Temp_scanDB  22  Rescanning Original Database to obtain new UD k F and UD k EF 23 endif 24 clear Temp_scanDB 25 Return UD k F  UD k EF  UD C 1  UD  Table 2 The notation of probability-based incremental association rule discovery using the normal approximation algorithm notation meaning DB k F  db k F  UD k F frequent k-itemset of DB, db and UD respectively DB k EF  UD k EF expected frequent k-itemset of DB and UD respectively DB x   db x   UD x  a support count of itemset X in DB , db and UD respectively DB C 1  UD C 1 Candidate 1-itemset of DB and UD s a minimum support threshold UD DB    support count of minimum probability of itemset in DB and UD respectively Z confidence interval Prob pl probability value threshold defined by user 437 


database UD k F are found as line 3. For itemsets which are not become UD k F they are calculated the Probability tolerance threshold of an itemset ptt X d the probability of an expected itemset ProbEF X eq.14 and eq.12 After UD  is calculated as line 7, an expected frequent itemset UD k EF and candidate 1-itemset UD C 1 an updated database is obtained as line 8 and 9, respectively For the iteration of k  2, in generally, this task is performed as the first iteration However, in this iteration there are 2 added steps: generating candidate itemset and rescanning original database in line 13 and 22 respectively The generating candidate itemset is detailed in figure 4 Generating candidate 2-itemset and candidate k  2 itemset is different. For candidate 2-itemset, it is generated by UD F 1  UD F 1 as line 2, while candidate k  2 itemset is generated by db k F 1   db k F 1  as line 8 when db k F 1  is obtained from itemset which its support count is greater than or equal to s*|db|. To ensure that no candidate itemsets are lost, itemset which is a member of  DB k F 1   DB k EF 1   is also brought to consider as line 5 and 6. In addition, the new candidate k-itemset new k C s obtained from line 3 and 9 This new k C are itemsets which their support count is only known in db but not in DB. These new candidate itemsets are reused in line  15 of figure 3 to extract Temp_scanDB  Figure 4. Generating Candidate Itemset The new candidate itemsets new k C ll be collected to Temp_scanDB if and only if the support count of new k C plus DB  1 where DB  obtained from the original mining phase, is greater than or equal to s*|UD|. This process is shown in line 16 of figure 3 for pruning new k C which impossibly be a frequent itemset or an expected frequent itemset of the updated database For the final step of an incremental mining phase Temp_scanDB is rescanned to an original database to update support count and find new frequent itemset and expected frequent itemset of an updated database as shown in line 21-23 of figure 3.  Both new frequent itemset and new expected frequ ent itemset are merged to the set of frequent itemset and expected frequent itemset which are found before. This guarantees that there is no remaining frequent itemset and expected frequent itemset to found absolutely 5. Experiments The objective of the proposed algorithm in this paper is to solve the numerical problem occurs with binomial distribution. Moreover, the confidence interval is introduced to increase the probability value of an itemset to be a frequent itemset in an updated database. The hypothesis is the proposed algorithm can reduce the number of Temp_scanDB itemsets which is rescanned to the original database To evaluate the efficiency of our algorithm probability-based incremental association rule discovery using the normal approximation, this algorithm is implemented and tested on a PC with 2.93 GHz Intel Core i7, and the main memory is 3 GB. The experiment is tested with a synthetic dataset which are generated by synthetic technique proposed by Agrawal  Th e synthetic dataset is T10I4D100K with the original database of 10,000 transactions A number of transactions of increment database appended to an original database are 3,000 and 5,000 respectively The experiment is conducted with 0.005% minimum support threshold and Prob pl 0.3. The average of execution time compared with Apriori, FUP and probability-based algorithm are demonstrated in table 3 and 4 respectively  Table 3 Average of Execution time for adding 3,000 transactions Algorithm Apriori FUP Probabilitybased Prob-based using Normal Approximati on Execution time sec 61,452.012 0 34,951.310 2 16,252.670 8 14,656.836 0 a number of frequent itemset 1,105 1,105 1,105 1,105 a number of collected expected frequent itemsets  40 115 maximum frequent itemset size of k F 5 F 5 F 5 F 5 a number of Temp_scanDB  95 31  Algorithm3: Generating Candidate Itemset Input db k C UD F 1  DB k F  DB k EF s ,|db Output db k C  new k C 1 if k = 2 2 db C 2  UD F 1  UD F 1 3 new C 2 X  db C 2 X   DB F 2  DB EF 2  4 else if  k  3 5 X  DB k F 1   DB k EF 1   db k C 1  6 UD x   DB x   db x  7 db k F 1  X UD x   s*|db 8 db k C  db k F 1   db k F 1  9 new k C X  db k C X   DB k F  DB k EF  10 end if 11 Return db k C  new k C 438 


The experiment results from table 3 and 4 display that the execution time of the proposed algorithm, the probability-based using the normal approximation algorithm, is concisely better than Apriori and FUP algorithm because Apriori needs to rerun a whole database \(the merging between the original database and increment database\needs k-times \(as size of k to rescan the original data base. While the proposed algorithm needs only one time to rescan the original database For comparing between the pr oposed algorithm and probability-based algorithm, the execution time of the proposed algorithm is slightly better than probability-base algorithm. A number of collected expected frequent itemset the proposed algorithm is greater than the probability-based algorithm. This affects to the number of Temp_scanDB that is the number of Temp_scanDB of the proposed algorithm is less the than probability-based algorithm. These experiment results demonstrate that our hypothesis is accepted, i.e., th e proposed algorithm can decrease the number of Temp_scanDB As a result, the proposed algorithm can reduce a time-consuming of rescanning the original database 6. Conclusion In this paper, we propose the incremental association rule algorithm, probability-based incremental association rule discovery using the normal approximation algorithm which estimates the probability of occurrence of expected frequent itemset using normal approximation. The proposed algorithm can deal with the numerical problem occurred when large n factorial is computed by binomial distribution. In addition, we introduce the increasing probability value of an itemset to be a frequent itemset in an updated database using confidence interval. The experiment results show the slightly better execution time when compare with the probability-based algorithm and the decreasing of a number of Temp_scanDB However we encounter with trade off a number of Temp_scanDB against a number of collected expected frequent itemset However, the common limitation of the proposed algorithm and probability-based algorithm is the fixed size of the increment database That is, both algorithms need to know the exact number of the increment database size for computing the probability value of the cooccurrence itemset in the updated database. Practically the increment database may be continually added to the original database with various sizes. Thus, the future research is looking for the approach to deal with the fixed increment database size problem 7.

A similar phenomenon occurs in closed   HUI mining. Besides, when DAHU was combined with CHUD, the execution time of CHUD+DAHU was up to two times faster than UPGrowth for low minimum utility thresholds and slightly slower than CHUD C  Experiments on BMSWebView1 Dataset The third experiment consists of running UPGrowth CHUD and CHUD+DAHU on BMSWebView1  while varying min_utility from 10% to 1 % of the total utility of the database. Results are presented in Figure 10 and Table VII. UPGrowth runs faster than CHUD and CHUD+DAHU for min_utility 003 3%. However, for min_utility 3%, the performance of UPGrowth decreases sharply. For min_utility 2%, UPGrowth cannot terminate within the time limit of 100,000 seconds and it generates more than 1,000,000 candidates in Phase I, whereas CHUD terminates in 80 seconds and produces only seven closed  HUIs from 32 candidates. The reason why CHUD performs so well is that it achieves a massive reduction in the number of candidates by only generating a few long itemsets containing up to 149 items, while UPGrowth has to consider a huge amount of redundant subsets \(for a closed itemset of 149 items, there can be up to 2 149 2 non-empty proper subsets that are redundant\. DAHU also suffers from the fact that there are too many HUIs. It runs out of memory for min_utility 2 % when trying to recover all HUIs because it has to generate too many subsets D  Experiments on Sythetic Dataset The fourth experiment is to run the algorithms on T12I8D200K  with min_utility varying from 0.1% to 0.02 of the database total utility. Results are presented in Figure 11 and Table VIII. For this dataset, CHUD is faster than UPGrowth for the total execution time. Although the reduction on this synthetic dataset is not as good \(since it produced the same result as UPGrowth\, CHUD is faster because it generates about three times less candidates in Phase I. CHUD takes more times to generate candidates in Phase I. But the total execution time of CHUD is less than UPGrowth because Phase II is more costly than Phase I CHUD+DAHU also outperforms UPGrowth, since DAHU only spend one second to derive all HUIs E  Memory Usage During the previous experiments, we also measure the maximum memory usage of UPGrowth and CHUD. Results for Mushroom  and Foodmart  are presented in Figure 12 and are similar for the other datasets. In general, CHUD uses as much or slightly more memory than UPGrowth because the latter uses a compact tries-based data structure for representing the database that is more memory efficient than a vertical database. However, when the databases contain very long HUIs such as BMSWebView1, the number of candidates can be very large. In this case, the memory consumption of UPGrowth rises dramatically because it needs to create a number of conditional UPTrees that is proportional to the number of candidates

To our knowledge, this is the first study on compact and lossless representation of high utility itemsets. To mine this new style of itemsets, we proposed an efficient algorithm named CHUD. Three effective strategies named REG  RML and DCM were further proposed to enhance the performance of CHUD. To efficiently recover all high utility itemsets from this representation, we proposed a top-down method named DAHU. Real and synthetic datasets with varied characteristics were used to perform a thorough performance evaluation. Results show that the proposed representation achieves a massive reduction in the number of high utility itemsets \(e.g. a reduction of up to 800 times for Mushroom and 32 times for Foodmart datasets\Besides, CHUD outperforms UPGrowth, the current best algorithm by several orders of magnitude under low minimum utility thresholds \(e.g CHUD terminates in 80 seconds on BMSWebView1 for min_utility 2%, while UPGrowth cannot terminate within 24 hours\e combination of CHUD and DAHU is also faster than UPGrowth when DAHU could be applied A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  This research was supported by National Science Council, Taiwan, R.O.C under grant no.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
