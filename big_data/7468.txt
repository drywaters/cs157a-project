  1 Memory Technologies and Data Recorder Design Karl F Strauss Senior Member IEEE  Jet Propulsion Laboratory 4800 Oak Grove Drive Pasadena, California 91109 US  karl.f.strauss@jpl.nasa.gov  Abstract 227Missions, both near Earth and deep space, are under consideration that will require data recorder capacities of such magnitude as to be unthinkable just a few years ago Concepts requiring well over 16,000 GB of storage are 
being studied.  To achieve th is capacity via \223normal means\224 was considered incredible as recently as 2004.  This paper is presented in two parts.  Part I describes the analysis of data recorder capacities for missions as far back as 35 years and provides a projection of data capacities required 20 years from now based upon missions either nearing launch, or in the planning stage The paper presents a similar projection of memory device capacities as baselined in the ITRS \226 the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors.  Using known Total Ionizing Dose tolerance going back as far as a decade 
a projection of total dose tolerance is made for two prime technologies out to the year 2028 Based upon the two prime technologies, the design of a 130 Tb recorder is discussed in Part II.  Further, it is noted that for all the missions and t echnologies analyzed, the parameters of a recorder \226 mass, power, volume \226 remain constant despite ever-increas ing capacity requirements          1 978-1-4244-2622-5/09/$25.00 \2512009 IEEE 2

of data recorders for deep sp ace, Earth orbiting, and Lunar missions commencing from the year 1967. This information is augmented by the inclusion of missions still in the planning stage and the curren tly-allocated data recorder size 1  H ISTORY OF D ATA R ECORDER C APACITY  Eighteen NASA, JPL, JAXA, and ESA deep space missions were analyzed as far back as 1973 \226 the series of Pioneer  JPL CL#08-4253 


 2  missions \226 specifically Pioneer 11, launched April 1973, to study the survivability of the interplanetary asteroid belt and to assess the radiation belts surrounding Jupiter 3   Presenting this information as a graph \(Figure 1\e readily seen that the trend \(shown in Green\deep space missions is to have a doubling of on-board data capacity at a rate approximately every three years  Tape Recorders \226 not without problems Up through 1990, th e spacecraft examined used multi-track tape recorders.  The largest tape recorder \(in terms of data capacity\aunched was the 1.8Gb, 12-track behemoth used on the Magellan mission to Venus.  The Magellan recorder featured over one-half mile of precision Mylar tape.  These precision mechanisms were not without problems \226 culminating in the near loss of the Galileo mission in October, 1995, due to a position encoder error compounded with electrostatic bu ild-up on the tape\222s surface.  From that point on, all missions \(that is to say, all missions examined have utilized solid state recorders \(SSRs Solid State Recorders \226 A Watershed Moment NASA\222s first mission using a solid state data recorder was the Cassini mission launched in 1997.  It features a 2 Gb SSR consisting of 640 specially screened DRAM devices and eight full custom ASICs.  With the advent of the Cassini recorder, two trends emerged.  First was the use of solid state devices for data stor age and the second was the abandonment of the so-called 223Mil-Grade\224 product by most   3 Pioneer 11 ceased transmitting to Earth March 1997 semiconductor manufacturers.  The latter required the development of additional procedures to \223up-screen 4 224 commercial devices to what is termed pseudo-mil.  Often this involved the development of a partnership with the device manufacturer to ensure that the devices chosen screened, and accepted were manufactured at the same time and often from the same wafer lot The use of commercial devices was both a bane and a blessing.  The bane was two-fold.  One, as memory devices were no longer made for sp ecific space-\223type\224 capability \226 such as temperature or radiation \226 a survey of many devices from many manufacturers wa s required.  These surveys involved at least two types of expensive radiation testing \226 Total Ionizing Dose \(TID\nd Single Event Effects \(SEE Complicating the issue, more often than not, manufacturers would alter various manufacturing settings \(such as ion implant depth\hieve better commercial yields, and these changes, however minor, would completely invalidate previous Radiation Lot Acceptance Testing \(RLAT Therefore, this brought in the second complication: the partnering with manufacturers.  This was rarely successful as semiconductor manufacturers are generally not set up to provide customers with lot-sp ecific data.  Therefore, socalled lifetime buys were instituted with random parts being examined internally for monitoring of certain on-die   4 The term \223up-screen\224 refers to a process wherein a set of commercial devices receives extra examination as far as quality and operational parameters are concerned often over a set of voltages and environments in excess of what the manufacturer states the device is designed for.  The \223upscreening\224 may include the use of X-Ray or Ultrasonic based inspections additional radiation testing, and involves the destruction of a sub-set of the devices for physical examination at an Electron Microscopic level Figure 1 - Historical & Projected Spacecraft Data Recorder Capaci ty by Launch Year.

This added greatly to the cost of the recorder 2  A N E XAMINATION OF S OLID S TATE D EVICE H ISTORY  The blessing is that as the semiconductor industry matured and developed new, aggressive products, the design of a recorder often went with it.  Intel founder and chief scientist Gordon Moore \226 then working for Fairchild Semiconductor 226 predicted in 1965 that, essentially, the number of transistors per fixed die size would double roughly every two years to thirty months [1  d a te, the Indu stry h a sn 222t  proven him wrong  [2   Of the thirteen solid-state based data recorders analyzed nine of them are based upon Dynamic Random Access Memory \(DRAM\ or Synchronous DRAM \(SDRAM technology and its variants.  The remainder are based upon non-volatile Flash.   The predominance of DRAM can be attributed to the general ability of DRAM devices to have a higher total ionizing dose tolerance than Flash \(discussed later in this paper MEMORY TECHNOLOGY Of all the devices needed to operate a computer, especially a computer in a space environm ent, space-specific memory technologies have received th e least amount of institutional development.  While commercial technology is achieving density and power reductions unimaginable even a few years ago,   space-specific memory is several generations behind.  Commercial Flash t echnology embraces 4 and 8 Gbits per single die \226 the latest space-rated non-volatile technology is 4 megabits \(Mb\\226 more than three orders of magnitude smaller Non-Volatile technologies  Non-Volatile Memory technology today consists of the following Rotating, Mechanical 227Hard Disk Drive, Optical Platter DVD, CD  Hard Disk Drive 227 Current technology supports 500 GB per platter, Figure 2  Despi t e a succes sful research study undertaken for the Prometheus/JIMO program, due to the competitive nature of the industry, no supplier willing to support this effort has been located  Figure 2 - Hard Disk Platter with Cantilever \(courtesy Seagate   Optical Platter 227Current technology supports 50GB per platter  [4 Du e t o th e co m p etiti v e  n a ture of t h e industry, no supplier willing to propose a rad-tolerant optical platter design has been located  Solid State 227Ferroelectric \(FeRAM\Magnetic MTJ MRAM\, Ovonic \(CRAM\, Trapped Charge \(ONO Nitride-oxide memory  Ferroelectric \(FeRAM 227 In this technology, an Oxygen atom is positioned within a perovskite matrix usually consisting of Lead, Zirconium, and Titanium \(PZT The position of the Oxygen atom is sensed as a positive or negative charge within the matrix, Figure 3   A limiting factor in Ferroelectric is the destructive read out nature of the device.  In this method, any knowledge stored at the cell must be disturbed during the read operation; this then requires a re-write of data which is one more stresscycle to the chip.  The mo st common issues are data retention \(relaxation of the position of the Zi \(or Ti and data imprint \(a tendency of the covalent bonds to prefer that the Zirconium atom remain in the previous position of the crystal The highest capacity devices are 4 Mb per die  Magnetic MTJ \(MRAM In this technology, two layers of magnetic metal, such as cobalt-iron, separated by an ultrathin layer of insulator, typically aluminum oxide Figure 3 - Operation of FeRAM \(courtesy Carnegie Mellon Data is stored as a shift in the Zi \(or Ti\tom within the perovskite bond.  As a result of the shift, the cell is either positively or negatively polarized 


 4  Information is written by injection of electrons directly through the thin \(typ. 1nm\ insulating layer.  Determination of the 1/0 state of a cell is achieved by sensing the reluctance to lightly imposed cu rrent flows in the direction of \226 or in the direction opposite to \226 the stored magnetization in the so-called \223free\224 magnetic layer Figure 4\  [5 A limiting factor in MTJ memory is the current required per bit to impose magnetic spin into the Free Layer.  The most common issues are adjacent bit flip \(field confinement and electro-migration. As with the aforementioned FeRAM these devices, too, are low density \226 also 4 Mb per die Likewise, these were not c onsidered for the HC-SSR discussed in Part II  Figure 4 - Operational Principle of MTJ Device courtesy EverSpin\agnetic lines of force between currents flowing in the Digit Line and the active Bit line imposes magnetic spin into the device\222s 221free layer.\222  Resistance to cu rrent flow \(read cycle\is determined by parallel or anti-parallel lines of force between the pinned layer and the free layer Phase Change 227In this technology the physical state of a plastic-like material is cha nged from an amorphous to crystalline state and back by controlled, direct heating of the memory bit being addressed.  The resistance of the material varies by many orders of magnitude \(Figure 5\ This large spread in resistance makes it easy to discern between a One and a Zero data state  Figure 5 - Phase Change Resistance versus Temperature Profile \(courtesy BAE Testing has shown that the data storage material is immune to strategic radiation, and therefore is a prime candidate for this application \226 as increases in radiation tolerance at the device level brings about a decrease in the amount of radiation shielding required A limiting factor in Phase change memory is the energy heat\ required in order to liquefy the memory cell Typically this is one milliwatt per bit, with cell temperatures reaching 230 Celsius, Figure 6  Figure 6 - Activation Energy versus State of an Ovonic Cell \(derived from Ovonics The main issue with Phase Change memory is the large activation energy \(E A the amorphous high resistance A is computed to be approximately 2.7 eV; an external application of heat may result in loss of data at the cell The densest available Phase Change device today is 4 Mb  Trapped Charge 227Several technologies are available under this category in which a charge \(electron or proton\ped within the crystalline structure of an Oxide at an interface site.   For this paper two technologies were investigated: Flash and NROM Floating Gate \(Flash 227 Non-volatile memory devices have traditionally relied on floating gate technology.  A floating gate memory cell contains an electrically isolated gate, a floating gate \226 below the standard control gate and above the transistor channel. \(Figure 7\ The floating gate is composed of a conducting material, typically layer of polysilicon.  The floating gate memory device stores information by holding electrical charge within the floating gate.  Adding or removing charge from the floating gate changes the threshold voltage of the cell, thereby defining whether the memory cell is in a \223programmed\224 or \223erased\224 state [7 Free Layer  Pinned  Layer Ea ~ 2.7 eV 


 5  A limiting feature in the Flash technology is the necessity to overcome large energy barriers to impose a charge or remove it \(erase\In all devices on the market today, this is done by on-chip generation of a relatively large voltage typ. 10 \226 15 V, sometimes as high as 25\ to bias the substrate and achieve Fowl er-Nordheim tunneling This action stresses the oxides leading to an accumulation of defect sites that eventually renders the cell useless.  Typical device lifetimes are reached after 100,000 erase cycles  Figure 7 \226 Typical Floating Gate Memory Cell [courtesy Saifun Semiconductor  The largest available Flash device today is 8 Gb per die Nitride \(NROM 227 NROM technology contains a nitride layer which traps or stores the charge, instead of a floating gate above the cell.  The nitride layer is surrounded by two insulating silicon dioxide layers. \(Figure 8 arge may be accumulated and confined at each end of the nitride layer, effectively storing two separate and independent charges.  Each charge can be maintained in one of two states, either \223programmed\224 or 223erased,\224 represented by the presence or absence of a pocket of trapped electrons The limiting factors in NROM devices are, similar to Flash large voltages \(in this case 8V\ssary to achieve a write and the very small number of electrons \(sometimes as low as 6\used to signify data which can lead to unusual Single Event Upset \(SEU The largest NROM device available today is 1 Gbit per die this is not a reflection on the capability of the technology merely a reflection of the newness of it 3  S OLID S TATE T ECHNOLOGY B ASELINES 226  THE ITRS The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors ITRS\s a compendium of ex haustive research into the technology trends for the semiconductor industry [9  Updated yearly, the ITRS iden tifies emerging technologies as well as tracks technologies widely in use today Technological advancements are predicted and identified on a year-by-year basis for nearly two decades hence A study of the ITRS for the memory technologies identified above reveals, as expected a doubling of bits-per-die capacity every 30 or so months.  The ITRS does not outright predict that a particular technology will double its capacity rather, the prediction is borne out by an investigation of the feature size and cell-to-cell pitch.    Further, some devices will be implemented with multiple bits per cell \(example Figure 8\\226 with four bits per cell being typical in 2009 this, too, being identified in the ITRS A very telling story of expected device capacity is shown in the Figure 9 Figure 8 - Typical NROM Cell Construction [Saifun N o te th at the  device typically stores two-bits per cell

The grap h shows that the feature size for the listed technologies \(NAND Flash, NROM Ferroelectric, MTJ MRAM, Phase Change\duces at an exponential rate, with a reduction by a factor of 2 approximately every 30 months.  \(Left axis, arrows pointing to Left\ This follows Moore\222s Law The graph also shows that th e Write Erase Voltage \(Right axis, arrows pointing to Right\reduces as well.  This is an important factor as it indicates that the operating power for a system will be reduced from one generation to the next when considered on a per-bit basis The graph concludes with an estimation of per-die data capacity when considering feature size reduction and active die area. \(Heavy green and red lines, Left Axis Flash Currently available si ngle bit per cell Flash devices reach a capacity of 8 Gb per die.

 8  Radiation Tolerance by Feature Size Feature size is the semiconductor industry term for the general length of a source-drain channel in a single MOSFET transistor.  In general, the total dose radiation tolerance of a semiconductor \(or microchip\ncreases as feature size de is is mainly due the thinner oxides used to form the gate of a MOSFET transistor \226 the thinner gate results in dram atically fewer places for free electrons to become entrapped in crystalline defect sites This, in turn, reduces the ability of the transistor to be controlled and, eventually, would lead to a circuit becoming inoperable as intended, usually with serious system consequences A previous development of JPL is the X2000 series of nonvolatile memory cards.  Each card contained twenty Samsung 128Mbit Flash memory devices.  These devices were manufactured with 300nm design rules \(feature size and an oxide thickness of 90 Angstroms.  Testing performed by JPL showed these devices maintained operation within specification to approximately 15 kilorads for the specific environment and operational  By comparison, testing a 4 Gbit Flash memory [1 manufactured at 90 nm feat ure size showed normal operation to 100 krads.  From there , total dose tolerance has increased dramatically regula rly achieving 200 krads [15  16 r 65  n m   A plot of Feature Size and Total Dose tolerance is included as Figure 14.  One should note that the total dose tolerance of any device studied is dependent upon operational function prior, during, and after exposure.   It is conceivable, and normal to have a single device, tested many times and many ways, to have varying total dose capability An excellent treatise on the control of radiation effects through design and processing can be found in [17  A chart representing launches \(and planned launches\rsus measured and expected \(for years 2009 and beyond radiation tolerance for Flash and NROM technology devices is included as Figure 15.  Note that NROM device technology flat-lines at 1 Mrad \226 this is based upon a business model by the supplier not to pursue capabilities in the multi-Megarad regime at this time This chart reveals that for all the missions studied --- save for one --, the use of storage devices manufactured without any special radiation processing is adequate.  One must read this with a good amount of caution as the radiation capability of any technology beyond the year 2009 is highly speculative but is intended to indicate an increase in total dose tolerance as device features continue to shrink Figure 14 - Total Dose Capability and Feature Size note CY2009 and beyond Speculative Figure 15 - Mission Radiation requi rements and Technology Capability 


 9  according to Moore\222s Law Therefore, the selection of Flash and NROM devices will more than suit all mission needs.  The sole outlier here is the Jupiter Europa Orbiter mission which requires devices capable of operating after megarads of exposure Flash\227 Due to decreased feature size, Flash devices of higher density will experience greater total ionizing dose tolerance and, conversely, experience a high upset rate of data or control information caused by the SEFI 5 phenomena 1   Current radiation tolerance is in the realm of 100 krads to 200 krads [19 Th is is no t a resu lt o f sp ecial d e sign  but  rather the normal increase of total dose capability due to processing, as discussed earlier in this paper NROM\227 NROM is currently the only technology supporting high capacity designs in which the vendor has agreed to develop devices that will perform to radiation immune levels.  Testing on existing commercial samples reveals radiation tolerance to 200 \226 300 krads. By design levels exceeding 1000 krads  o mmercial parts  tested have proven to be latch-up free when exposed to heavy ions at a fluence level of 5 x 10 5 ions/cm 3 at an LET of 58 MeV/mg/cm 2 20 Ad d ition ally, and p e rh ap s m o re importantly, \223NROM technology has an inherent immunity to failure due to point defects in the gate dielectric layer Electrons \(or holes\re trapped individually\205 NROM technology does not suffer from charge loss   5 Single Event Functional Interrupt \226 a loss or unexpected change of state of a device often by a charged particle upsetting a latch or register within the device\222s state machine CRAM\227 By design, this technology handily maintains normal operation in an environment exceeding 1000 krads 22 Fo r ex t r em e en v i ro nmen ts, u n til o t h er techno log i es are funded and move forward \(e.g. NROM alternative 5  A  N EW M AXIM  One will note that the evidence suggests a certain exponential growth exists for the required data volume of data recorders.  Further, that by its very nature, the semiconductor memory industry is matching such needs with ever increasing density of its products. \(Figure 12 Including the desired Recorder capacity, by Year, gives us the Figure 16.

 11  Impact \226 Strauss\222s Derivative of Moore The impact of such a simple statement is at the same time beautiful and difficult to realize.  What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.  It can be easily seen that in terms of memory technology for space, the selection is limited \226 especially so when it comes to non-volatile radiation hardened devices Part II 6  H IGH C APACITY S OLID S TATE R ECORDER  The impetus of this paper was the assignment to predict mass, power, volume, and cost for multi-terabit data recorders of the capacities shown in Table 3 with deliveries occurring in the year given [2   Table 3 - Data Recorder Capacity Requirements YEAR DATA CAPACITY 2010 2.88 Tb 2020 30 Tb 2030 130 Tb  This part of the paper presents a design of a 130 Tb NonVolatile data recorder which could be built for delivery in the year 2030, based on the information presented in Part I In developing the SSR design, technology selection was limited to the two technologies examined in detail in Part I Flash and NROM\nd a technology freeze date of 36 months in advance of delivery was assumed  SSR \226 Flash & NROM Based designs Table 4 - ITRS predicted device capacity \(Gb for three technologies Year 2015 2018 2021 2025 Technology CRAM 0.032 0.064 0.064 0.128 NROM 4 8 16 32 Flash 64 128 256 512  In this particular case, the year 2025 is selected as the freeze date and appropriate device capacity is used.

The recorder features cross-coupled SpaceWire interfaces as well as redundancy down to the memory plane Cross-coupled controllers w ith shared memory ensure operation without the need to re-build memory allocation tables should a fault occur Recorder Summary  Using conservative packaging techniques, two recorder designs were developed: one using Flash memory and the other using NROM.  A summary of their characteristics is provided in the tables below.  A more detailed discussion of design and implementation follows Board Design  Figure 19 - One side of 8Tb Memory Slice using NROM Technology The NROM-based solution is presented as Figure 19.  In the figure, nearly two hundred 2-Gbit NROM devices are installed on each face of the 9U card.  \(The whitespace is preserved in this example for passive components and design margin.\e time of this writing, the availability of chip-stacked NROM devices was uncertain and omitted from the trade space Design of a Flash-based memory card would be of similar ilk.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous
