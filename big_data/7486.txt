S K Sharma X Wang Live Data Analytics With Collaborative Edge and Cloud Processing in Wireless IoT Networks  stored for further processing and also to facilitate real-time delivery at the edge-side thus leading to the storage/caching constraints Existing wireless networks are mainly designed by considering communication resources as the primary resources with the connection-oriented approach and other resources such as computing and caching are considered as secondary However the demand is towards content-oriented networks facilitated by the recent advances in Internet technologies and cloud computing where computing and caching will be the integral parts of the network Also in the 034fth generation 0505G\051 and beyond wireless networks all types of resources such as communication computing and caching will be distributed throughout the network and it is an important challenge to coordinate among these resources towards their effective utilization in handling the massive amount of distributed data One of the promising approaches to tackle the issues of the big data could be to enable synergies among communications computing and caching components of future wireless IoT networks The inte gration of these paradigms may lead to additional degrees of freedom in effectively optimizing the resources of communication systems In this regard it has become an essential requirement to take all the involved resources into account while designing future wireless IoT networks by exploiting the synergy among communications caching and computing paradigms 5 One of the recent developments in the computing world is the Internet-based computing called cloud computing which provides an ubiquitous and on-demand access to a virtually shared pool of con\034gurable computing and storage resources Cloud computing is an e xcellent platform to handle the enormous data generated from the IoT environment due to cheaper and large amount of virtual computing/processing power available at the cloud centre Therefore the current trend is towards IoT-cloud convergence with most of the IoT platforms supported with cloud computing However it is not suitable for the applications demanding low-latency real-time operation and high Quality of Service 050QoS\051 In addition to lo w latenc y and location awareness requirements the emerging IoT platform requires the support for seamless mobility and ubiquitous coverage which can not be fully supported by cloud computing solutions On the other hand the concept of edge computing also called fog computing 1 is receiving important attention in order to address some of the drawbacks of cloud computing  The main goal of edge computing is to extend the cloud computing functions to the edges of the network Due to proximity to the end-users and geographically distributed deployment it can support the applications/services demanding the requirements of lowlatency location-awareness high mobility and high QoS 1 In this paper the terms edge computing and fog computing are used interchangeably and they refer to the computing/processing at the IoT gateway/aggregator nodes/edge servers However edge computing units usually do not have enough storage and computing resources in handing the massive amount of IoT data In addition due to several involved constraints such as low-power heterogeneity and weak capability of devices IoT environment is more vulnerable to the information security Therefore there is a clear need to investigate suitable network architecture and control mechanisms to handle the processing of massive IoT data in a secured manner Although there are ongoing parallel advances in the 034elds of cloud computing and edge computing interactions between these platforms in handling live data analytics from the communication perspective have not been investigated in the literature A few works have recently highlighted the need of coordination between edge computing and cloud computing 11 12 ho we v er  the y do not consider various practical aspects of live data analytics in wireless IoT networks In this regard this paper proposes a novel framework of collaborative edge-cloud processing in order to handle live data analytics in wireless IoT networks by combining advantages from both the cloud and edge computing paradigms Due to huge amount of storage and computing resources available at the cloud-end it is bene\034cial to of\035oad much of the computational tasks to the cloud However it becomes highly advantageous to handle delay-sensitive tasks at the edge-side in order to ensure real-time processing and feedback to the end-users More importantly in the proposed framework cloud processing can utilize its network-wide global knowledge and historical/delayed information and can act as a monitoring or guidance platform to guide edge processing units towards the effective-utilization of available resources Starting with the basic features and key enablers of big data analytics we discuss various challenges in performing live data analytics in wireless IoT networks Subsequently we provide synergies and differences between cloud and edge computing platforms Then we propose a novel framework for collaborative processing between edge and cloud computing along with some interesting applications Subsequently we discuss various key

processing platforms from the perspective of live data analytics Section IV proposes a novel collaborative edge-cloud processing framework for handling live data analytics in wireless IoT networks

S K Sharma X Wang Live Data Analytics With Collaborative Edge and Cloud Processing in Wireless IoT Networks  A BASIC FEATURES The term Big data usually refers to extremely large heterogeneous and complex 050semi-structured and unstructured\051 data-sets which cannot be handled by the conventional data processing and storage tools/applications such as Relational Database Management System 050RDBMS\051 The impor tance of big data lies on how meaningful information can be extracted from it for a particular application rather than the size of the data and this extraction process requires novel data analysis methods and huge processing power In wireless IoT environments big data may be generated from a variety of application scenarios ranging from smart home scenario to e-Healthcare applications In addition to the importance of content and control signaling data in wireless networks location-based data from various sensors such as GPS sensors and embedded sensors in mobile devices can provide signi\034cant inputs to the government bodies in developing speci\034c strategies for public facilities transportation system emergency responses and crime/risk warnings Moreover by analyzing the habits and interests of customers industries may plan their future products in order to address their customers personalized as well as group needs FIGURE 1 Main attributes of big data As depicted in Fig 1 the commonly discussed attributes of big data are 050i\051 v olume 050ii\051 v ariety  050iii\051 v eracity  050iv\051 velocity and 050v\051 value The 034rst two attributes i.e volume and variety re\035ect to the hardware and software requirements in handling massive heterogeneous data-sets while the features veracity and velocity translate into the real-time processing ability with suf\034cient trustworthiness On the other hand acquisition of the highest useful value from the complex big data-sets in wireless IoT networks requires interdisciplinary cooperation among academia enterprises and wireless industries B CHALLENGES In contrast to the traditional data big data mainly differs in the following way 050i\051 data rate is more rapid and data volume is constantly updated 050ii\051 data is of semi-structured or unstructured nature 050iii\051 data source is fully distributed 050iv\051 data access is in batch mode or real time instead of more interactive feature in the traditional data and 050v\051 integration of heterogeneous data from different sources becomes complicated The heterogeneous data generated from IoT devices may have certain statistical and strong correlative features across several dimensions such as time and location and also the devices may have social relations among themselves In addition in hierarchial IoT networks the aggregated features of the data traf\034c can be exploited in order to regulate the peak content demand for example cluster planning based on data distribution peak load shifting and cache provisioning Besides IoT devices with similar interests may share the contents from their nearby devices and this content sharing may be enabled using either infrastructure-based communication or some infrastructure-free communication Such a peer to peer nature of resource sharing called as crowd computing can e xploit the spatial correlation as well as the mobility of IoT devices Big data analytics at the cloud centre can easily integrate the data collected using distributed sensors and aggregator nodes while exploiting correlation among the data-sets More importantly this has the ability to analyze the massive data with ever-increasing scale and complexity and can provide a global point of view across the whole network Moreover this cloud-based approach will lead to lower-error higher-precision and more dynamic treatment of data than the conventional data analytic approaches Ho we v er  handling IoT data in the cloud platform in a traditional way creates several issues due to speci\034c features of IoT data described in the following 1\051 Distributed and heterogeneous data structure  IoT data is generated from distributed heterogeneous nodes which is largely diverse and may range from integer to character and can be semi-structured and unstructured such as audio images and video In addition big data in wireless networks is usually distributed across several domains such as frequency space time codes and antennas Also the involved data sources may have distinct characteristics in terms of data rate mobility power levels and transmission schemes 2\051 Real-time requirements  The dynamic environment of wireless IoT systems creates the need to handle a large volume of real-time and high-speed continuous data streams 3\051 Weak data semantics  The data acquired from IoT sensors are mainly of low-level having weak semantics and are gathered with the help of resourceconstrained sensors/devices/objects In order to extract meaningful information from the collected data they need to go through effective processing by exploiting various aspects such as spatial-temporal correlation and event-driven knowledge 4\051 Data inaccuracy  Since the information gathered by the employed sensing system may not be accurate VOLUME 5 2017 4623 


S K Sharma X Wang Live Data Analytics With Collaborative Edge and Cloud Processing in Wireless IoT Networks  enough due to various practical constraints suitable multi-dimensional sensing data analysis and processing techniques need to be investigated for wireless IoT applications The data analytics life-cycle to handle IoT data starts with the collection of the raw data collection at the IoT sensors and then the acquired raw information is aggregated at the aggregator/gateway and is subsequently sent to the cloud for further processing The raw information g athered from the IoT sensors may represent various parameters such as vibration pressure temperature motion heart rate etc and they need to be converted into recognizable formats for further analysis The acquired data may be transmitted to the cloud centre either in a single hop or multiple hops based on the employed network topology The completion of this life-cycle requires effective coordination of various activities among IoT sensors IoT aggregator nodes/gateways in-transit network devices such as routers/relays and software/hardware resources in the cloud center Further more it is crucial to have reliable and effective wireless communication links among these entities in order to ensure proper operation of wireless IoT networks Another key issue for handling big IoT data is how to turn the burden of handling big data to the bene\034ts in improving the performance of wireless networks The big data usually exhibits highly useful features such as user activity/mobility patterns and temporal spatial and social correlations of data contents By properly extracting and effectively utilizing these features the performance of various wireless networks could be signi\034cantly enhanced For example by analyzing social ties and common interests of people in a certain region the network can fetch the popular contents to the corresponding edge gateway in order to reduce latency as well as the communication bandwidth overhead In wireless IoT networks it is crucial to develop techniques to convert a massive amount of raw data into the meaningful information The main challenge during this data interpretation and knowledge formation is to develop suitable data inference techniques to deal with the noisy and realworld data Furthermore dealing with the uncertainty in the interpreted data is another challenge due to dynamics of timevarying wireless environment In order to make a reliable and trustworthy decision reliable transport protocols and suitable in-\034eld sensor calibration techniques need to be investigated Otherwise it may lead to wrong or incomplete data resulting in false conclusions which if used in practical scenarios may lead to serious problems In order to tackle this the inferred information can be supported by a probabilitybased con\034dence level which can be used to ensure the safe operation of the devices Moreo v er  in se v eral scenarios it may be necessary to combine the current sensor data with the historical data in order to derive an effective conclusion C ENABLERS FOR BIG DATA ANALYTICS The conventional data management tools such as RDBMS are mainly designed to handle structured data and are not suitable for handling semi-structured or unstructured data In addition for handling the massive IoT data RDBMSs can scale up with the costly hardware but not with the commodity hardware T o address the aforementioned issues some ad-hoc solutions have been recently proposed by the research community In terms of infrastructure level cloud computing has been considered important for handling big data due to its several features such as scalability elasticity and costeffectiveness In order to handle massive unstructured datasets NoSQL databases and distributed 034le systems have been suggested Furthermore programming frameworks like MapReduce have been proposed in order to handle groupaggregation tasks like website ranking Moreover in terms of system-level solution open-source software frameworks like Hadoop have been proposed to integrate data storage data processing and other modules Ho we v er  these solutions are not mature enough in order to handle huge data collection and transmission and to provide real-time processing and feedback to the end-users Also high power consumption large network overhead latency privacy and security are of important issues to be addressed Figure 2 illustrates the key technology enablers for big data analytics In the following we provide brief description of these techniques from the data analytics perspective Stochastic models are probabilistic models and are usually used to capture the explicit features and dynamics of the data traf\034c The commonly used stochastic models are Markov models time series geometric models and Kalman 034lters On the other hand data mining approach tries to extract implicit information from the data-sets and transform this information to a known structure for further usage by employing suitable anomaly detection classi\034cation clustering and regression analysis methods Machine learning techniques aim to create a functional relationship between input data-set and output actions and are capable of performing predictions and decisions based on the input data without requiring the need of following static program instructions These techniques can be broadly categorized into unsupervised supervised and reinforcement learning and they may comprise of various classi\034cation techniques regression analysis and Q-learning techniques In addition to the conventional machine learning techniques several advanced learning techniques such as active learning deep learning and online learning can be utilized to extract useful information from incomplete or complex data-sets Active learning is mostly useful for partially labeled datasets while deep learning is suitable for modeling complex behaviors of heterogeneous data-sets On the other hand online learning deals with learning in real-time and is useful for applications where data arrives in a sequential order In terms of computing platforms edge computing and cloud computing are considered as key solutions for handling big data analytics and they will be detailed later in Section III In addition crowd computing is another emerging paradigm in which nearby devices with social ties and similar interests can share resources in order to maximize the overall 4624 VOLUME 5 2017 


S K Sharma X Wang Live Data Analytics With Collaborative Edge and Cloud Processing in Wireless IoT Networks  FIGURE 2 Main technology enablers for big data analytics system performance By implementing this paradigm devices having higher computing capability and power resource can help other devices with lower computing capability and battery level in achieving their performance targets Moreover crowd computing-based solutions can exploit temporal spatial correlations as well as mobility of IoT devices for information/resource sharing and can subsequently reduce the backhaul/fronthaul bandwidth in infrastructure-based wireless IoT networks Based on the processing time required for big data analytics the potential techniques can be broadly classi\034ed into stream processing and batch processing In the 034rst approach the data arrives to the system continuously in the form of a stream and the data size is in\034nite or unknown in advance Whereas in the batch processing method data size is 034nite and known in advance and they are stored and analyzed In this approach the data are divided into small chunks and processed in parallel in a distributed manner The widely used linear algebra methods such as Cholesky decomposition and matrix multiplications and convex optimization algorithms can not be straightforwardly applied for big data analytics because of extremely large sizes of data as well as the involved parameters This requires the need of adapting the existing algorithms and investigating new optimization techniques for big data analytics problems Optimization algorithms suitable for big data can be categorized into the following types 050i\051 034rst order methods 050ii\051 randomization and 050iii\051 parallel and distributed computation Out of these distributed optimization algorithms play a key role in solving resource allocation and management problems in heterogeneous wireless IoT networks where information and resources are often distributed across various entities of the networks Some examples of distributed optimization algorithms are alternating direction method of multipliers and primal/dual decomposition which can decompose complex optimization problems into sub-problems in such a way that they can be simultaneously computed This parallel computation capability signi\034cantly helps in reducing computational burden in a single computing unit as well as the communication overhead over the fronthaul/backhaul One possible way of dealing with the high dimensionality of big data is to use random matrix theory 22 by representing big data in the form of large random matrices This analysis is based on some of large dimensional matrix VOLUME 5 2017 4625

section IV PROPOSED COLLABORATIVE EDGE-CLOUD PROCESSING As highlighted in Section III edge computing and cloud computing solutions have their own distinct advantages and disadvantages from the perspective of live data analytics in wireless IoT networks The integration of centralized feature of the cloud and the real-time advantage of edge computing can address various issues in dealing with real-time data analytics in wireless IoT networks Motivated by this aspect in this section we propose a novel framework for collaborative edge-cloud processing in wireless IoT networks FIGURE 3 Proposed generalized system model for collaborative edge-cloud processing in heterogeneous IoT networks Figure 3 presents a generalized system model for collaborative edge-cloud processing in heterogeneous wireless IoT networks In the proposed model IoT edge gateways are equipped with cache memory and are capable of performing edge-caching in order to deliver the popular contents locally The edge computing nodes may be any devices having the capability of computing storage and network connectivity such as routers switches and video surveillance cameras Depending on the application scenarios IoT networks may comprise of various networks having distinct characteristics For example in the smart home scenario wireless IoT networks may consist of a WiFi network a bluetooth network a Zigbee network and a cellular network The raw-data coming from different domains/sensors is largely diverse and need to be collected over time In addition data dimensions and sizes may be different depending on the considered IoT application scenario Besides the real-time processing of massive IoT data this collaborative framework an enable new wireless IoT applications which may require collaborations among different edge computing units and between edge computing units and the cloud centre The proposed system will bene\034t from the advantages of both the cloud computing and edge computing In addition to this we envision cloud centre as a monitoring and guidance platform to have effective real-time data processing at the edge-side of wireless IoT networks In practical scenarios IoT devices/sensors are heterogeneous in nature in terms of their computing capabilities intelligence as well as the computing/processing power In this regard it becomes highly bene\034cial to guide the operation/processing of edge-nodes in order to utilize the available communication and computing resources in an effective manner In the considered framework edge computing helps to gather information from the surrounding radio environment while the cloud computing assists by providing suitable instructions to the edge-side nodes for their operations For example the operations at the edge-side such as data compression 034ltering sampling rate power control and making decisions on the type of data to be sensed/acquired can be supported by the cloud centre by providing suitable control signals over the feedback links Since the cloud centre can have a global view of information collected from a large number of sensors deployed over a large geographical region the control of edge processing from the cloud-side can provide signi\034cant improvements in future wireless IoT networks Due to huge amount of computing resources available at the cloud end it is bene\034cial to of\035oad much of the computational tasks to the cloud On the other hand it is advantageous to handle delay-sensitive tasks at the edge-side Depending on various levels of information such as traf\034c types location information processing delay and transmission overhead the decision on whether to of\035oad data to the cloud or not can be made It can also be considered that all the edge nodes are operated in a coordinated fashion in order to help each other in terms of communication computing and storage/caching resources Another important aspect which can be exploited in the proposed framework is that cloud processing can utilize the history/delayed information available at the cloud-centre in order to infer certain decisions for the edge processing without the need of waiting for the instantaneous data collected from IoT nodes The introduction of edge-computing in the conventional centralized cloud computing set-up brings up new opportunities to balance the trade-off between centralized and distributed network architectures In this re g ard the proposed collaborative edge-cloud processing will be significantly useful to decide on what actions to perform locally and what actions to be sent to the cloud Various constraints in the considered system model include computational rate computing power processor speed cache size communication bandwidth latency and transmit power The performance of the considered framework in Fig 3 can be evaluated in terms of various metrics such as energy ef\034ciency spectral ef\034ciency throughput operational ef\034ciency cache hit ratio VOLUME 5 2017 4627 


S K Sharma X Wang Live Data Analytics With Collaborative Edge and Cloud Processing in Wireless IoT Networks  computational ef\034ciency end to end latency and of\035oading ef\034ciency Since wireless environment is time varying in nature it is crucial to adapt the proposed collaborative processing dynamically Depending on different network conditions physical channel conditions and data features such as temporal and spatial correlations the proposed collaborative platform may adaptively choose among central processing at the cloud centre local processing at the edge gateway and parallel processing at both the ends The historical data available at the cloud side and the instantaneous data collected by the edge nodes at the current instance can be used to predict various important parameters such as future traf\034c 035ow energy usage weather forecasting community activity and geo-location In this context it is important to investigate dynamic prediction algorithms which can be updated based on time-varying situations such as source node failure and security threat Due to massive amount of IoT data and continuously increasing number of service requests power consumption for operating servers in the cloud centre is rapidly increasing Therefore it is crucial to in v estig ate suitable strategies to reduce energy consumption in the edge-cloud coordinated platform On the other hand it is important to guarantee the latency requirements while delivering services to the end-users In this regard it is essential to investigate the fundamental tradeoff between energy consumption and latency in the considered cloud-edge platform of wireless IoT networks Moreo v er  the massi v e data-sets g athered from various locations have heterogeneous formats and are usually semi-structured and unstructured in nature In most cases the data-sets are in a raw form with inconsistency high redundancy and much useless information Without performing pre-processing operations on the data-sets not only a huge storage is required but also the data may not 034t into the prede\034ned database structure Therefore it becomes highly bene\034cial to carry out data pre-processing such as data integration redundancy elimination and data cleansing at the edge-side in order to avoid the unnecessary storage space and also to enhance the computational ef\034ciency Furthermore it may not be necessary for all IoT sensor nodes to upload the collected/generated data to the cloud In this regard the edge computing unit can inform IoT devices when to stop sending the data to the cloud in order to effectively utilize the network resources In addition a certain portion of the data may not be required for a certain time period In this case the IoT gateway can inform the IoT sensor/device when it needs to stop uploading the data This collaborative procedure will help to save the cloud as well as the network resources for that idle period Besides in the existing scenarios many nodes are directly connected to a sink node/access point/coordinator which leads to signi\034cant increase in the complexity for node scheduling and subsequently it will lead to the intolerable system delay In this context the proposed framework follows a hierarchical network structure in which the nodes can be grouped locally into different clusters and they can be connected to the sink via their cluster heads By enabling collaborations among the devices within a cluster using their social relations devices can share various communication storage and computing resources and subsequently the network performance can be enhanced in terms of different performance metrics such as latency and energy ef\034ciency content delivery ef\034ciency and security The proposed collaborative edge-cloud processing framework can be applied to handle real-time data analytics in wireless IoT networks with different performance objectives Some of the potential applications are listed below 017 Cloud-assisted adaptive optimization of computing communications and caching resources 017 Cloud-assisted energy-ef\034cient caching and task/data of\035oading 017 Spectrum monitoring and dynamic spectrum management using collaborative edge-cloud processing 017 Event-driven resource allocation and network management using collaborative edge-cloud processing 017 Cloud-assisted security and privacy enhancement V POTENTIAL ENABLERS CHALLENGES AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS In this section we provide various potential enablers key challenges and potential future directions for the proposed collaborative edge-cloud processing by categorizing them into the following topics A COORDINATION MECHANISMS BETWEEN EDGE COMPUTING AND CLOUD COMPUTING In the proposed collaborative edge-cloud architecture communication computing and storage functionalities need to be dynamically allocated among the edge-side units cloud and the things 050devices/sensors\051 in order to handle the massive IoT data in the real-time Besides there is a strong need to have the coordinated management of cloud computing and edge computing units in handling massive IoT connections in a reliable and secured manner In other w ords ef fecti v e coordination mechanisms between edge processing units and cloud processing units are crucial in order to realize this architecture effectively In order to enable these interactions suitable interfaces between edge processing unit and the cloud centre among different edge processing units and between edge processing units and IoT devices/objects need to be de\034ned Moreover in the proposed coordinated platform the cloud center is assumed to be capable of dictating the edge computing units about which parameters are important to monitor how frequent a parameter needs to be monitored and which task should be processed to meet the real-time requirements of end-users In this regard various aspects such as coordination framework de\034nition parameters to be coordinated control signaling design from the cloud center and load balancing at the edge and cloud sides need to be investigated 4628 VOLUME 5 2017

are provided below 017 De\034nition of edge-cloud interaction mechanisms  Various aspects such as what should be the suitable interfaces between cloud and edge between cloud and things between edge and things/devices and between different edge computing units which computing and communication parameters will be involved in establishing relationship between edge and cloud units and how to design common control signaling and management schemes in order to control edge units from the cloud need to be investigated under the proposed framework 017 Resource mapping between edge and cloud computing  In order to enable effective collaborations between edge and cloud units it is important to investigate suitable techniques to map edge-side computing/communication resources with the cloud-side resources and also suitable strategies to share resources among multiple edge units for handling live data anlytics 017 Load balancing among edge cloud and things  It is crucial to investigate which tasks can be handled at the edge gateway and which tasks should be sent to the cloud which tasks can be handled at the things/devices in order to effectively optimize the available edge and cloud resources in the proposed platform 017 QoS enhancement schemes  In the considered cloudedge coordinated platform it is important to identify the performance bottlenecks 050communication bandwidth cache size computing power etc.\051 and then to develop suitable techniques to minimize service response time and to improve reliability in the case of network/link failures B BIG-DATA AWARE EDGE-CLOUD COLLABORATIVE PROCESSING One promising way of dealing with the big data in wireless IoT networks is to understand the features of big data and to incorporate this awareness in order to enhance the system performance In contrast to multimedia contents IoT data has several peculiar features such as bursty nature small data-size and transiency i.e they expire in short time Besides in the proposed framework only enriched data with the meaningful information can be forwarded to the cloud instead of sending all the raw data to the cloud In this direction it is interesting to explore model-based data processing techniques such as data compression device cooperation and distributed coding/encoding by extracting certain features of IoT data such as temporal and spatial correlations and social relations For example the data collected from IoT sensor nodes can be compressed at the aggregator node before forwarding to the cloud and also only certain features of the raw data can be extracted and sent to the cloud for some speci\034c applications One of the main tasks of IoT sensors is to sense various parameters of the environment under the practical constraints such as low-cost low-power and weak processing capability In the proposed architecture it is crucial to optimize edgecomputing resources at the IoT gateway along with the communication resources such as transmit power bandwidth and antennas in order to meet the desired performance metrics of the proposed system such as latency data rate and energy ef\034ciency Also in various IoT applications such as smart health and smart car it is important to acquire and process contextual information such as location and speed to provide meaningful information In this regard the cloud centre can facilitate the optimization of edge-side processing under the proposed framework For example sampling rate to be employed at the edge-node depends on the characteristics of information 050such as radio spectrum usage\051 to be acquired from the environment and higher sampling rate causes more power consumption and also requires costly equipment In this example the cloud centre can provide guidance to the edge-nodes on the use of suitable sampling rate based on its networkwide intelligence as well as history information in order to reduce the power consumption Besides other transmission and operating parameters at the edge-nodes such as transmit power modulation and coding can be adapted based on the feedback provided by the cloud-centre Another key challenge in the proposed framework is how to minimize the closed-loop 050end-to-end\051 latency in order to process IoT big data in the real-time In practice the closedloop latency of the considered system should be within the data coherence time i.e lifetime of the data By employing suitable data prioritization techniques the processing of the prioritized data can be handled at the edge computing units to provide faster response to the end-users In addition by employing caching techniques at the edge computing units in the proposed platform content delivery ef\034ciency can be maximized and fronthaul/backhaul bandwidth overhead can be signi\034cantly reduced as in 5G wireless networks Dur ing the off-peak hours popular contents can be pre-fetched to the edge-side and during the peak periods the delivery phase has to only deal with the transmission of additional contents requested from the users The content popularity can be predicted using the available historical big data at the cloud side and then a suitable cache replacement policy can be employed on the basis of the predicted content popularity distribution Based on the above discussion we highlight some of the research directions under this topic below 017 Energy-ef\034cient caching strategies  Various aspects such as time-varying popularity estimation popularity modeling/prediction based on historical data cache placement delivery and replacement strategies different performance tradeoffs such as data rate versus cache size 050memory\051 latency versus memory and energy versus delay cooperative and coded caching can be investigated in the proposed framework 017 Edge-side data acquisition and processing techniques  At the edge-side of the proposed platform various cloud-assisted data processing techniques such VOLUME 5 2017 4629

sensing/monitoring/acquisition distributed encoding/decoding combining and decision making schemes can be investigated 017 Closed-loop latency minimization  In order to minimize closed-loop latency in the proposed framework suitable device/node/task/data prioritization techniques can be investigated under various practical constraints such as transmit power and backhaul/fronthaul bandwidth based on different criteria such as residual energy requirement emergency level and expected delay 017 Adaptive learning/prediction algorithms  Several issues such as how to make the best use of available prediction algorithms 050Neural network arti\034cial intelligence support vector machine clustering regression analysis etc.\051 in different application scenarios and how to adapt algorithms based on time-varying situations are promising future directions C TASK/DATA/COMPUTATION/PROGRAM OFFLOADING It is understood that huge amount of IoT data cannot be handled at the edge-side and need to be of\035oaded to the cloud-side Besides resources at the edge side such as transmit power bandwidth and computing power need to allocated ef\034ciently to handle real-time applications at the edge-side Latency tolerant and large-scale tasks can be processed ef\034ciently at the cloud centre while it is advantageous to process latency-sensitive tasks at the edgeside The transfer of computational load/data/task from the edge-side to the cloud in the proposed collaborative edgecloud framework can be enabled by employing suitable task/data/computation/program of\035oading techniques at the IoT edge gateway/aggregator In this regard it is crucial to take effective decisions about which data/task to of\035oad to cloud and which data/task to be processed at the edge-side based on the guidance from the cloud center By using suitable data prioritization techniques critical data 050which needs real-time treatment\051 can be identi\034ed and processed at the edge-side to provide faster response to the end-users The prioritized data can be later sent to the cloud for further processing and storage for future usage In this regard suitable data classi\034cation data prioritization data/task partitioning/scheduling task/data of\035oading with backhaul constraints 050limited bandwidth delay power consumption\051 and delay-based node prioritization need to be investigated under the proposed framework Besides since there is a huge amount of cost involved in renting cloudlets from the cloud providers it is essential to investigate the tradeoff between service execution time and the cost required to use the cloud resources Based on the above discussion we provide some research topics under this theme below 017 Task scheduling techniques  In the proposed framework suitable task scheduling techniques need to be investigated for multiple dependent and interdependent tasks under the constraints of cloud/edge computing resource cost and service/work\035ow execution time deadline 017 Data of\035oading techniques  The investigation of suitable data/task of\035oading techniques under backhaul and edge-cloud resource constraints and decision making strategies on which data to of\035oad to the cloud and which to process at the edge-side are important future research directions 017 Code partitioning techniques  In order to maximize the overall computational ef\034ciency of the proposed framework it is crucial to investigate which parts of the code to be run locally at the edge-side and which parts should be of\035oaded to the cloud and at what state of the program considering practical constraints such as battery level delay constraint and channel state 017 Performance tradeoffs  Various performance tradeoffs such as of\035oading gain versus energy and cost of cloud resources versus service execution time under the proposed framework are interesting aspects to be investigated in future works D ADAPTIVE OPTIMIZATION OF COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND CACHING RESOURCES In contrast to the traditional way of managing computing and communication resources in a separate manner future wireless IoT networks require novel solutions towards the adaptive optimization of computing storage and communication resources at both the edge and cloud sides in order to deal with the massive amount of heterogeneous data Besides in the considered cloud-based IoT environment the overall system dynamics vary due to different causes such as device movements system parameter variations and wireless channel variations thus making the designed system unstable over the time In this context it is important to adapt the system model and decisions/control actions to be taken based on the global knowledge available at the cloud side and instantaneous information collected at the edge-side Moreover objective functions can be adapted based on the varying state of the system as well as instantaneous requirements from the end-users Besides in order to facilitate real-time collaboration between the cloud computing and edge computing units it is crucial to optimize the involved backhaul/feedback links under the transmission bandwidth constraint without compromising the quality of the links In this direction suitable techniques for designing low-latency 035exible backhaul links under the constraints of end-user QoS requirements can be developed by utilizing the concepts of software de\034ned wireless networks Moreo v er  the interactions between various layers of protocol stacks need to be considered in devising end-end system reliability In this direction various cross-layer techniques such as modulation and coding adaptation at the physical layer collision free access mechanisms at the access layer and novel routing algorithms at the network layer can be investigated for the proposed architecture 4630 VOLUME 5 2017 


S K Sharma X Wang Live Data Analytics With Collaborative Edge and Cloud Processing in Wireless IoT Networks  Based on the above discussion we highlight some of the interesting research topics below 017 Characterization of system resources  In the proposed framework it is important to identify all the involved communication caching and computing resources and then derive link/system capacity or any other suitable metrics by considering all these resources into account in order to provide the overall characterization of the system 017 Adaptive optimization problems  Some examples include latency minimization under the constraints of computational rate transmit power minimization under the constraints of computational rate precoding matrices/beamforming vector optimization under the constraints of computational rate and the optimization of processing power under the constraints of latency bandwidth and transmit power 017 Performance tradeoffs  In the considered framework several performance tradeoffs such as caching gain and memory size/cache content size computing and communication delays can be investigated 017 Joint optimization of system resources  Suitable joint

con\035icting objectives in designing a wireless IoT network E AUTONOMOUS DEVICE COLLABORATIONS IN WIRELESS IoT NETWORKS Device to Device 050D2D\051 communication has got importance in various practical scenarios and plays an important role in the proposed edge-cloud coordinated framework in Fig 3 The increasing context-aware applications require location awareness and discovery functionalities and need to communicate with other neighboring nodes Also D2D plays an important role in enabling the sharing of resources such as contents applications processing power and spectrum among spatially-closed resource-constrained nodes in order to enhance the overall system performance In addition D2D communication is of vital importance to form emergency communication network in disaster scenarios such as earthquake or hurricane In such disaster scenarios D2D communications has to take care of various aspects such as unpredictability limited resources in disaster areas and dynamically varying environment In wireless IoT networks involving different types of things/objects such as home appliances body area sensors smart-phones and environmental monitoring sensors a series of communication is required to realize the process of creating collecting and sharing information among nearby devices Due to their heterogeneous capabilities de vices can help each other with the help of suitable collaborative strategies among them 050for example in a smart home home audio lighting bulbs and alarming systems can collaborate to indicate the emergency level\051 Similar to human social network in connecting users via Internet one device can be connected with other devices based on its social relationships with them thus leading to the concept of social IoT By exploring the social relations of the devices device collaboration can be initiated without human intervention The heterogeneity and the diversity of the connected smart devices impose challenges in handling interoperability among IoT devices During the operation phase there arise several challenges such as how to maintain seamless connections among the devices how to attach a new device to the network how to rediscover a device in the network how to form a collaborative cluster and which device to disconnect in case of faulty conditions and security threats By grouping correlative devices under the same collaborative cluster ef\034cient management strategies can be employed at the IoT gateway in order to control them and also to enable device collaborations In this direction the key issues to be considered are to understand the social relations among the devices to classify de vices based on a suitable basis to track the location of the devices/inhabitants and to design effective device collaborative strategies based on the inferred information with the aim of enhancing the zerocon\034guration index of device interaction In the following we highlight some of the interesting research topics and issues under this theme 017 De\034nition of social relationships  Several aspects such as how to assign social relations among IoT devices and what kind of device social relations can be extracted from human social relations are important to investigated under the considered joint edge-cloud collaborative platform 017 Device attachment and discovery schemes  It is essential to develop suitable policies to admit a new device to the existing IoT network and the ways to discover a device in the shortest possible path to minimize the latency as well as energy consumption 017 Techniques for device classi\034cation and collaborative cluster formation  Various research questions such as what is the best classi\034cation basis how many devices should be grouped in a network how to support a large number of heterogeneous group/cluster of devices how to synchronize different clusters and how to choose a cluster head dynamically in time varying channel conditions need to be addressed in the proposed framework 017 Performance analysis  Balancing the tradeoff between local device interactions and maintaining stable global system state in the considered distributed system is one of the important aspects to be considered Besides suitable incentive-based device participation approaches can be investigated to enhance the participation of IoT devices in sharing their communication computing and storage resources VOLUME 5 2017 4631 


S K Sharma X Wang Live Data Analytics With Collaborative Edge and Cloud Processing in Wireless IoT Networks  F DATA-DRIVEN EVENT MONITORING AND EVENT-DRIVEN SERVICE PROVISIONING IN WIRELESS IoT NETWORKS In the considered cloud-edge collaborative framework various features of big data can be utilized in order to monitor the events which may be periodic or random in nature Based on the global view of the network and historical data cloud can implement suitable prediction techniques to forecast future events and to provide this information to the edge computing units in order to better utilize the network resources Moreover in order to support device interactions in IoT networks with the minimal human intervention energy ef\034ciency computational ef\034ciency and spectral ef\034ciency are important issues to be considered One of the promising approaches to tackle these issues is event triggering which enables communication/computing action to take place only when a particular event or a sequence of events happens With this approach resource utilization ef\034ciency can be signi\034cantly improved since communication circuits can be put into the sleep mode and the computing burden is reduced during the non-occurrence of events The 034rst step in data-driven event monitoring is to de\034ne a suitable behavior model which captures the normal behavior of the considered IoT system After a behavior model is identi\034ed a suitable even detection technique can be employed The even detection techniques can be broadly categorized into sample-based and stream-based The 034rst cate gory of techniques is based on individual samples to detect events while the second category relies on the 035ow of data samples Besides the service provisioning of IoT is signi\034cantly different than from the traditional services which are mainly targeted for human-machine interactions and the difference mainly lies in the fact that IoT services need to deal with the seamless interactions with the real-world The heterogeneous IoT environment requires distributed processing of the large-scale sensing information collected by the IoT nodes which need to combined and shared among different entities In this regard it is important to dynamically adapt the services based on the instantaneous changes in the physical environment We highlight some of the interesting research problems and directions under this research topic below 017 Behavior modeling techniques  Several aspects such as de\034nition of suitable reference models methods to cope up with unpredictable system characteristics exploitation of differential states in the system state and advanced learning methods can be studied under the proposed framework 017 Event detection techniques  Suitable sample and stream-based mechanisms and statistical approaches such as eigenvalue distributions and PCA can be investigated for the considered framework 017 Event handling methods  In order to handle events in the proposed framework various clustering techniques event classi\034ers data-driven methods such as regression expectation maximization and linear support vector machines inference methods such as fuzzy logic and heuristic reasoning and data fusion techniques can be investigated 017 On-demand information sharing  Several aspects such as resource sharing models interactions with application layer parameters on-demand information dissemination models environmental awareness and information fusion techniques require further research 017 Adaptation and validation of event triggering  In practice the events can be spontaneous and may have recurrent patterns and are of dynamic nature How to adapt the operation of the network based on various states of the event such as early sign and intermediate state is another key issue to be considered After acquiring information about the event how to validate the credibility of that information is another important challenge G SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORKING AND VIRTUALIZATION IN WIRELESS IoT NETWORKS In the existing networks the main problems are vendorspeci\034c interfaces and software associated with hardware complex and expensive network operation and the tight coupling of data and control planes Besides the netw ork cannot dynamically adapt based on the network conditions To address the aforementioned issues the emerging concept of SDN 43 can be emplo yed Besides virtualization technology can be used to form a virtual network on the top of the existing networks which shields the user from the underlying hardware and becomes adaptable to diverse technologies and protocols However in contrast to the traditional virtualized wired networks radio resource abstraction and isolation in wireless networks is challenging due to time-varying channel broadcast nature mobility and heterogeneous access technologies In heterogeneous IoT en vironment dynamic resource discovery and the sharing of available resources can enable the creation of effective virtual networks However one of the critical challenges is the ef\034cient management of the physical resources allocated to virtual networks How often resource discovery and allocation need to be performed is also another challenge to be addressed Besides mapping of the physical resources to the logical resources in order to embed a virtual network on the existing physical networks in an effective way is another key aspect to be investigated The creation of a virtual network requires effective interactions among the involved entities at different hierarchical levels of the wireless IoT network This requires the need of de\034ning suitable interfaces as well as proper control signalling which can be adaptable among heterogeneous wireless access technologies For control signalling mechanisms such as IP-based signalling and dedicated channel assignment can be investigated considering both network overload and delay Besides naming the devices with logical identi\034ers mapping between physical and logical addresses slicing device attachment and dynamic routing of the device 4632 VOLUME 5 2017 


S K Sharma X Wang Live Data Analytics With Collaborative Edge and Cloud Processing in Wireless IoT Networks  traf\034c are other important operations to be considered  Furthermore another k e y research aspect is to e xamine the possibility of employing various levels of slicing such as spectrum-level slicing network-level slicing and 035ow-level slicing in the wireless IoT networks In addition investigating suitable admission control policies in order to control the admission of incoming users/devices while guaranteeing the QoS of the existing users/devices is another aspect to be considered Based on the above discussion some research directions under this topic are provided below 017 Formation of virtualized edge-cloud collaborative network  The design of a uni\034ed logical network in the proposed framework include various aspects such as network topology and interfaces de\034nition networks/devices discovery/routing mapping between physical and logical resources naming assignment of unique logical identi\034ers to the devices and device attachment strategies/admission control policies for future devices/nodes/users 017 Wireless virtualization technologies  It is an interesting future research direction to investigate suitable radio resource abstraction isolation and slicing techniques under various practical constraints such as time-varying channel mobility and heterogeneous access technologies in the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework 017 Adaptive con\034guration of system parameters  Some important research challenges in the proposed framework are to dynamically con\034gure a large number of system parameters such as carrier frequency bandwidth computing power cache size and transmission power to estimate the time-varying wireless channels i.e loads and to dynamically characterize the communication links in terms of stability delay rate loss and collision It is interesting to investigate the application of SDN to overcome these challenges 017 Control signalling design  Another key challenge is how to design control signalling under the constraints of delay and communication bandwidth overhead Several questions such as whether it is better to provide a dedicated radio channel or to employ a shared channel for control signalling how to support the scalability of the devices how to make signalling reliable in the case of device mobility and device failure during D2D communication need to be investigated in future works H SECURITY/PRIVACY ENHANCEMENT IN WIRELESS IoT NETWORKS Another main challenge is how to provide secured connections to the massive number of heterogeneous IoT devices having different levels of processing capabilities During the processing of big data generated from massive IoT environment the security threat may arise in any of the data processing phases including data acquisition information 034ltering data integration representation modeling processing and interpretation In our proposed framework the cloud centre can guide the processing of edge nodes by utilizing the available history information as well as the network-wide intelligence towards achieving secured 035ow of information in the aforementioned phases The existing modular design practices for wireless communications are leading to vulnerable wireless IoT networks due to the transparent air interface and weak security protection mechanisms Also the decentralized characteristics of wireless IoT networks long sleeping windows of IoT sensors and the needs for collaborative communications to support D2D communications over heterogeneous networks pose signi\034cant challenges to the traditional wireless security provisioning techniques For example in IoT-based healthcare environment the delegation of both storage and computation to the untrusted party can bring serious security and privacy issues and it is crucial to maintain the security and privacy of the every patient's data Since the cloud centre has a global view of the network as well as the history information this knowledge can be exploited in taking decision on which nodes are unreliable and need to be disconnected from the network In the IoT environment involving heterogeneous sensors having different levels of processing capabilities and also different mobility levels existing cloud computing security mechanisms like sophisticated access control and encryption methods may not be suf\034cient to prevent illegitimate and unauthorized access to the data In this context there is a strong need to investigate suitable physical layer and cross-layer techniques such as dynamic link adaptation and adaptive medium access scheduling to enhance the data 035ow security in the proposed edge-cloud coordinated platform In contrast to the traditional scenarios there is a high probability of privacy loss in IoT enabled systems due to several factors such as location-based services increased interaction with smart devices and less awareness on the user side In this regard there is a strong need to investigate privacy preserving mechanisms in IoT-enabled wireless networks Moreover in the proposed cloud-edge collaborative platform the distributed edge units may be more vulnerable to attacks since they do not have a global view of the network and have less resources to protect themselves In this regard cloud can assist edge-side units in implementing security measures in practical scenarios with the help of its global intelligence in identifying attacks/threats Furthermore in the proposed platform edge computing units can act as controllers and aggregators for privacy sensitive data before sending data to the cloud and they may also act as the proxies of resourceconstrained IoT devices in order to handle their security functions Based on the above discussion the following speci\034c research directions can be considered under this theme 017 Security enhancement with joint edge-cloud processing  Several research questions such as how to perform cloud-side computations on the encrypted IoT data without revealing any privacy/secrets to the cloud service VOLUME 5 2017 4633

transit to the cloud centre and how to of\035oad tasks/programs from the edge to cloud in a secured manner need to be addressed 017 Access control and cooperative data aggregation schemes  In the proposed platform suitable cloudassisted encryption techniques energy-ef\034cient data scrambling techniques and cooperative data aggregation schemes can be investigated under the constraints of latency and communication bandwidth In the cooperative schemes various aspects such as how the nodes negotiate for a shared key and what are different ways in which cloud can assist nodes in devising these cooperative policies under the constraints of communication bandwidth and computational rate need to be investigated 017 Privacy preservation techniques  In the proposed cloud-assisted platform it is important to investigate suitable privacy preserving data clustering differential privacy mechanisms and Pseudonymizing techniques in order to preserve the privacy of the end-users 017 Trustworthiness of IoT systems  Various aspects such as how to measure the trustworthiness of an IoT sensor/aggregator node how to identify that the source of the data is a desired sensor device but not a robot or a malicious device need to be investigated under the proposed framework VI CONCLUSIONS Cloud computing and edge computing are considered as two emerging paradigms in handling the massive amount of distributed data generated by IoT devices However these paradigms have their own advantages and disadvantages Cloud computing provides a centralized pool of storage and computing resources and has a global view of the network but it is not suitable for applications demanding low latency realtime operation and high QoS On the other hand edge computing is suitable for the applications which need real-time treatment mobility support and location/context awareness but does not usually have suf\034cient computing and storage resources Taking these aspects into consideration this paper has proposed a novel framework of collaborative edge-cloud processing for enabling live data analytics in wireless IoT networks The basic features key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics in wireless IoT networks have been described and the main distinctions between cloud and edge processing have been presented Furthermore potential key enablers for the proposed collaborative edge-cloud computing framework have been identi\034ed and the associated key challenges have been presented in order to foster future research activities in this domain Finally it is worthy to mention that the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework can be exploited as an important platform for wireless networks to achieve various objectives such as dynamic spectrum management energy-ef\034cient caching and of\035oading closed-loop latency minimization adaptive optimization of computing communication and caching resources even-driven resource allocation and
