Big Universe, Big Data: Machine Learning and Image Analysis for Astronomy 
requires big data know-how, in particular, highly ef\037cient machine learning and image analysis algorithms But scalability is not the only challenge astronomy applications touch several current machine learning research questions 
will provide far greater data volumes. Another promising future survey is the Large Synop tic Survey Telescope \(LSST\, which will de liver wide-\037eld images of the sky, exposing 
galaxies that are too faint to be seen today A main objective of the LSST is to discover 
transients 
objects that change brightness over timescales of seconds to months. These changes are due to a plethora of reasons some of which might be regarded as unin teresting while others will be extremely rare events that can\222t be missed. The LSST is ex pected to see millions of transients per night that need to be detected in real time to allow 
for follow-up observations. With a stagger ing 30 Tbytes of images being produced per night, ef\037cient and accurate detection will be a major challenge. Figure 1 shows how data rates have increased and will continue to in crease as new surveys are initiated What do the data look like? Surveys usu ally make either 
spectroscopic 
 observations \(Figure 2\. Spectroscopy mea sures the photon count at thousands of wave 
photometric 
or 
lengths, and the resulting spectrum allows for identifying chemical components of the ob served object and thus enables determining many interesting properties. Photometry takes images using a charge-coupled de vice \(CCD\, typically acquired through only a handful of broadband \037lters, making photom etry much less informative than spectroscopy Although spectroscopy provides measure ments of high precision, it has two drawbacks: it

 BIG DATA 
ne of the largest astronomical surveys to date is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey SDSS; www.sdss.org\. E ach night, the SDSS telescope produces 200 Gbytes of data, and to this day close to a million \037eld images have been acquired, in which more than 200 million galaxies, and even more stars, have been detected Upcoming surveys

For each band, the galaxy\222s brightness is captured in an image M ARCH/APR IL 2017  17 isn\222t as sensitive as photometry meaning that distant or otherwise faint objects can\222t be measured, and only a few objects can be captured at the same time, making it more expensive than photometry, which allows for acquir ing images of thousands of objects in a single image. Photometry can capture objects that might be 10 times fainter than what can be measured with spec troscopy. A faint galaxy is often more distant than a bright one\227not just in space but also in time. Discovering faint objects therefore offers the potential of looking further back into the history of the universe, over timescales of billions of years. Thus, photometric observations are invaluable to cosmologists, as they help in understanding the early universe Once raw observations have been acquired, a pipeline of algorithms needs to extract information from them. Much of image-based astron omy currently relies to some extent on visual inspection. A wide range of measurements are still carried out by humans but need to be addressed by automatic image analysis in light of growing data volumes\227examples include 3D orientation and chiral ity of galaxies, and the detection of large-scale features, such as jets and streams. Challenges in these tasks include image artifacts, spurious ef fects, and discerning between merg ing galaxy pairs and galaxies that happen to overlap along the line of sight. Current survey pipelines of ten have trouble correctly identifying these types of problems, which then propagate into the databases A particular challenge is that cos mology relies on scienti\037c analyses of long-exposure images. As such, the in terest in image analysis techniques for preprocessing and de-noising is natu rally great. This is particularly impor tant for the detection of faint objects with very low signal-to-noise ratios Automatic object detection is vital to any survey pipeline, with reliabil ity and completeness being essential metrics. Completeness refers to the amount of detected objects, whereas reliability measures how many of the detections are actual objects. Max imizing these metrics requires ad vanced image analysis and machine learning techniques.

to date. These extremely bright objects form at the center of large galaxies and are very rare. Bayesian comparison has helped scientists select a few most likely objects for re-observation from thousands of candidates In astronomy, distances from Earth to galaxies are measured by their redshifts, but accurate estimations require expensive spectroscopy. Get ting accurate redshifts from photom etry alone is an essential but unsolved task for which machine learning methods are widely applied 2 How ever, they\222re far from being on a par with spectroscopy Another application is the measure ment of galaxy morphologies. Usu ally, we assign a galaxy a class based on its appearance \(Figure 3\, tradi tionally via visual inspection. Lately this has been accelerated by the cit izen science project Galaxy Zoo 3  which aims to involve the public in classifying galaxies. Volunteers have contributed more than 100 million classi\037cations, which allow astro physicists to look for links between galaxies\222 appearances \(morphology and internal and external proper ties. Several discoveries have been made through the use of data from Galaxy Zoo, and the classi\037cations have provided numerous hints to the correlations between various pro cesses governing galaxy evolution. A galaxy\222s morphology is dif\037cult to quantize in a concise manner, and automated methods are high on the wish list of astrophysicists. There ex ists some work on reproducing the classi\037cations using machine learn ing alone 4 but better systems will be necessary when dealing with the data products of next-generation telescopes A growing sub\037eld in astrophysics is the search for planets outside our solar system \(exoplanets\. NASA\222s Kepler spacecraft has been searching for exoplanets since 2009, observing light curves of stars\227that is, measur ing a star\222s brightness at regular in tervals; the task is then to look for changes in the brightness, indicating that a planet might have moved in front of it. If this happens with reg ular duration and decrease in bright ness, the source is likely to be an exoplanet. While automated software can detect such changes in bright ness, the citizen science project Planet Hunters has shown that the software does miss some exoplanets. Also, de tecting Earth-sized planets, arguably the most interesting, is notoriously dif\037cult, as the decrease in bright ness can be close to the noise level For next-generation space telescopes such as the Transiting Exoplanet Sur vey Satellite \(TESS\, scheduled to launch in 2017, algorithms for de tecting exoplanets need to be signi\037 cantly improved to more reliably detect Earth-sized exoplanet candi dates for follow-up observations There are also problems that could directly affect our lives here on Earth, such as solar eruptions that if headed toward Earth, can be dan gerous to astronauts, damage satel lites, affect airplanes, and, if strong enough, cause severe damage to elec trical grids. Several spacecraft moni tor the sun in real time to watch for these \036ares, and while the ultimate goal is a better understanding of the sun, the main reason is to be able to quickly detect and respond to solar eruptions. The continuous monitor ing is done by automated software but not all events are detected 5 Solar eruptions are known to be associated with sunspots, but the connection isn\222t understood well enough that sci entists can predict the onset or mag nitude of an eruption. There could be a correlation with the complexity of the sunspots, and understanding this, as well as how the complex ity develops over time, is crucial for future warning systems. While sci entists are working toward a solu tion, for example, through the citizen science project Sunspotter \(https www.sunspotter.org\, no automated method has yet been able to reli ably and quantitatively measure the complexity This glimpse of success stories and open problems is by no means ex haustive; a much fuller overview of machine learning in astronomy ap pears elsewhere 6 IEEE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS 18  www.computer.org/intelligent  a b Figure 3.

Lx xp M ARCH/APR IL 2017  is the scale space representation of the image I d K K S Three examples from our own work show how astronomical data analysis can trigger methodological advance ments in machine learning and image analysis In supervised machine learning, mod els are constructed based on labeled examples\227that is, observations \(im ages, photometric features\ogether with their outputs \(also referred to as labels, such as the corresponding red shift or galaxy type\. Most machine learning algorithms are built on the assumption that training and future test data will follow the same distri bution, which allows for generaliza tion, enabling the model built from labeled examples in the training set to accurately predict target variables in an unlabeled test set. In real-life ap plications, this assumption is often violated in what we refer to as sample selection bias. Certain examples are more likely to be labeled than oth ers due to factors such as availability or acquisition cost regardless of their  representation in the population Sample selection bias can be very pro nounced in astronomical data 9 and machine learning methods have to address this bias to achieve good gen eralization. Often, we only initially have training datasets from old sur veys, while upcoming missions will probe never-before-seen regions in the astrophysical parameter space To correct the sample selection bias, we can resort to a technique called The idea is to give more weight to exam ples in the training sample that lie in regions of the feature space underrep resented in the test sample and, like wise, give less weights to examples whose location in the feature space is overrepresented in the test set. If these weights are estimated correctly the model we learn from the training data is an unbiased estimate of the model we would learn from a sample that follows the population\222s distribu tion. The challenge lies in estimating these weights reliably and ef\037ciently Given a suf\037ciently large sample, a simple strategy can be followed: using a nearest neighbor-based approach we can count the number of test ex amples that fall within a hypersphere whose radius is de\037ned by the dis tance to the  210\210 2 tr ai n tr ai n 210 is a Gaussian \037lter, and  is the scale.

If input space di mensionality is moderate \(say, below 30\, runtime can often be reduced by several orders of magnitude While approximate schemes are valuable alternatives, we\222re usually in terested in an exact nearest-neighbor  search for astronomical data. In this context, massively parallel devices such as GPUs, show great prom ise. Unfortunately, nearest-neighbor search based on spatial data struc tures can\222t be parallelized in an ob vious way for these devices. To this end, we developed a new tree struc ture that\222s more amenable to mas sively parallel traversals via GPUs Figure 5 12,13 The framework can achieve a signi\037cant runtime reduc tion at a much lower cost compared to traditional parallel architectures code available at http://bufferkdtree readthedocs.io\.

There are two differ ent approaches to predictive model ing in astronomy: physical modeling and data-driven modeling. Building physical models, which can incorpo rate all necessary astrophysical back ground knowledge, is the traditional approach. These models can be used for prediction, for example, by run ning Monte Carlo simulations. Ide ally, this approach ensures that the predictions are physically plausible In contrast, extrapolations by purely training and test examples.

Most astronomical surveys make their entire data collection, including derived parameters, available online in the form of large databases, pro viding easy entry points for computer scientists wanting to get engaged in astronomical research The Galaxy Zoo website \(https www.galaxyzoo.org\rovides data with classi\037cations of approximately 1 million galaxies. It\222s an excellent resource for developing and testing image analysis and computer vision algorithms for automatic classi\037ca tions of galaxies Much of the Kepler data for exo planet discovery is publicly available through the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes \(http://archive.stsci edu/kepler\. These include light curves for con\037rmed exoplanets and false positives, making it a valuable dataset for testing detection algorithms Having been monitored continuously for years, there\222s an incredible amount of imaging data for the sun, from ar chival data to near real-time images One place to \037nd such information is the Debrecen Sunspot Data archive http://fenyi.solarobs.unideb.hu/ESA HMIDD.html\. These images allow for the development and testing of new complexity measures for image data or solar eruption warning systems 21 Getting Started on Astronomy and Big Data W M ARCH/APR IL 2017  near est-neighbors model can reduce the RMSE by 22 percent when estimat ing star formation rates 14,15 Thus we strongly advocate data-driven models when accurate predictions are the main objective. And this is in deed often the case if, for example we want to estimate properties of ob jects in the sky to quickly identifying observations worth a follow-up in vestigation or to conduct large-scale statistical analyses Generic machine learning meth ods aren\222t meant to replace physical modeling because they typically don\222t provide scienti\037c insights beyond the predicted values. Still, we argue that if prediction accuracy is what matters we should favor the more accurate model, whether it\222s interpretable or not. While the black-and-white por trayal of the two approaches might help illustrate common misunder standings between data scientists and physicists, it is of course shortsighted Physical and machine learning model ing aren\222t mutually exclusive: physical models can inform machine learning algorithms, and machine learning can support physical modeling. A simple example of the latter is using machine learning to estimate error residuals in a physical model 7 Dealing with uncertainties is a ma jor issue in astronomical data analysis Data scientists are asked to provide error bars for their predictions and to think about how to deal with in put noise. In astronomy, both input and output data have \(non-Gaussian errors attached to them. Often, these measurement errors have been quanti 037ed \(such as by incorporating weather conditions during observation\ and it\222s desirable to consider these errors in the prediction. Bayesian modeling and Monte Carlo methods simulat ing physical models offer solutions but they don\222t often scale for big data Alternatively, we can modify machine  learning methods to process error bars as attempted for nearest-neighbor  regression by modifying the distance function 11 www.computer.org/intelligent  k data-driven machine learning models could violate physical laws. Another decisive feature of physical models is that they allow for understanding and explaining observations. This in terpretability of predictions typically isn\222t provided when using a machine learning approach Physical models have the draw backs that they\222re dif\037cult to con struct and that inference can take a long time \(such as in the case of Monte Carlo simulations\. Most im portantly, the quality of the predic tions depends on the quality of the physical model, which is typically limited by necessary simpli\037cations and incomplete scienti\037c knowledge In our experience, data-driven mod els typically outperform physical models in terms of prediction accu racy. For example, a simple ithin the next few years, im age analysis and machine learning systems that can process terabytes of data in near real time with high accuracy will be essential There are great opportunities for making novel discoveries, even in da tabases that have been available for de cades. The volunteers of Galaxy Zoo have demonstrated this multiple times by discovering structures in SDSS im ages that have later been con\037rmed to be new types of objects. These volun teers aren\222t trained scientists, yet they make new scienti\037c discoveries Even today, only a fraction of the images of SDSS have been inspected by humans. Without doubt, the data still hold many surprises, and upcom ing surveys, such as LSST, are bound to image previously unknown objects It won\222t be possible to manually in spect all images produced by these surveys, making advanced image anal ysis and machine learning algorithms of vital importance. Researchers could use these systems to answer questions such as how many types of galaxies there are, what distinguishes the dif ferent classes, whether the current classi\037cation scheme is good enough  and whether there are important sub classes or undiscovered classes. These questions require data science knowl edge\035rather than astrophysical knowledge
