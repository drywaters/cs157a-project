seamlessly within a smart environment and enables information sharing across platforms in a convenient manner The recent adaptation of different wireless technologies places IoT as the next revolutionary technology by bene\034ting from the full opportunities offered by the Internet technology IoT has witnessed its recent adoption in smart cities with interest in developing intelligent systems such as smart of\034ce smart retail smart agriculture smart water smart transportation smart healthcare and smart energy 13 IoT has emerged as a new trend in the last few years where mobile devices transportation facilities public facilities and home appliances can all be used as data acquisition equipment in IoT All surrounding electronic equipment to facilitate daily life operations such as wristwatches vending machines emergency alarms and garage doors as well as home appliances such as refrigerators microwave ovens air conditioners and water heaters are connected to an IoT network and can be controlled remotely Ciufo stated that these de vices  talk  to one another and to central controlling devices Such devices deployed in different areas may collect various kinds of data such as geographical astronomical environmental and logistical data A large number of communication devices in the IoT paradigm are embedded into sensor devices in the real world Data collecting devices sense data and transmit these data using embedded communication devices The continuum of devices and objects are interconnected through a variety of communication solutions such as Bluetooth WiFi ZigBee and GSM These communication devices transmit data and receive commands from remotely controlled devices which allow direct integration with the physical world through computer-based systems to improve living standards Over 50 billion devices ranging from smartphones laptops sensors and game consoles are anticipated to be connected to the Internet through several heterogeneous access networks enabled by technologies such as radio frequency identi\034cation 050RFID\051 and wireless sensor networks Reference mentioned that IoT could be recognized in three paradigms Internet-oriented sensors and knowledge The recent adaptation of different wireless technologies places IoT as the next revolutionary technology by bene\034ting from the full opportunities offered by Internet technology B BIG DATA The volume of data generated by sensors devices social media health care applications temperature sensors and various other software applications and digital devices that continuously generate large amounts of structured unstructured or semi-structured data is strongly increasing This massive data generation results in big data Traditional database systems are inef\034cient when storing processing and analyzing rapidly growing amount of data or big data The term  big data  has been used in the previous literature but is relatively new in business and IT An example of big data-related studies is the next frontier for innovation competition and productivity McKinsey Global Institute de\034ned big data as the size of data sets that are a better database system tool than the usual tools for capturing storing processing and analyzing such data  The Digital Universe study labels big data technologies as a new generation of technologies and architectures that aim to take out the value from a massive volume of data with various formats by enabling high-velocity capture discovery and analysis This previous study also characterizes big data into three

M Marjani et al  Big IoT Data Analytics Architecture Opportunities and Open Research Challenges  This de\034nition uses the 3V's 050volume variety velocity\051 model proposed by Beyer The model highlights an e-commerce trend in data management that faces challenges to manage volume or size of data variety or different sources of data and velocity or speed of data creation Some studies declare volume as a main characteristic of big data without providing a pure de\034nition Ho we v er  other researchers introduced additional characteristics for big data such as veracity value variability and complexity 24 The 3V's model or its derivations is the most common descriptions of the term big data III BIG DATA ANALYTICS Big data analytics involves the processes of searching a database mining and analyzing data dedicated to improve company performance Big data analytics is the process of examining large data sets that contain a variety of data types to re v eal unseen patterns hidden correlations market trends customer preferences and other useful business information The capability to analyze large amounts of data can help an organization deal with considerable information that can affect the business Therefore the main objecti v e of big data analytics is to assist business associations to have improved understanding of data and thus make ef\034cient and wellinformed decisions Big data analytics enables data miners and scientists to analyze a large volume of data that may not be harnessed using traditional tools Big data analytics require technologies and tools that can transform a large amount of structured unstructured and semi-structured data into a more understandable data and metadata format for analytical processes The algorithms used in these analytical tools must discover patterns trends and correlations over a variety of time horizons in the data After analyzing the data these tools visualize the 034ndings in tables graphs and spatial charts for ef\034cient decision making Thus big data analysis is a serious challenge for many applications because of data complexity and the scalability of underlying algorithms that support such processes Talia 0502013\051 highlighted that obtaining helpful information from big data analysis is a critical matter that requires scalable analytical algorithms and techniques to return well-timed results whereas current techniques and algorithms are inef\034cient to handle big data analytics Therefore large infrastructure and additional applications are necessary to support data parallelism Moreover data sources such as high-speed data stream received from different data sources have different formats which makes integrating multiple sources for analytics solutions critical Hence the challenge is focused on the performance of current algorithms used in big data analysis which is not rising linearly with the rapid increase in computational resources Big data analytics processes consume considerable time to provide feedback and guidelines to users whereas only a few tools can process huge data sets within reasonable amount of processing time By contrast most of the remaining tools use the complicated trial-and-error method to deal with massive amounts of data sets and data heterogeneity Big data analytics systems e xist F or example the Exploratory Data Analysis Environment is a big data visual analytics system that is used to analyze complex earth system simulations with large numbers of data sets A EXISTING ANALYTICS SYSTEMS Different analytic types are used according to the requirements of IoT applications These analytic types are discussed in this subsection under real-time off-line memory-level business intelligence 050BI\051 level and massive level analytics categories Moreover a comparison based on analytics types and their levels is presented in Table 1 Real-time analytics is typically performed on data collected from sensors In this situation data change constantly and rapid data analytics techniques are required to obtain an analytical result within a short period Consequently two existing architectures have been proposed for real-time analysis parallel processing clusters using traditional relational databases and memory-based computing platforms Greenplum and Hana 35 are e xamples of real-time analytics architecture Off-line analytics is used when a quick response is not required F or e xample man y Internet enterprises use Hadoop-based off-line analytics architecture to reduce the cost of data format conversion Such analytics impro v es data acquisition ef\034ciency SCRIBE Kafka 38 T imeTunnel and Chukw a 40 are e xamples of architectures that conduct off-line analytics and can satisfy the demands of data acquisition Memory-level analytics is applied when the size of data is smaller than the memory of a cluster T o date the memory of clusters has reached terabyte 050TB\051 level Therefore several internal database technologies are required to improve analytical ef\034ciency Memory-level analytics is suitable for conducting real-time analysis MongoDB is an example of this architecture BI analytics is adopted when the size of data is larger than the memory level but in this case data may be imported to the BI analysis environment BI analytic currently supports TB-level data Moreo v er  BI can help disco v er strategic business opportunities from the 035ood of data In addition BI analytics allows easy interpretation of data volumes Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy provide competitive market advantage and long-term stability Massive analytics is applied when the size of data is greater than the entire capacity of the BI analysis product and traditional databases Massi v e analytics uses the Hadoop distributed 034le system for data storage and map/reduce for data analysis Massive analytics helps create the business foundation and increases market competitiveness by extracting meaningful values from data Moreover massive analytics VOLUME 5 2017 5249

large amount of data received from sensors are stored in the cloud and accessed through big data analytics applications These applications contain API management and a dashboard to help in the interaction with the processing engine A novel meta-model-based approach for integrating IoT architecture objects is proposed The concept is semiautomatically federated into a holistic digital enterprise architecture environment The main objective is to provide an adequate decision support for complex business architecture management with the development of assessment systems and IT

Traditional transportation systems which are based on image processing are affected by weather conditions such as heavy rains and thick fog Consequently the captured image may not be clearly visible The design of an e-plate system using RFID technology provides a good solution for intelligent monitoring tracking and identi\034cation of vehicles Moreover introducing IoT into vehicular technologies

M Marjani et al  Big IoT Data Analytics Architecture Opportunities and Open Research Challenges  decisions have to be made with regard to ethical factors such as what to use how to use and why use generated big IoT data Another security risk associated with IoT data is the heterogeneity of the types of devices used and the nature of generated data such as raw devices data types and communication protocols These devices can have different sizes and shapes outside the network and are designed to communicate with cooperative applications Thus to authenticate these devices an IoT system should assign a non-repudiable identi\034cation system to each device Moreover enterprises should maintain a meta-repository of these connected devices for auditing purposes This heterogeneous IoT architecture is new to security professionals and thus results in increased security risks Consequently any attack in this scenario compromises system security and disconnects interconnected devices In the context of big IoT data security and privacy are the key challenges in processing and storing huge amounts of data Moreover to perform critical operations and host private data these systems highly rely on third party services and infrastructure Therefore an exponential growth in data rate causes dif\034culty in securing each and every portion of critical data As previously discussed existing security solutions 050Karim 2016 86\051 are no long applicable to providing complete security in big IoT data scenarios Existing algorithms are not designed for the dynamic observation of data and thus are not effectively applied Legacy data security solutions are speci\034cally designed for static data sets whereas current data requirements are changing dynamically 050Lafuente 2015\051 Thus deploying these security solutions is dif\034cult for dynamically increasing data In addition legislative and regulatory issues should be considered while signing SLAs With regard to data generated through IoT the following security problems can emerge 050a\051 timely updates dif\034culty in keeping systems up to date 050b\051 incident management identifying suspicious traf\034c patterns among legitimate ones and possible failure to capture unidenti\034able incidents 050c\051 interoperability proprietary and vendorspeci\034c procedures will pose dif\034culties in 034nding hidden or zero day attacks 050d\051 and protocol convergence although IPv6 is currently compatible with the latest speci\034cations this protocol has yet to be fully deployed Therefore the application of security rules over IPv4 may not be applicable to protecting IPv6 At present no answer can address these challenges and manage the security and privacy of interconnected devices However the following guidelines can overcome these adversities 050a\051 First a true open ecosystem with standard APIs is necessary to avoid interoperability and reliability problems 050b\051 Second devices must be well protected while communicating with peers 050c\051 Third devices should be hardcoded with the best security practices to protect against common security and privacy threats B DATA MINING Data mining methods provide ef\034cient and best-\034tting predictive or descriptive solutions for big data that can also be generalized for new data The e v olution of big IoT data and cloud computing platforms has brought the challenges of data exploration and information extraction Ho we v er  for the overall big IoT data architecture Figure 5 presents the primary challenges related to processing and data mining Exhaustive data reads/writes The high-volume highvelocity and high-variety qualities of big IoT data challenge exploration integration heterogeneous communication and extraction processes The size and heterogeneity of data impose new data mining requirements and diversity in data sources also poses a challenge  Furthermore compared with small data sets large data sets comprise more abnormalities and ambiguities that require additional preprocessing steps such as cleansing reduction and transmission 83 Another issue lies in the e xtraction of e xact and knowledgeable information from the large volumes of diverse data Consequently obtaining accurate information from complex data requires analyzing data properties and 034nding association among different data points Researchers have introduced parallel and sequential programming models and proposed different algorithms to minimize query response time while dealing with big data FIGURE 5 Big data mining issues in IoT VOLUME 5 2017 5257 


M Marjani et al  Big IoT Data Analytics Architecture Opportunities and Open Research Challenges  Moreover researchers have selected existing data mining algorithms in different manners to 050a\051 improve single source knowledge discovery 050b\051 implement data mining methods for multi-source platforms and 050c\051 study and analyze dynamic data mining methods and stream data Hence parallel k means algorithm and parallel association rule mining methods are introduced Ho we v er  the need to de vise algorithms remains to provide compatibility with the latest parallel architectures Moreover synchronization issues may occur in parallel computing while information is exchanged within different data mining methods This bottleneck of data mining methods has become an open issue in big IoT data analytics that should be addressed C VISUALIZATION Visualization is an important entity in big data analytics particularly when dealing with IoT systems where data are generated enormously Furthermore conducting data visualization is dif\034cult because of the large size and high dimension of big data This situation shows underlying trends and a complete picture of parsed data Therefore big data analytics and visualization should work seamlessly to obtain the best results from IoT applications in big data However visualization in the case of heterogeneous and diverse data 050unstructured structured and semi-structured\051 is a challenging task Designing visualization solution that is compatible with advanced big data indexing frameworks is a dif\034cult task Similarly response time is a desirable factor in big IoT data analytics Consequently cloud computing architectures supported with rich GUI facilities can be deployed to obtain better insights into big IoT data trends Different dimensionality reduction methods have been introduced as a result of complex and high-dimensional big IoT data 88 Ho we v er  these methods are unsuitable for all types of presented data Similarly when 034negrained dimensions are visualized effectively the probability to identify observable correlations patterns and outliners is high Moreo v er  data should be k ept locally to obtain usable information ef\034ciently because of power and bandwidth constraints In addition visualization software should run with the concept of reference locality to achieve ef\034cient outcome in an IoT environment Given that the amount of big IoT data is increasing rapidly the requirement of enormous parallelization is a challenging task in visualization Thus to decompose a problem into manageable independent tasks to enforce concurrent execution of queries is a challenge for parallel visualization algorithms At present most big data visualization tools used for IoT exhibit poor performance results in terms of functionality scalability and response time To provide effective uncertainty-aware visualization during the visual analytics process avoiding uncertainty imposes a considerable challenge Furthermore se v eral important issues are addressed such as 050a\051 visual noise most data set objects are closely related to one another and thus users may perceive different results of the same type 050b\051 information loss applying reduction methods to visible data sets can cause information loss 050c\051 large image observation data visualization tools have inherent problems with respect to aspect ratio devise resolution and physical perception limits 050d\051 frequently changing image users will not notice rapid data changes in an output and 050e\051 high performance requirements high performance requirements are imposed because data are generated dynamically in an IoT environment Moreover methods supported by advanced analytics enable interactive graphics on laptops desktops or mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets Real-time analytics is another consideration highlighted in IoT architectures Several guidelines on visualization in big data are presented such as 050a\051 data aw areness i.e appropriate domain expertise 050b\051 data quality cleaning data using information management or data governance policies 050c\051 meaningful results data clustering is used to provide high-level abstraction such that the visibility of smaller groups of data is possible and 050d\051 outliers should be removed from the data or treated as a separate entity Reference suggested that visualization should adhere to the following guidelines 050a\051 the system should provide special attention to metadata 050b\051 visualization software should be interactive and should require maximum user involvement and 050c\051 tools should be built based on the dynamic nature of the generated data D INTEGRATION Integration refers to having a uniform view of different formats Data integration provides a single view of the data arriving from different sources and combines the view of data Data inte gration includes all processes in v olv ed in collecting data from different sources as well as in storing and providing data with a uni\034ed view For each moment different forms of data are continuously generated by social media IoT and other communication and telecommunication approaches The produced data can be categorized into three groups 050a\051 structured data such as data stored in traditional database systems including tables with rows and columns 050b\051 semi-structured such as HTML XML and Json 034les and 050c\051 unstructured data such as videos audios and images Good data offer good information however this relationship is only achieved through data integration Inte grating diverse data types is a complex task in merging different systems or applications Ov erlapping the same data increasing performance and scalability and enabling realtime data access are among the challenges associated with data integration that should be addressed in the future Another challenge is to adjust structures in semi-structured and unstructured data before integrating and analyzing these types of data Information such as entities and relationships can be extracted from textual data by using available technologies in the eras of text mining machine learning natural processing and information extraction However new technologies should be developed to extract images videos and other information from other non-text 5258 VOLUME 5

extractors on the same text Hence managing and integrating different extraction results from a certain data source require other techniques VII CONCLUSION The growth rate of data production has increased drastically over the past years with the proliferation of smart and sensor devices The interaction between IoT and big data is currently at a stage where processing transforming and analyzing large amounts of data at a high frequency are necessary We conducted this survey in the context of big IoT data analytics First we explored recent analytics solutions The relationship
