Rough  Knowledge Mining Algorith m Based on Extension  Decision Rule Lattice for Electronic Patient Record Weiping Ding 1,2,3 Jiandong Wang 1  Zhijing Guan 2 Hao Zhu 1,2 Quan Shi 2 Abstract Electronic patient record mining deals with the implicit and useful medical information stored in the electronic patient record database.By this technology the useful knowledge is extracted and the scientific and auxiliary decision-making is proved for the diagnosis and treatment of disease. In this paper,a rough knowledge mining algorithm \(named RKMA\ based  on 
extension decision rule lattice  is presented. Firstly the electronic patient records are converted into different recordings in order to  be further reduced and classified in the medical database Secondly both variable rough thresholding and  concept lattice are relatethed.A novel extension decision rule lattice is constructed.This extension lattice can rough reduce the mutative knowledge attributions and well mine all disease diagnosis rules without more redundancy by avoiding finding frequent itemsets The experimental results show this RKMA algorithm well can mine consistent decision rules,and it is better robustness than other algorithms on the capability of attribution reduction and 
rule mining for electronic patient records Keywords: rough set; extension transformation; decision rule lattice; electronic patient record mining  I  I NTRODUCTION  Electronic patient records, as the important part of digit hospital, can not only transfer the traditional paper-based medical patient record into digital format, but also provide the function of the checking, analyzing, exchanging the information  and etc 1  With the rapid increase of patient record number in the database, how to extract the valuable information and knowledge has become one of the most 
interesting issues in the electronic patient record research field Hereby the research direction of electronic patient record mining is being taken. It mainly deals with medical information that is composed of the useful implicit pattern and knowledge stored in the electronic patient record database  And via some ways, useful knowledge can be extracted in order that scientific and auxiliary decision-making can be provided for the diagnosis and reatment of diseases Currently, there are three main techniques to extract rules in the electronic patient record database. The first one is to reduce the quantity of candidate frequent item sets and the scanning times of the database 3,4,5 
But it is ineffectual when dealing with large scale databases due to heavy I/O overhead The second one is to design a good distributed and parallel algorithm 6,7 The applying parallel processing to the electronic not merely a technical challenge.Instead, along with hardware and softwareís challenge, the massive data processing tasks known collectively as ìdata miningî have their impetus logical, business-oriented challenges. The third one is to sample the huge database to form a small sample set and extract information from it to obtain the approximate answers 8,9 But it can not renovate the mining objects in the medical database and its mining efficiency and quality are not perfect. We have proved that the above three techniques are quite unfit for the electronic patient record mining by lots of 
the experiments Rough set, concept lattice analysis and extension set theory,are three effective tools which are successfully applied in many knowledge discovering and data mining  fields   According to the features of the medical data in the database  a a rough knowledge mining algorithm \(named RKMA\ based on the extension decision rule lattice for electronic patient record is presented. The algorithm is adopted to convert the electronic patient record into the recording of database,then Extension decision rule lattice is constructed.It can rough reduce the mutative knowledge attributions in the database and well mine disease diagnosis rules of electronic patient record by avoiding finding frequent itemsets. Finally RKMA is 
applied in the experiment of  data sets from UCI machine learning.The results indicate that it is better robustness on the knowledge reduction and mining capability The organization of this paper as follows. Section 2 introduces some preliminary knowledge including rough set theory, concept lattice analysis and extension set theory, etc Section 3 presents the related definitions and theorems Section 4 describes rough knowledge mining algorithm\(named RKMA\ed on extension  decision rule lattice.Section 5 discusses the related capability of RKMA by experiment and applies it in the electronic patient record mining Section 6 draws some related conclusions and points out the directions of future work

A  Rough Set Theory \(RST RST, as a kind of soft computing techniques, was proposed by Z. Pawlak in 1982, and it has been successfully applied in rough classification and knowledge discovery 1  The basic concept of RST is the notion of the approximation space, which is an ordered pair  GUR  where U a non-empty set of objects, called universe, and R an equivalence elation on U   R UU 002  If s tU 002 and s Rt then s and t are indistinguishable For TU 002 be a subset U let  R t 003 denote the equivalence class of R 003 containing t \( t 001\031 U Its lower approximation  LA GT and upper approximation   UA GT in G are defined respectively as     LA R GT tUt T 003 002 004      UA R GT tUt T 003 002 005\006\007  A rough set in G is the family of all subsets of U having the same lower and upper approximations B  Concept Lattice Analysis \(CLA Concept lattice analysis, germinated by Birkhoff and considerably enriched by Wille, is a mathematical technique for clustering abstract entities known as formal objects that share common formal attributes into formal concepts organized in a concept lattice 16  For a set XO 004 of objects, we define   XeEoRe 003 002 for all  oE 002 the set of attributes common to the objects in X Correspondingly, for a set Y of attributes we define    YeEoRe 003 002 for all  oE 002 the set of objects which have all attributes in Y   The set of all formal concepts forms a complete lattice called concept lattice, denoted by     L OER or simply L. The meet and join of the lattice are characterized by     tt t t XY X Y tT tT tT 010 002 002\002 000\037\000         tt t t XY X Y tT tT tT 011 002 002\002 000*\000\037  where 002\011  is an index set, and for each tT 002    tt XY is a formal concept C  Extension Set Theory \(EST Extension set theory was proposed by Cai Wen, in 1983 which is a new kind of knowledge system for solving contradictory problem in the realistic world  based on matterelement and extension set   Extension knowledge 002 as an important part of extension set theory, is the knowledge being used to solve the incompatible problems. Its composing is as follows Extension knowledge = extended formula transformation implication formula association function The transformation implication formula in extension knowledge is a classical variable knowledge, and it is more valuable knowledge for solving a incompatible problem. So extension knowledge has the character of variable knowledge Data mining can acquire knowledge \(condition_result extension transforming the condition and conducting transforming the result can acquire variable knowledge extension knowledge condition result TT 012  It calls this variable knowledge as extension data mining. It is very fit for the electronic patient record mining   III  R ELATED DEFINITION AND THEOREM  In this section,We concentrate on what a formal definition of extension decision rule lattice mining algorithm \(RKMA\ of the electronic patient record is, as well as the above preliminary knowledge Definition 1   For object set 1 O the support of decision rule denoted as 1  count O i means the number of objects that have decision i  11    1 count O i x O d x i i r d 002  002  Definition 2  11  max 1  f count O j count O i i r d i 013\013 we define decision j is the support decision of 1 O denote with 1  s up_des O  Definition 3   In the data table, the dependency on the condition attribute C of the decision attribute D is defined as     osc CD P D U 014    osc P D is the amount of the elements of the positivedomain  osc P D  Core of imformation system S is the intersection of all reduct of S i.e   CORE S RED S 005 where  R ED S is the reduct of information system S  Definition 4   Suppose U is a universe of discourse u is a discretional element in U  k is a mapping from U to real number field I     Uku TTTT  is a given extension transformation Then           U ku E TuyyuTUykuI yTkTu I 003 002=\002 003 002 000\004  is called an extensible set in U  yku  is a dependent function of  E T 000\004   ku yTkTu 003  is an extension function of  E T 000\004 Among which U T is the transformation of U  k T is the transformation of the dependent function u T is the transformation of element u  Definition 5    We define the positive stable field of   E T 000\004 as       0    0 U ku ET uyyuTUyku yTkTu 003  002   003

We design an intelligently diagnosing system and RKMA algorithm programmed with VC++6.0 language is embedded in the system so as to extract medical knowledge and rules from electronic patient record database. The useful knowledge can be provided for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.Using the same way, we can draw some helpful conclusions  VI  D ISCUSSION AND F UTURE W ORK  The research of electronic patient record mining is one of the most interesting issues for data mining field. In this paper according to the features of the medical data in the patient record database, a rough knowledge mining algorithm \(named RKMA\ased on the extension decision rule lattice for electronic patient record is put forward. It can well mine all disease diagnosis rules without redundancy of electronic patient record by avoiding finding frequency itemsets. The mining experimental  results have indicated that RKMA algorithm can well extracte the consistent decision rules But because the medical data in the electronic patient record database has the especial features of variety, scarcity redundancy and timeliness, etc, the RKMA mining capability is finitary for extracting the useful medical rules and knowledge in  the electronic patient record database.We must design the more excellent algorithm to mine medical rules in order that the scientific and auxiliary decision-making is provided for the diagnosis and treatment of disease   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is partially supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China\(ì863îProgram\under grant No.2006AA706103 Natural Science Foundation of Jiang Su Education Department under grant No. 09KJD520008, Applying Study Foundation of NanTong under grant No.K2008031 and K2008018 Open  Project  Program  of  Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratory of Computer Information Processing Technology and 2009 Communication and Information System Innovation Foundation of Nantong University    R EFERENCES  1 R ouk em a  J  los R  K  B l eek er S  E  G i n n e k e n A  M  P ap er ver s u s c o m p u t er   feasibility of an electronic medical record in general pediatricsî, Pediatrics vol.117,no.1, pp.15-21. 2006 2  E l ec t r on ic  h e a l t h rec o rd overv i e w   i n Na ti ona l I n s t i t u t es of Hea l t h  National Center for research resources,Mitre Corporation,pp,26,2006 3 A g r aw al R I m iel i nski T  S w am i A   M in i n g asso ci at io n r u l e s be tw ee n se ts of items in large databasesî, Proc.of the 1993 ACMSIGMOD Conf. on Management of Data.

mum support decreases, and long rules are more likely to be excluded by the informative rule set than short rules There is little difference in size between an association rule set and a non-redundant rule set So in the following comparisons we only compare the informative rule set with the associa tion rule set Now we will compare generating efficiency of the in formative rule set and the association rule set We imple mented Apriori on the same data structure as the proposed algorithm and generated only single target association rules Our experiments were conducted on a Sun server with two 200 MHz UltraSPARC CPUs I iln Figure 3 Generating time for different rule sets The generating time for association rule sets and infor mative rule sets is listed in the Figure 3 We can see that mining an informative rule set is more efficient than mining a single target association rule set This is because the in formative rule miner does not generate all frequent itemsets and does not test all items as targets in a frequent itemset The improvement of efficiency becomes more evident when the minimum support decreases This is consistent with the deduction of rules being excluded from an association rule set as shown in Figure 2 I L I i 33 Figure 4 The number of times for scanning the database Further, the number of times of scanning a database for generating an informative rule set is smaller than that for an association rule set as showed in Figure 4 This is because the proposed algorithm avoids generating many long fre quent itemsets that contain no rules included in an informa tive rule set. From the results we also know that long rules are easier to be excluded by an informative rule set than short rules Clearly this number is significantly smaller than the number of different antecedents in the generated rule set which are needed to scan a database in aother direct algorithm To better understand of improvement of efficiency of the algorithm for mining the informative rule set over that for the association rule set we list the number of nodes in a candidate tree for both rule sets in Figure 5 They are all frequent itemsets for the association rule set and partial frequent itemsets searched by mining the informative rule set We can see that in mining the informative rule set, the searched itemsets is less than all frequent itemsets for form ing association rules So this is the reason for efficiency im provement and reduction in number of scanning a database 7 Conclusions We have defined a new informative, rule set that gener ates prediction sequences equal to those generated by the association rule set by the confidence priority The infor mative rule set is significantly smaller than the association rule set especially when the minimum support is small We have studied the upward closed properties of informative rule set for omission of unnecessary rules from the set and presented a direct algorithm to efficiently mine the informa tive rule set without generating all frequent itemsets first 367

constrained frequent itemset search are NP-hard and they are at least P-hard meaning t hey will remain intractable even if P=NP This work gives evidence it is not a good idea to mine all frequent itemsets above a support threshold since the output size is combinatorial In 13 t h e a ut hors d eri v e a bound on the number of candidate itemsets given the current set of frequent itemsets when using a level-wise algorithm Covers and bases 37 21 a re an alternati v e t o s ummarize association rules using a comb inatorial approach instead of a model Clusters have some resemblance to bases in the sense that each cluster can be used to derive all subsets from a maximal itemset The model represents an approximate cover for all potential associations We now discuss closely related work on establishing relationships between association rules and other data mining techniques Preliminary results on using clusters to get lower and upper bounds for support is given in 27  I n g eneral there is a tradeoff between rules with high support and rules with high conﬁdence 33 t h i s w o rk propos es an al gorithm that mines the best rules under a Bayesian model There has been work on clustering transactions from itemsets 41  H o w e v er  t hi s a pproach goes i n t he oppos i t e di rection it rst mines associations and from them tries to get clusters Clustering association rules rather than transactions once they are mined is analyzed in 22  T he out put is a summary of association rules The approach is different from ours since this proposal works with the original data set whereas ours produces a model of the data set In 42 the idea of mining frequent itemsets with error tolerance is introduced This approach is related to ours since the error is somewhat similar to the bounds we propose Their algorithm can be used as a means to cluster transactions or perform estimation of query selectivity In 39 t he aut hors explore the idea of building approximate models for associations to see how they change over time 6 Conclusions This article proposed to use clusters on binary data sets to bound and estimate association rule support and conﬁdence The sufﬁcient statistics for clustering binary data are simpler than those required for numeric data sets and consist only of the sum of binary points transactions Each cluster represents a long itemset from which shorter itemsets can be easily derived The clustering model on high dimensional binary data sets is computed with efﬁcient operations on sparse matrices skipping zeroes We rst presented lower and upper bounds on support whose average estimates actual support Model-based support metrics obey the well-known downward closure property Experiments measured accuracy focusing on relative error in support estimations and efﬁciency with real and synthetic data sets A clustering model is accurate to estimate support when using a sufﬁciently high number of clusters When the number of clusters increases accuracy increases On the other hand as the minimum support threshold decreases accuracy also decreases but at a different rate depending on the data set The error on support estimation slowly increases as itemset length increases The model is fairly accurate to discover a large set of frequent itemsets at multiple support levels Clustering is faster than A-priori to mine frequent itemsets without considering the time to compute the model Adding the time to compute the model clustering is slower than Apriori at high support levels but faster at low support levels The clustering model can be built in linear time on data size Sparse matrix operations enable fast computation with high dimensional transaction data sets There exist important research issues We want to analytically understand the relationship between the clustering model and the error on support estimation We need to determine an optimal number of clusters given a maximum error level Correlation analysis and PCA represent a next step after the clustering model but the challenges are updating much larger matrices and dealing with numerical issues We plan to incorporate constraints based on domain knowledge into the search process Our algorithm can be optimized to discover and periodically refresh a set of association rules on streaming data sets References 1 C  A ggar w al and P  Y u F

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
