An Intrusion Detect ion Algorithm Model Based on Extension Clusteri ng Support Vector Machine  Zhao Rui, Yu Yongquan, Cheng Minjun Faculty of Computer  Guangdong University of Technology  Guangzhou, China zhaorui118204@163.com  yyq@gdut.edu.cn cmj3602@gdut.edu.cn   Abstract  Intrusion detection technology is a key research direction in information technology. For intrusion detection method based support vector machine\(SVM\, there is a big obstacle that the amount of audit data for modeling is very large even for a small network scale, so itís impractical to 
directly train SVM using original training datasets. Selecting important features from input dataset leads to a simplification of the problem, however a defect caused is the lack of sparseness. All training data will become the support vectors of SVM, which causes the low intrusion detection speed. We propose a novel SVM intrusion detection algorithm model using the method of extension clustering which is utilized to obtain a subset including support vectors. Through this approximation, the training dataset is downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model is reduced, which will greatly help to improve the 
response time of intrusion detection. Comparing to others, the arithmetic model is simple implement and better performance So it is worth applying and popularizing  Keywords-intrusion detection; extension clustering;support vector machine I   I NTRODUCTION  With the development of computer network technology more attacks on computer networks are carried out by exploiting unknown weaknesses or bugs always contained in system and application software  H e nce  co m p ut er security has been receiving a lot of attention in recent years Intrusion Detection System \(IDS\plays vital role of detecting various kinds of attacks. The main purpose of IDS 
is to find out intrusions among normal audit data and this can be considered as classification problem Two approaches to intrusion detection are conventionally used [2  o n e i s m i suse  de t ect i o n a n d t h e ot he r i s a n o m a l y detection. Misuse detection is an attack signature-based approach that utilizes a detailed description of the sequence of actions performed by the attacker. This approach detects a series of actions as an attack only if it matches a previously seen attack signature identically. Hence, if a new attack is made, the system fails to recognize it. But due to the requirement of low false alarm rates, most popular intrusion detection systems fall into this category. Another approach to 
intrusion detection is called anomaly detection. Anomaly detection is based on modeling the normal activity of the computer system. Unfortunately, the acquisition of profiles of normal activity is not an easy task. The audit records used to produce the profiles of normal activity may contain traces of intrusions leading to misdetections, and also activities of legitimate users often deviate from their normal profile as modeled, leading to high false alarm rates. There are many IDSs developed during the past three decades and most of the commercial and freeware IDS tools are signature based But when new attacks appear and amount of audit data increases, IDS should counteract them. In addition to this, as 
network speed becomes faster, there is an emerging need for security analysis techniques that will be able to keep up with the increased network throughput[3 Th e r ef o r e IDS its elf  should be lightweight \(means relatively low computational cost\hile guaranteeing high detection rates. In this paper we propose a new lightweight intrusion detection model based on extension clustering support vector machine EC-SVM\. Our model mainly focuses on how to effectively detect intrusions in the real-time network environment Firstly, we extract several necessary and much important features \(named core features\rom network traffic dataset by means of Principal Component Analysis \(PCA\ [4   Secondly, we adopt extension clustering to get a subset 
including support vectors. Then use the training data in the subset to form classifier for detecting attacks based on the selected features, which will improve detection efficiency and shorten response time  II   S UPPORT VECTOR MACHINE SVM Support Vector Machines \(SVM\is a learning system based on statistical learning theory. Theoretically, one main reason for the superior performance is that SVM embodies the Structural Risk Minimization \(SRM\principle to minimize an upper bound on the expected risk [5 Geometrically, SVM modeling algorithm works by constructing a separating hyperplane with maximal margin

   sgn   b x w x f i i   002 1 where 002 is a nonlinear function, which maps x the input space into a feature space. To separate the data linearly in the feature space, the decision function satisfies the following conditions and the optimization problem is minimize   w w w    2  subject  to   2  1  1     n i b x w y i i  003  002 2 The objective of SVM is to maximize the margin of separation and minimize the training errors. Support Vector machine \(SVM\is a newly proposed machine learning approach, which has become a popular research method in intrusion detection, and good results are reported [8 III  I NTRUSION DETECTION MODEL BASED ON EXTENSION CLUSTERING SVM  EC-SVM The overall model of our approach is depicted in Fig. 1 In the training process, network traffic dataset is passed to our feature selection engine using PCA approach Afterwards, extension clustering is used to build subset basis of original set populated by training data for intrusion detection model. In the testing process, network traffic data will directly sent to our intrusion detection model to detect The most advantage of our lightweight model is that by means of feature selection, it can greatly reduce the redundant and least important features for intrusion detection, therefore reduce the computational cost in the process of intrusion detection. Moreover, through extension clustering, the training data was downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model were reduced, which greatly helped to improve the response time of intrusion detection  IV  F EATURE SELECTION  Principal Component Analysis \(PCA\ a powerful technique for extracting features from data sets. But traditional PCA has several problems. Recently kernel trick has been applied to PCA and kernel trick is based on a formulation of PCA in terms of the dot product matrix instead of the covariance matrix [10  K e rn el  P C A  K P CA    however, requires storing and finding the eigenvectors of a N 000h N kernel matrix where N is a number of patterns. It is infeasible method when N is large. To extract on-line nonlinear features, we adopt a new feature extraction method 11  w h i c h  ov er c o m e s t h e  pr ob l e m  of m e m o ry re qu i r em en t  of KPCA by on-line eigenspace update method incorporating with an adaptation of kernel function In this section, we will give a brief introduction to the method of on-line PCA algorithm which overcomes the computational complexity and memory requirement of standard PCA. Before continuing, a note on notation is in order. Vectors are columns, and the size of a vector, or matrix, where it is important, is denoted with subscripts Particular column vectors within a matrix are denoted with a superscript, while a superscript on a vector denotes a particular observation from a set of observations, so we treat   observationsas column vectors of a matrix. As an example i mn A is the ith column vector in an m◊n matrix . We denote a column extension to a matrix using square brackets Thus b A i mn  an  m n  1   m atrix w ith v ect o r  b  appended to i mn A  as a last column. To explain the on-line PCA, we assume that we have already built a set of eigenvectors U = [uj  j    1       k a f t e r ha vi ng t r a i ned t h e input data xi \(i = 1, ∑ ∑ ∑, N\. The corresponding eigenvalues are 002\001 and x  is the mean of input vector. On-line building of eigenspace requires to update these eigenspace to take into account of a new input data. Here we give a brief summarization of the method which is described in [12   First, we update the mean   1 1  1     N x x N N x 3 Then we update the set of eigenvectors to reflect the new input vector and to apply a rotational transformation to U For doing this, it is necessary to compute the orthogonal residual vector 1 1         N N x x Ua h and normalize it to obtain 2 1 1 1       N N N h h h for 0   2 1   N h and 0 1   N h otherwise. We obtain the new matrix of Eigenvectors U 004 by appending 1  N h  to the eigenvectors U and rotating them     1 R h U U N   004 4 where R \037 R k+1\\(k+1 is a rotation matrix.

Then         u K y U u y u A  010  is called an extension set of U, y=K \(u\he dependent function of A  K \(u\e dependent degree of u about A    0      003 010  u K U u u A   0       011 010  u K U u u A   0      0  010  u K U u u J  These are called respectively the positive fields, negative field and zero boundary. Positive number expresses that there is the degree of certain characteristic. Negative means that there is not the degree of certain characteristic. Zero means that there is and there is not certain characteristic B  Extension clustering Definition 2: Based on definition on extensible set and the constructing method of its dependent function, we can make an alterable classification for all research objects This classification method is called extension clustering method [13   The followings are the basic steps of extension clustering method 1 Define classical domain and modulatory domain Suppose N i i=1,2,...,m\ a subset of set P, and P 0 is an object being tested \(P 0 001\031 P\. For judging P 0 belongs to which subset, we must define classical domain R i i=1,2,...,m\ and modulatory domain R p firstly[1 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000        000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000   in in n i i i i i in n i i i i j i i b a c b a c b a c N X c X c X c N X c N R            2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000        000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000   pn pn n p p p p pn n p p p j p b a c b a c b a c P X c X c X c P X c P R            2 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 1   2 Define an object being tested P 0 as specific matter element R 0  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000  n n x c x c x c p R   2 2 1 1 0 0  3 Compute dependent degree by dependent function 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 010  012                     j i j ij ij j j i j ij i pj j ij j j i X x X X x X x X x X x X x x K 013 013 013 013 7 000   n j ij j ij j ij b x b x a 1   8 In the formula \(8\, a ij is weight coefficient.

In actual case we must get core features of network traffic dataset by the new feature extraction approach based PCA firstly. Suppose the selected features are CPU_occupation_rate duration_time, root_user_access_times, port_scan_times and special_file_access_times etc. Then we should know about their value information of some features in normal and abnormal action by a general survey or previous experience 
17 


Based on the known value information, for example, we can define classical domains and modulatory domain of normal and abnormal action and denote them as R 0i i=1,2\ and R p  respectively  000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000            5  1 _ _ _ 5  1 _ _ 5  1 _ _ _ 100  0 _ 30  0 _ _  Normal 01 times access file special times scan port times access user root time duration rate occupation CPU R 000\003\000\003 000\003\000\003 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000            15  5 _ _ _ 15  5 _ _ 10  5 _ _ _ 1000  500 _ 100  50 _ _  Abormal 02 times access file special times scan port times access user root time duration rate occupation CPU R 000\003 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000            15  1 _ _ _ 15  1 _ _ 10  1 _ _ _ 1000  0 _ 100  0 _ _ Action times access file special times scan port times access user root time duration rate occupation CPU R p 000\003 000\003 Then using formula \(7\, formula \(8\and formula \(9\of extension clustering, dependent degree of every action belonging to two classes will be computed. For those actions whose dependent degree belonging to the two classes is not much strong. This means these data justly lay in the margin area of the two classes. And support vectors used classify mainly come from the area. So we can collect them together and form a subset basis of original network traffic dataset This is the new training dataset for classifier based SVM. By this way, the efficiency of training new classifier will be improved and the cost of response time will be decrease greatly. So the model has great actual value VII  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed a novel EC-SVM intrusion detection model using extension clustering to construct a subset basis of original set populated by training data Through this approximation, the training data was downsized and consequently the number of support vectors of ultimate SVM model was reduced and the model building time was shortened, which greatly improved the network intrusion detectionís performance. And It provided an instance to explain the actual application of the model. But above research is the first step. There are many works to do after it such as more details of the model application and so on. The model effectively integrates extenics with SVM. It also provides a new method for solving intrusion detecting. So the new model has great applied value  VIII   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors are grateful to National Natural Science Foundation of China \(60272089\nd Science Foundation of Guangdong University of Technology for decisive support IX  R EFERENCES  1  J.

A minor difference between the observed and the predicted number of upsets for the majority of the programs analyzed indicates that the models are relatively accurate in predicting upset rates even after the SV and shielding assumptions were explored.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds.
