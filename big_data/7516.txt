And then, we present the defects exist in this algorithm. Such as spending a lot of time to produce the candidate item-sets , scanning the database in a simple method, and so on. At last we promote our improved Apriori Algorithm which consists of three parts. The first part is reducing the number of judgments, and the second part is reducing the number of candidate frequent item-sets. The last part is optimizing the database. And the experimental results proved our improvement 1 Introduction With the popularization of computer and development of Database Technology, more and more data are stored in the large databases. Obviously speaking, it is impossible to find useful information without using efficient methods. And then, Data mining DM\niques have emerged as a reflection of this request. Association rules mining, an important research direction, is aim to find out the dependence of among multiple domains basing on a given degree of support and credibility  Association rules mining process is divided into two steps. The first step is to find the frequent item-sets which support degree is large than the initial support degree from the transaction database; the second step to generate the rules of value from the frequent item-sets and the acquisition of frequent item-sets is the key step during mining association rules procedure. In 1993, R Agrawal first promoted an association rule mining algorithm named apriori alg orithm \(AA\. And in the following year, Agrawal proposed two kinds of improved AA named AprioriTid algorithm and AprioriHybrid algorithm. Whatís more, subsequent researchers have also given a lot of improvement for the AA. However, all of these improved algorithms have the following problems in varying degrees. The first problem is these algorithms need a lot of time to produce the candidate frequent item-sets. And the second one is these algorithms have to scan the transaction database many times to do the pattern-matching for candidate frequent item-sets These two issues are both the hotspots and difficulties during current research on mining association rules. In our paper, we promote a faster and more efficient algorithm based on the classical AA  2.Basic conception The concept of the association rules was first proposed by R. Agrawal. It is used to describe the patterns of customers' purchase in the supermarket. The association rules can be formally defined as Definition 1: Let      123 n Iiii i   be a set of items D is a transactional database. Where  k ik 123 n   is an item. Tid is the exclusive identifier of transaction T in transactional database Definition 2: The implication of the form XY  is called an association rules. Where XI   YI  and XY   Definition 3: Let D be a transactional database. If the percentage of transactions in D that contains XY  is s%, the rule XY  holds in D with Support s If the percentage of transactions in D containing X that also contain Y is c the rule XY  has Confidence c The definitions of probability are  Support X Y P X Y     Confidence X Y P Y X   Rules that satisfy both minimum support threshold min-sup\ and minimum confidence threshold min-conf\trong rules Definition 4: If the support of item-sets X is greater than or equal to minimum support threshold X is called frequent item-sets. If the support of item-sets X is smaller than the minimum support threshold, then X is called infrequent item-sets 


415 3 The basic idea of Apriori Algorithm Generally speaking, AA uses an iterative method to search the rules Layer by layer. We should find out the 1-item-set named 1 L at first, and then we use 1 L to identify the set of 2-item-set named 2 L Go on this operation until we canít seek out the item-set. Here there are two parts during the AA a Connection Step Generate a new set of candidate item-set named k C here k is the length of candidate item-set k C is the produced through the connection operation of 1 k L   Here 1 k L  is a frequent item-set and 1 k  is the length of this frequent item-set. The connection rules reads as follows. Let 1 L and 2 L belong to the 1 k L  If all the items of these two frequent item-set are same except their last items, then they can be connected b Pruning Step Actually speaking, it is scanty that all the subset of k C fill the min-sup. As a result, we must determine how many subset of k C are belongs to k L by scanning the transaction database D That is to say, we should determine the support of every item-set in k C in order to delete the candidate item-set which canít match the min-sup 4 Apriori Algorithm Performance Analysis From the Implementation of AA, we can find there are three fatal defects exist in this algorithm a First, we need to scan the database repeatedly That is, we need to scan the whole database every time when we calculate an item-set b The time complexity and space complexity are too high due to its large candidate item-sets c There exist many rules, discovered by the method which is based on the theory of credibility, which have no practical significance 5 Improvement of Apriori Algorithm In this paper, we decide to improve the performance of AA in the following three aspects a Reduce the number of judgments b Reduce the number of candidate frequent item-sets c Optimize the database 5.1 Reduce the number of judgments During the process of AA, all these transactions have already been sorted. Therefore, we can affirm that the candidate frequent item-set is ordered. And any comparison between the two candidate item-set  is ordered on the bit comparison .That is to say, we can reduce the number of judgments during the process of producing candidate frequent item-set  through the use of this property. The details are as follows  Definition 1: Let us compare two frequent item-set named lx and ly If            lx 1 ly 1 lx i 1 ly i 1 lx i ly i 1 i k 012 012  Then we can say that lx is smaller than ly  lx ly  If there exists m frequent item-sets and 12 m ll l     we can allege that these item-sets are ordered. There are many properties for this definition Property 1: For any item of k-item-set, there exists    l1 l2    Proof: Because l is an ordered item-set, so the property is proved Property 2: For any item of k-item-set  lx ly let 1x yzm   If           lx 1 ly 1 lx i 1 ly i 1 lx i ly i 1 i k 012 012  than we can get that    lx j lz i   while counter j is smaller than z and larger than 1 Proof: Because yz  so we can affirm ly lz   Therefore, if    ly i lz i     lx i lz i  is true when j equals to i which is a specific number. By the same token, if    ly i lz i     ly p lz p   is true when j equals to p which is a specific number We can optimize the link step by using the properties mentioned above  With regards to these two k-1 frequent item-set named lx and ly if these two item-set canít be connected, then we can affirm that all the item-sets after lx and ly canít satisfy the connection condition .As a result, there is no need to determine whether the item-sets which are behind the item-set lx and ly satisfy the connection conditions or not Whatís more, both item-set lx and item-set ly get from k-item-set. So, repeated connection operations are existed during the Traversal process. That is, the result of connecting x and y is same to the result of connecting y to x. So, it is necessary to execute further optimization  12 declare TL TL  1K12K1 Set TL L TL L   1 f oreach lx TL 015

Here  K1 L j  means the number of j in  K1 L j   Proof: Let X be a k-dimension item-set. Now we take any k1  elements from X Obviously, there are k possibilities. So, there are k1  project j in all the \(k-1\dimension item-set which are produced by X  As far as the above properties are considered, we can get a conclusion. The details are as follow Let c i 015  1  015 k L c here i is an project, c is an element and 1  K L  is a k-dimension frequent item-set . If the inequality  K1 L jk1   is established, then the candidate k-dimension 1  K C item-set produced by 1  K L  canít be a frequent item-set. As a result, there is no need to let 1  K C participate in join operations Here is the new strategy for pruning the frequent item-set Calculate  K1 L j  Here  K1 L j  is the frequency of   K1 L j  and    k1 jL UAAL  015 015 Find the projects which frequency are smaller than k1   and then put them into a Set name  I  Get rid of the frequent item-set of K1 L  which contains the subset of  I than we can get a new K1 L  named  K1 L   5.3 Database optimization Mark a delete tag on all the transactions of item-set which not contains the k C during the calculation of k C  Therefore, there is no need to take these item-set into consideration in the following calculation. The efficiency can be more and more obvious with the growth of value k 6 Improved algorithm description Input: Transaction D Minimum support threshold min-sup Output L i Frequent item-set in D  Here is the flow chart 1   _ 1 _ _ 1 D itemset frequent find L   f ind the 1-itemset 2 1 2   k for k L k   3 sup min_   _ 1   K k L gen apriori C  K Create the candidate itemset C    5 kk L Citemset  6  7 k return L=UL Procedure apriori_gen 1 k L  min_sup 1  12 declare TL TL 2     k1 Get I i L i k 1   3  k1 k1 Set L L I   4  1k1 2 k1 Set TL L TL L   5 1 f oreach lx TL 015 6 2 f oreach ly TL 015 7      if lx 1 ly 1 lx 2 ly 2 012 8        lx k 2 ly k 2 lx k 1 ly k 1  012   10  clxly  12   _  k1 if has infrequent_itemset\(c,L   13  delete c  16   kk CC c  17 22 TL TL lx  18  19 else break  21 Has_infrequent_item-set c  K1 L   1 f or each \(k-1\ subset s of c  2 k1 if s L return true; else return false    7 Experimental Result  We compared the performance of our improved

Contrast with different number of items From Fig 3, we can see that the execution time of IAA is shorter than AA while under different number of items The above three experiment results demonstrate that while comparing the classical AA, the IAA improves the overall performance by reducing the number of scanning the database, using the new data representation and adopting a new Connection method between items 8 Conclusions In this paper, an improved Apriori-based algorithm IAA is proposed. Our improvement consists of three parts which are reducing the number of judgments adopting new pruning strategy and optimize the transaction database. These improvements can greatly reduce the redundant operation while generating frequent item-sets and association rules in the database Validated by the experiments, the improvement is notable Acknowledgements The paper is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China \(60872115\, Shanghaiís Key Discipline Development Program \(J50104 References 1 K un-M i ng  Y u  J i a L i ng Zho u  A W e ig hte d Load-Balancing Parallel Apriori Algorithm for Association Rule Miningî, Granular Computing, 2008.

the-shelf PCs. From experiments conducted it is observed that ED-ARM improves the speed of finding the large itemsets over the distributed transaction database system and has a superior performance over CD and FDM However, by comparing different algorithms it is seen that DDM algorithms were not shown to scale well [18 So  there is need of designing of one that has merits of both the parallel and distributed algorithms. The simple solution proposed for this problem is a hybrid of PDM and DDM approach The DDM algorithm based on other than Apriori sequential algorithms has to develop. Moreover, DDM algorithms developed so far ignores the differences among distributed sources and can leads to incorrect results and also cannot incrementally mines evolving databases. So there is great need for the designing and implementation of ARM algorithms that overcomes all these constraints   References  1  M J  Za k i  P a r a lle l a n d D i s t ribute d A s s o c i a tion Mi ning A     Surveyî, IEEE, 1999, pp. 2- 3, 13- 15    R A g ra w a l an d J  S h af er P aral l e l m i n i n g asso ci at i o n ru l e s   IEEE Trans.

second This is 13–26 times slower than the processing speed on the GPU To compare against a parallel implementation we did 8 simultaneous runs using 8 cores which took 15.66 seconds Since the time did not grow noticeably we conclude that the computation does not yet have a memory bottleneck The number of set elements processed per second using 8 cores is 1  71  10 9  or 29–57 of the throughput of the GPU batmap computed above This means that performance is noticeably poorer on the CPUs than on the far less expensive GPU V C ONCLUSION We have shown that a GPU allows set intersection and frequent pair mining that extends to much larger number of items than previous algorithms Further we believe that our approach may be pushed further with careful tuning as we are still far from using the full memory bandwidth of the GPU Our techniques may open up for new applications of e.g association mining where there are tens of thousands of variables e.g genetic data One problem we leave open is to achieve similar results for intersections of more than two sets There are two ways in which our work could possibly be extended one is to use a generalization of batmaps that store items in d out of d 1 places This would ensure that itemsets of size up to d would have at least one position witnessing their intersection Another is to use batmaps to count for each item in S i 1  how many times this item appears in S i 2 S i 3   At the end one would need to sum up the counts for the two occurrences of each item to determine if the item appeared in all sets A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  We would like to thank Anna Pagh for taking part in showing theoretical results on our generalization of the cuckoo hashing insertion procedure and Kumar Lav for his participation in initial experiments with the method described in this paper Also thanks to the anonymous reviewers for numerous useful suggestions This work was supported in part by a grant from the Danish National Research Foundation for the project Scalable Query Evaluation in Relational Database Systems R EFERENCES  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases VLDB 94  pages 487–499 Morgan Kaufmann Publishers 1994  R R Amossen and R Pagh Faster join-projects and sparse matrix multiplications In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory ICDT  pages 121–126 ACM 2009  P Bille A Pagh and R Pagh Fast evaluation of unionintersection expressions In Proceedings of International Symposium on Algorithms And Computation ISAAC  volume 4835 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science  pages 739–750 Springer 2007  P A Boncz M Zukowski and N Nes MonetDB/X100 Hyper-pipelining query execution In Proceedings of Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research CIDR  pages 225–237 2005  C Borgelt Efﬁcient implementations of apriori and eclat In Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  volume 90 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings  CEUR-WS.org 2003  C Borgelt Recursion pruning for the apriori algorithm In Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  volume 126 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings  CEUR-WS.org 2004  C Borgelt An implementation of the fp-growth algorithm In Proceedings of the 1st international workshop on open source data mining OSDM  pages 1–5 ACM 2005  Computer language benchmark game http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all   E D Demaine A L  opez-Ortiz and J I Munro Adaptive set intersections unions and differences In Proceedings of Symposium on Discrete Algorithms SODA  pages 743–752 2000  M Dietzfelbinger and F M auf der Heide Simple efﬁcient shared memory simulations In Proceedings of the 5th Annual ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  pages 110–119 SIGACT and SIGARCH June 30–July 2 1993 Extended abstract  W Fang M Lu X Xiao B He and Q Luo Frequent itemset mining on graphics processors In Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware DaMoN  pages 34–42 ACM 2009  A Ghoting G Buehrer S Parthasarathy D Kim A D Nguyen Y.-K Chen and P Dubey Cache-conscious frequent pattern mining on a modern processor In VLDB  pages 577 588 ACM 2005  N K Govindaraju J Gray R Kumar and D Manocha GPUTerasort high performance graphics co-processor sorting for large database management In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 325–336 ACM 2006  J Han J Pei Y Yin and R Mao Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation A frequent-pattern tree approach Data Min Knowl Discov  8\(1 2004  B He K Yang R Fang M Lu N Govindaraju Q Luo and P Sander Relational joins on graphics processors In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data  pages 511–524 ACM 2008

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
