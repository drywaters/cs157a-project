Hypergraph Clustering Model Based on Fuzzy Frequent Itemsets Applied in Management of Agricultural Land Evaluation Liu Yang Zhang Shiyi School of Resource and Environmental Science WuHan University Wuhan, China E-mail: liuyang.whu@163.com  Zhu Lifang School of Urban and Environmental Science Huazhong No rmal University Wuhan  China E-mail Address: zlft11@163.com  Abstract  There are two shortages in usual methods for agricultural land evaluation: \(1\ manual interferences into the calcu lating procession; \(2\ively large differences of partial units are concealed in certain factors. We designed a hypergra ph clustering model in this paper based on fuzzy freque 
nt itemsets to conduct the evaluation  for quality of agricultur al land. The database for land units is composed with the fuzzy feature vectors. It executes the mining association rules to the fuzzy itemsets given by the definition of evaluation factors  and analyzes the clusters with the HMETIS segmentation method, finally devises the transactions similarity function to cluster the services. With the following check ing example in some region in South China, it not only determines the quality rating of each units of agricultural land, but also gives the quality description for each grade  Keywords agricultural land evaluation; hypergraph clustering model; fuzzy frequent itemset; transaction database  I. INTRODUCTION The substance of evaluation for agricultural land management is a process of analyz ing the information of agricultural land quality\(p roduction conditions determining the evaluatio 
n criterion and hierarchizing the analysis. When applying the factor method in the agricultural land evaluation, it might be possible that the defects of a certain condition would be concealed by the advantages of some other factors, but this kind of defects could be the sill which restricts the quality of farmland In this paper we design a method which composes 2 steps establishing the hypergraph model and clustering data based on hypergraph. Firstly the transaction database is constructed from th e evaluation units database. During this process, we set index description of evaluation factor as an data item, and express it as a vertex in hypergraph. The correlated items would be connected by weighted hyperedges. A hyperedge represents a relationship in the subset of evaluation units data. The weight of hyperedge shows the intensity of the relationship. Then applying the hypergraph partitioning algorithm to cluster the vertexes 
and we will get the corresponding index for evaluation factors-clusters of items. Finally, these items from the cluster is used to describe the clu ster which the transaction belongs.\(Fig. 1 II.

The attribute value of agricu ltural land units might be continuous or discrete. We need to apply the fuzzy sets theory to create the membership function for each attribute and change attribute data to th e dimensionless items which show the monotonically increasing tendency. The continuous property membership data is divided into several intervals. Each interval composes a subset of the certain property which called a fuzzy itemset. If the supporting degree of the fuzzy itemset is higher than the setting threshold, this itemset is called a fuzzy frequent itemset. Mining the association rules according to the fuzzy frequent itemsets would be agreeable to show the fuzzy phenomena in the land qua lity of evaluation units  B  Constructing the model It is assumed that there are m evaluation units of agricultural land in a certain region n evaluation factors the index data with multi-resource of evaluation unit i is defined as X j j=1Én x i1 x i2  x in A membership function of each evalua tion factors is established in the discussed area, which subjects to Y j   j X j=1Én  And the value of membership from each index of factors for a evaluation unit is derived. Getting y ij   j  x ij  Y i  y i1 y i2  y in is regarded as the fuzzy feature vector of evaluation unit Xi. The transaction database is composed by the fuzzy feature vectors For a weighted hypergraph H V E Fig.2\set V is constituted of fuzzy itemsets, and hyperedge E is composed of fuzzy frequent itemsets. A hyperedge is expressed by a fuzzy frequent itemset, and the weight of each hyperedge is defined as the average value of all the main association rulesê credibilities of the hyperedge. The main association rule is a formul a which includes all the items of hyperedge and there is only one item on the right side. The way to get the main association rules will be introduced behind                  III. ASSOCIATION RULE S AND THE MINING ALGORITHM A  mining algorithm of Association rule Mining association rules is aimed at obtaining all the association rules which satisfy the minimum supporting degree-Minsupport and the minimum credibility Minconfidence. Firstly all the frequent itemsets in dataset D can be quickly searched according to the minimum supporting degree, then the association rules will be get from the frequent itemsets and the minimum credibility B  Generation of association rules After mining all the frequent itemsets in the dataset, the strong association rules which satisfy the minimum supporting and cred ibility can be produ ced. The specific operating introductions is followed: for each frequent itemset 1 to generate all the non-empty subsets of 1, if    We get an association rule s =>\(l - s among which sup por _ count\(l\numbe r of transaction records which contained itemset 1 sup port _ count\(s\ the number of transaction records which contained itemset s min_ conf is the threshold of minimum credibility. The association rules are directly produced by the fre quent itemsets, therefore all the itemsets that involve in the rules will satisfy the threshold of minimum supporting degree IV. TOP-DOWN HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING ALGORITHM BASED ON HYPERGRAPH Hypergraph partitioning algorithm HMETIS is applied in the cluster analysis which belongs to divisive hierarchical clustering methods. HMETIS is a efficient layered hypergraph partitioning algorithm. It divides the vertices of hypergraph into k parts which are roughly the same and makes the least number of hyperedges which connect different parts A  Item clustering-the classification of fuzzy frequent  items for evalu ation factors To purify the division results we need to eliminate meaningless classes at first. Higher quality value of class implies that the inside edge of division has a greater weight If the quality value of class is higher than the setting division threshold, the clusters are considered to be fine It is assumed that e represents a vertex set of hyperedge The standard for measuring whether division c is good or bad is defined as follows   After obtaining the g ood division, we need to check the vertices in the division and filter those vertices which are not strong correlated with others.

The correlation function of vertex v is defined as follows Re levancy  v  c    e  e  c  v  e  e  e  c  After purifying the division by the 2 standards above, we can get high quality division of the vertices, in other words the clusters that fu zzy items belong B  Transactions clusterevaluation un its classification The hypergraph clustering model constructed in this paper is clustering the transactions of evaluation units by clustering the items of evaluation factors.

FARMLAND QUALITY EVALUATION OF HESHAN CITY According to the natural and economic attributes of farmland in Heshan City, we make comprehensive assessments for the farmland quality and divide the results into several grades. In this case, 10 factors are chosen to be analyzed \(Table I polygons act as the evaluation units which come from the land use database with the scale of 1:10000.

CONCLUSIONS The substance of target item clustering is that it definites the range or value for the factors of a certain type or level agricultural land.

     7. Conclusions  The application of weights to sample market basket transaction data yielded interesting patterns by generating association rules for less frequent items but with higher revenues. For example, Love Seat and Plasma TV gained prominence due to their price compared with Sofa and Love Seat. This kind of information can be used to boost revenue. It has been demonstrated that WIAARM effectively prunes item sets when weights are provided and generates interesting association rules. WIAARM can be applied effectively on market basket transactions to boost revenues. If the weights provided are profits, then the rules can instead be used to boost profit SIAARM when applied to BioMap dataset \(about 2000 transactions\ yielded strong associations rules even for item sets with low support. Whether or not a newly introduced protein will show up in strong association rules, will depend on how significant it is in its occurring transaction and the nature of all transactions. For dataset with about million transactions, it is believed that the items will have very low support. Thus the significance of the item set could contribute more towards the weighted support than just mere support. This however needs to be analyzed and the program has not been tested against such large datasets A study on the pruning effects on the different approaches proved that item sets with low support and low weights can be significant when using WSIAARM. As it is cumbersome to apply weights on biomedical extracts, SIAARM can be applied on such datasets. The absence of weights does not prevent item sets with lesser support to gain importance Importance of item sets is determined by their significance in corresponding transactions and not by merely their support. SIAARM was applied on BioMap data with equal weights considered. Even with the absence of weight definition for the items SIAARM produced rules with less frequent item sets The problem with WIAARM and WSIAARM approaches is that they do not adhere to the property of anti-monotonicity. They use a conjunction of monotonic \(average weight\ and anti-monotonic constraints \(Apriori support\. However, it has been demonstrated that interesting patterns can be generated from this approach. It is this property that leads to interesting patterns from less frequent item sets as well. In his study, Jeudy [9 an aly z e d an timo n o to n i c  and monotonic properties and states that monotonic properties are more efficient than anti-monotonic properties. This provides justification to go with WIAARM or WSIAARM approaches even though it is not downward closed. Also the main problem with Apriori is its fundamental assumption that rules with high support are the more interesting ones causing the rare item problem. A valuable approach, SIAARM has been derived from WSIAARM, retains antimonotonicity property and might not suffer from the rare item problem the traditional Apriori approach faces  8.

verify the postulation behind our algorithm that an update usually only affects the status of a very small portion of the CET and the new branches grown because of an update is usually a very small subset of the CET We also studied the memory usage for Moment As shown in Figure 9\(b the average memory usage per closed frequent itemset actually decreases as the minimum support decreases This suggests that as the CET becomes larger it becomes more memory-ef\223cient in terms of memory usage per closed frequent itemset BMS-WebView-1 The second dataset we used is BMSWebView-1 which is a real dataset that contains a few months of clickstream data from an e-commerce web sites This dataset was used in KDDCUP 2000 There are 59,602 transactions in the dataset We set the sliding window size N to be 50,000 and do experiment on 100 consecutive sliding windows Other parameters are the number of distinct items is 497 the maximal transaction size is 267 and the average transaction size is 2.5

total number of nodes in the CET and the total number of closed itemsets As can be seen although both grow exponentially as the minimum support decreases the relative ratio between the two remains approximately the same which suggests that for real data the CET size is also linear in the number of closed frequent itemsets 5 Conclusion In this paper we propose a novel algorithm Moment to discover and maintain all closed frequent itemsets in a sliding window that contains the most recent samples in a data stream In the Moment algorithm an ef\223cient in-memory data structure the closed enumeration tree CET is used to record all closed frequent itemsets in the current sliding window In addition CET also monitors the itemsets that form the boundary between closed frequent itemsets and the rest of the itemsets We have also developed ef\223cient algorithms to incrementally update the CET when newly-arrived transactions change the content of the sliding window Experimental studies show that the Moment algorithm outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm that mines closed frequent itemsets without using incremental updates In addition the memory usage of the Moment algorithm is shown to be linear in the number of closed frequent itemsets in the sliding window Acknowledgement We thank Professor Mohammed J Zaki at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute for providing us the Charm

with at least 100 terms is quite low barely reaching 100 Therefore we 002x the 002nest temporal granularity at an hour Figure 9c considers the cells at the 100 km 002 100 km 002 1 week granularity The 002gure shows that thousands of such cells have summaries that receive more than 1 thousand terms We 002x k at 25 and generate 2 query sets each consisting of 100 queries Each query in the 002rst set has a temporal extent with a length chosen at random among 1 hour 1 day and 1 week and it has a randomly selected spatial region The spatial granularity of the coarsest cell that is contained in the spatial query region is the query's spatial granularity and the query region is enlarged to cover all the cells at that granularity that it intersects with In visual terms this procedure corresponds to 223snapping\224 the spatial query region to the coarser granularity The underlying rationale for adopting this procedure is that 002ner-granularity cells do not contribute with term counts at the same magnitude as do cells at the granularity of the coarsest fully covered cell Since any rectangle can be created from a number of merged squares we limit the experiments to squares Each cell contains 10 002 10 cells at the next 002ner granularity Thus the largest number of cells any query square can cover is 18 002 18  324 As a result we employ queries that may cover up to 1,800 002 1,800 km 2  While the 002rst query set focuses on variation in the spatial range the second focuses on temporal variation Each of the 100 queries has a spatial region chosen at random from one of the spatial granularities The query resulting in most temporal summary merges is the query that spans from the 002rst hour after midnight on the 002rst day in May until the hour before midnight on the last day of May This query covers 2 002 23 hours 3  5 days and 3 weeks which amounts to 57 temporal summaries To avoid empty results we do not consider regions that only cover empty cells Note that we do not perform compaction on the last active temporal granularities to better re\003ect the real-life scenario where a stream is constantly keeping these summaries active To simplify the experiments the initCounters parameter which determines the initial number of counters is set to the same value as targeted k  C Baselines We consider two baselines for comparison and validation of our proposal SS In each active spatio-temporal summary we aggregate the most frequent items using the SpaceSaving algorithm Active summaries maintain a 002xed number  m  of items and their counts while archived summaries are compacted by keeping only the counters for the k most frequent terms Choosing a value for m represents a trade-off between storage size and result accuracy HT In each active spatio-temporal summary we maintain a full list of terms using a hash table Once the summary becomes inactive and is archived its time granularity passes the list is sorted and cleaned up by discarding all but the counters for the targeted topk terms This approach maintains the exact topk items at all spatio-temporal granularities and serves to measure the accuracy of the other approaches However since HT has excessive storage requirements we do not expect it to scale under the considered workloads D The Space Versus Accuracy Trade-Off In the 002rst set of experiments we evaluate the accuracy of our approach by comparing it with the baselines Since HT maintains the exact counts at all granularities its storage requirements are too high for large scale experiments Similarly SS maintains a 002xed number m of counters at all granularities and m cannot be set too high for large scale experiments Thus we consider only tweets occurring in the spatial region with the 11S grid zone designator a region in the US of size ca 900 002 550 km 2  We use the local machine We consider variants of SS where m is set to 50 100 and 200 In AFIA we set targeted k to 50 The 002rst week four days in May is used for warm-up and only the accuracies of the subsequent summaries are evaluated We perform topk queries on all summaries at each spatio-temporal granularity We compare the topk most frequent terms in each summary produced by AFIA and SS and compare with the corresponding topk items produced by HT We set k  20  156

Fig 14 Checkpoints Over Time V C ONCLUSIONS We present a new framework for the processing of spatiotemporally constrained topk most popular terms queries on streaming spatio-temporally tagged text content such as microblog posts The framework's index extends existing techniques for counting frequent items in summaries to allow the summaries to grow and shrink dynamically to adapt to changes in the incoming data Query processing works by merging relevant summaries To provide guarantees about the query results a new merging algorithm is proposed that supports spatio-temporal query regions Experimental studies with an implementation of the framework offers insight into the accuracy scalability and performance of the processing of incoming data and queries and they demonstrate that the framework is capable of offering very accurate query results at high performance at scale A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported in part by the MADALGO research center and in part by the

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
