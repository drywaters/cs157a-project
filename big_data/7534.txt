hwalden@ball.com, mpierce@ball.com, dakaufma@ball.com, alopez@ball.com  Abstract 227Spacecraft standards can enable dramatic reduction in the cost, schedule and risk of spaceflight. After the first build of a standa rd spacecraft the non-recurring engineering is complete which allows rapid, cost-effective production of subsequent un its. Spacecraft standards can increase the supplier base by encouraging multiple organizations to build components, subsystems, or spacecraft according to the same standard. Interface standards promote rapid and low-risk integration. The Space Development and Test Wing \(SDTW\ of the Space and Missile Systems Center \(SMC 
Laboratory \(NRL\ied Physics Laboratory \(APL\and a consortium of aerospace industry and academia partners have developed standards for two independent projects with different, yet synergistic goals. SDTW leads the Space Test Program-Standard Interface Vehicle \(STP-SIV\program with prime contractor Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp Ball Aerospace a small spacecraft bus with well-defined and documented st andard interfaces to the payload, ground, and launch vehicle \(LV\s designed to provide low cost space access to the science and technology \(S&T\community. NRL leads the Operationally Responsive Space \(ORS\ent. The ORS bus standards were developed by the Integrated System Engineering Team \(ISET\sting of technical experts from over a dozen government and industry 
partners, chartered with gene rating standards for production of responsive spacecraft buses for the ORS Program Office Both programs provide to the space community wellPL on which to base future PL designs. Rather than designing a unique SC for each payload the standards provide adaptable interfaces to accommodate a range of payloads STP-SIV offers a Payload User\222s Guide \(PLUG\which defines the mechanical, therma l, power and data interfaces to help facilitate PL design and integration. Similarly, the ISET developed a Payload Developers Guide \(PDG describing capabilities and interface requirements for the ORS standard. Ball Aerospace has been contracted to standardize the ORS PDG such 
that the payload interface information and document organization follow the same outline and similar content as the STP-SIV PLUG. The complementary documents, including a payload questionnaire, along with a merged \223flysheet\224 table containing summary-level capab ilities of each platform will aid payload providers in sel ecting the appropriate spacecraft platform to host their payloads. This paper focuses on standard payload hosting capabilities, described in STP-SIV PLUG and ORS PDG, and the bene fits of standardization of these small space vehicle platforms to the S&T, ORS, and other aerospace communities 1 2  T ABLE OF

The paper gives a brief history of each program and describes the interface capabilities Table 1 shows a top level summary and comparison of capabilities. The standards for both SC 
provide mission flexibility; both enable operation over a wide range of orbits, and allow for launch on a variety of LVs. The STP-SIV and ORS ISET standards provide complementary capabilities.

  3 It is expected that utilizing a standard interface and disseminating this informati on to the aerospace community will increase spaceflight opport unities, lower cost, and reduce risk for missions and potential customers. In addition to programmatic benefits, a standard interface provides operations benefits as well. Although the ground support equipment \(GSE\ions systems may need some modification due to PL specific requirements \(i.e state of health and science data\he core GSE and ground systems, which interface to the SC should not change Operations training for personnel remain consistent across multiple standard vehicles and operators achieve a greater familiarity with the SC and ground system. Hence, GSE ground system and operations costs are reduced as the number of standard vehicles increase Various publications  reveal the cost benefit of SC standardization. The STP-SIV and ORS ISET designs implement standardization at the interface between the SC and PL and the SC and LV. To incorporate the benefits of standardization, spacecraft engi neers work with experiment designers early in the development process. By designing to a standard, the PL developer understands the resources that are available on the selected spacecraft and the requirements necessary for PL to SC interface 2  STP-SIV  P ROGRAM  SDTW shares a fundamental goal with other government organizations to lower costs and increase speed of access to space. The STP-SIV is an impor tant step in achieving this goal. The STP-SIV program provides for up to six spacecraft using a flexible inde finite delivery, indefinite quantity \(IDIQ\ntract for rapid acquisition of satellites to quickly respond to Department of Defense \(DOD The SDTW "develops, tests, and evaluates Air Force space systems, executes advanced space development and demonstration projects, and rapidly transitions capabilities to the warfighter." To accomplish this mission SDTW has two groups, the Space Test Group \(SDT\and the Space Development Group \(SDS\core competencies. Two of SDT's competencies include procuring LVs and conducting satellite operations. A key element of the SDS mission is to develop advanced space systems that demonstrate DOD S&T and new capabilities for our warfighters. The cost-e ffective approach enabled by the STP-SIV allows SDTW to increase the number of spaceflight opportunities for the S&T community, thus helps accomplish the SDS mission The mission design division of the SDS builds space-flight missions from a yearly, prioritized list of 40-45 DODsponsored space experiments on the Space Experiment Review Board \(SERB\ list. The design drivers for the STPSIV were derived from an analysis of payloads submitted to the SERB and the desire for ESPA compatibility. Many small payloads that come to the SERB for flight opportunity have a high degree of flexibility in orbit inclination and altitude and typically can be \223bundled\224 into a suite of payloads that a single 180 kg class spacecraft can support By providing small payload designers with a defined interface in which to develop their systems it is easier for SDS mission planners to bundle the various experiments STP-SIV Interface Capabilities The STP-SIV design supports the program goal of a lowrisk bus by using flight-proven components, a simple structural design, and significant design and software reuse from prior missions. The design balances a low-cost and low-risk approach with si gnificant spacecraft capability and flexibility The STP-SIV capabilities suppor t a variety of potential small payloads. The standard capability spacecraft operates over a range of low earth orbit altitudes and inclinations The spacecraft design as shown in Figure 1 provides the required power over the full range of sun angles Table 2 highlights the threshold requirements and performance goal characteristics for the spacecraft Mission-tailored multi-layer insulation blankets provide the appropriate radiator coverage fo r the particular orbit and PL suite. A single star tracker is a key element of the attitude determination and control system. It is mounted directly on the PL interface plate to mini mize alignment errors between the bus and PL STP-SIV must be compliant with many interfaces  Figure 2 The PL is primarily concerned with the SC to PL interface but many of t hose requirements are flowed down from SIV\222s external interfaces   Figure 1 STP-SIV Design is Flexible and Capable

See Appendix D of the STP-SIV Payload User's Guide for a complete drawing of the PIP. To be compatible with the SIV standard, the PL supplier shall make all mounting points compatible with the standard mounting grid. PL locations on the PIP will be determined by Ball Aerospace to ensure requirements of each individual PL are satisfied   Figure 2 External Interfaces of the STP-SIV Spacecraft are Defined Figure 3 The STP-SIV Spacecraft Bus and Payload Module Accommodate a Range of Payloads 


  5 SIV provides a total PL volume of 0.14 m 3 The allowable PL envelope in the launch configuration is shown in Figure 5 PLs will be mounted \221on-top\222 of the SC and must fit within this volume for launch. Once the SC is on orbit and deploys the solar arrays, PLs may deploy elements as necessary to perform their mi ssions. All deployed elements shall remain above \(+Z PL  PLs are provided an unobstructed field of view of 2  steradian, oriented towards the +Z PL nadir originating at the PL interf ace plane. Additionally, the PLs are provided a 2 steradian unobstructed field of view   Figure 6 Payload has Nearly 3 Steradians Unobstructed Field of View towards the +X PL velocity direction until seasonal yaw flip\originating 55 cm from the leading edge of the PIP in the +X PL direction. This provides nearly 3 steradians of unobstructed views for PLs Figure 6  Power Interface 227During normal mission operations, the SC provides a minimum 100 W orbit average power \(OAP to the PL suite. This power is allocated between the different PLs on each mission. If the total power draw for all PLs combined exceeds 100 W it may be necessary to duty cycle PL operations in order to reduce the PL suite power consumption to within the capability of the SC Each PL is provided three switched power feeds. Each power feed provides unregulated 28 +/-6 Vdc from the SC PLs which have multiple power modes of operation, may wish to divide up the three SC power services among the differing modes. For example, if the PL has a nominal or idle state of operation and occasionally powers up focal plane arrays, the PL may dedi cate a single SC power service to that nominal mode and a separate power service to the focal plane electronics The SC provides over-current protection on each power line provided to the PL. Each switch is equipped with a circuit to actively disable the switc h if the current exceeds 5.94 amps. After the initial 40 milliseconds from switch turn-on if PLs exceed the 5.94 amp limit for greater than 20 microseconds, the fault protection turns the power switch off, removing power from the PL. The current on these switches is also monitored by the SC software. The software can be configured to remove power if the current exceeds a pre-determined current less than 5.94 amps Thermal Interface\227 The SC monitors the temperature of the PIP using four temperature sensors mounted to the underside \(-Z PL side\interface plate. Each PL receives the temperature once per second as part of the SC status message. The temperature measurements are provided to the ground as part of SC state of health \(SOH is maintained to temperatures between -9 \272C and +39 \272C Figure 4 Payload Interface Plate shown with Payload Coordinates Provides Standard Mounting Grid  Figure 5 Payload Envelope fo r Launch Configuration Consistent with Variety of LVs 


  6 Data Interface\227 The SC Integrated Avionics Unit \(IAU functions as the main data and command interface between the PLs. All PL command, data collection, and data storage is via the PL Interface Board \(P IB\which resides within the IAU. The PIB provides each PL one data port which consists of a 62 pin high density d-sub \(HDD\or on the PL module. All PL commands and collection of high rate data, real-time data, analogs and discretes is through the single 62 pin Data Port. All PL data \(high rate and realtime\is polled and ingested in a \223round robin\224 scheme ensuring that no PL can monopolize the bus. Both the PL high rate and real-time data are time-stamped at the time of receipt Figure 7 shows the PIB system block diagram. The PIB ingests PL high rate mission data, encapsulates this data in a Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems \(CCSDS compliant Channel Assess Data Unit \(CADU\format and stores the formatted CADU for subsequent transmission to the ground. All high rate data is transferred via either an asynchronous UART EIA-422 link or  a synchronous EIA compliant RS-422 link. The choice of synchronous or asynchronous data transfer met hod is selectable for each PL and is fixed prior to launch. The total high data rate available is 2 Mbps shared among all the PLs The PIB provides for collection of PL real-time data. One EIA-422 UART is provided on each PL data port. PL realtime data is collected and interleaved into the real-time SC downlink and is also stored on the PIB for retransmit. Each PL\222s real-time data is limited to 240 bytes/sec The PIB provides to each PL data port; 8 analog inputs, 8 discrete inputs, and 8 discrete outputs. The term \223input\224 or 223output\224 used throughout this section is referenced from the SC point of view \(i.e. input refers to data from a PL into the SC\e PIB samples the analog and discrete telemetry channels once a second. Analog data is converted to a Figure 7 PIB System Block Diagram Illu strates Standard Data Interface 


  7 digital format using a 12 bit A-to-D converter. The PIB interleaves the discrete and an alog data into the SC realtime telemetry. The PL real-time serial data is formatted with a CCSDS Path Protocol Data Unit \(CP_PDU\header and then transferred to solid state memory for storage and subsequent transmission to the ground. SC data \(high rate real-time, analog, discrete\entified using an application id \(APid\rtual channel id \(VCid\ real-time data is assigned it\222s own APid and VCid for each data port, while analog and discrete data is included into the SC state of health data and uniquely identified by APid for each data port The PIB also functions as th e gateway for commands issued to the PLs and delivering SC status message \(time, SC ephemeris, SC attitude and PL interface temperature information to the PLs. Each PL data port is provided one EIA-422 UART command link Each PL data port is provided a 1 PPS signal, slaved to the SC master clock. The 1 PPS signal is an EIA-422 compliant differential pulse providing accu racy better than 1 ms. Once a second, SC time \(seconds since epoch\s delivered to each PL via the EIA-422 command gateway. Thus the PLs may synchronize to the SC master clock with a high degree of precision The PIB provides total mass memory storage of 8 Gbit of EDAC validated memory space. The memory is shared amongst all 4 PLs for high rate, real-time and stored state of health data. The PIB design allows for four software partitioned buffers corresponding to storage of each PL\222s high rate data. Memory partition size is allocated by flight software \(FSW\zed to fit individual PL\222s storage needs. Mass memory allocations are assigned to each PL by Ball Aerospace and may be resized during flight. PL realtime data is also archived and managed by FSW. Archived data is available for retransmission via ground command PL memory storage is physica lly arrayed as a circular buffer, for which PLs are responsible for not exceeding their data storage allocation and overwriting previous data Memory partitions are in place to ensure that even in error conditions such as a PL exceeding their data storage allotment, each PL\222s data will remain inviolate Design Environments The STP-SIV User\222s Guide defines the environments the PLs will be exposed to during system level test, launch and on-orbit. These environments include vibration, acoustics shock, acceleration, radiation, and electromagnetic Space Vehicle to Launch Vehicle Interface STP-SIV is designed to launch a variety of LVs, including Pegasus, Minotaur I and IV, and the ESPA on either Atlas V or Delta IV. This flexibility maximizes launch manifest opportunities as a secondary PL or as a rideshare partner Compatibility with multiple LVs requires the SV be designed to bounding launch envir onments that envelope all candidate LVs. Although volume and mass are easily bounded, other factors such as a realistic LV shock and electromagnetic Interference EMI\ent require thorough analysis  A minimal set of electrical inte rfaces have been identified to provide safety monitoring and battery charging of the SC The SC and PLs will be powered off when mated to the LV until SC separation, keeping the required number of umbilical interfaces at a minimum Spacecraft to Ground System Interface The interface between the STP-SIV and ground operations is also controlled by two doc uments; an Interface Control Document \(ICD\and the Standardized Interface Specification for the Air Force Satellite Control Network AFSCN\SIS-000502C. SIS-000502 defines the types of service provided by the AFSCN and the design requirements for the SV radio frequency \(RF\stem. The ICD describes the specific char acteristics employed by the space vehicle RF system to show compliance with these requirements. This includes defining the exact operating frequency, subcarrier frequencie s, modulation scheme, etc Space Ground Link Subsystem \(SGLS of a command/ranging receiver with embedded decryptor and power converter and a telemetry/ranging transmitter with embedded encryptor and power converter. The STPSIV RF system is based on a single string L-3 Communications CXS-810C transponder. The transponder provides command reception, telemetry transmission encryption/decryption, and ranging data turn-around consistent with the Standard Interface Specification between AFSCN Common User Element Comm/Range Segment and Space as described in SIS-000502E Figure 8 provides an overview of the ground system architecture Commands and Schedules Commands are stored on board the SC in one of two schedules. The real-time schedule is an absolute time execution sequence. The script schedule is a relative time execution sequence. The realtime schedule and the script schedule have the same data format and structure. Each is a linked list ordered by scheduled time and priority. Each item in each schedule include s the command header, the data, and the cyclic redundancy check \(CRC maximum total length a command on any schedule is 256 bytes Real-time Command Processing When the schedule target fiel d indicates that the command is destined for the real-tim e schedule, the scheduled time field is compared with the current SC time. If the field\222s value is less than or equals to the SC time, the command is 


  8 immediately executed. If the sc heduled time is greater than the SC time, the command is placed on the schedule and executed when its scheduled time becomes equal or less than the SC time Every second, the real-time schedule is checked for commands that are to be execu ted. The scheduled time field of the first command on the sche dule is compared with the SC time. The command is executed if its scheduled time field is either current or in the past. The scheduled time of the next command on the schedule is then checked and executed if appropriate. This is continued until the command being checked has a sche duled time that is in the future Script Command Processing Script schedules have many of the same features as the realtime schedules; they can be manipulated in the same fashion as the real-time schedule. By command, script schedules can be loaded onto the real time schedule. The script schedule persists after being loaded onto the real-time schedule so that it can be subsequently manipulated reloaded, etc Script schedules have the same structure as the real-time schedule; they are linked lists ordered by scheduled time and priority. When schedule target field indicates the command is destined for one of the script schedules, it is placed on the script schedule by inserting it into the linked list When the script schedule is to be executed, a command is sent which loads the script schedule onto the real-time schedule. As the script schedule is being loaded, a time offset \(either a command parameter or the current SC time is added to the scheduled time field of the command. Thus the script schedule is a \223relative time\224 schedule that can be used at many different times. Since each command retains the value of the target schedul e field when it is loaded onto the real-time schedule, any in advertently loaded script schedule can be deleted from the real-time schedule Interface Control Documentation Although the STP-SIV PLUG describes the superset of interface capabilities, Ball Aero space and the PL developer must agree to the specifics of how each PL will use the interfaces. This non-ambiguous agreement is documented as an ICD and is the single sour ce for interface requirements The ICD specifies not only the requirement but also the method of requireme nt verification and provides traceability to supporting verification documentation Since PL developers and SDS will partner to successful fly DOD experiments, SDS will sugge st PL design changes that both increase the PL probability of mission success and decrease the risk of detrimenta l effect to the SC or other PLs. It is a balance between PL and SC requirements. PL developers must be vigilant of elusive effects to such things as outgassing and EMI and apply design guidance supplied in the STP-SIV PLUG Figure 8 STP-SIV Ground System Interfaces Defined 


  9 3  ORS  ISET  S TANDARDS P ROGRAM  The need for effective spacecr aft bus standards has been broadly identified as a necessary condition for a successful ORS system. The Office of Force Transformation \(OFT and SMC undertook a four phase initiative to develop and test bus standards and subsequently transition them to acquisition. This effort involves multiple government laboratories, industry partners, and academic institutions The ORS ISET bus standards described in this paper were developed as Phase III of this effort The ORS ISET Standards program has as its foundation the results of two focused studies performed in Phase I of the 4phase initiative to analyze the technical and business aspects of a standard bus within th e ORS System concept. The thrust of the business case effort, led by the MITRE Corporation, was to consider the broader user community of bus standards and the potential for overall acquisition from industry of a standard bus from the classes under consideration for ORS The second study was led by MIT/Lincoln Laboratory MIT/LL\oping a technical framework for classes of ORS standard busses to assess utility within the identified mission context. The research sought to determine whether meaningful military utility could be realized from relatively sm all spacecraft. This phase provided an analytical departure point to determine at least one proper class of ORS spacecraf t needed to be militarily relevant. This utility analysis drew on experienced users and system developers to generate measures of utility mapping system characteristics \(e.g geolocation accuracy, imaging resolution, dwell time, etc.\ mission capability across a broad set of identified ORS mission areas. Missions considered included RF collection, visible imaging, spectral imaging, navigation, communications, et  The MIT/LL study identified over fifteen performance metrics such as resolution, target location error, sensitivity frequency range, etc. within ten mission areas. Mission area examples include RF collecti on, visible imaging, spectral imaging, navigation, and communications. The utility of each performance metric and th e weighted value of that metric were determined and entered into a systems-ofsystems model. The parametric tool used spacecraft design models to determine spacecraft bus performance characteristics such as size, weight, power communications, etc. for approximately 120,000 varying bus designs and then evaluated the overall military utility for each design as well as the re lative cost in order to plot the trend of utility versus cost. Based on the results of the utility analysis, the report had several findings First, a tactical spacecraft bus standardized across variety of National Security Space \(NSS\issions, can meet many but not all needs of a tactical commander. Second, small sized tactical satellites can achieve large increases in mission utility if used in constellations to improve persistence. Lastly, there exist standard performance specifications for a small tactical satellite bus that satisfy a wide range of NSS missions The initial studies inform the bus standards effort which developed and matured bus standards in an open environment with broad government, industry, and academia participation. This was accomplished by forming a national system engineering working group with the US small satellite industry to establish and maintain ORS bus standards to include both technical and business factors One primary product of the bus standards effort is a Payload User\222s Guide which allows payload designers to design to the ORS standard bus. The second product is a bus \223design specification\224 that contains the developed standards interfaces, and overall performance level \(slew rate, power mass, etc.\of the spacecraft bus, including data protocols and launch vehicle interface details. While this collection of items could be considered the bus \223standard,\224 it is important to realize that this is not a spacecraft point-design, nor does it represent a design that is imposed on industry; but instead a system-level performance a nd interface specification that will enable multiple developers and integrators to support future acquisitions To validate and refine the bus standards, a prototype bus for flight experimentation was produced. The prototype bus developed under this effort will be integrated with a COMM-X payload in Fall 2008 for the Tactical Microsatellite \(TacSat\ mission Integrated System Engineering Team \(ISET Recognizing that significant buy in from industry was necessary to construct a set of standards that govern the design, manufacturing, assembly, test and integration of a high utility bus, ISET was established in 2005. The team\222s charter is to develop a set of specific standards that allow industry to produce spacecraft bus es for the government at moderate volume for low cost that provide, on average, the 22380% utility\224 solution across a number of mission types The ISET adopted the following specific charter Generate a set of spacecraft bus standards, in sufficient detail to allow a space vehicle manufacturer to design build, integrate, test and deliver a low cost spacecraft bus satisfying an enveloping set of mission requirements launch vehicle, target orbit, payload, etc.\n support of a tactical operational responsive space mission The government formed the team from credible domestic small satellite integrators. The team members supply senior systems engineering support to both high-level architecting activities, as well as detailed subsystem evaluation Representatives have demonstrated hands on experience in the design, development, manufacturing, integration, and 


  10 test of satellites, preferably small satellites, and/or volume production of satellites. The companies that make-up the ISET Team include ATK, AeroAstro, Design-Net Microcosm, Space Systems/Loral, General DynamicsSpectrum Astro, Microsat Sy stems Incorporated, Boeing Raytheon, and the Space Dynamics Lab \(SDL Spacecraft Capabilities The SC standards take into account the potential commonality and/or differen ces in spacecraft bus design between LEO and HEO missions. LEO missions launched from the Western and Eastern test ranges were investigated with altitudes from 350 to 705 km. A number of HEO orbits with working apogee altitude s above 7800 km were also investigated. These mission types were studied on the basis of differences in both the environmental impacts on bus design and required spacecraft bus subsystem performance Since the ORS spacecraft must comply with established satellite disposal procedures, the propulsive capability requirements for LEO and HEO missions were investigated A drag analysis that reflected ballistic coefficients for ORSclass missions determined that for LEO missions with altitudes greater than 600 km propulsion is required to deorbit the satellite within the required 25 years. Similarly, for HEO orbits, the directive states that the perigee of a LEO and medium Earth orbit \(MEO\t must be raised to above 2000 km. Since this requires a significant Delta V capability, the ORS standard was established to carry enough propulsion to lower the pe rigee. In addition, the drag environment for LEO missions below 550 km required sufficient makeup propulsion to maintain altitude through a nominal year mission life From a radiation perspective, HEO orbits define the worstcase charged particle environments. Below 705 km, LEO orbits have benign conditions. Since SC in HEO orbits spend more time near the orb it apogee, they accumulate a greater dose. At the lower apogees \(<3000 km\the environment is dominated by trapped protons and, at the higher apogees, electrons domin ate the environment. These results have implication on the radiation tolerance of the SC bus, therefore the standards el ected to state the expected environments, as both dose depth curves and particle fluence levels and leave the design mitigation for both Total Ionizing Dose \(TID\ngle Event Effects \(SEE\to the design team based on performance at the design vehicle life Finally, from a subsystem performance perspective, the relative orbital environments are similar enough to expect that bus performance could be maintained constant between the two mission types, with the exception of communications performance, which would need to be reduced or power aperture increased for the higher propagation distances Table  3 highlights bus capabilities   ISET Products \226 Bus Standards Figure 9 shows the ORS bus standards document structure A bus built to the standards must be compliant to these documents. PL developers will be most interested in the PDG summarized in the following sections Payload Developers Guide \(PDG The PDG document presents the envelope of capabilities and the requirements for support of the selected range of potential missions. It identifies the necessary performance requirements, interface defi nitions, and general ORS philosophies needed by mission designers and payload developers to be compatible with the ORS SC bus and launch capability.

  11 The support accommodation for the PL contained within this document was derived from an enveloping process conducted by the ISET In order to develop effective standards, it was necessary fo r the ISET to research the mission needs and PL support requirements across a wide range of potential missions that were representative of a typical mission for the ORS program Table 4 shows the capabilities available to a potential payload. The volume available to the Payload is shown in Figure 10   Figure 10.  PL Stowed Envelope  The PDG is not a complete design standard for the PL itself it only covers the interfaces and support accommodations with the spacecraft bus and launch support service. Many aspects of the PL design are dependent on the actual mission  Table 4 ORS Standard Bus Provides Significant PL Accommodation  PL Support Item Selected Capability Comments Mass [kg 200 Captures 87% of maximums Volume [m 3  Figure 10 LV fairing constraints to be used Orbit Average Power W  200 Captures 94% of maximums Peak Power [W  700 Captures 81% of maximums Orbit Position Knowledge-3 002   1 arc-min at I/F Captures 75% of maximums Attitude Control-3 002 m  90 Captures 81% of maximums Attitude Knowledge3 002    0.05 Captures 81% of maximums Slew Rate [deg./sec 2.0 Captures 87% of maximums S/C SB Ops Data Rate [M  5 Captures 100% of maximums Tactical D/L Data Rate [M  274 As state-of-the-art permits PL Data Storage   0 SC will store only state-of-health data Thermal Dissipation to SB [W 60 PL brings any extra radiator  Figure 9 ORS Bus Standards Document Structure 


  12 the PL is intended to fulfill, thus many requirements and specifications that would be found in a PL design specification would need to be provided by the specific PL procurement agency. The ORS Phase III standards can be downloaded from http://projects.nrl.navy.mil/busstandards  Communications Interfaces  A key external interface for th e space segment \(bus and PL is RF communications to the ground. This topic investigated standardization for SC command and control \(C&C communications link and the tactical communication link Figure 11 presents a basic high-level view of the RF communications pathways envisioned in the standards Other issues investigated related to both current and future approaches the military is planning for RF communications including, data flow, frequency band definitions modulation techniques, data rates, communication security COMSEC\and basic defi nition of ground interface locations. Given the current maturity of the general military SC C&C network, the presen t SGLS architecture and the expected Unified S-Band \(USB\architecture were established as the standard. Fo r the tactical links, standard UHF was established for LDR application, and the Common Data Link \(CDL\ocol was established as the HDR standard Ground Support Checkout Interface In support of the rapid call-up scenario, standards for interfacing spacecraft bus and the payload, and processing the integrated space vehicle though launch, is one of the unique activities under the IS ET derived ORS system design. The need to develop an approach for this effort in sufficient detail in order to derive requirements that would influence the spacecraft bus design is critical. The approaches developed have design and manufacturing ramification on the bus, such as the ability to install batteries late in the flow, rapid \223built-in-test\224 capabilities periodic checks, and access a nd safety implications Data Interfaces: Bus to Payload and Ground This document defines the data exchange protocols, data transport formats, packet definitions and field definitions for the bus/PL interface. Underlying electrical interface for the bus/PL interface is the HDLC and SpaceWire. The bus/PL interface is defined such that the HDLC interface SpaceWire interface, or both can be used. The bus design will provide support for both interfaces. The PL may choose to implement either one or both. The bus/PL interface is defined to dynamically suppor t either or both interfaces without needing bus reconfiguration \(i.e., FSW changes This document also defines the data exchange protocols data transport and packet template for the space/ground interface. The space to ground interface definition assumes the use of a flight side SGLS transponder integrated with COMSEC slices. The SGLS forward link assumes a flightside Cardholder COMSEC slice. The SGLS return link  Figure 11 Radio Frequency Communications Architecture  


  13 assumes that the SGLS transponder supports both the narrow-band and wide-band inte rfaces. While a return link COMSEC is required, this document assumes that the return link COMSEC does not levy any blocking or packaging constraints for the return link This interface standard was developed as part of the ORS Phase 3 Bus effort. This interface standard was adopted by the ORS Phase 3 Bus and COMMx payload elements. As a result, the TACSAT-4 spacecraft implemented the encl osed interface standards for its bus to payload and space to ground interfaces This document is limited to and currently defines the interfaces between the spacecraf t bus and the payload, and between the spacecraft bus and the ground. Subsequent releases will define the add itional internal interfaces. The depth of detail required for in terface standardization and the need for coverage of additional interfaces is an ongoing assessment effort by ORS s upported standards definition efforts. The intent is to levy interface standards where these standards will lead to efficien t system integration, robust operational capabilities, and improved system flexibility while reducing overall system cost 4  C ONCLUSION  Both the STP-SIV and the ORS ISET efforts have developed standards that provide options for cost-effective capable, flexible spaceflight. Pathfinder SC buses are currently in development for both efforts and will have flight heritage within approximately one year Through the efforts of ISET and the associate prototype teams, the ORS program ha s successfully produced an extensive and well-documented set of ORS bus standards consistent with the ORS concept of operations \(CONOPS and classes of missions. The process used to produce these standards has resulted in technically sound standards which are understood, with buy in from industry. Business factors were also strongly considered to improve the transition of these standards into successful acquisition under a subsequent operational phase While ORS must provide the business foundation, these technical standards are intended to be more broadly useful in order to further volume production, standards acceptance, and the industry business cases. The ORS standards are readily available to Government organizations and payload developers SDTW employs lessons learned from decades of space flight to standardization of STP-SIV design. Flexibility is planned from the beginning and missions are adapted within the range of the SC\222s capability. Development of SC standards requires upfront investment in order to achieve a return on investment once multiple missions have been built and flown. The more PL provi ders who are willing to adopt the STP-SIV interfaces and deve lop experiments applicable to the capabilities of the SC the more successful this program will become R EFERENCES   National Research Council The Role of Small Satellites in NASA and NOAA Earth Observation Programs National Academy Press, Washington D.C., 2000  G F Squibb, \223Meeting the Needs of the Space Technology Industry,\224 ISO Focus, Oct 2005   T.

Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous
