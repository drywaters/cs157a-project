signi\034cant thus the sets are considered redundant 017 if R 024 T  the variance between the sets is not signi\034cant In order to apply the Anova model over the groups of sets we used the k-means algorithm to classify the sets in groups based on the means of these sets Then we proposed a new initialization method to 034nd dynamically the optimal number of groups 050 K 051 in k-means The proposed method divides a parent group into b p  n  2 c children groups where n is the number of total sets at each period every time the Anova model is not satis\034ed Finally the CH sends one data set from each group with the IDs of all the sensors in this group to the sink Algorithm 2 describes the k  means algorithm adopted by the A  nova model and the B  artlett test or simply the KAB technique proposed in First it starts as e xplained previously by grouping all the received sets at the initial same group 050lines 4 to 6\051 Then it searches the variance between measurements in all the sets in the initial group using the Anova model and the Bartlett test 050lines 9 and 10\051 If the test's result indicates a low variance between the sets then the algorithm considers this group as a 034nal group and it puts it in the list of 034nal groups 050lines 11 12 and 13\051 Else it divides the initial group in K sub groups by applying the k-means algorithm 050line 15\051 Once the 034nal groups are obtained CH sends only one useful information to the sink e.g the data set with the highest cardinality and the IDs for the sensors that generate redundant data sets 050lines 19 to

searching dissimilarities between these sets Hence a great number of distance functions have been proposed in the literature In this paper  we are interested in two distance functions that are widely used in various domains Euclidean and Cosine distances Let us consider two data sets M 0 i and M 0 j  generated by the sensor nodes S i and S j respectively at the period p as follows M 0 i D f 050 m 0 i 1  wgt 050 m 0 i 1 051\051  050 m 0 i 2  wgt 050 m 0 i 2 051\051      050 m 0 i k i  wgt 050 m 0 i k i 051\051 g and M 0 j D f 050 m 0 j 1  wgt 050 m 0 j 1 051\051  050 m 0 j 2  wgt 050 m 0 j 2

than a threshold 050 t d 051 as follows Dist 050 M 0 i  M 0 j 051 024 t d However two issues must be considered when using distance functions with measures weights 1\051 Calculating the distance between two data sets with different cardinalities e.g k i and k j  and 2\051 integrating the weights when calculating the distance between sets To face these challenges we propose to use the threshold   introduced in the Similar function 050cf Section IV\051 when computing the distance between the sets In order to 034nd the distance between two sets M 0 i and M 0 j  the 034rst step consists in dividing each set into two parts overlap and remained The overlap part of the set M 0 i 050resp M 0 j 051 contains measures that are similar to those in M 0 j 050resp M 0 i 051 VOLUME 5

H Harb et al  Comparison of Different Data Aggregation Techniques in Distributed Sensor Networks  Research Lab 2 Mica2Dot sensors with weather boards collect timestamped topology information along with humidity temperature light and voltage values once every 31 seconds The objective of these experiments is to con\034rm that the proposed data agregation methods can successfully achieve desirable results for energy conservation data latency and data accuracy in different monitoring applications Data were collected using TinyDB in-network query processing system built on the TinyOS platform In our experiments we used a 034le that includes a log of about 2  3 million readings collected from these sensors For the sake of simplicity in this paper we are interested in one 034eld of sensor measurements the temperature 3 We assume that all nodes send their data to a common CH placed at the center of the Lab First each node periodically reads real measures while applying the local aggregation At the end of this step each node sends its set of measures with weights to the CH which in its turn aggregates them using the three proposed methods in our technique We evaluated the performance using the following parameters 050a\051 1\051  the threshold   de\034ned in Similar function takes the following values 0  03 0  05 0  07 0  1 2\051 034  the number of sensor measurements taken by each sensor node during a period takes the following values 200 500 and 1000 3\051  the distance threshold t d takes the following values 0  35 0  4 0  45 and 0  5 4\051  the threshold t J of the Jaccard similarity function is 034xed to 0  75 5\051 013  the false-rejection probability in the Anova model is 034xed to 0  01 A DATA AGGREGATION RATIO AT THE SENSOR's LEVEL During the local aggregation each sensor node searches the similarity between measures captured at each period and assigns for each measure its weight Therefore the result of the aggregation in this phase depends on the chosen threshold   the number of the collected measures in period 034 and the changes in the monitored condition Fig 4 shows the percentage of remaining data or aggregated data which will be sent to the CH with and without applying the local aggregation phase at the sensors level At each period the amount of data collected by each sensor is reduced at least by 77 050and up to 94%\051 after applying the aggregation phase Otherwise the sensor node sends all the collected data e.g 100 without applying the aggregation phase Therefore our technique can successfully eliminate redundant measures at each period and reduce the amount of data sent to the CH We can also observe that with the local aggregation phase data redundancy among data increases when 034 or  increases 2 Our techniques has been also applied on real data collected from the ARGO project The obtained results were similar to those presented in this paper which indicate the ef\034ciency of our techniques in underwater sensor applications However the results are not presented in order to not increase the number of pages of this paper 3 the others are done by the same manner FIGURE 4 Percentage of data after applying local aggregation This is because the Similar function will 034nd more similar measures to be eliminated in each period B DATA SETS REDUNDANCY When receiving all the sets from its member nodes at the end of each period CH applies the second aggregation level in order to 034nd all pairs of redundant sets Fig 5 shows the number of pairs of redundant sets obtained at each period when applying Euclidean and Cosine distances KAB and PFF techniques respectively First we 034xed 034 and  and we varied t d as shown in Fig 5\050a\051 then we 034xed 034 and t d and varied  as shown in Fig 5\050b\051 and 034nally we 034xed  and t d and varied 034 as shown in Fig 5\050c\051 The obtained results show that the CH 034nds more redundant sets when applying the distance functions i.e Euclidean and Cosine compared to the Jaccard function used in PFF technique for different values of parameters This is because the distance condition 050Equations 7 and 8\051 is more 035exible compared to the similarity condition 050Equation 1\051 used in PFF On the other hand the Anova model gives the least important number of redundant sets because it searches redundant data sets in groups instead of pairs in distances and similarity methods FIGURE 5 Number of pairs of redundant sets at each period 050a\051 034 D 500  D 0  07 050b\051 034 D 500 t d D 0  4 050c\051  D 0  07 t d D 0  4 4258 VOLUME 5 2017 


H Harb et al  Comparison of Different Data Aggregation Techniques in Distributed Sensor Networks  Several observations can be made based on the obtained results in Fig 5 017 The Euclidean distance 034nds more redundant sets compared to Cosine distance in all cases This is due to the Euclidean distance equation which is more 035exible compared with that used in Cosine distance 017 The number of pairs of redundant sets in Euclidean and Cosine distances increases when t d increases 050Fig 5\050a\051\051 This is because we allow more measures to be lost when t d increases thus we allow more sets to be redundant 017 The number of redundant sets obtained in both distances and KAB technique is almost 034x when 034xing 034 and t d and increasing   while it increases in PFF 050Fig 5\050b\051\051 This is because the data sets save the same distance 050resp variance\051 condition when changing   Otherwise the results of PFF proportionally change to  since they are strongly dependent on the Similar function FIGURE 6 Percentage of sets sent to the sink at each period 050a\051 034 D 500  D 0  07 050b\051 034 D 500 t d D 0  4 050c\051  D 0  07 t d D 0  4 C DATA SETS REDUCTION In this section we show how the CH is able to eliminate redundant sets at each period before sending them to the sink Fig 6 shows the percentage of the remaining sets that will be sent to the sink after eliminating the redundancy Similarly to Fig 5 we varied t d and we 034xed 034 and  in Fig 6\050a\051 then we varied  and 034xed 034 and t d in Fig 6\050b\051 and 034nally we varied 034 and 034xed  and t d in Fig 6\050c\051 Generally the obtained results are dependent on the number of the redundant sets shown in Fig 5 if more redundant sets are found this will lead to more sets being eliminated Therefore Euclidean and Cosine distances allow the CH to eliminate more redundant sets except when t d is small 050e.g t d D 0  35 in Fig 6\050a\051\051 at each period compared to PFF and KAB techniques The results obtained in Fig 5 allow us to conclude some observations shown in Fig 6 017 The percentage of sets sent to the sink using Euclidean distance is inferior to that sent using Cosine distance for different values of parameters This is because the CH 034nds more redundant sets by using Euclidean distance 050see results in Fig 5\051 017 The distance functions allow the CH to send 15 to 61 less of sets to the sink compared to PFF due to the 035exibility of distances regarding the redundancy compared to similarity functions Similarly KAB gives better results 05036 to 49 less of sent sets\051 compared to PFF in all the cases This is because KAB searches redundant sets in groups then sends one set of each group to the sink while PFF searches them by pairs 017 The percentage of sets sent to the sink in Euclidean and Cosine distances decreases when t d increases 050Fig 6\050a\051\051 while it is almost 034x when  or 034 increases 050Fig 6\050b\051 and 6\050c\051\051 017 PFF sends less percentage of sets to the sink when  increases while it is almost 034x when using KAB technique 050Fig 6\050b\051\051 This is because the variance condition in Anova is independent from  while the Jaccard function in PFF is dependent FIGURE 7 Energy consumption in each sensor node 050a\051 034 D 200 050b\051 034 D 500 050c\051 034 D 1000 D ENERGY CONSUMPTION STUDY In this section our objective is to study the energy consumption at the sensor nodes and CH levels In sensor networks energy consumption is highly dependent on the amount of data sent and received First Fig 7 shows the energy consumption comparison with and without applying the local aggregation phase by each sensor node and when varying 034 and   Since the local aggregation signi\034cantly reduces the redundancy among data collected by the sensor node 050see results in Fig 4\051 it allows it to proportionally save its energy when transmitting its data to the CH at each period This result is obvious in Fig 7 when the sensor node applies the local aggregation phase and when  or 034 increases It is important to notice that our technique can save from 76 050Fig 7\050a\051\051 up to 94 050Fig 7\050c\051\051 of the energy of a sensor node VOLUME 5 2017 4259

H Harb et al  Comparison of Different Data Aggregation Techniques in Distributed Sensor Networks  FIGURE 10 Data accuracy 050a\051 034 D 500  D 0  07 050b\051 034 D 500 t d D 0  4 050c\051  D 0  07 t d D 0  4 has been evaluated based on the percentage of loss measures at the CH in other words we divided the number of measures taken by the sensor nodes whose values 050or similar values\051 do not reach the sink after applying each aggregation method over the whole measures collected by the sensors at each period Fig 10 shows the results of data accuracy for the data aggregation functions used in our technique for different values of t d   and 034  We can notice that PFF gives the best results for data accuracy 2  81 in the worst case compared to the Euclidean 050up to 12  52%\051 and Cosine 050up to 21  75%\051 distances and KAB technique 050up to 33  8%\051 The reason for this is that the Jaccard function used in PFF is a strong constraint regarding the loss measures compared to distance and variance constraints which are more 035exible We can also notice that Euclidean and Cosine distances conserve the integrity of the information more than the KAB technique Indeed KAB sends one set among a group of sets to the sink which increases the loss of measures It is important to know that with KAB technique the objective is to send the minimum amount of data to the sink which allows decision makers to take the correct decision based on the received information The following observations can be made based on the results obtained in Fig 10 017 The Euclidean distance conserves the integrity of data more than Cosine distance in all cases This is due to the equation of Cosine distance which eliminates the sets that have high cardinality 017 The loss of measures using Euclidean and Cosine distances increases when t d increases 050Fig 10\050a\051\051 This is because the CH eliminates more sets when t d increases 050see results in Fig 6\051 017 The data accuracy in distances and KAB techniques increases when  increases 050Fig 10\050b\051\051 or 034 decreases 050Fig 10\050c\051\051 On the other hand using PFF the data accuracy decreases when  or 034 increases G FURTHER DISCUSSIONS In this section we give further consideration to our proposed techniques We compare the obtained results while applying the three proposed methods We give some directions as to which method should be chosen under which conditions and in which circumstances of the application From the energy preserving point of view at the CHs the three proposed methods signi\034cantly reduce the energy consumption in the CHs 050Figs 8\051 In addition we observe that the distance method conserves more energy compared to the variance and the similarity methods Subsequently it reduces up to 39 and 64 of the energy in CH compared to KAB and PFF respectively Therefore in the applications where we need to conserve the energy of the network as long as possible the distance method is more suitable From the data latency point of view at the CHs we deduce that the variance method gives the best result in terms of minimizing the data latency compared to distance and similarity methods Subsequently KAB can accelerate the execution time at the CH up to 57 and 26 times compared to the best results obtained using distances and PFF These results are logical because searching the groups of redundant sets using KAB has a weak complexity compared to search them in pairs using distances methods or in candidates using PFF Consequently when the priority for the application is to deliver data to the sink the variance method is more suitable From the data accuracy point of view at the CHs the similarity method can totally save the integrity of the collected data without any loss of information e.g up to 2  81 On the other hand the distance method gives better results in terms of data accuracy compared to the variance method Hence if the application does not permit 035exibility regarding data accuracy the similarity functions method is more suitable else distance and variance methods can be used as a compromise between energy saving and data accuracy 035exibility To summarize this section Table 1 shows the 035exibility of each method regarding energy consumption data latency and accuracy and complexity of the method at the CHs TABLE 1 Comparison between distance variance and similarity methods As an analytical study each sensor node S i will form a set M i of 034 measures in each period Due to Similar function the size of this set will be reduced from 034 to j M i j  Therefore our proposed technique has at most O 050 j M i j 2 051 as a computation complexity at the sensor and it will save at most 0502 002 j M i j 051 measures at each period in its memory These complexities are suitable for the case of sensor node since collected measures are usually redundant thus makes j M i j small even in the worst case This fact is showed clearly in Fig 4 VOLUME 5 2017 4261 


H Harb et al  Comparison of Different Data Aggregation Techniques in Distributed Sensor Networks  where the data collected by each sensor in each period is signi\034cantly reduced On the other hand the complexity of our technique at the CH level is dependent on which data aggregation method the CH uses 050see Table 1\051 Since the CH must enumerate and compare every pair of set the complexity of the distance functions is in order of O 050 n 2 051 where n is the number of all received sets Otherwise the complexity of KAB method is at most in order O 050 n 051 thanks to k-means algorithm which only compare the sets in the same cluster Finally the complexity of PFF is dependent on the complexity of the pre\034x 034ltering calculated in which it is at most in order of O 050 n 002 log 050 n 051\051 since the comparison is reduced to the candidates pairs only Finally the message complexity in our technique is highly dependent on the number of data collected in a period e.g 034  which is 034xed by the application in the case where a large 034 is needed different solutions could be applied like packet division etc On the other hand the storage complexity depends on the memory size of the sensor in addition to the period 034  which can be treated similarly to the message complexity Thus the storage complexity is dependent on the sensor nodes capabilities and memories and then data collection frequency can be de\034ned in function of that storage capacity IX CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK Data aggregation is very essential for WSNs where the huge amounts of data collected by the sensors need to be minimized In this paper we proposed a data aggregation technique for clustering-based periodic sensor networks After eliminating redundant data collected by each sensor we propose three different data aggregation methods allowing CH to eliminate redundant data sets generated by neighboring sensor nodes The proposed methods are based respectively on the sets similarity functions the one-way Anova model with statistical tests and the distance functions We have demonstrated through experiments on real data measures the ef\034ciency of our proposed technique in sensor networks in terms of energy consumption data latency and accuracy In our future work we plan to schedule the sensor nodes in the network in a manner that nodes generating redundant data will not be active at the same time Thus sensor nodes will conserve more energy and network lifetime will be extended REFERENCES   D Baum and C I Matters 0502013\051 Big Data Big Opportunity   A v ailable http://www
