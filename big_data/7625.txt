According to the question of the traditional multilevel association rules mining in large data mining in low efficiency and accuracy ,based on clustering classification multi-level association rule mining is proposed. The method is combined with the concept of hierarchical concept, the data of the generalization sets processing, and uses SOFM neural network generalization into the database after the transaction 
 
by way of introducing an internal threshold so no need to set the minimum support threshold, to generate the local frequent itemsets as global candidates itemsets to generate global frequent itemsets, thereby enhancing the efficiency of multilevel association rules and accuracy. And by simulating the case shows that the method can not only efficient mining single-layer and cross-layer association rules, but also the association rules is new ,easy to understand and meaningful  
Keywords-Self-organizing feature map network SOFM\;Clustering divided; Mult i-level association rules 
I I NTRODUCTION At present the multi-level association rules mining algorithm has many researches. It includes association rules 
mining  of the same level and across levels. The complexity of its problem is higher than single association rules mining The commonly used algorithms of multi-level association rules mining are ML_T2L1 algorithm and the Cumulate algorithm Srikant R, Agrawal R and others proposed ML_T2L1 algorithm is suitable for mining association rules with level and Cumulate algorithm level can mining at the same level and across levels of association rules. Because of these two kinds of algorithms are made by Apriori algorithm extended, has the Apriori algorithm two big shortages: 1 producing a large number of candidate itemsets; 2, multiple scanning database. Therefore people is put forward based on 
the FP - tree multi-level association rules algorithm, the use of FP - tree don't generate candidate itemsets advantages, to enhance multi-level association rules mining efficiency. But this method has the limitations of FP - tree: storage FP - tree need to take up a lot of memory. It is not suitable for a large database of mining, and for each abstraction layer mining use the same minimum support degree threshold value and the value set depend on the user or the expert's subjective Settings. Generally it uses a single the value of minimum support threshold; Set too high, may miss low abstraction layer meaningful association rules; Set too low, may produce meaningless association rules appearing in the higher 
concept levels In view of the above mentioned insufficiency, this article puts forward the clustering based on the division of multilevel association rules mining through clustering division affairs database,to make frequent items relatively concentrated data in each subs et, and introducing the internal threshold way to need not set the minimum support threshold.It not only greatly reduces candidate itemsets, but also reduces the database scan times, to make the mining association rules  more value and  practical significance II R ELATED CONCEPT AND DEFINITION

The mining frequent pattern is more close the local frequent itemsets number called global candidate itemsets is greatly reduced the mining global frequent itemsets efficiency is improved This algorithm inputs for quantitative transaction data set D, concept hierarchy tree T, threshold K, field radius and learning rate, the network training iterative maximum frequency CMax, output frequent itemsets, specific steps shown below Step 1:The original affairsset is processed by data generaliza Struct u r e  the characteristic vector of sample data.If the original project number is n, the input layer neuron number is n.

SOFM has the parallel processing ability distributed storage and strong tolerance of fault, information processing and storage and self organized; Through the competitive learning and training weight coefficient, the clustering center automatically is obtained, to avoid  the subjective factors. It support the large number of clustering results, and effectively find abnormal data classes. Network training convergence speed is faster It is a two layer feed forward neural network 3-5  namely input layer and output layer. Each of the input layer and output layer neuron through the right of each neuron connected. Input layer neurons in the form of one dimensional array. The number of the input layer neurons is by the input sample object n characteristic value to said.The output layer neurons are general with one-dimensional or two-dimensional form arrangement,.the output layer is also called competitive layer, is responsible for the input mode comparison", looking for law, and classification.

Because Cumulate algorithm is extended from the Apriori algorithm. In the mining large database, it has two big main disadvantages: need multiple scanning database and producing a large number of candidate itemsets. In this paper the algorithm by using the SOFM network which has topological keep ability and self organization probability distribution characteristics, and advantage of input data clustering and feature extraction, suitable for the uncategorized multidimensional data set for coarse classification [3  B y  c o a r se di v i de d  la rg e  d a t a  s ets  i t  m a kes similar data set in each block, and make local mining frequent itemsets efficiency improved, frequent pattern close greatly reduce the number of local frequent itemsets. And in view of rare item problem of general multi-level association rules, by the introduction of internal threshold set mode ,to reduce the search space, it can mining Top - k frequent items in a relatively short time. Using the above way on the basis of data with similar advantage in each block, run improvement the Cumulate alg orithm  without support setting. For the relatively large database, the method based on the Apriori multi-level association rules mining still has high efficiency, so the divide and rule strategy method  for large data set is feasible. Based on clustering partition multilevel association rules mining algorithm is one of these categories. Compared with other multi-level association rules algorithm, this algorithm can effectively reduce the number of scanning database, greatly reduce the candidate itemsets generation and improve  the efficiency of association rules mining  of the same level and across levels Experimental hardware platfo rm is: Intel core i3 dualcore processor, memory: 2 GB, hard disk: 320 GB of computer, Software operating system Window XP, using Matlab 7.1of  simulation test Use the case sample data in the similar literature [7 t o  test.The processed original affairs data contains items: kill theft, robbery, rape, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, August September, October, November, December, junior high school, high school, elementary school.

For different test of different size of data sets, between the algorithm and the Apriori based on the multi-level association rules mining algorithm the relationship of execution time and data set the size  as shown in figure 1 shows. The figure 3 knows the algorithm s in this paper execution time than the multi-level association rules mining algorithm based on Apriori is less.While the data size increases from 10000 to 15000 or 20000 , the time gap is widening tendency, mainly because of clustering segments similar data, and the frequent patterns similar, which greatly reduce the candidate item sets Figure 3 The relationship of execution time and the data set size V C ONCLUSIONS Based on theoretical research of the multi-level association rules mining, Top - k frequent pattern mining and SOFM clustering and classi fication methods, according to the problem of that the traditional multi-level association rules mining based on the Apriori algorithm is not adaptable to a large database, this paper proposes a multi-level association rules mining method based on the clustering division. The experiment shows that the algorithm is feasible and effective. This paper is aim to introduce the method, and the more SOFM parameters and internal threshold Settings and performance relationships  of the algorithm will be also further discussed. In the future, we will also focus on parameter Settings difficult problems in the method and this met s application in Web mining fields for further study R EFERENCES 1  H u x i ang q i a n  Mul t i l e v e l asso ciatio n r u l e s mi ni ng al g o r it hm research based on the FP - Tree  \(D\ Chongqing.

We explore a new usage of association rule algorithms to predict missing attribute values combined with rough sets theory We 036rst introduce a new approach RSFit to assign missing attribute values based on rough sets theory Comparing to the 223closest 036t\224 approach 4 this approach signi\036cantly reduces the computation time and a comparable accuracy is achieved We then introduce an integrated approach ItemRSFit based on both the association rule algorithm and rough sets theory to assign missing attribute values The experimental results show the new approach obtains high prediction accuracy It relies on its own data as a knowledge base and therefore the predicted values are not biased In our research we adopt the strategies used by 11 o n balancing the computational cost and the prediction accuracy Lower support value can bring a higher prediction accuracy however frequent itemsets with lower support requires more time for computation than frequent itemsets with higher support In the future we are interested in exploring a satisfactory balance between the support value and the prediction accuracy Given the available computational cost and the affordable computation time it is interesting to explore what percentage of the missing attributes can be effectively predicted and what are the most effective attributes to be predicted In case of a higher prediction cost the idea of giving more important attributes higher priorities for predictions can be applied as an heuristic

Figure 3 Memory Usage of Bodon and Chester implementations on webdocs as Measured by Unix top command during late stages of execution mine sufÞciently low support thresholds on even a modestsized benchmark datasetÑnever mind the gigabytes of data in many real-world applications By introducing a vertical sort at the onset of the classic APriori algorithm signiÞcant improvements can be made Besides simply having better localised data storage the candidate generation can be done more efÞciently and an indexing structure can be built on the candidates at the same time Candidates can be compressed to improve comparison times as well as data structure size The cumulative effect of these improvements is observable in the implementation that we created Whereas other algorithms have been heavily optimised this work opens up many avenues for yet more pronounced improvement Given their independence the data structures used can be partitioned and parallelised quite easily with minimal need for inter-process communication Because our algorithmÕs memory footprint is so small we have sufÞcient memory available to fully exploit multi-core architectures without disk thrashing We expect future results to show a near-linear improvement with an increase in the number of cores Extending the index to more than one item to improve its precision should also yield signiÞcant improvement The result of this research is that the frequent itemset mining problem can now be extended to much lower support thresholds or equivalently larger effective le sizes than have even yet been considered These improvements came at no performance cost as evidenced by the fact that our implementation matched the state-of-the-art competitors while consuming much less memory Prior to this work it has been assumed that the performance of APriori is prohibitively slow This reestablishes it as the frontier algorithm R EFERENCES 1 R A g r a w a l T I m i e l i n s k i  a n dA N S w a m i   M i n i n g a s sociation rules between sets of items in large databases in Proc of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data Washington D.C May 26-28 1993  ACM Press 1993 pp 207Ð216 2 P  W  P ur dom D  V  G ucht  a nd D  P  G r ot h  A v e r a gecase performance of the apriori algorithm SIAM Journal on Computing  vol 33 no 5 pp 1223Ð1260 2004 3 R  A gr a w al and R  S r i kant   Fast al gor i t hms f or mi ni ng association rules in Proc of VLDB  1994 pp 487Ð499 4 J  H an J  P ei  a nd Y  Y i n Mi n i n g f r e quent pat t er ns w i t h out candidate generation in SIGMOD Conference  ACM 2000 pp 1Ð12 5 S  B r i n R  Mot w ani  J D  U l l m an a nd S  T s ur   D ynami c itemset counting and implication rules for market basket data SIGMOD Rec  vol 26 no 2 pp 255Ð264 1997 6 C  L ucchese S  O r l a ndo R  P e r e go and F  S i l v est r i  W ebdocs a real-life huge transactional dataset in FIMI ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 126 2004 7 G  B uehr er  S  P ar t h asar at hy  a nd A  G hot i ng O ut o f c or e frequent pattern mining on a commodity pc in KDD 06 Proceedings of the 12th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining NewYork NY USA ACM 2006 pp 86Ð95 8 B  G oet h al s E f  ci ent f r e quent pat t e r n mi ni ng  P h D  di ssertation transnationale Universiteit Limburg 2002 9 N  D e x t e r s  P  W  P ur dom a nd D  V a n G ucht   A p r obabi l i t y analysis for candidate-based frequent itemset algorithms in SAC 06  New York NY USA ACM 2006 pp 541Ð545  R  S r i k ant a nd R  A g r a w a l  Mi n i n g s equent i a l p at t e r n s Generalizations and performance improvements in Proc 5th Int Conf Extending Database Technology EDBT96  1996 pp 3Ð17  C  B o r g el t a nd R  K r use I nduct i o n o f a ssoci at i o n r ul es Apriori implementation in Proceedings of the fteenth conference on computational statistics  2002 pp 395Ð400  F  B odon  A f a st apr i or i i mpl e ment at i on  i n Proc of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations FIMIÕ03  ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 90 Melbourne Florida USA 19 November 2003  C  B o r g el t  R ecur s i o n p r uni ng f o r t he apr i or i a l gor i t hm  i n FIMI  ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 126 2004  C  L u cchese S  O r l a ndo and R  P er e go kdci  on usi n g d i r ect count up to the third iteration in FIMI  ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 126 2004  FIMI 04 Proc of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations Brighton UK November 1 2004  ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 126 2004  G  G r ahne and J  Z hu E f  ci ent l y u si ng pr e xt r ees i n mining frequent itemsets in FIMI  ser CEUR Workshop Proceedings vol 126 2003 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 55 


For the spatial partitioning we use the Military Grid Reference System MGRS Thus w ay  we represent an y location on the surface of the Earth at multiple granularities ranging from 1 002 1 m 2 to 100 002 100 km 2  by an alphanumeric value For temporal partitioning we use the typical temporal hierarchies from data warehousing hour day week month We drop cells with very low activity speci\002cally cells where the most popular term occurs in fewer than 5 messages at the 002nest granularity hour We will shortly describe how we 002x the spatio-temporal hierarchy in AFIA based on the considered workload We perform three sets of experiments The 002rst measures the space and accuracy of the proposed algorithms and compares them with two baselines The second evaluates the throughput memory consumption and number of checkpoints when varying the targeted k parameter The third evaluates the query processing performance when varying the size of the spatio-temporal query range We also show the number of checkpoints created during a time period B Data and Queries We collected all geo-tagged messages from the public Twitter FireHose during May 2013 The dataset contains 110,426,053 tweets yielding an average rate of circa 41 tweet per second Figure 9 provides insight into the workload and helps choose an appropriate spatio-temporal hierarchy Figure 9a shows the total number of cells that receive at least one tweet Thus the graph shows the expected number of active summaries at the given granularities For example every hour the number of 0.1 002 0.1 km 2  1 002 1 km 2  10 002 10 km 2  and 100 002 100 km 2 spatial grid cells that receive at least one tweet is circa 0.5M 200K 40K and 10K respectively i.e the 223Hour\224 curve in the 002gure Figure 9b considers the cells at the 0.1 km 002 0.1 km 002 1 hour granularity The y-axis depicts the number of such cells subject to different loads the number of terms t processed This shows that the number of 223interesting\224 cells with at least 100 terms is quite low barely reaching 100 Therefore we 002x the 002nest temporal granularity at an hour Figure 9c considers the cells at the 100 km 002 100 km 002 1 week granularity The 002gure shows that thousands of such cells have summaries that receive more than 1 thousand terms We 002x k at 25 and generate 2 query sets each consisting of 100 queries Each query in the 002rst set has a temporal extent with a length chosen at random among 1 hour 1 day and 1 week and it has a randomly selected spatial region The spatial granularity of the coarsest cell that is contained in the spatial query region is the query's spatial granularity and the query region is enlarged to cover all the cells at that granularity that it intersects with In visual terms this procedure corresponds to 223snapping\224 the spatial query region to the coarser granularity The underlying rationale for adopting this procedure is that 002ner-granularity cells do not contribute with term counts at the same magnitude as do cells at the granularity of the coarsest fully covered cell Since any rectangle can be created from a number of merged squares we limit the experiments to squares Each cell contains 10 002 10 cells at the next 002ner granularity Thus the largest number of cells any query square can cover is 18 002 18  324 As a result we employ queries that may cover up to 1,800 002 1,800 km 2  While the 002rst query set focuses on variation in the spatial range the second focuses on temporal variation Each of the 100 queries has a spatial region chosen at random from one of the spatial granularities The query resulting in most temporal summary merges is the query that spans from the 002rst hour after midnight on the 002rst day in May until the hour before midnight on the last day of May This query covers 2 002 23 hours 3  5 days and 3 weeks which amounts to 57 temporal summaries To avoid empty results we do not consider regions that only cover empty cells Note that we do not perform compaction on the last active temporal granularities to better re\003ect the real-life scenario where a stream is constantly keeping these summaries active To simplify the experiments the initCounters parameter which determines the initial number of counters is set to the same value as targeted k  C Baselines We consider two baselines for comparison and validation of our proposal SS In each active spatio-temporal summary we aggregate the most frequent items using the SpaceSaving algorithm Active summaries maintain a 002xed number  m  of items and their counts while archived summaries are compacted by keeping only the counters for the k most frequent terms Choosing a value for m represents a trade-off between storage size and result accuracy HT In each active spatio-temporal summary we maintain a full list of terms using a hash table Once the summary becomes inactive and is archived its time granularity passes the list is sorted and cleaned up by discarding all but the counters for the targeted topk terms This approach maintains the exact topk items at all spatio-temporal granularities and serves to measure the accuracy of the other approaches However since HT has excessive storage requirements we do not expect it to scale under the considered workloads D The Space Versus Accuracy Trade-Off In the 002rst set of experiments we evaluate the accuracy of our approach by comparing it with the baselines Since HT maintains the exact counts at all granularities its storage requirements are too high for large scale experiments Similarly SS maintains a 002xed number m of counters at all granularities and m cannot be set too high for large scale experiments Thus we consider only tweets occurring in the spatial region with the 11S grid zone designator a region in the US of size ca 900 002 550 km 2  We use the local machine We consider variants of SS where m is set to 50 100 and 200 In AFIA we set targeted k to 50 The 002rst week four days in May is used for warm-up and only the accuracies of the subsequent summaries are evaluated We perform topk queries on all summaries at each spatio-temporal granularity We compare the topk most frequent terms in each summary produced by AFIA and SS and compare with the corresponding topk items produced by HT We set k  20  156 


a Total number of active cells b Terms per hour per 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 cell c Terms per week per 100 002 100 km 2 cell Fig 9 Twitter Workload Intensity at Different Spatio-Temporal Granularities The results are shown in Figure 10 We measure the fraction of correct topk for varying spatial granularities and we report separate graph for each temporal granularity The coarser spatio-temporal summaries are subject to higher loads and more diverse terms At the 002nest granularity 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 in Figure 10a all approaches produce quite accurate results However as the spatial or temporal granularity gets coarser the accuracy of SS deteriorates Increasing m does not solve the problem but just postpones it On the other hand AFIA is virtually as accurate as HT at all spatial and temporal granularities Its Aggressive Increment procedure is effective in making it adapt its number of counters as needed to capture the most frequent items very accurately Due to checkpointing when several summaries have to be merged few topk terms are missed and we did not observe accuracies below 0.99 0.98 and 0.97 for hours days and weeks respectively Figure 11 reports the average number of counters maintained per summary in the same experiment Note the logscaled y-axis The 002gure con\002rms the impracticality of using HT in large scale scenarios SS maintains a 002xed number of counters The 002gure shows how AFIA adapts At hours and days Figures 11a\22611b AFIA follows SS  m  100  implying that on average 100 counters is enough to achieve the desired accuracy At weeks Figures 11c the adaptivity of AFIA is even clearer for 002ner cells it uses much fewer counters than for coarser cells This experiment shows how AFIA achieves the best of two worlds accuracy is at the level of HT which is 100 accurate while the space requirements are at the level of SS with a small number of counters Having demonstrated the accuracy of our approach we proceed to large scale performance experiments on the HMC machine E Varying targeted k In this experiment we vary targeted k and consider two cases where the 002nest spatial granularity is 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 and 1 002 1 km 2  For each case we also maintain all the coarser granularities Figure 12 shows the results AFIA always has a throughput of more than 13,000 items per second Figure 12a As expected the throughput increases as either targeted k decreases or the 002nest granularity becomes more coarse Figure 12b shows how the memory consumption increases with increasing targeted k  This is because increasing numbers of counters have to be maintained to guarantee correctness when there are more terms The memory consumption increases slowly at 002rst due to fewer checkpoints occurring Figure 12c Thus for small values of targeted k  much of the space consumption is due to checkpoints As expected more memory is required for maintaining 002ner granularities The results show that a single HMC machine can maintain between 2 and 3 months of data meaning that it takes 4 to 6 machines to support a full year At current costs 1  this is feasible for larger companies Note that the measured memory consumption represents the entire Java heap memory used by the application The actual aggregates not shown require much less When targeted k is set to a low value the number of required counters will most often also be low With only a few counters any small change in activity of a cell may impact the targeted k counters resulting in a checkpoint Therefore we see that the number of checkpoints decreases with targeted k  Having a high number of counters makes a cell more robust to changes in activity and any small changes can be captured without checkpoints The number of checkpoints increases as expected when a 002ner granularity is maintained F Varying Q:R and Q:T We 002x targeted k at 100 and vary the spatial and temporal extents of the queries We employ the two query sets and measure the average runtime Figures 13a and 13b show the results Retrieving a summary requires one or more constant time lookups in Algorithm 3 Line 3 depending on the spatial or temporal granularity of the query and it may also require the merging of checkpointed summaries Because 002ner granularity cells generally receive fewer items than coarser granularity cells the runtime is lower at 002ner granularities Fewer merges are required because more cells are empty The results show that this applies to both the spatial and the temporal granularities When the spatial extent increases more lookups are performed resulting in an expected higher runtime With more coarse temporal granularities more merges are performed increasing the runtime further The runtime is not made worse  1 The price for a Spot Instance in June 2013 was USD 0.343 per hour 157

Fig 14 Checkpoints Over Time V C ONCLUSIONS We present a new framework for the processing of spatiotemporally constrained topk most popular terms queries on streaming spatio-temporally tagged text content such as microblog posts The framework's index extends existing techniques for counting frequent items in summaries to allow the summaries to grow and shrink dynamically to adapt to changes in the incoming data Query processing works by merging relevant summaries To provide guarantees about the query results a new merging algorithm is proposed that supports spatio-temporal query regions Experimental studies with an implementation of the framework offers insight into the accuracy scalability and performance of the processing of incoming data and queries and they demonstrate that the framework is capable of offering very accurate query results at high performance at scale A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported in part by the MADALGO research center and in part by the

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
