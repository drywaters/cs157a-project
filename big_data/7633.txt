Abstract \227 The problem of Big Data in cyber security \(i.e., too much network data to analyze\ compounds itself every day. Our approach is based on a fundamental characteristic of Big Data an overwhelming majority of the network traffic in a traditionally secured enterprise i.e using defense-in-depth is non-malicious Therefore one way of eliminating the Big Data problem in cyber security is to ignore the overwhelming majority of an enterprise's non-malicious network traffic and focus only on the smaller amounts of suspicious or malicious network traffic. Our approach uses simple clustering along with a dataset enriched with known malicious domains i.e anchors to accurately and quickly filter out the non-suspicious network traffic. Our algorithm has demonstrated the predictive ability to accurately filter out approximately 97 depending on the algorithm used\ of the non-malicious data in millions of Domain Name Service DNS queries in minutes and identify the small percentage of unseen suspicious network traffic. We demonstrate that the resulting network traffic can be analyzed with traditional reputation systems blacklists or in-house threat tracking sources we used virustotal.com to identify harmful domains that are being accessed from within the enterprise network Specifically our results show that the method can reduce a dataset of 400k query-answer domains with complete malicious domain ground truth down to only 3 containing 99% of all malicious domains. Further, we demonstrate that this capability scales to 10 million query-answer pairs which it can reduce by 97% in less than an hour I INTRODUCTION The ever-increasing expansion of interconnection among computer networks is responsible for creating the conditions that allow for our rising global cyber security threat exposure At the same time improvements in technology and infrastructure have led us to create another problem for ourselves the problem of Big Data Accordingly it is necessary for cyber security professionals to design and implement novel methods to efficiently and effectively mitigate cyber security threats in a Big Data environment The Domain Name Service DNS is the network protocol that maps human-readable domain names to IP addresses that machines can use to route packets across the Internet DNS packets flow continuously between network-connected devices and comprise massive amounts of data Because it is known to contain vulnerabilities the DNS protocol is a common attack vector for malicious actors This threat coupled with the sheer size of the DNS traffic that a typical enterprise receives, is too overwhelming for analysts to spend sufficient time evaluating As such malicious traffic can easily slip between the cracks We propose that traditional methods can be augmented with novel machine learning methods to drastically reduce the amount of traffic to analyze especially since the vast majority of packets sent and received are non-malicious The contribution of this paper is that we demonstrate through experimentation that by simply: \(1\ extracting features from raw passive DNS data, and \(2\ injecting a small amount of known malicious domains to encourage cluster creation a filtering scheme can be developed to quickly and accurately filter out approximately 97 depending on the clustering algorithm used of the typically non-malicious DNS queries/responses in an enterprise network The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we discuss related works In Section III we explain our passive DNS dataset. In Section IV, we describe the clustering algorithms used and in Section V we describe our Big Data Reduction algorithm. We explain our experimental evaluation in Section VI and discuss our results in Section VII. Finally, in Section VIII we summarize the paper and discuss future work II RELATED  WORK Semi-supervised learning is a subclass of machine learning that makes use of both a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data It has been used in various areas from image recognition to game theory. We believe the works that are most related to our approach focus on using semi-supervised methods to detect cyber threats or methods that use machine learning to detect threats to DNS A Semi-supervised Learning to Detect Cyber Threats Semi-supervised learning has gained popularity only in the last few years but it has proven to be a valuable tool in applications where the data are plentiful but the labels are difficult or expensive to obtain Supervised learning in domains where labels are hard to obtain is problematic because many labels are needed. Unsupervised methods do not require labels however they are prone to frequent false Using Semi-supervised Machine Learning to Address the Big Data Problem in DNS Networks Lanier Watkins and Sean Beck Johns Hopkins University Information Security Institute Baltimore, MD USA Jared Zook, Anna Buczak and Jeffery Chavis Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory Laurel, MD, USA William H.

a larms. In Chiu et al. [1   s e m i s u p e r v i s e d  le a r n in g  i s  u s e d  to  reduce the false alarm rate up to 85 of a Snort-based Intrusion Detection System \(IDS In Chen et al 2   r e s e a r c h e r s  d e m o n s tr a te d  t h a t c u s to m  semi-supervised algorithms were able to outperform both supervised and unsupervised learning methods for intrusion detection They found a marked improvement in accuracy when classifying unknown attack types compared with traditional purely supervised methods Additionally their semi-supervised clustering method yielded a significant performance improvement over a purely unsupervised method Wang et al 3  d e m o n s tr a t e d  a  s ig n i f ic a n t p e r f o r m a n c e  improvement when using semi-supervised learning to perform network traffic clustering. Data points found in network traffic flows form relationships that can be expressed as constraints By using semi-supervised learning methods to take advantage of this quality researchers were able to improve both classification accuracy and cluster purity In Ritter et al. [4  s e m i s u p e r v is e d  le a r n i n g  is  u s e d  to  tr a c k  in realtime an overwhelming amount of data coming from Twitter for security related events  Based on a small set of seed examples and a regularization approach to semisupervised learning in which only positive and unlabeled data is used the authors were able to demonstrate promising performance gains Li et al 5  u s e d  a  tr a n s d u c tiv e  s u p p o r t v e c to r  m a c h i n e  TSVM\ algorithm to detect phishing webpages.  The authors were able to demonstrate improved accuracy with TSVM over a classical support vector machine \(SVM\ algorithm Our approach is similar in that we use semi-supervised learning to analyze Internet-based network traffic however the distinctions are that we look solely at DNS traffic use unmodified standard clustering algorithms and use a purely semi-supervised solution without any added supervised methods. These differences allow our method to: require very little labeled data be very fast near real-time and be noncomputationally intense without compromising accuracy B DNS Threat Detection The detection of generated names is not a new topic and thus it is a popular technique for identifying malicious domains. In Yadav et al., the researchers use both distance and linear regression to successfully detect generated names [6   I n  Antonakakis et al the researchers used both clustering and classification algorithms to detect known and previously unknown generated domain names 7   S c h ia v o n i e t a l  u s e s  string and IP-based features to characterize  domain-generated algorithms \(DGAs\ and associate them with botnets [8   Some generated names detection techniques for tunneling involve n-grams, which use character analysis to examine the data in requests and responses of DNS traffic. The authors in Born and Gustafson use character frequency analysis to detect tunneling Moreover they found that most domain and subdomain names match character frequencies of the English language [9    Again, our approach is similar in that we also use machine learning and the DNS query name in our analysis, but we also focus on other aspects of the DNS traffic beside the query name. Even in our use of the query name, there is a difference in that we use the Shannon Entropy  as an extracted feature instead of the n-gram approach These differences allow our approach to identify threats that attempt to mask themselves by using non-generated names and be non-computationally intense III CAPTURING  PASSIVE  DNS  DATA Our datasets are comprised of captured passive DNS pDNS\ data, which are answers \(e.g., IP address, time to live TTL record counts from authoritative DNS servers given domain name queries from the browsers of users within the Johns Hopkins University JHU network We collected two datasets, one small \(i.e., 400,000 query-answer pairs or rows and one large i.e 184 million query-answer pairs or rows We use the small dataset in its entirety \(Section VI.B\, and we extract a subset of the large dataset totaling 1 million rows Section VI.C\. Finally, we extract another subset of the large dataset totaling 10 million rows Section VI.D The rows in each dataset contained meta-data for a query-answer pair \(i.e a query from the browser and an answer from the authoritative DNS server Specifically the university network engineers used tshark to capture the fields in Table 1 from a major point of egress in the network Due to limitations imposed to achieve IRB approval 13   s e v e r a l f ie ld s  w e r e  o m itte d   including the IP address and any other fields that could be used to identify users We did not include a discussion of Exposure [18  in  S e c tio n  II because it uses purely supervised machine learning however we leveraged some of the feature types from their work to ensure that we are capturing a robust set of domain behaviors, namely DNS domain name, TTL, and DNS answer based features According to 18   D N S  d o m a i n  n a m e  b a s e d  features should help to discern easily readable names from those less easy to read \(computer generated domain names are likely indicators of malicious domains\. We decided to use the Shannon Entropy of the query name. Next, TTL based features can help to discern between high availability i.e high TTL values are likely indicators of malicious domains and low availability websites Finally DNS answer-based features come from the authoritative DNS server The authors in 18  used mostly IP-based calculations but since our dataset was anonymized this was not possible instead we used features that focused on capturing the behavior of the attributes of the returned data. These features are listed in Table 1 Table 1.

Then, only the insp ired clusters are kept which likely contain unknown domains that  from a DNS name, TTL value, and DNS answer perspective, be have like known bad domains. This approach allows the me thod to filter out 97 of the non-suspicious domains and ke ep the suspicious 3 IV  CLUSTERING  ALGORITHMS  AND  PERFORMANCE  METRICS The Affinity Propagation AP algorithm develops cl usters by using message passing between samples until the algorithm converges Also it identifies exemplars in the dat a representative of the clusters to be developed Thi s approach allows the AP algorithm to determine its own cluste rs instead of requiring the number of clusters to be identifie d by the user 10    The Mean Shift \(MS\ algorithm uses centroids derive d from the mean of the distances of the points within a gi ven region The algorithm also auto-determines the number of cl usters needed. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge, bu t it is not highly scalable due to its necessity to make multip le nearest-neighbor searches during execution [11   The k-Means algorithm requires the number of cluste rs to be specified by the user. It initially assigns poin ts to clusters at random, but then it iteratively reassigns points ba sed on their Euclidian distance to the centroid of each cluster 12    We use Sensitivity as a measure of the accuracy of each of the algorithms described above Sensitivity is defi ned in Equation 1 as the ratio of the True Positives to th e sum of the True Positives and the False Negatives. The True Po sitives are the correctly identified malicious domains and the  False Negatives are the domains that are malicious but we re incorrectly identified as non-malicious    n\r\r n\r\r\r\r\r      1  We use this metric to compare the performance of th e clustering algorithms used in this paper. In our ca lculation of this metric, we do not use the number of predicted suspicious domains; instead, we use our knowledge of the groun d truth in the small dataset We submitted every domain in the  small dataset to virustotal.com and documented the result ing ratings which gave us ground truth on the number of malicio us domains i.e those that have a virustotal.com rat ing greater than zero\. We use this ground truth to calculate t he number of False Negatives After a run of our Algorithm 1 th e input dataset is reduced to approximately 3 depending o n the clustering scheme used of its original size this resulting 3 is the predicted suspicious domains. The predicted suspicious domains are compared with the malicious domains as previously identified by virustotal.com The matche s are the True Positives and the False Negatives are calcula ted by subtracting the number of malicious domains \(from t he ground truth from the True Positives In summary our Sen sitivity metric is the ratio of the number of True Positives  to the number of ground truth malicious domains V  BIG  DATA  REDUCTION  ALGORITHM One of the main contributions of this paper is the claim that the Big Data problem in cyber security can be reduc ed using our approach. Our algorithm can be described as fol lows  Algorithm 1 1\ Parse the Big Data dataset into reasonable size batches 2\ Use a fixed sliding window \(with the size as a multiple of 50 enriched with known malicious domains i.e  anchors\ in the ratio 2:48 \(for anchors to unlabele d data\ to iteratively process each batch 3\ Submit each window to one of three standard clu stering schemes \(i.e., k-Means, AP, and MS\ and keep only c lusters containing an anchor After all batches have been processed, the resulting clusters would have reduce d the Big Data dataset by approximately 97 depending on the  clustering algorithm used 4 Use reputation services on the remaining 3 of the original Big Data dataset to identify the malicious domains VI  EXPERIMENTAL  EVALUATION A  Experimental Setup The experiments were performed on a Big Data platfo rm Figure 1 hosted at the Johns Hopkins University A pplied Physics Laboratory JHU/APL The passive DNS query answer pair datasets were captured via tshark  from JHUís Homewood Campus and anonymized We used the python Scikit-Learn library for the MS AP and k-Means cl ustering algorithms Lastly we used custom scripts to prepr ocess the data for VirusTotal.com ratings, to calculate Shannon Entropy  and any other data or file manipulations necessary  
 


 B  Semi-Supervised Algorithm Comparisons: Malicious Domain Detection We used our Big Data platform to process 400,000 qu eryanswer pairs Then we used custom scripts to perfo rm the following steps 1 preprocess the data by submitt ing all of the domain names to VirusTotal.com \(VT\ to get a ra ting, \(2 select 20 domains with a VT rating above 1, save th em into a file \(i.e., anchors\, and remove them from the over all dataset 3 perform feature extraction on the anchor file a nd the overall dataset, \(4\ read in two domains from the a nchor file at random for every 48 domains read in from the overa ll unlabeled dataset and we vary this window size fro m 50 to 300 5 submit these windows from 50ñ300 to thre e different clustering algorithms MS AP and k-Mean s and 6 calculate the Sensitivity Section IV and docu ment the run-time contents of all clusters containing ancho rs and the window size for each clustering algorithm C  Semi-Supervised Algorithm Comparisons: Run-Time and  Number of Predicted Suspicious Domains \(1 million q ueryanswer pairs The procedure for these experiments is the same as the procedure in Section VI.B except we used a slightl y larger dataset i.e 1 million query-answer pairs and w e did not perform Step 1 and thus did not calculate the Sensi tivity In these experiments, we focused on documenting and co mparing the run-time and the number of domains predicted to  be suspicious D  Case Study: Identifying Malicious Domains in Near-R eal Time \(10 million query-answer pairs The procedure for these experiments is very similar  to the procedure in Section VI.B except we used a much la rger dataset i.e 10 million query-answer pairs that was divided into several batches. Specifically, we performed St eps 2 and 3 exactly chose two window sizes a small 50 and a  larger size \(300   a n d  s u b m i t t e d  t h e m  t o  t h e  A P  a n d  M S  a l gorithms These parameters were chosen to evaluate the abilit y of our method to produce near real-time results The resul t of the case study was a list of predicted malicious domain s   Figure 1. Big data platform VII  RESULTS  AND  DISCUSSION We developed an algorithm to reduce the Big Data pr oblem in cyber security to a manageable stream of data T hen we designed an apparatus to test and evaluate this alg orithm In the following sections we discuss the detection ab ility runtime and filtering abilities, and the real world ap plicability of our algorithm A  Small Dataset: Malicious Domain Detection Ability Tables 2 through 4 illustrate that given our approa ch and a small dataset i.e 400,000 query-answer pairs s tandard clustering algorithms can be used to sift through D NS traffic quickly to identify the 3 or less of the data that  likely contains suspicious or malicious domains Furthermo re because we had ground truth on the actual number of  malicious domains in the small dataset we can conf idently state that this approach provides the ability to ac curately identify potential threats buried within many non-t hreats. The accuracy of detection is measured by the Sensitivit y of the technique, which increases as the window size incre ases for all three algorithms  Table 2.

The AP algorithm shows slightly larger s uspicious results in this small dataset however in larger d atasets the AP algorithm chooses much smaller suspicious result s However the sensitivity of the AP algorithm is low  even at higher window sizes B  Medium Dataset: Run-time and Filtering Ability Given a slightly larger dataset \(i.e., 1 million qu ery-answer pairs it becomes apparent that the AP algorithm y ields a smaller set of suspicious results at higher window sizes Specifically, the AP algorithm:  \(1\ determines the number of clusters to use automatically unlike the k-Means a lgorithm 2\ can execute at a reasonable run-time if the win dow size is chosen properly \(Figure 2\, just like the other alg orithms, and 3 predicts a significantly lower number of potent ially malicious or suspicious domains In applications wh ere the size of the data reduction is critical the AP algo rithm is a better choice Figure 3 but as stated earlier if  sensitivity is critical, then the MS or k-Means algorithms are bet ter choice C  Large Dataset: Real-World Applicability In the last set of experiments we assumed that run time was the most critical aspect JHU/APL could be consider ed a medium-sized enterprise and its network processes approximately 10 million DNS requests per hour We used these parameters as a case study and designed an op erating model of our approach around this case study  Figure 2. Run-time comparison using 1M row dataset   Figure 3 Comparison of the number of suspicious do mains predicted using 1M row dataset  Our results appear in Table 5 for the k-Means, AP and MS algorithms with runtimes under 5 minutes A five-mi nute runtime would allow 10 batches of 1 million domains  to be processed in less than 1 hour The resulting suspic ious domains were less than 2% \(~150,000 domains\ of the overall traffic for the k-Means algorithm or a 98% dataset reduction less than 2% \(~170,000 domains\ of the overall traf fic for the AP algorithm or a 98 dataset reduction and about 8 840,000 domains\ of the overall traffic for the M S algorithm or a 92 dataset reduction We submitted these susp icious domains to a reputation system i.e virustotal.co m that yields 298 domains with virustotal.com ratings abov e zero The top three threats are listed in Table 6 The co ntribution here is that we used 20 examples of known bad domai ns with virustotal.com ratings as high as 3 and found unsee n examples as high as 5 These malicious domains in Table 6 al ong with the other 295 domains could be piped into a securit y information and event management SIEM system like  ArcSight for a cyber-analyst to further investigate  The point here is that this experiment demonstrates  the feasibility of using our method in a real-world sce nario. Based on this case study 10 million domains could be ana lyzed in less than 1 hour. This is done by Algorithm 1 reduc ing this 10 million record dataset by 98 and likely very accur ately identifying the malicious domains contained within   Table 5.

 VIII  SUMMARY  AND  FUTURE  WORK In this paper we outlined a semi-supervised machine  learning approach for managing the ever-growing pro blem of Big Data in cyber security. In analyzing the data we focused on DNS traffic applying our approach to sift throu gh DNS requests to identify the smaller percentage of susp icious network traffic present on the network We did this  by applying standard clustering algorithms to a datase t enriched with known malicious domains to filter out the majo rity of non-malicious network traffic, thus allowing us to focus on a manageable set of data that likely contained suspic ious or malicious domains. The key to our approach is that we inspire clustering algorithms to cluster around the DNS nam e-based TTL value-based and DNS query answer-based behavio r of known bad domains Then we only keep these inspire d clusters and they become the reduced dataset of su spicious results Future endeavors in this regard include the followi ng 1 improving the level of filtering of non-malicious d ata to provide the analysts an even smaller set of candida te data to investigate 2 exploring issues of scale to deter mine if this approach works for even exponentially larger data s ets 3 exploring the idea of integrating this approach as a first-order data reducer as a part of an ensemble approach to d ata management specifically this semi-supervised metho d could be used as a front-end processor for a supervised m ethod such as our previous work 17     4   e x p l o r i n g  t h e  a p p l i cation of this approach to other cyber data types beyond DNS  and 5 investigating sensitivity as a function of number o f anchors  Acknowledgement  This material is based upon work funded and supported by the Department of Defense u nder Contract No FA8721-05-C-0003 with Carnegie Mellon University for the operation of the Software Engine ering Institute, a federally funded research and developm ent center References herein to any specific commercial produc t process or service by trade name trade mark manu facturer or otherwise does not necessarily constitute or im ply its endorsement recommendation or favoring by Carnegi e Mellon University or its Software Engineering Insti tute Distribution Statement A  T h i s  m a t e r i a l  h a s  b e e n  a pproved for public release and unlimited distribution Plea se see Copyright notice for non-US Government use and dist ribution DM-0004296 IX  REFERENCES 1  C Chiu et al Semi-supervised learning for false  alarm reduction,î in Advances in Data Mining: Applications and Theoretical Aspects  Volume 6171 of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science Berlin Germany 2010 p p 595-605 2  C Chen et al Semi-supervised learning methods f or network intrusion detection,î in IEEE Proceedings of the International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics 2008 3  Y Wang et al A novel semi-supervised approach for network traffic clustering in IEEE Proceedings of the International Conference on Network and System Secu rity NSS 2011 4  A Ritter et al Weakly Supervised Extraction of Computer Security Events from Twitter,î in Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web 2015, Florence, Italy, 2015, pp. 896-905 5  Y Li et al A semi-supervised learning approach for detection of phishing webpages,î in Optik - International Journal for Light and Electron Optics Volume 124, Issue 23, 2013, pp 6027ñ6033 6  S Yadav et al Detecting algorithmically generat ed malicious domain names in ACM SIGCOMM Conference on Internet Measurements  Melbourne Australia, 2010, pp. 48-61 7  M.
