Currently Apriori algorithms play a major role in identifying frequent item set and deriving rule sets out of it. But it uses the conjun ctive nature of association rules and the single minimum support factor to generate the effective rules. However the above two factors are alone not adequate to derive useful rules effectively. Hence in the proposed algorithm we have taken Apriori Algorithm as a reference and included disjunctive rules and multiple minimum supports also to capture all possible useful rules. Although few algorithms [4  r e  dealing the disjunctive rules and multiple minimum supports separately to some extent, the proposed concept is to integrate all into one that lead to a robust algorithm. And the salient feature of our work is introducing Genetic Algorithm \(GA\ in deriving possible Association Rules from the frequent item set in an optimized manner. Besides we have taken one more add-on factor ‘Lift Ratio’ which is to validate the generated Association rules are strong enough to infer useful information. Hence this new approach aims to put together the above points to generate an efficient algorithm with appropriate modification in Apriori Algorithm so that to offer interesting/useful rules in an effective and optimized manner with the help of Genetic Algorithm Keywords-Apriori; Genetic Algorithm; Lift ratio; Multiple Minimum Support;  Disjunctive Rules I   I NTRODUCTION  A  Association rule mining in Data Mining  Data mining is the task to mining the useful meaningful information from data warehouse. It is the source of inexplicit purely valid, and potentially useful and important knowledge from large volumes of natural data [8  T h e sel e ct e d k n o w led g e  must be not only precise but also readable, comprehensible and ease of understanding There are a many of data mining task such as ARs sequential patterns, Classification, clustering, time series, etc and there have been lots of techniques and algorithms for these tasks and different types of data in data mining. When the data consist continuous values, it becomes hard to mine the data and some special techniques need to be prepared. Association rule basically use for finding out the useful patterns, relation between items found in the database of transactions [9   Association rule mining generally experimented to find all rules that satisfy user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence constraints [3 The important factor that makes association rule mining practical and useful is the minsup. It is used to limit the number of rules generated. However, using only a single minsup implicitly assumes that all items in the data are of the same nature and/or have similar frequencies in the database. This is often not the case in real-life applications. In many applications, some items appear very frequently in the data while others rarely appear. If the frequencies of items vary a great deal, we will encounter two problems 1. If minsup is set too high, we will not find those rules that involve infrequent items or rare items in the data 2. In order to find rules that involve both frequent and rare items, then minsup to be kept very low. However, this may produce too many rules So when one common support is fixed as minimum support for all the items, the rules which are not frequent occur but majorly contributing towards profit may get lost without notice For example, in a supermarket transaction data, in order to find rules involving those infrequently purchased items such as food processor and cooking pan \(they generate more profits per item\ery minimum support needs to be set ; but due to this the unwanted and rare items will not be get pruned. Hence fixing multiple minimum support for each items have become significant B  Conjunctive and Disjunctive rules  Association rule mining deals conjunctive rules majorly. A con-junctive association rule is an implication in the form of X Y, where X \(the antecedent rule\and Y \(the consequent rule\re sets of items, and X Y But using disjunctive rules, extensive rule sets which are very much useful in mining the dataset can be found out effectively At times disjunctive rule sets are also preferred to infer interesting rules. For example ideal rule set for the below query  If classes B or C or D are committed, what is the chance that A is also committed would be B OR C OR D A   


2013 International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Informatics and Mobile Engineering \(PRIME\         91   C  Apriori Algorithms and Genetic Algorithms  The Apriori Algorithm an influential algorithm for mining frequent item sets for Boolean association rules Apriori Algorithms works on the below two factors i\. Generate all large item sets that satisfy minsup. ii Generate all association rules that satisfy minimum confidence minconf\ using the large item sets Two user-defined thresholds for association rules are called minimal support and minimal confidence. Supports of an association rule is defined as the percentage/fraction of records that contain XUY to the total number of records in the database or repository. Confidence C of an association rule is defined as the percentage/fraction of the number of transactions that contain XUY to the total number of records that contain X. If s and c exceed minimal support and minimal confidence values respectively, then the association rule X Y must be induced In the proposed approach Apriori approach to find out the frequent item sets and incorporate Genetic Algorithm to derive the association rules from it Besides support and confident factors are not adequate to validate the rule sets. Hence here another factor i.e. Lift- is suggested to analyse and validate the effectiveness of the rules Because confident’ only focuses on the antecedent not the consequent D  Lift Ratio A high value of confidence suggests a strong association rule. However this can be deceptive because if the antecedent and/or the consequent have a high support, we can have a high value for confidence even when they are independent. A better measure to judge the strength of an association rule is to compare the confidence of the rule with the benchmark value where we assume that the occurrence of the consequent item set in a transaction is independent of the occurrence of the antecedent for each rule. This benchmark can be found out from the frequency counts of the frequent item sets. The benchmark confidence value for a rule is the support for the consequent divided by the number of transactions in the database. This enables to compute the lift ratio of a rule. The lift ratio is the confidence of the rule divided by the confidence assuming independence of consequent from antecedent. A lift ratio greater than 1.0 suggests that there is some usefulness to the rule. The larger the lift ratio, the greater is the strength of the association. With the lift value, the importance of a rule can be validated in an effective manner. However no minimum lift in the settings similar to minimum support or minimum confidence can be set. The lift is a value between 0 and infinity. A high value of confidence suggests a strong association rule A better measure to judge the strength of an association rule is to compare the confidence of the rule with the benchmark value where the assumption is that to assume the occurrence of the consequent item set in a transaction is independent of the occurrence of the antecedent for each rule. The benchmark can be found out from the frequency counts of the frequent item sets. The benchmark confidence value for a rule is the support for the consequent divided by the number of transactions in the database. The lift ratio is the confidence of the rule divided by the confidence assuming independence of consequent from antecedent. A lift ratio greater than 1.0 suggests that there is some usefulness to the rule. The larger the lift ratio, the greater is the strength of the association Confidence and Life factors are calculated as below  A in  items  the containing  ons transacti of  No C  and A in  items  the of  all  containing  ons transacti of  No Confidence    A  of Support AUC  of Support      ons transacti of  no  To t al  items  consequent  the having  ons transacti of  No Confidence  Expected  Hence  Confidence  Expected Confidence Lift   The above factor can also be included while validating any rule set E  Disjunctive Rules Let X = {i1, i2...in} be a set of items. XC = {i1 AND i2 AND … AND i n} or simply {i1i2...in}  is a conjunctive term of X, and XD = {i 1 OR i2 OR OR in} is a Disjunctive term of X. The possible rule is of one of the following types involving conjunctive and disjunctive terms from the set of items X U Y| X  Y 2  TABLE I   Type Support Confidence  Xc  Yc s = P\(XC U YC c = P\(YC | XC Xc  YD s = P\(XC U YD c = P\(YC | XD XD  Yc s = P\(XD U YC c = P\(YD | XC XD  YD s = P\(XD U YD c = P\(YD| XD  F  Rule sets List XY Z  VW  type XC  YC XY Z  V OR W type XC  YD X OR Y OR Z  VW type XD  YC X OR Y OR Z  V OR W        - type XD  YD The number of rules that are found by the Associations mining function can be reduced by using rule filters if the number of frequent item sets is high. Rule filters are a powerful way to limit the amount of rules to be generated or the content of the rules. This parameter determines the maximum number of items that occur in an association rule. In the above table maximum rule length is 5 and maximum antecedent allowed is 3; the maximum consequents allowed are 2. But in the example the filters are not used as the number of frequent items are only 3\(A, C, E 


2013 International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Informatics and Mobile Engineering \(PRIME\         92   G  Multiple Minimum Supports In many data mining applications [4  som e item s app e a r  very frequently in the data, while others rarely appear. If minsup is set too high, those rules that involve rare items will not be found. To find rules that involve both frequent and rare items, minsup has to be set very low. This may cause combinatorial explosion because those frequent items will be associated with one another in all possible ways. The disadvantage of support is the rare item problem. Items that occur very infrequently in the data set are pruned although they would still produce interesting and potentially valuable rules The rare item problem is important for transaction data which usually have a very uneven distribution of support for the individual items E.g., Consider four items A, B and C in a database. If the minimum support count is 10 %, then we may lose the rule set AB if it had support 7% .But assume now we have multiple minimum item supports are   MIS \(A\ = 20 MIS \(B\= 3  MIS\(C\ = 4  And their actual supports: {A 18%, B 4%, C 3 Then the rule AB is not discarded as it satisfies the rule min MIS \(A, B\\in \(Support \(A<B Hence there could be a modification in Apriori algorithm accordingly II  P SEUDO CODE FOR THE PROPOSED A LGORITHM  Input A set  of n transaction data T , a set of p items to be purchased , each item ti, with a minimum support value mi, i=1 to p , and a minimum confidence value Output A set of association rules in the criterion of the maximum values of minimum supports Procedure  Step 1 Calculate actual support of each item t k  k=1..p.

GA is stochastic search algorithm modelled on the process of natural selection which underlines biological evolution. GA has been successfully applied in many search, optimization, and machine learning problems.GA works in an iteration manner by generating new populations of strings from old ones. Every string is the encoded binary, real etc., version of a candidate solution .An evaluation function associates a fitness measure to every string indicating its fitness for the problem. This type of representation is relative to position. Presence of 1 at ith position indicates occurrence of the item in transaction[i   Similarly presence of 0 at jth position indicates absence of item in transaction   For example Bit pattern for A can be given as 1010101111 based on its availability in the transactions in table V.

This section describes three operators of Genetic Algorithms that were used in GA algorithm: selection, crossover and mutation 1\ Selection: The selection operator chooses a chromosome in the current population according to the fitness function and copies it without changes into the new population.GA algorithm used route wheel selection where the fittest members of each generation are more chance to select 2\ Crossover: The crossover operator, according to a certain probability, produces two new chromosomes from two selected chromosomes by swapping segments of genes 3\ Mutation: The mutation operator is used for maintaining diversity. During the mutation phase and according to mutation probability, 0.005 in GA algorithm value of each gene in each selected chromosome is changed III  C ONCLUSION  This paper proposed an integrated algorithm for useful and effective association rule mining to capture rare but not frequent items; using generic algorithm to derive all possible conjunctive& disjunctive rules sets using genetic algorithm; lift factor to analyse the strength of derived rules.

In future it is planned to integrate UML model /multi level data mining to analyse the dataset based on their hierarchy before they get into the algorithm. Besides planning to identify the redundant item sets in the early stage to avoid the time taken during rule set generation.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con“gurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con“gure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef“ciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/˜manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
