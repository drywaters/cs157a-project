Results acquired from an internal Failure Modes and Effects Analysis \(FMEA\udy identified turnto-turn winding faults as the primary mechanism, or mode of failure. Physics-of-failure mechanisms used to develop a model for the identified fault are provided. The model was 
implemented in Simulink to simulate the dynamics of the motor with a turn-to-turn insulation winding fault. Then, an experimental test procedure was devised and executed to validate the model. Additionally, a diagnostic feature identified by the fault model and derived using Hilbert transforms, was validated using the Simulink model and experimental data for several fault dimensions. Next, a feature extraction routin e preprocesses monitoring parameters and passes the resulting features to a particle filter. The particle filter, based on Bayesian estimation theory, allows for representation and management of uncertainty in a computationally efficient manner.

This paper proposes a comprehensive approach to develop, analyze and validate novel fault diagnosis and failure prognosis algorithms and methods for anomaly detection Introduced is a novel integrated framework for fault diagnosis and failure prognosis that relies on systems engineering principles and takes advantage of physics-offailure models, Bayesian estimation methods and measurements acquired through seeded fault testing and/or on-board the aircraft. The proposed Bayesian estimation framework for diagnosis and prognosis for nonlinear, nonGaussian systems begins w ith a systems engineering process to identify critical components and their failure models, sensing and monitoring requirements and processing algorithms.  Fundamental to this approach is the development of physics-based fa ilure or fatigue models and the optimum selection and extraction of features or Condition Indicators \(CIs raw data that form the characteristic signatures of sp ecific fault modes. The latter are selected on the basis of such criteria as sensitivity to particular fault modes and their correlation to ground truth data.  The proposed framework employs a nonlinear statespace model of the plant, i.e. critical aircraft component with unknown time-varying parameters and a Bayesian estimation algorithm, called particle filtering, to estimate the probability density function \(PDF\of the state in real time 1 e state PDF is u s ed to p r ed ict th e ev o l u tio n  in  tim e of the fault indicator, obtaining as a result the PDF of the RUL for the faulty component/s ystem. A critical fault is detected and identified by calling on the particle filter-based module that expresses the fault growth dynamics. Prognosis has been called the Achilles\222 heel of CBM due to major challenges arising from the inherent uncertainty in prediction.

A redundant position sensor provides output shaft position to the three controllers for loop closure of each channel as well as tele metry to the controller for redundancy management. This actuator is suitable for this study since it can operate in a single channel \(simplex mode or in fully redundant, active-active-active system mode  The system is designed to employ active-active-active redundancy, providing a two-fault-tolerant system.  In the active-active-active system, a ll three motors are actively driven in a torque sharing mode where the torque applied to the load is the cumulative sum of the three motor torques A Vehicle Management Computer \(VMC\ermines the drive for each motor/channel and corresponding servo controllers. The VMC also mon itors each motor channel for failures or degraded performance, so it can shut it down when necessary  Fault Modes Results from an internal FMEA study of the EMA, shown in Figure 2, are provided in Table 3. According to the results of the study, the leading modes of failure are associated with the bearings, position feedback sensors and brushless motors.

However, according to the manufacturer, turn-to-turn winding insulation faults are most likely to occur due to the geometry of the stator winding configuration, or layout, number of windings per turn, and separation distance between different phase windings. According to 227[12 st at or i n sul a t i on can fai l  due to several reasons: high stator core or winding temperature; contamination from oil, moisture and dirt short circuit or starting stresses; electrical discharges; and leaking in the cooling system. For the EMA under investigation, winding temperature is the dominant failure mechanism due to the excessive environmental factors. As a consequence, the principle effects of a turn-to-turn winding insulation short result in a three-phase impedance imbalance in the stator windings. This leads to asymmetries in the phase currents and phase-to-neutral voltages leading to increased harmonic generation and overall performance degradation 227[14  Therefore, t h e rem a i n i ng subsections discuss methods for modeling the resulting asymmetry and a feature used to identify the corresponding imbalance 4  T HEORY  Brushless DC Motor Model The electrical diagram for a brushless DC motor can be modeled as a three-phase wye-c onnected electrical circuit as illustrated in Figure 3.

The classical im age recognition and signal processing paradigm of data information knowledge becomes most relevant and take s central stage in the fault diagnosis case, particularly since such operations must be performed on-line in a real-time environment  Fault diagnosis depends mainly on extracting a set of features from sensor data that can distinguish between fault classes of interest, detect and is olate a particular fault at its early initiation stages.

The underlying principle of the methodology is the approximation of relevant distributions with particles \(samples from the space of the unknowns and their associated weights Compared to classical MonteCarlo methods, sequential importance sampling enables particle filtering to reduce the number of samples required to approximate the distributions with necessary precision and makes it a faster and more computationally efficient approach than Monte-Carlo simulation. This is of particular benefit in diagnosis and prognosis of complex dynamic systems, such as engines, gas turbines and gearboxes because of the nonlinear natu re and ambiguity of the rotating machinery world when operating under fault conditions. Moreover, particle filtering allows information from multiple measurement sources to be fused in a principled ma  Particle Filtering in Real-Time Diagnosis Applications\227 Particle filtering has a direct application in the arena of fault detection and identification \(F DI\the current state of the system is known, it is natural to implement FDI procedures by comparing the process behavior with patterns regarding normal or faulty operating conditions A fault diagnosis procedure involves the tasks of fault detection and identification \(assessment of the severity of the fault\sense, th e proposed particle-filter-based diagnosis framework aims to accomplish these tasks, under general assumptions of non-Gaussian noise structures and nonlinearities in process dynamic models, using a reduced particle population to represent the state pdf  A compromise between model-based and data-driven techniques is accomplished by the use of a particle filterbased module built upon the nonlinear dynamic state model   18 where f b  f t  and h t  are non-linear mappings x d  t  collection of Boolean states a ssociated with the presence of a particular operating condition in the system \(normal operation, fault type #1, #2, etc x c  t of continuous-valued states that describe the evolution of the system given those operating conditions f p  t   is a feature measurement  t  v  t are non-Gaussian distributions that characterize the proce ss and feature noise signals respectively. For simplicity n  t may be assumed to be zero-mean i.i.d. uniform white noise. At any given instant of time, this framework provides an estimate of the probability masses associated w ith each fault mode, as well as a pdf estimate for meaningf ul physical variables in the system. Once this information is available within the FDI module, it is conveniently proce ssed to generate proper fault alarms and to inform about the statistical confidence of the detection routine. Furthermore pdf estimates for the system continuous-valued states \(computed at the moment of fault detection\may be used as initial conditions in failure prognostic routines, giving an excellent insight about the inherent uncertainty in the prediction problem. As a result, a swift transition between the two modules \(FDI and prognosis\ay be performed, and moreover, reliable prognosis can be achieved within a few cycles of operation after the fault is declared. This characteristic is, in fact, one of the main advantages of th e proposed particle-filter-based diagnosis framework. Customer specifications are translated into acceptable margins for the type I and/or II errors in the detection routine.

The intent is to detect a fault as early as possible after its initiation allowing for a sufficient time to track its evolution and determine the RUL of a failing component. Figure 10 depicts the major modules of the proposed architecture for an anomaly detector. In this architecture, real-time m easurements \(from sensors conveniently located and designed to respond to a large class of fault modes\nformation about the current operational mode are provided on-line. Data are preprocessed and de-noised before computing the features that will assist to efficiently monitor the behavior of the plant Statistical analysis applied to this set of features, which compare their evolution in time with respect to baseline data, is performed to simultaneously arrive at the probability of abnormal conditions, the probability of false alarms, and a simple on/off indicator. This indicator exhibits the exact time instant when th e presence of a fault can be confirmed for a given confidence level \(for example, 95%\ime and computational resources allow for further analysis, feature information can be used to complete the tasks of fault isolation, identification, and failure prognosis The modules of the architecture were evaluated using simulated phase currents generated earlier from Simulink. The results of the particle-filter based anomaly detector using the simulated data from Figure 8 are provided in Figure 11  The Particle Filter Framework for Failure Prognosis  227 Prognosis on long-term prediction of the failure evolution is based on both an accurate estimation of the current state and a model describing the fault progression. If the incipient failure is detected and isolated at the early stages of the fault initiation, it is reasonable to assume that sensor data will be available for a certain time window allowing for corrective measures to be taken. At the end of the observation window, the prediction outcome is passed on to the user operator, maintainer\tional adjustments are not feasible since corrective action must be taken to avoid a catastrophic event Corrective terms are estimated in a learning paradigm to improve model parameter estimates and/or update load profiles thus resulting in be tter accuracy and precision of the algorithm for long-term prediction. A two-level procedure is introduced to remedy this problem. It intends to reduce the uncertainty associated with long-term predictions by using the curre nt state pdf estimate, the process noise model, and a record of corrections made to previously computed predictions. In the first prognosis level, a p step ahead prediction is generated on the basis of an a priori estimate, adjusting probabilities that are associated with the predicti on according to the noise model structure. At the second prognosis level, these predictions are used to estimate the RUL pdf, also referred to as the time-to-failure \(TTF\df  Particle-filter based prognosis was demonstrated for the turn-to-turn winding insulation fault using artificial data generated from the simulation model discussed earlier.  A result showing the particle filter updates, diagnostic assessment and long-term predictions of RUL are provided in Figure 12.

The actuator test setup consists of two COTS motors where one motor simulates the actuator and the other motor provides dynamic loading. The actuator and dynamic loader are tied directly back-to-back using metal bellow couplings with a high precision torque sensor. Both motors are controlled using a digital-space-vector pulse width m odulation \(PWM sinusoidal drive. This setup allows the motor under investigation to operate unde r dynamic loading conditions for both opposing and aiding loads  Seeded Fault Insertion The fault insertion test setup simulates turn-to-turn winding insulation faults caused by thermal degradation of the insulation material. The motor chosen for the experiment has an accessible center winding tap to allow independent measurements of the phase-to-neutral voltage and phase current for each phase winding Winding faults are inserted or seeded, external to the mo tor by placing a resistor, also referred to as external fault resistance, in parallel to a selected phase winding terminal and the center tap as shown in Figure 14  To simulate varying degrees of damage, or fault dimensions, a resistor network was used to control the particular value used for the external fault resistance for a controlled amount of time. To manage the selection of applied resistor values and turn-on time, the resistor network was connected to the motor winding using highspeed power relays. The relays were controlled by a programmable micro-processor to trigger and simulate the duration and sequence of a par ticular fault. LabVIEW was used to initiate the fault insertion and synchronize the high speed data collection. This imposed minimal stress to the motor providing the capability for a repeatable and reliable seeded fault testing environment to evaluate different motor speeds and applied loads for a whole host of fault values. A graph of the experimental fault insertion profule used in this study is provided in Figure 15   Figure 15\227Experimental fault insertion profile Experimental Results Experimental results were used to validate the brushless DC motor model, the turn-to-turn winding insulation fault model, primary feature values and the anomaly detector algorithms investigated in the previous section  Feature Validation\227 The primary featur e identified in Equation 17 was calculated in real-time for experimental  Figure 12\227Example of particle filter based prognosis using artificial data Figure 13\227Actuator and Loader Experimental Setup  Figure 14\227Fault Insertion Setup

A snapshot of raw data, including the calculated feature values, is provided in Figure 16 Anomaly Detection\227 The particle filter framework was integrated into LabVIEW to evaluate the real-time performance of the anomaly detector during data acquisition. Shown in Figure 17 is a GUI developed in LabVIEW to manage the anomaly detector settings which include the false alarm rate \(type I error\and false alarm threshold \(type II error  Addi t i onal  confi gurat i on settings include the number of particles used by the particle filter, baseline statistics, fault model, and particle filter update / sample time The results from anomaly detector, using the data shown previously in Figure 16, are provided in Figure 18. The green line represents the confidence of detection based on the false alarm rate and the red line represents the alarm, or detection, threshold as defined earlier in Figure 17. The red dot designates the crossing point during which the red health-state light illuminates to indicate an anomaly has occurred 6  C ONCLUSION  This paper presented a particle-filter based anomaly detector capable of detecting the occurre nce of a major fault mode in its incipient stages for a safe ty critical aircraft actuation system. An overview of a ge neric PHM architecture were presented and applied to a particular EMA fault mode based on an internal FMEA study. The fault mode investigated in detail was a turn-to-turn winding insulation short for a brushless DC motor. The primary fault mode was modeled using physics-of-failure mechan isms indicating the primary failure effect, phase current asymmetry. A feature was derived using a Hilbert transform and statistical analysis to quantify the primary failure eff ect. Then, experimental data was acquired to validate the Simulink simulation model Finally, real-time evaluation of the anomaly detector was performed using LabVIEW  Although a specific system, an EMA, was selected as the test-platform with a specific fault mode, the overall PHM architecture can be applied to an entire range of systems and application domains. In fact, similar techniques which allow  Figure 16\227Plots of experimental data \(top computed features \(bottom experimental test setup using LabVIEW  Figure 17\227LabVIEW interface used to define particle filter settings Figure 18\227Plot of anomaly detection confidence \(top and health state indicator \(bottom\the experimental test setup using LabVIEW 


 11 for early fault detection dur ing acceptable performance in the presence of faults are being developed for a wide variety of system in both manned and unmanned air vehicles Therefore, the concept of usi ng system health information diagnosis and prognosis\n conjunction with reconfigurable control is at the forefront of modern space and avionics applications requiring increasingly sophisticated fault-tolerant systems that are robust, reliable and relatively inexpensive. Ther efore the need arises for a fault-tolerant control architecture to further maximize performance and extend the operating life of COTS components in future avionics systems A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was performed under the United States Air Force USAF\contract number FA8650-06-C-7628.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
