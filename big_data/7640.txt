Identifying frequent itemsets is one of the most important issues faced by the knowledge discovery and data mining community. There have been a number of successful algorithms developed for extracting frequent itemsets in very large databases. Frequent itemset mining leads to the discovery 
of associations and correlations among items in large transactional or relational datasets. A problem with such a process is that the solution of interesting patterns has to be performed only on frequent itemsets. Pushing constraints in frequent itemsets mining can help pruning the search space. In this paper, an efficient algorithm is proposed to integrate confidence measure during the process of mining frequent itemsets, which generates confident frequent itemsets Consequently, the suggested algorithm generates strong association rules from these confident frequent itemsets. This technique has been implemented and the experimental results show the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed 
algorithm

 I NTRODUCTION  The advances in data collection have generated an urgent need for techniques that can intelligently and automatically analyze and mine knowledge from huge amounts of data The Knowledge Discovery in Databases \(KDD\ is the process to exploit the possib ilities of extracting the knowledge implicit in the collected data. The field of KDD integrates techniques from artificial intelligence mathematics and statistics for the discovery of interesting previously unknown and potentially useful information from

The task of association rules mining usually performed into two steps [1 T h e fi r s t st ep aims at finding all frequent itemsets that satisfy the minimum support minsup 
constraint with the frequent itemset property \(any subset of a frequent itemset is frequent; if an itemset is not frequent, none of its supersets can be frequent for efficiency reasons. The second step involves generating association rules that satisfy the minimum confidence  constraint from the frequent itemsets Fundamentally, all association rules meet a threshold that defines a frequent itemset. If these association rules further meet a threshold, then they are called strong association rules[15 Se ve ra l a l g o rithm s  ha ve  b e e n  proposed to address association rules mining 13 14

Association rule mining can produce a huge amount of patterns that are most of the time not useful to the users. It is hence, impossible for an expert to assess these patterns. This is the case with the well-known Apriori algorithm [12   1 3    One of the methods used to cope with such an amount of output depends on using constrained association rules mining 3   6   1 1   17 t h a t h e l p s t o re d u c e  t h e num b e r of uninteresting discovered rules Constrained itemsets mining is a hot research theme in data mining.

algorithm computes the confidence and prunes the items that have confidence less than the threshold. Further iteration of the algorithm is performed only for the itemsets that have support and confidence higher than a user specified thresholds. These itemsets are called confident frequent itemsets. The method described in this paper pushes the confidence measure within the mining algorithm of frequent itemsets in order to eliminate search space that is uninteresting to the user or to emphasize the search space that is interesting to the user Roddick and Rice nve st i ga t e var i o us w a y s t o s e t  thresholds that define interestingness in rules, such as content dependent and independent ones and links the interest in a pattern to its low probability to occur. The work suggested by Wang, He, Cheung and  e lim ina t e  the problem of setting and find directly association rules with a threshold with the drawback that from some databases too many rules might be generated. Pei, Han and Lakshmanan [3 pro po sed a co nver t i b l e co nstr a i nt, w h i c h can be pushed deep into frequent pattern mining. Dense Miner [1 app l i e s a l l o f  and minimum improvement to constraint the search space. An incremental association rules mining algorithm that integrates shocking interestingness criterion during the process of building the model is proposed in [1 The main challenge in this paper is how to integrate the constraint of confidence measure  earlier in the mining procedure\(push this constraint deeply into the frequent itemsets generation process\ rather than using the simple approach of running a traditional algorithm then using a post-processing pass to filter the generated rules This paper is organized as follows. In Section II we briefly recall the basic concepts of association rules. The proposed algorithm for discovering strong association rules is presented in Section III. The experimental results are shown in Section IV to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. And, in Section V the conclusion and future work are described II A SSOCIATION RULE  An association rule is defined as follows Let I = {i 1 i n be a set of items, and T = {t 1 t m a set of transactions, where each transaction t i consists of a subset of items in I. An association rule is then an implication of the form A 001\027 B, A 001\031 I, B 001\031 I,  A 001 B The support for an itemset is defined as the ratio of the total number of transactions which support this itemset to the total number of transactions in the database. An itemset A has support s in T if s% of the transactions in T contains A An itemset A is frequent if its support is higher than the user specified  The confidence of rule A 001\027 B is the probability that when itemset A occurs in a transaction in T, itemset B also occurs in the same transaction. The rule A 001\027 B holds in T with confidence c if c% of transactions in T that contain A also contain B. An example of association rules is: 60% of transactions that contain coffee also contain sugar; 5% of all transactions contain both of these items. Here 60% is called the confidence of the rule, and 5% the support of the rule The problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that consist of frequent itemsets and the confidence greater than the user-specified The discovery of association rules is thus important in understanding the underlying relationships between a large numbers of possible combinations of items [15  III 
 THE  PROPOSED  ALGORITHM   The problem of mining frequent itemsets plays an essential role in mining association rules, but it is not sufficient to mine all frequent itemsets. Instead, it is sufficient to mine the set of confident frequent itemsets The proposed algorithm uses confidence measure as a constraint during the model building in order to discover association rules. Instead of using the confidence measure as a post-processing step  as in the Apriori algorithm, this measure is pushed into the mining of frequent itemsets to form a constraint in order to discover only confident frequent itemsets. For every stage of frequent itemests generation frequent sub- itemsests are generated from every frequent itemset at that stage. These frequent sub- itemsests are evaluated using confidence \(conf\easure \(use "\(1\\nd prune the frequent sub- itemsests that do not satisfy this measure resulting in a set of confident frequent itemsets in this stage    where sup.count.fre.itmst and sup.count.fre.sub-itmst is the number of transactions containing frequent itemset  and frequent sub-itemset respectively The proposed algorithm expands the current confident frequent itemsets to the next level frequent itemsets like a normal Apriori algorithm. This approach approves that only confident frequent itemsets are eligible to be candidate during the next iteration of frequent itemsets generation The confident frequent itemsets in the proposed algorithm can substantially reduce the number of patterns generated in frequent itemset mining while preserving the complete information regarding the set of frequent itemsets That is, from the set of confident frequent itemsets, we can easily derive the set of frequent itemsets and their support in further iterations Based on this, many of frequent itemsets will relate to unconfident frequent itemsets. If only confident frequent itemsets are extracted, the search space can be greatly reduced. As a result, the proposed algorithm uses the confident frequent itemsets to generate strong association rules. This can improve the quality of the extracted association rules and make them more interesting and easier to understand Figure 1 shows the proposed algorithm

WEKA is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. We used the default parameters of the Apriori algorithm to make the comparison fair. The performance of the proposed algorithm on different datasets is demonstrated below Mushroom dataset was used for this experiment. This dataset has 8124 examples, and 23 nominal attributes. Table I presents the final strong association rules discovered by the proposed algorithm with the following thresholds 0.82 and 1.00 The Apriori algorithm with 0.82 and 1.00 would generate 11 strong association rules for the Mushroom dataset Voting dataset was used for this experiment. This dataset has 435 examples, and 17 nominal attributes. From this dataset, the proposed scheme discovered 4 strong association rules with the following thresholds 0.50 and 0.70, which are given in Table II   The Apriori algorithm with 0.50 and 0.70 would generate 16 strong association rules from the Voting dataset Zoo dataset was used for this experiment. This dataset has 101 examples, and 18 attributes. The attributes were nominal. Table III presents the final strong association rules discovered by the proposed algorithm with the following thresholds 0.65 and 0.90  The Apriori algorithm with 0.65 and 0.90 would generate   24 strong association rules for the Zoo dataset In this experiment Weather dataset is used. This dataset has 14 examples, and 5 nominal attributes. The proposed algorithm generates 5 strong association rules with the following thresholds 0.20 and 0.70 as shown in Table IV  TABLE II

 In the same constraints the Apriori algorithm would generate   17 strong association rules form the Weather dataset The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is powerful and outperforms rather than substantially, the Apriori algorithm. The large number of rules generated by the Apriori algorithm makes manual inspection of the rules very difficult. Hence, automated assistance is needed. In the proposed algorithm the confidence measure is pushed in association rule mining to reduce the huge search space. So, the proposed algorithm would decrease the number of extracted association rules Figure 2 depicts the comparative performance of the two algorithms   Figure CONCLUSTION  AND  FUTURE  WORK The task of data mining is to produce interesting patterns and extract useful knowledge for human users from a database. Frequent itemsets mining is one of the most important areas of data mining. The proposed algorithm shows that integrating confidence measure during the process of mining frequent itemsets may substantially improve the performance of association rules mining by reducing the search space. The integration of confidence measure and frequent pattern growth mining into one unified framework, leads to further improvement of mining efficiency.  The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in reducing the number of discovered rules comparing with the Apriori algorithm One of the most important future research directions would be the automated discovery of interesting association rules from large datasets using multi-objective genetic algorithm R EFERENCES  1

Figure 5. Frequency plot of items in a user\220s collection, that includes people and location tags  collection. So our system is able to produce groupings that incorporate the specific characteristics of a user\220s collection Table II shows the top itemsets detected in some of the user collections, along with the corresponding ground truth user labels\ The average number of itemsets after filtering was 51, covering over 80% of the images in the collection, with images appearing in multiple top itemsets. Many of the itemsets correspond to easily determined themes, e.g., users 1,5 same location\, users 4,6,8 \(same activity\and users 7,9 related locations indicating similar activity\. The itemsets listed for users 2 ,3 appear to lack a common theme in terms of the event labels provided. Based on the correlation with ground truth event labels, the average precision of the system is 64 However, a first-party user study needs to be conducted to evaluate the user reaction to the frequent itemsets that are detected by the system but have no support in the user-provided event labels. Some of these coincidental itemsets could be interesting to the user - they may depict people in common, or have some other common thread unrelated to the event label The recall does not have much meaning for this system, as the number of potential narratives in a collection is vast and cannot be enumerated Fig. 8 shows some visual exampl es to illustrate the types of groups detected by our system. The first two rows indicate images grouped by the use of scene classifier features augmented by other features. The errors made by the 215FallFoliage\216 detector are filtered out by the use of the additional features in the itemset capturing the time of year, the lack of detected faces and the constraint of being outdoor images. The second row produces a coherent set showing water scenes, again by combining the features of water, nature, no faces and outdoors. The third and fourth rows are interesting in that pictures of the same person are grouped together without knowing their identity. In the first case, because the person was a frequent subject of indoor images showing her various activities, and in the second case because the person wore a spring/fall jacket with a distinctive color. Even though these underlying features may not directly provide a meaningful reason for grouping these images, the overall semantic link is obvious to the user viewing the groups. The fifth row gives an example of a grouping that lacks a semantic connection, mainly because all the features defining the group are too generic For the temporal recurring groups, the ground truth is more specific, as each group recurring across years has a specific meaning to the user. The average precision of our approach here is 72%. Recurring groups were deemed to be detected correctly when the majority of the events in the group were from the same recurring theme  Fig. 7 shows an example from a user collection, with the user-provided labels shown next to the groups. Note that some of the groups \(e.g. summer soccer leagues\ are not strictly calendar date-based, but are still detected because they occurred around the same week of the year for multiple years. Other examples of events that are loosely tied to the calendar but are still detected using our method includes regular vacations \(e.g., during school breaks parties/gatherings , and sporting events

Park Driving Park  VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  We have proposed a framework for mining interesting chronicles or narratives from multi-year consumer media collections, including themes related to the calendar date. The media in the collection is analyzed by a variety of algorithms to generate metadata of different types. We use metadata based on camera capture information, low-level image processing semantic image understanding, facial processing and event clustering to gather a large set of diverse metadata. The media and associated metadata are represented as a transaction database, and frequent itemset mining is employed to detect frequently occurring groups of images that share several meta             Figure 7. An example of temporal recurring groups detected data in common. A confidence and interest measure relevant to the consumer domain is used to determine the quality of the frequent itemsets, and create a  list of the top "themes" within the collection. Since a variety of metadata types are included for every media in the collection, we are able to capture a broad variety of recurring themes without a priori knowledge of the themes in a given collection. Because the system also discovers frequent patterns that the user may be unaware of, the system seems to display çintelligenté behavior by providing unexpected groupings that could not have been extracted by merely searching We also detect calendar-related recurring themes in multiyear collections. We define collections in terms of events, and represent them in an appropriate two-dimensional temporal space. We use density-based clustering followed by filtering to reduce the number of false matches in a group. Our approach detects personal special dates such as birthdays and anniversaries, seasonal activities and holidays celebrated. Since both the calendar-based groups and feature-based thematic groups detected are strictly data-driven \(with no a priori assumptions about a userês collection\ they are customized to the type of content in specific userês collections Further work in this area includes a user study to evaluate user reaction to these automatically generated narratives from their collection. Some of the user studies will focus on using the output of our method for slideshow-based reliving of a collection. We also plan to gather more collections with people and location metadata. Another direction of exploration is in improving the performance of scene, material and object classifiers by incorporating contextual information from seemingly unrelated metadata, as suggested by the frequent itemsets detected by our system. Also, further improvement of the precision of detecting recurrent themes can be obtained by incorporating the discrimination power of different features into the confidence score to avoid making groups based on generic features R EFERENCES  1  N.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
