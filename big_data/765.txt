Research and Application of ICA Technique in Fault Diagnosis for Equipments Wei Lou, Guoying Shi, Jun Zhang College of Mechanical and Electronic Engineering Shandong Agricu ltural University Taian, Shandong, China sdlouwei@126.com Abstract In order to overcome the difficulty of feature signal extraction from mixed vibration signals, a new method based on Independent Component Analysis \(ICA\ proposed to realize separation and filtering for multi-source vibration signals. ICA technique develops from blind source separation \(BSS\which solves the problems of information fusion and feature extraction of multi-sensor sign als. In this paper, firstl y the principle of ICA was briefly introduced and then a good algorithm of independent component analysis FastICA was presen ted. Secondly application in signal separation and filtering with FastICA is studied in fault diagnosis of big petr ochemical equipments Imitation examples and field experiments show that it is feasible to separate and extract feature signal from multi-source vibration signals and indicated that ICA technique is an effective method in signal preprocessing in fault diagnosis of equipments Keywords- fault diagnosis; condition monitoring; FastICA feature extraction; separation and filtering I I NTRODUCTION In industry working state of machines usually need to be monitored and faults must be diagnosed in time, in petrochemical field usi ng vibration signal to diagnose running equipments is a general and effective method [1 petrochemical running equi pments are usually complicated and the driving sources are numerous an d the sampled vibration signals are usually mixed with multi-source vibration signals and a great deal of noise. Had the original mixed signals not been preprocessed, the accuracy and particularity of diagnosis were bound to be affected. Therefore, the sampled original vibration signals tend to be preprocessed befo re diagnosing such as filtering and feature extraction so as to improve information quality for diagn osis and make good preparation for follow-up accurate diagnosis Independent Component Analysis ICA\w technique based on statis tics signal processing which developed with blind source separation. ICA can be used to extract useful information fro m original signals, which provides more abundant and useful information for the fault diagnostic system. In this paper the application based on ICA in diagnosis for petrochemical running equipments is studied ICA technique is used to prep rocess original vibration signals of petrochemical runni ng equipments. FastICA algorithm is studied and applied in separating and filtering original vibration signals for extracting fault feature signal so as to improve diagnosis accuracy of equipments II I CA T HEORY A Fundamental principle Since ICA was proposed by Jutten in 1980s it has  been used well in biology si gnals processing, mixed speech signals separation and bind so urce sepa Beca use of its advantages in bind s ource separation, ICA technique has been used in more and more fields The objects that ICA processes are mixed signals created by a set of linear combinations of statistically independent source of information. Through ICA algorithm independent signal components are extracted from the mixed signals As to itself, ICA is a kind of new statistical signal processing method which can be presented as follow The fundamental goal of ICA technique is to find a linear transformation in order that the transformed signals are statistically independent as far as possible. Assume x is the observed value corresponding to m dimension discrete time signal T 2 1      m x x x x   which is also the linear combination of the source signal T 2 1      n s s s s    As x  1 Where x is the vector of observed signal s the vector of source signal, and A the hybrid matrix. Linear ICA is, under the condition of unknowing ind ependent source of information T 2 1      n s s s s   and mixing matrix A to search a decomposition matrix 1 WA   in order to separate source signals from the observed signal T 2 1      m x x x x    namely s x W x A s       1  2 The result s  is good approx imation of source signal s  It is impossible to resume s from observed signal x without any prior information about hybrid matrix A and source signal s Generally assumed as follows _______________ ______________ 978-1-4244-4738-1/09/$25.00 2009 IEEE 


1\source signals are mutually statistics independent stationary random signals 2\hybrid matrix A is nonsingular matrix, detA 0 3 n m  namely, the number of sensors is greater than or equal to the num ber of source signals The method of ICA can be used well in solving the problem of blind source separation, where the key is to establish an objective function that may measure the independence of separation res ult and the corresponding optimized algorithm. Many ob jective function and separation algorithm have been proposed by people from different  this pa per a ki nd of criteri on base d on negative  entropy and the fast stationary point algorithm \(FastICA discussed, which has the advantages of fast convergence rate and more accurate solution and is one of the prevailing methods [9  B Negative entropy criterion and FastICA algorithm The key factor of ICA m odel is non-Gaussian quality According to the central limit th eorem, if a random constant is a sum of reciprocal independe nt random constants with limited mean and variance, the random constant is surely close to Gaussian distribution regar dless of distribution of independent random constant s. To ICA process, mixed signal is linear superposition of independent signals, so mixed signal is more close to Gaussian distribution than independent signals. Reciprocal independence of separation results may be monitored through its non-Gaussian quali ty. When the nonGaussian quality of separation results reaches maximum or the Gaussian quality results reaches minimum, separation of independent components is finished The FastICA algorithm pr oposed by Hyvarinen [1 essentially is a kind of neural network methods through evaluating components mutual info rmation, which demands to evaluate negative entropy \(or minimal entropy\nd compute negative entropy approximately with the maximal entropy theory, namely 2    ii Jy kEGy EGv  3 Where    G are some nonnegative quadratic functions E is mathematical expectation k is a constant v is a normalized Gaussian variable and i y is assumed as random variable with zero mean unit variance Bring T i ywx  into formul a \(3\obtain 2  T i Jwx kEGy EGv  4 Where w is m dimension or authority vector and meet the constraint condition   1 T Ewx   We know from formula \(4\aximal value of T wz negative entropy amounts to the maximal value of   T EGwz Thereby, under th e restraint of  2 1 w   objective function is constituted as follows 2 2     1 T Fw EGwz w   5 Where  is the scaled factor Evaluate w that cause to the maximum of  Fw hence 0     1  2        2      012     w z w xg E w w z w G x E w w F w f T T   6 Where g is the derivative of nonlinear function gG 012    f w is the Jacobian matrix of  Fw and  is the simplified representation of 2 2 1 w    Utilize Newton iteration method to solve equation \(6 obtain the solution w furthermore obtain the recurrence formula of ICA  1      wk wk f wk f wk 012   7 The Hessian matrix of  Fw is     TT f wk E xx g w z I  012\012  8 Iterate w one time, then normalize it 1 1\/\(1 wk wk wk    9 After the constringe of iteration w is obtained and an extracted indepe ndent component T i y wz   III A PPLICATION E XAMPLES A Imitation Example In order to explain the eff ect of signal separation and filtering with the method of ICA, here an imitation example is demonstrated Firstly 500-point imitation signa l is constituted. Figure 1\(a is the pressure signal sampled by a pressure transducer within a period of time. Figure 1 b\nonGaussian distributed sequence of signs generated by random generator. Figure 1\(c is superposition signal with diffe rent sine waves. Figure  2 is the different linear commixture of three original signals in figure 1. Then separate the mixed signals presen ted in figure 2 with the FastICA algorith m given in 2.2 and observe separation effect Figure 1. Original signal 


Figure 2. Mixed signal Figure 3. Separated signal Figure 3 is signal wave separat ed with ICA algorithm. We can see that being separated by FastICA algo rithm, signals are purified effectively and get g ood filtering effect. Compared with the source signal in fig ure 1, valid signal and random interference are well separated and the features of original signal are recovered except the amplitude. The experiment shows that source signals can be separated from mixed signals with ICA technique Whats worth to mention is that ICA transformation has one apparent advantage. It is obt ained with the statistics property of signal and ch anges with th e manipulative object but comparatively, DFT, DCT and wavelet adopt relatively fixed radix and have no adaptability to different data B Field example Some day in the September, the 2# tile of one refinerys exhaust turbine appears major vibration. Its signals are acquired by two turbulence sensors which are installed vertically on the tile. The measured signals are rotors vibration relative to axle tile. Th e vibration signals are shown in figure 4, and figure 5 is its corresponding frequency spectrum. Through observation we can find that the signal in X direction is smooth which fre quency is mainly set vibration line frequency 97.7Hz and its amplitude changed slightly. But the signal in Y direction is more complicated, which spectrum has the component of 164.1Hz and its amplitude altered continuously, which belongs to classical non-stationary signal Figure 4. Vibration wave of the second tile Figure 5. Vibration spectrum of the second tile Taking the vibration sign als of the tile in X and Y directions as mixed signals, they were separated with FastICA algorithm mentioned in section 2.2. The result is shown in figure 6 and figure 7 is its corresponding spectrum. The separation result showed that the source signal of the vibration signals of the tile in X and Y directions mainly had two signals independent source signal 1 mainly is non-stationary signal with 164.1Hz which amplitude continuously changed with time, and independent source signal 2 mainly is line frequency stationary signal which amplitude changed slightly. We can see from figure 4 and figure 5 that the approximate mixing mode of vibration signals in X and Y directions. Signal in X direction is mainly composed by independent source signal 2 but independent source signal 1 is almost not reflected in it and signal in Y direction is linear fold of two independent source signals. Hence, there are two apparent peak values in Y directions vibration spectrum 


Figure 6. Wave of independent source signals of 2nd tile Figure 7. Spectrum of independent source signals of 2nd tile Figure 6 and figure 7 show that there were two independent vibration driving so urces existed in the exhaust turbine. Independent source si gnal 2 can be regarded as line frequency vibration signal which is caused mainly by the imbalance of assembly rotors. Th e main frequency 164.1Hz of independent source signal 1 is neither caused by the fault of rotor or axle tile nor th e fraction number multiple frequency This phenomenon is quite rare in the rotating assembly. If the independent source signal 1 is al so caused by the fault of rotor or axle tile, the signal will be shown in both directions of X and Y but it is not the truth. There were neither obviously changed non-stationary independent source signal 1 in the vibration signal of X direction \(figure 4\(b\apparent 164.1Hz spectrum in the corresponding spectrum figure 5\(b According to the above analysis, it was d oubted that the turbulence sensors itself in Y direction appeared fault. The maintainers of the factory checked the installation of the sensors, only to find that the epoxy resin used to seal turbulence sensors is worn out and the sensors coils are loose The independent source signal 1 is just the non-stationary vibration signal created by the loose of the sensor. From this example we can see that the ICA algorithm separated the two independent sour ce signals totally perfectly IV C ONCLUSIONS Utilizing ICA technique to separate and filter multi-source mixed signals of petrochemical running equipments, the separated source signals contain more information of faults source than observed signals. Therefore, it can decrease difficulty and improve accuracy of fault diagnosis. At the meantime, we may notice th at compared with filtering methods of coherent average and wavelet transformation, ICA possesses some superiority in despite of how the signal-tonoise ratio is and even if th e signals are submerged totally by noise, as long as appropriate ICA algorithm is adopted, The observed signals may be separated fast and effectively, and consequently the filtered source signals information describing faults is obtained. Th e study of this experiment shows that the method is a kind of quite favorable signal preprocessing method in fault diagnosis R EFERENCES  W a ng H., Analy s i s on Libration Su pe rvision and Failure Esti m a t i on for  DH Type Abaxial Compressor,  Fluid M achinery, vol.32 no.11, pp.3235, 2004 2 Wang X W Hua ng R.H Ma W.P   Some Examples of Vibration Fault Diagnosis and Remedies for Rotating Machinery in Petrochemical Industry  Journal of Mechanical Strength vol.24, no.4, pp. 493499  2002  Jutten C., Herault J., Independent C o m ponent Analy sis Versus PCA In: Proceeding of European Signal Processing Conf, 1988, pp.287-314  Em irU E, Akqul C B, "W avelet De n o ising-ICA denoisi ng for functio nal optical imaging", In: Proceedings First International IEEE EMBS Conference on NeuralEngineering Capri Island, Italy, 2003, pp.384-387  Yp m a  A, Leshe mA, Duin RP W B lind separation of rotating m a chine  sources: bilinear forms and convolutive mixtures", Neuro computing,vol.49, no.4 pp.349-368, 2002  Oja E, Y a ng Howard Hua, A m ar i S-I, Adaptive online learning algorithms for blind separa tion, Maximum entropy and minimum mutual information,   Neural Computation, vol 9, no.7, pp.1457-1482, 1997  Hy varinen A.,Oja E.

This paper presen ts the results of a project recently performed at the power company, Vattenfall, in Sweden. The project studied mobile power equipment related issues for application purpose. One of important concerns was how far we could increase power supply reliability and how much we could reduce scheduled power outages by using mobile equipment Based on the performance data and outage statistics of a period of four years at Vattenfall network company in Sweden, the project analyzed impact on power service reliability by application of mobile power equipment. The analysis shows that mobile power equipment combined with LW technique has potential to eliminate planned customer outages expected up to 90% and improves the reliability significantly. The companys SAIFI value would be potentially improved by 13-17%. A potential 8-22 improvement of the companys SAIDI value would be realized. The overall system reliability would then be increased from 99.86-99.96% to 99.87-99.97 VII.

MB-EISE conceptual model Figure 3. Basic engineering tasks performed based on each cell-related view operability between methodologies applied within each cell can be accomplished. These tasks should be further re?ned within the limits of each Zachman cell Since, even within the purpose of a speci?c methodology or viewpoint, discrete issues may be resolved using autonomous, heterogeneous tools, tool integration related to a speci?c task should be supported. Some of them may employ their own internal model for EIS representation. Thus tool coordination and internal meta-model transformation should also be supported. According to model-based engineering principles, consistency is ensured, since the EIS view meta-model acts as a  reference point  Prior to using an existing tool, the partial transformation of view metamodel into the tool  s internal meta-model must be facilitated. Using this transformation, the invocation and initialization of any tool can be automatically performed 4. Model-Based Enterprise Information Systems Architecture Design To further elaborate on basic MB-EISE activity model re?nement and the proposed guidelines for constructing EIS cell-related view and the interaction with external cells, the System Network cell of the Zachman matrix is used as example According to INCOSE [16], determining system architecture \(i.e. the way autonomous system components should be synthesized tecture design is the process of de?ning and optimizing the architecture of the information system \(both hardware and software ing that all software components are identi?ed and properly allocated and that hardware resources can provide the 


erly allocated and that hardware resources can provide the desired performance. This activity is performed based on the EIS view corresponding to system network cell, which should facilitate: \(a e.g. a system-oriented view of distributed applications b nition of system performance and availability requirements c d platform-independent distributed infrastructure \(e.g. network architecture and hardware con?guration e ciation of software components to network nodes \(resource allocation requirements EIS architecture design was also discussed in [20]. In the following, we provide a methodology-independent, modelbased EIS enterprise design activity model and describe the corresponding EIS architecture design sub-views as well as Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 Figure 4. EIS Architecture Design basic engineering tasks way they are interrelated to external cells 4.1. First-level Description of EIS Architecture Design MB Activity The basic tasks identi?ed during the EIS architecture design activity are depicted in ?gure 4. These tasks are in alignment with basic engineering tasks performed for each Zachman matrix cell, as depicted in ?gure 3. Collect Requirements task \(as depicted in ?gure 3 through two discrete stages i.e. Functionality De?nition and Requirements De?nition within System Network cell The former depicts functional requirements extracted from People, Data and Function cells of the system model row The latter concerns non functional requirements related to EIS architecture design, extracted from the Motivation cell of System Model row. Requirements included in this cell are either propagated from the upper layers of Zachman framework or speci?cally de?ned for system design and may relate to issues not relevant to EIS architecture design Only architecture design related requirements are propagated within EIS System Network view Next, the solution is synthesized through two interactive steps i.e. Topology De?nition and Network Infrastructure De?nition \( [7], [12 source allocation and replication. This task is performed taken into account the de?nition of system access points in terms of hierarchically related locations performed in upper Network cells \(Business row network cell in particular The term site is used to characterize any location \(i.e. a building, an of?ce, etc tity which can be further analyzed into sub-sites, forming thus a hierarchical structure Network Infrastructure De?nition refers to the aggregate network, described through a hierarchical structure comprising LANs. Devices, such as servers and workstations Figure 5. EIS Sub-Views corresponding to the System Network cell are associated with LANs at the lowest level of the hierarchy. Network nodes are either workstations allocated to users or server stations running server processes. Topology and Network Infrastructure De?nition tasks are interrelated. Both should be performed in the same hierarchical levels of detail. At the lowest level, network nodes should be related to processes/data replicas. In essence, interaction between these two tasks represents an interdependence in terms of derived requirements. Requirements derived during Topology De?nition affect Network Infrastructure Definition and vice versa. Therefore, Requirements De?nition is performed in parallel with Topology and Network Infrastructure De?nition as well. Developing requirements and architectural artifacts in parallel has already been addressed in the literature [23 


in the literature [23 After the solution deployment, validation is performed using simulation. Solution evaluation will determine whether the overall process will end in case the solution is satis?ed or readjustments will be performed through the recurrence of the previous steps The tasks of ?gure 4 corresponding to Requirements Collection and Solution Synthesis \(which presented in ?gure 3 relative views are de?ned, namely, Functional View, Topology View, Network Infrastructure View and Requirements View. These views constitute sub-views of the SystemNetwork view of Zachman framework. Solution validation and evaluation is performed using information included in all of them. Interrelations between corresponding tasks are re?ected upon the introduced views. These interrelations along with the dependencies between the introduced views and the related models of the corresponding Zachman cells are depicted in ?gure 5. Dependencies with external Zachman cells are bidirectional. Functional view obviously is in?uenced by and in?uences People, Data and Function cells of System Model row, while Requirements view interacts with SystemMotivation view. Topology view is bidirectionally related to Business Network view, while Network Infrastructure view to Technology Network view System Network views are illustrated in ?gure 5 in a blackbox manner. A white-box perspective of them will unfold through the description provided in the following paraProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 graph, further elucidating view interdependencies 4.2. Meta-model describing System Network View The meta-model of System Network view, e.g. entities constituting each sub-view and their interrelations, is adjusted to support the identi?ed tasks As depicted in ?gure 6, Functional view encompasses functional requirements derived by external system cells. It focuses on functional speci?cations \(e.g. application architecture, user behavior and data structures considered to be based on multi-tiered, client-server models. Each application tier, called module, comprises services. Application tiers and provided services should be in accordance to the model de?ned in Function cell, thus they act as external entities. User behavior is modeled through roles de?ning the behavior of different user groups. They act as external entities for People cell \(e.g. they could be related to user role entities cate portions of data used by applications. They also act as external entities for Data cell. For each service, a service description sub-view is de?ned indicating network infrastructure resources needed for its execution. The load imposed to network infrastructure resources each time the service is executed is expressed using operations selected from a prede?ned set called Operation Dictionary [21]. Service Description and Operation Dictionary sub-views will be further described latter after discussing Requirements view Topology view facilitates allocation of software, data and people resources. It comprises sites, de?ned in upper Network cells, processes de?ned as instances of server or client modules, user pro?les as instances of roles, and data entity replicas as instances of data entities de?ned in Functional View. The allocation of them to sites corresponds to software architecture design. Sites are organized in a hierarchical structure. Those belonging to the lowest level of the hierarchy are characterized as atomic Network Infrastructure view comprises the overall network decomposed to sub-networks. Devices, such as servers, workstations and other network devices are associated with LANs at the lowest level of the hierarchy. Devices may include a processing unit and a storage unit Networks and network nodes are characterized by capac 


Networks and network nodes are characterized by capacity indications, for example throughput, storage speed or processing power, which should be matched with load requirements, related to Topology view entities. As a result networks are associated to sites de?ned in Topology view while processes, data entity replicas and user pro?les located in atomic sites are allocated to server or workstation devices included in the corresponding LAN Requirements view comprises non-functional requirements derived from the System Motivation cell relevant to EIS architecture design or progressively de?ned during the execution of the EIS Architecture Design tasks. Requirements de?ned within requirement view are satis?ed by speci?c entities included in Functional, Logical and Network Infrastructure views and contribute to inter-view interrelations. In the following we provide a further classi?cation of non-functional requirements based on our objectives in respect to EIS architecture design. Three main categories are supported: performance, constraint and speci?c quality [10 Regarding constraint requirements, we focus on those concerning capacity. Capacity, which has to do with the limitations of the hardware and their impact to the system is related to Network Infrastructure view. Regarding speci?c quality requirements, we consider only availability requirements. They are associated with Network Infrastructure view, where availability deals with hardware aspects Availability requirements may be either derived from upper level requirements, within System Motivation cell, or de?ned with System Network cell during EIS architecture design. Requirements de?ned within System Network cell during EIS architecture design should be passed to EIS System Motivation view As depicted in ?gure 6, performance requirements are further decomposed to behavior, load and utilization. Utilization requirements are associated with Network Infrastructure view and regard the proportion of network infrastructure resources used by applications during normal operation or extreme conditions. Behavior requirements deal with service behavior and are time-related \(e.g. response times 6. Load requirements concern the load imposed to EIS resources by system entities, as processes and data replicas de?ned in Topology view, for example average data transfer load or data processing load imposed by a speci?c process. These requirements are derived ones, which should be calculated for execution of each speci?c service based on behavior requirements and service decomposition described in Service Description sub-view The execution of each service relates to speci?c load requirements imposed to network infrastructure. To identify such requirements the amount of information processed stored or transferred during its execution should be estimated. The Service Description sub-view is introduced for this purpose, de?ned for each service included in Functional view. Since service functionality can be complex, it is not easily described in terms of the amount of information processed, stored or transferred during its execution. To facilitate the progressive estimation of load parameters, a set of operations are de?ned for the description of service load requirements [21]. Operations are selected from a prede?ned set de?ned in Operation Dictionary sub-view, which comprises application and elementary operations.

EIS System Network View Meta-model operations are those used for service description and must be ultimately decomposed into elementary ones \(i.e. data processing, storing and transferring are estimated through parameter values that are propagated by service invocation parameters to parameters describing application operations constituting the service description which are further propagated to parameters describing elementary operations 4.3. EIS Architecture Design Task Implementation EIS Architecture Design tasks may be supported by existing tools [20]. Systems Modeling Language \(SysML 15] is considered as the most appropriate for EIS System Network model representation and requirement engineering, since it supports the concepts of requirements and resource allocation. As a direct consequence, SysML allows the representation of requirements as model elements which means that requirements are part of the system architecture. For representation purposes, a SysML pro?le for EIS System Network meta-model \(?gure 6 mented as a plugin to MagicDraw modeling tool [2]. In order to facilitate model exchangeability, EIS System Network model is being realized in XML, which is a standard exchangeable format. In order to exchange data with speci?c software tools, model transformations will be accomplished through appropriate XSLTs developed for each tool for example as the one transforming XMI to the EIS System Network document type description \(DTD 5. Case Study In the following we discuss the case of renovating a legacy information system supporting a large-scale public organization based on the proposed concepts. The organization supports more than 350 interconnected regional of?ces and its main purpose is to provide services to the public both citizens and businesses. Regional of?ces are divided into three categories according to their size and information infrastructure requirements \(large, medium and small More than 15.000 employees work in the organization having on-line access to the legacy system. There are more than 300 different services provided to the public, while each citizen is required to register in the one belonging to his/her residential area, called residential of?ce. Some of them require the actual presence of citizens in their residential of?ce Existing system architecture is based on a fat clientserver architecture. All application logic is programmed within the client platform, while data is distributed in local database servers located in each regional of?ce. A Central database is supported in the Datacenter for data synchronization and lookup purposes. The Datacenter and all regional of?ces participate in a private TCP/IP network to facilitate ef?cient data replication. Most data related to a speci?c citizen are maintained as local data in his/her residential of?ce. Client programs access the local database to store data, while they access the central database mostly for lookup purposes. Local data are asynchronously replicated in the central database using a transaction management system \(TMS Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 to facilitate communication with the central database. The central database provides the overall view of each citizen  s record 


record To enhance the level of services provided by the organization, we decided to establish an enhanced e-services environment through an e-government portal. The main target of the portal is to minimize the need for citizen  s presence in regional of?ces and intents to deal with all the drawbacks of the current e-service platform. It provides easy access to citizens and businesses twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. It also promotes the increase of e-services to users, facilitating the organization to accomplish its strategic goals. The portal facilitates on-line transactional services and ensures on-line access to the databases of the legacy information system Provision of transactional e-services re?ects the operation of the legacy system and thus results in its renovation. In order to effectively support both systems \(e.g the portal and the legacy system able to apply the same policies and minimize maintenance cost. Thus, it was decided to explore the renovation of the legacy information system by adopting modern technological trends, such as multi-tiered application architecture server-based computing and light clients. It was decided also to rewrite application code based on J2EE architecture to develop a web interface for the legacy information system in order to support a uni?ed environment for both the legacy system and the portal. This decision affected the legacy system architecture, described in System Network View. Some of issues raised included: \(a database architecture? It is currently distributed. Should it become centralized? What are the implications in the network infrastructure? \(b complished to minimize maintenance cost Though EA was never fully described, the organization had already decided to establish an EA based on Zachman framework a few years ago. RUPmethodology was used for software development, thus application description models were developed within Rational Rose platform. In order to be able to apply the proposed tasks identi?ed in section 4, relative information had to be extracted from the corresponding cells. Application description \(e.g. applications and modules tracted from corresponding Rational Rose ?les. Though the process was not automated, the provision of System Network meta-model, helped architecture designer to identify the information needed to obtain from software designers Detailed service description in terms of load requirements could not be extracted from software description. This was crucial in order to decide upon Intranet and Datacenter architecture. This information was collected by interviewing software developers The new system has to deal with a number of require&lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Small Regional Office oracle L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt tuxido L.R.O lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt L.R.O. department tuxido Central

Topology View - Existing System ments, with security and availability being the most important ones. Security issues have to do with the security of the network, security of data, authentication control, etc. Availability requirements deal with the backup subsystem, the recovery system and high availability UPS. Privacy must be enforced with the use of cryptography and compression techniques. All these requirements were identi?ed during the System Architecture design process and consequently exported in System Motivation cell where all system requirements are gathered using a simpli?ed text-based requirement description method System Architecture design tasks were performed by existing tools already described in [20]. The existence of System Network meta-model and its implementation in XML facilitated tool integration and interoperability. The identi?cation of primary EIS engineering activities served by Zachman matrix rows and columns facilitated a better understanding between software developers, architecture designers and organization management and enhanced discrete methodology integration. Existing and renovated application architecture of the legacy system de?ned by Topology View are presented in ?gures 7 and 8 respectively. The screenshots are from the MagicDraw [2] tool, enhanced with EIS pro?le to provide the appropriate functionality 6. Conclusions &amp; Future Work MB-EISE process based on Zachman framework was explored in the paper. The designer may adjust basic MB-EISE activity model for each cell, formulate a methodology-independent EIS cell-related view, and ?nally identify methods and tools appropriate for implementing each speci?c task. One could argue that in such a case, 36 distinct EIS sub-views should be de?ned, each of them being rather complex, while basic MB-EISE activity should be adjusted 36 times, resulting in a very complicated process Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Application Server lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt

Topology View - Renovated System However, EIS engineering process, as enterprise architecture, is itself complex. The bene?t of the proposed approach is that all aspects \(simple or complex form and modular fashion. Cell-related sub-views and corresponding meta-models, as well as cell-related MB-EISE activity model may be progressively formed according to the designer  s priorities and perspectives Having a black-box view of each Zachman cell, the proposed approach focuses on EIS view integration and interview consistency. The notion of external entities when de?ning EIS cell-related views provides the means for interoperability with external cells, while at the same time facilitates atomicity within the limits of each cell. We are currently emphasizing Business and System rows, and especially Function and Network cells, exploring in parallel Motivation column and the way non-functional requirements are managed Having a white-box view of each Zachman cell, it is evident that the de?nition of a technology neutral metamodel and the identi?cation of basic engineering tasks, corresponding to EIS cell-related views, contributes to the integration of different methodologies and tools. A library of EIS System Network models has been already implemented in XML.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
