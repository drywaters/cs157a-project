A binary partition based fast algorithm BPA for mining association rules in large databases is presented in this paper. Basically, the framework of BPA is similar to that of algorithm Apriori. In the first pass, all the frequent 1-itemsets can be divided into two disjoint parts Accordingly in each subsequent pass k, we partition the set of all the frequent k-itemsets into three subsets. Any two different partitions are disjoint. If necessary, this partition procedure can be a recursive one. Therefore we get a binary partition tree in the first pass and a corresponding ternary partition tree in each subsequent pass k. Due to such a partition, BPA can be very easily parallelized assuming a shared-memory architecture 1. Introduction Data mining, also known as knowledge discovery in databases, has been recognized as a new area for database research. This area can be loosely defined as the efficient discovery of previously unknown patterns or rules in large databases. Database mining is motivated by the decision support problem faced by most large retail organizations Progress in bar-code technology has made it possible for large supermarkets to collect and store massive amounts of sales data, referred to as the basket data. A record in such data typically consists of the customer-id, the transaction date and the items bought in the transaction Analysis of the big amount of past transaction data can provide very valuable information on customer buying behavior, and thus we can improve the quality of business decisions. [1, 2 The problem of mining association rules over basket data was introduced in [1  A n ex am p l e o f s u ch  a r u l e might be that 90% of customers that purchase bread and butter also purchase milk. The intuitive meaning of such a rule is when customers purchase some items how they will tend to purchase some other items too. Finding all such rules is valuable for cross-marketing and attached mailing applications. Other applications include catalog design, add-on sales, store layout, and customer segmentation based on buying patterns. The databases involved in these applications are very large. Therefore, it is imperative to design efficient algorithms to mine association rules. [1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 In this paper, an efficient algorithm BPA \(Binary Partition Based Algorithm\ is  presented. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. A formal description of mining association rules is first given in section 2. Then we discuss the related works in section 3.  In section 4, we describe the BPA algorithm in detail, and discuss scale-up problem and parallelization at the same time. The relative performance study is discussed in section 5. Finally we conclude with a summary in section 6 2. Mining of Association Rules The following is a formal statement of the problem of mining association rules: [2 Let   m i i i I L 2 1   be a set of literals ,  called items Let D be a set of transactions, where each transaction T is a set of items such that I T 315 Associated with each transaction is a unique identifier, called its TID We say that a transaction T contains X a set of some items in I if T X 315 An association rule is an implication of 


the form Y X 336 where I X 314  I Y 314 and  Y X I 306 The rule Y X 336 holds in the transaction set D with confidence c if  c of transactions in D  that contain X also contain Y The rule Y X 336 has support s in the transaction set D if  s of transactions in D contain Y X U  Given a set of transactions D the problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have support and confidence greater than the userspecified minimum support \(called minsup and minimum confidence \(called minconf respectively The problem of discovering all association rules can be decomposed into two subproblems 1.   Find all sets of items itemsets whose support is greater than the user-specified minsup Itemsets with minimum support are called frequent itemsets 2.   Use the frequent itemsets to generate the desired rules. The general idea is that if, say ABCD and AB are frequent itemsets, then we can determine if the CD AB 336 holds by computing the ratio AB ABCD conf support    support  If minconf conf 263 then the rule holds Since the second subproblem is straightforward, much of the current research has been focussed on the first subproblem [1, 2, 3  3. Related Works Among the many algorithms that have been proposed for discovering frequent itemsets, the Apriori algorithm presented by R.Agrawal and R.Srikant is the most successful and influential [4, 7   T o  d i s c ov e r  a l l frequent itemsets, Apriori makes multiple passes over the data. The first pass of the algorithm simply counts item occurrences to determine the frequent 1-itemsets. A subsequent pass, say pass k consists of two phases. First the frequent itemsets 1 k L found in the k 1\th pass are used to generate the candidate itemsets k C  using the apriori-gen function. Next, the database is scanned and the support of candidates in k C  is counted. At the end of the pass, Apriori determines which of the candidate itemsets are actually frequent. This process continues until no new frequent itemsets are found. The key of efficiency is based on not generating and evaluating those candidate itemsets that can not be frequent. To achieve this goal, all currently known algorithms use a same basic intuition that any subset of a frequent itemset must be frequent [2 To deal with a kind of incremental updating problem of association rules, We have proposed to partition the frequent 1-itemsets 1 L using a binary partition tree in paper [7  I n f a ct  w h e n u s er s in t e r a ct i v el y m i n e association rules, they may have to continually tune two thresholds, minimum support and minimum confidence which describe the users 222 special interestingness.  Assume the transaction database does not change, we mainly consider the case that the new minimum support is less than the old one. Our partition idea is based on the following observation In the first pass, all the frequent 1-itemsets can be divided into two disjoint parts, all the new frequent 1itemsets 1 1 L and all the old frequent 1-itemsets 2 1 L And since any subset of a frequent itemset must be frequent too, then for every single item i in a frequent k itemset c its corresponding frequent 1-itemsets   i is either drawn from 1 1 L or 2 1 L Accordingly in each subsequent pass k we can partition all the frequent k itemsets into three disjoint classes 1\requent k itemset   k i i i c K   2 1    1  k j j 243 243    1 1 L i j 316  2\requent k itemset   k i i i c    2 1 K    1  k j j 243 243    2 1 L i j 316  3\requent k itemset   k i i i c    2 1 K  there must be two non-empty subsets 1 c and 2 c that c c c  2 1 U   2 1 c c I 306 and 1 1 1 L c 314  2 1 2 L c 314  The above partition procedure is at single level. In the final part of that paper, we have shown we can make a generalization by doing further partition at multiple levels. In this paper, Our goal is to use the same basic intuition to solve the mining of association rules itself and discuss the implementation problems of  the  generalized partition procedure in detail 4. Algorithm BPA Given a transaction database D the support of an itemset can be taken as the number of transactions that contain the itemset. Suppose the minsup is s  k L  is the corresponding set of frequent k itemsets, and k C  is the corresponding set of candidate k itemsets. Associated with each itemset is a count field to store the support of this itemset 4.1. Algorithm BPA 


Basically, the framework of BPA is similar to that of Apriori, it needs to make multiple passes over the database  too. In the first pass,  BPA  generates 1 L Then we use a binary tree \(called a binary partition tree\ to partition 1 L and accordingly, in each subsequent pass k  we employ a ternary tree \(called a ternary partition tree to partition k L  Now we describe our partition procedure in detail. Let maxl be the maximal level number which we\222d like to choose. We use the notation n l k L 327  l 1, 2, \205 maxl o denote a subset of frequent k itemsets in the l th level which is labeled by n  n is a sequence of integers in the range of 1 to 3 with a length of l Let 1 L be the root of the binary partition tree and at level 0; its two disjoint sons 1 1 1 327 L and 2 1 1 327 L at level 1, etc. A internal vertex n l L 327 1 at the l th level corresponds to the union of its two disjoint sons 1  1  1 n l L 327  and 2  1  1 n l L 327  at the 1  l th level . Likewise In each subsequent pass k let k L be the root of the corresponding ternary partition tree and at level 0; its three mutually disjoint sons 1 1 327 k L  2 1 327 k L and 3 1 327 k L at level 1 etc. A internal vertex n l k L 327 at the l th level corresponds to the union of its three mutually disjoint sons 1  1  n l k L 327   2  1  n l k L 327  and 3  1  n l k L 327  at the 1  l h level. However, the third son such as 3 1 327 k L can not be further partitioned, it can only be a leaf vertex. Figure 1 illustrates an example of binary partition tree and ternary partition tree with maxl 2 Level 0 1 L  k L Level 1 1 1 1 327 L  2 1 1 327 L  1 1 327 k L  3 1 327 k L  2 1 327 k L Level 2 11 2 1 327 L  12 2 1 327 L  11 2 327 k L  13 2 327 k L  12 2 327 k L Figure 1   Example of  binary partition tree and ternary partition tree At the same level l  1 1 p l L 327  2 1 p l L 327  1 p l k L 327  2 p l k L 327 and 3 p l k L 327  p is the common prefix of length 1 l must satisfy the following conditions which are similar to those of the three disjoint classes mentioned in section 3 1 1 p l k L c 327 316  let   k i i i c    2 1 K    1  k j j 243 243    1 1 p l j L i 327 316  2 2 p l k L c 327 316  let   k i i i c    2 1 K    1  k j j 243 243    2 1 p l j L i 327 316  3 3 p l k L c 327 316  let   k i i i c    2 1 K  there must be two non-empty subsets 1 c and 2 c that c c c  2 1 U   2 1 c c I 306 and 1 1 1 p l L c 327 314  2 1 2 p l L c 327 314  Clearly, based on the binary partition tree, the generation of 1 L can be viewed as a procedure of 2-way merge. And in each subsequent pass k it is a 3-way merge Suppose in each subsequent pass k  n l k C 327 is the corresponding candidate k itemsets of n l k L 327 and 1 p l k C 327  2 p l k C 327 and 3 p l k C 327 correspond to 1 p l k L 327  2 p l k L 327 and 3 p l k L 327 respectively. We use function bpa-gen n l k L 327 o generate n l k C 327 The parameter n l k L 327 corresponds to a vertex in the ternary partition tree. If n l k L 327 is a leaf  vertex, we simply use the apriori-gen function to generate 1 p l k C 327 and 2 p l k C 327 and to generate 3 p l k C 327 we use iuagen 1 p l j L 327 presented in [7   I n f a ct w e  ca n  g e t ev er y candidate k itemset in 3 p l k C 327 by simply concatenating a frequent j itemset  1 1  243 243 k j in 1 1 p l k L 327 and a frequent k j itemset in 2 1 p l k L 327 assuming neither this pair of itmsets 1 p l j L 327  2 p l j k L 327 is empty. Function iuagen 1 p l j L 327 takes two steps. First, in the concatenate step we concatenate 1 p l j L 327 and 2 p l j k L 327  insert into 3 p l k C 327 select 1 item  p  2 item  p 205 j p item   1 item  q  2 item  q 205 j k q item  from 1 p l j L 327 p  2 p l j k L 327 q  Next in the prune step, delete all itemsets 3 p l k C c 327 316 such that some k 1\ubset  of c is not in 3 1 p l k L 327 In the case of n l k L 327 is a internal vertex, the generations of 1 p l k C 327 and 2 p l k C 327 are implemented  by the 3way merges of  the l 1\th level, and we still use function  


iua-gen to generate 3 p l k C 327 Using a recursive style, the bpa-gen n l k L 327 function is described as follows bpa-gen n l k L 327   if n l k L 327 is a leaf vertex\ then begin  1 p l k C 327 apriori-gen 1 1 p l k L 327   2 p l k C 327 apriori-gen 2 1 p l k L 327  end else begin n l k L 327 is a internal vertex  1 p l k C 327 bpa-gen 1  1  n l k L 327    2 p l k C 327 bpa-gen 2  1  n l k L 327   end 3 p l k C 327  306  for    1  1    243  j k j j do begin  3 p l k C 327  3 p l k C 327 U iua-gen 1 p l j L 327  end n l k C 327  1 p l k C 327 U 2 p l k C 327 U 3 p l k C 327  return n l k C 327   After generating k C the database is scanned and k L is finally generated. This process continues until no new frequent itemsets are found. Figure 2 gives the primary framework of algorithm BPA 1   itemsets 1 frequent 1  L  2 begin  do     2  for 1   306 271  k L k k 3 k C  bpa-gen  k L  k L can be viewed as 0 0 327 k L  here l 0 n 0 4 forall transactions  do begin tD 316 5    subset t C C k t  6  do   candidates  forall t C c 316 7 c count   8 end 9    s count c C c L k k 263 316    10 end 11 Answer  k k L U Figure 2   Algorithm BPA 4.2. Scale-up and Parallelization In the candidate generation phase of pass k we need storage for 1 k L and k C With the increase of the number of transactions, the number of frequent itemsets may greatly increase too. Then we have to do swaps between memory and disks. However, by means of the binary partition and the ternary partitions, we are always able to keep both a subset of k C and the corresponding subset of 1 k L entirely available in memory. This aim can be taken as a basic partition rule. Whenever a subset of 1 k L does not entirely fit in memory, we do a partition of  that subset, therefore the corresponding leaf vertex in the binary partition tree or the ternary partition tree becomes a internal vertex. Apparently, it is a dynamic partition procedure. Whenever a new partition is done, the binary partition tree in the first pass and the ternary tree in each subsequent pass k have to do a vertex split accordingly For example, as shown in the figure 1, we can first divide 1 L into two disjoint subsets 1 1 1 327 L and 2 1 1 327 L If 1 1 1 327 L and 2 1 1 327 L can entirely fit in memory respectively, we then suspend the partition. \(We can also have another choice if 1 1 1 327 C can not entirely fit in memory, we can choose to further partition 1 1 1 327 L Suppose in each subsequent pass k  whenever a subset of 1 k L say 1 1 1 327 k L can not entirely fit in memory, we first partition 1 1 1 327 L into 11 2 1 327 L and 12 2 1 327 L then in each subsequent pass k we partition 1 1 327 k L into 11 2 327 k L and 12 2 327 k L and 13 2 327 k L  Based on the binary partition and ternary partitions BPA can be very easily parallelized assuming a sharedmemory architecture. That is algorithm PBPA. Suppose we have n processors which have a shard-memory. Based on multiple levels partition, we have a straightforward choice. For example, we can make the ternary partition tree have at least n leaf vertices. We then distribute the load equably among the n processors. Therefore we can take full advantage of the available processors 5. Relative Performance Basically, BPA is an extension of Apriori. Now we compare the relative performance of BPA with that of Apriori. The framework of BPA is similar to that of Apriori,  and there is not much extra overhead for the maintenance of  the binary partition tree and ternary partition trees BPA  does better than Apriori in the generating of the candidates k itemsets corresponding to the third child 


such as 3 1 327 k L of a internal vertex. Apriori expands two frequent k 1\-itemsets to generate candidate k itemsets using the apriori-gen function, it needs k 1\ join conditions to implement complex join. However, BPA only needs to concatenate two sub-itemsets using the iuagen function. Furthermore, in the prune step. Suppose n l k L 327 is a leaf vertex, When generating n l k C 327 BPA can implement efficient prune by simply checking the corresponding n l k L 327 1 However, Apriori has to check the whole set 1 k L Therefore, suppose a ternary partition tree has m leaf vertices, then Apriori has to check  the scope to decide a prune  by m 1\imes  1 k L more than BPA. This can be more significant while single n l k L 327 1 can entirely fit in memory respectively but the whole of 1 k L can not.  In fact, at this time Apriori can no longer prune those candidates whose subsets are not in 1 k L   Therefore, BPA can efficiently generate less candidates than Apriori. Based on the binary partition, BPA can always gain this advantage It is obvious that PBPA not only has all the above virtues of BPA, but also can do efficient parallel computation To get detailed relative performance data, related experiments are still under construction 6. Summary Based on the binary partition of  all the frequent 1itemsets, this paper presents an  efficient mining algorithm BPA. We suppose to use the basic intuition to solve the mining problem of the generalized association rules [5 o r o t h e r  k i n d s o f r u l e s su c h  a s se q u e n t i a l patterns References 1 R  A g ra w a l e t  a l  M i n i n g a s s o c i a t io n ru le s b e tw e e n s e t s  o f items in large databases.

on the frequency list of the items. As soon as a transaction is added, the frequency list could be changed and the FP-Tree may require a significant rearrangement of nodes to maintain the structure 6. Conclusion We propose a novel data structure, CATS Tree and an algorithm to build it. The algorithm FELINE is also proposed to mine frequent patterns from CATS Trees There are many advantages of CATS Tree algorithms over the existing algorithms. 1\ce a CATS Tree is built, frequent pattern mining with different supports can be performed without rebuilding the tree The benefit of çbuild once, mine manyé increases with the number of frequent patterns mining performed, i.e interactive mining with different supports; the cost of CATS Tree construction is amortized over multiple frequent patterns mining. 2\ CATS Tree allows single pass frequent pattern mining. 3\ CATS Tree algorithms allow addition and deletion of transactions in the finest granularity, i.e., a single transaction f o r m o re details. Currently, there is no known and published algorithm that can provide the same functionalities efficiently. This makes CATS Tree algorithm suitable for real time transactional frequent pattern mining where modifications and frequent patterns mining are common Moreover, with the addition and deletion capability CATS trees algorithms are appropriate to mine transaction streams since one single scan of the data suffices [18   We have implemented CATS Tree algorithms and compared our approach with other algorithms. CATS Tree algorithms are shown to be efficient and scalable to large amount of transactions and outperform other algorithms in interactive setting 7.
