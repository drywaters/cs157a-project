One such application that has received significant attention from the computer vision community is traffic surveillance. We propose a new event detection technique for detecting abnormal events in traffic video surveillance. The main objective of this work is to detect the abnormal events which normally occur at junction, in video surveillance. Our work consists of two phases 1\ Training Phase 2\ Testing Phase Our main novelty in this work is modified lossy counting algorithm based on set approach. Initially, the frames are divided into grid regions at the junction and labels are assigned The proposed work consist of blob detection and tracking conversion of object location to data streams, frequent item set mining and pattern matching. In the training phase, blob detection is carried out by separating the modelled static background frame using Gaussian mixture models \(GMM\ and this will be carried out for every frame for tracking purpose The blobs location is determined by assigning to the corresponding grid label and numbered moving object direction to form data streams. A modified lossy counting algorithm is performed over temporal data steams for discovering regular spatial video patterns. In testing phase, the same process is repeated except frequent item set mining, for finding the spatial pattern in each frame and it is compared with stored regular video patterns for abnormal event detection  The proposed system has shown significant improvement in performance over to the existing techniques  Keywords 227 Blob detection, Blob tracking, Spatial patterns Lossy Counting Algorithm, GMM I  I NTRODUCTION  Computer vision and video analysis techniques play an important role in modern intelligent systems. Video-based systems can capture a larger variety of desired information and are relatively inexpensive because cameras are easy to install, operate, and maintain. With the huge amount of video cameras installed everywhere now a days, there is an urgent need for automated video understanding techniques that can replace human operators to monitor the areas under surveillance [2 e o su rv eillan ce h a s g a i n ed i m p o r tan ce in  security, law enforcement and military applications and so is an important computer vision problem. As more and more surveillance cameras are deployed in a facility or area, the demand for automatic methods for video processing is increasing Traffic control and monitoring using video sensors has drawn increasing attention recently due to the significant advances in the field of computer vision. However, robust and accurate detection of abnormal events in video data still remains a difficult problem for the majority of computer vision applications. Especially in case of outdoor video surveillance systems, the traffic rule violation problem is particularly challenging due to due to size, unrestricted flow of video data streams  t h i s paper, ou r ai m i s  t o pres ent a novel intelligent traffic video surveillance system for video traffic analysis, and detecting traffic rule violation which commonly occurs at the junction In general, systems developed for traffic surveillance purposes aim at having a understanding of the real time traffic conditions, which require the analysis of the static environment and the detection of static or moving obstacles such as vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. Image processing and computer vision techniques are being applied to the analysis of video sequences of traffic, in order to extract traffic information, such as vehicle counting, vehicle classification, speed measurement, traffic flow, and so on   Fig. 1. Illegal U-turn Event  As more and more surveillance cameras are deployed in a facility or area, the demand for automatic methods for video processing is increasing. The operator constantly watching the video footages could miss a potential abnormal event, as the amount of information/data that has to be handled is high So there is a need for surveillance system which supports a human operator by automatically detecting abnormal events and drawing the operator\222s attention to such events. An example for illegal event or abnormal event in traffic is junction crossing shown in Fig h i s  w or k i s  u s ed t o

There are two phases in this method. The first is the training phase, and second is the testing phase. In the training phase, a section of normal surveillance videos are selected as a training sample to generate frequently occurring spatial patterns \(normal events\ the testing phase, the stored spatial patterns are compared with incoming patterns The event detection work consists of object detection and tracking, Conversion of object region to data streams frequent item set mining and Pattern matching. The following Fig. 2 shows the architecture for abnormal event detection in traffic junction. Initially, the moving foreground objects in the video are detected and tracked using Gaussian Mixture Model \(GMM\hen the junction is divided into equal number of grids and labels are assigned to each grid. After assigning labels to grid, sp atial location of each moving object in each grid is stored. Then, the object locations are converted into set of data sequences. Finally, based on the pattern matching procedure the frequent item sets are compared with the other sequences and the abnormal events are detected    Fig 2: Architecture for Abnormal Event Detection A  Object detection and Tracking

The moving object directions are quantized into four directions North, East, South, and West\d are numbered as shown in Fig.4. For every frame, the object location is determined based on its presence in the spatial grid and corresponding grid labels along with numbered object direction are assigned to form transactional data streams in alphabetical order  Fig. 3 : Assigning Labels to Grids    Fig. 4 Assigning Numbers to Each Direction  For example, if the object is moving in a straight road from bottom left to top left in a sequence of frames then transactional data streams are created as shown in Table 1     2 005     3 The assumption for red, green and blue color components are independent and have the same variance The procedure for detecting foreground pixels is as follows First, the initialization for K Gaussian distributions of the pixel are fixed with predefined mean, high variance and low prior weight. For an observed new pixel in the image sequence, we will check its RGB vector against K Gaussians until a match is found. Generally a match is defined as a pixel value within    b k k b T B 1 minarg 2013 International Conference on Recent Tre nds in Information Technology \(ICRTIT 553  The main purpose of object detection is to detect the moving foreground vehicles from the video. Effective foreground object detection is very important, because the follow-up operations such as tracking, classification etc. are based on the results of this moving object detection.

To find the frequent item sets from stream of transaction a modified lossy counting algorithm is used Stream of transactions or frames are given as the input for modified lossy counting algorithm. Each transaction consists of set of spatial locations and their moving directions. Here N denotes the current length of the transactions. The user has to specify one parameter: support s. Handling variable sized transactions and avoiding enumeration of all subsets of transaction is big challenge here. Data structure D is in the form \(set, f\, where f is an integer which represents the frequency count, and set is a spatial items. In the initial stage D is empty. The incoming transactions of each frame are added to the initial set. For each new incoming transaction frequency count is increased by one  Modified Lossy Counting Algorithm  Input: Data Stream S n error rate \037, support threshold s Output: Frequent Item set with threshold s Begin 1  Initially D is empty, n=0 2  For each sequence set S n of every transaction S 3  n=n+1; b current 037n 4  If\(set S n exists in D or subset of existing set in D 5  f\(existing set\\(existing set\+1  // existing data set value is retained 6  else if\(set S n is superset of the existing set in D 7  f\(existing set\\(existing set\+1 8  existing set in D=set S n existing dataset in D is replaced with new data set S n  9  else add entry\(set,1\ to D 10  end if 11  output each sequence set in D where f\(set set 12  end for end  If the incoming transaction is already in the data structure or is a subset of the existing data set; then frequency count is increased by one. If the incoming data set is superset of the existing data sets, then frequency count is increased by one and old entry will be updated with new data set. Then,  based on the threshold value, the less frequently occurring patterns are removed and the remaining are considered as frequently occurring patterns. These frequently occurring patterns are taken as normal events and other patterns are taken as abnormal events. In the training phase, video with flow of regular traffic events are taken as input and frequently occurring patterns are find out. In the original lossy counting algorithm, set generation is carried out by using trie data structure and buffer is allocated for each transaction. But in this modified lossy counting algorithm only subsets and super sets are considered. No buffer is allocated After finding the patterns, frequently occurring patterns were found by applying threshold value. Patterns with the frequency count below the threshold value were removed and frequency count above the threshold value was taken as frequent item sets. The threshold value is determined by the user based on the length of the training video and periodicity of the traffic rules D  Pattern Matching In the testing phase, the above processes \(object detection and tracking, data stream conversion\ are performed to find the spatial traffic pattern for each frame. These spatial patterns of each frame were compared with stored regular patterns.

2013 International Conference on Recent Tre nds in Information Technology \(ICRTIT 555  In order to evaluate the proposed abnormal event detection framework, a busy traffic data set, containing videos of length 1 hour \(90000 frames\d frame size of 360 * 288 is taken from www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk. The data set contains all the regular and irregular traffic rules. This framework was implemented in MATLAB 2010 with 2 GB RAM. Fig. 5 shows the output of blob detection Here, the moving foreground objects are detected. Fig. 6 shows the result of moving vehicle tracking. The bounding rectangle shows the tracked vehicles. Fig. 7 shows the results for frequent item set mining. Frequently occurring patterns are determined by learning the video  Fig. 6: Output for Object Tracking  In Fig.7 first three patterns represents the scenario of the objects moving in opposite lanes and some are moving from bottom right in a sequence of frame.

The performance evaluation of the abnormality detection tests was implemented with data sets. The main scenario to be considered here is traffic rule violation. In the synthetic environment, 9 different traffic events and 7 abnormal events were used. The evaluation results are shown in Table 3. From 9 abnormal events our method detects 8 abnormal events. So detection rate is 89 The True-Positive Rates \(TPR\dicates the percentage of successfully detected abnormal events. The False-Negative rates \(FNR\ndicate the proportion of missing actual events that were not detected   Fig. 8: Abnormal Event Detection Results  TABLE 3: ABNORMALITY DETECTION RESULTS  PREDICTED EVENT Event 9 TPR 0.89 FNR 0.11 The false-positive events mostly occur when a vehicle has slight lane deviation compared with the underlying route models.

The results were more satisfactory considering the detection of severe crashes  TABLE 4: COMPARISON WITH EXISTING WORK  METHOD DETECTI ON RATE Zou Method using ROI 84 Lee Method [1 using SVM 60 Proposed Abnormal Event Detection Method 89 V  CONCLUSION  AND  FUTURE  WORK This work proposes a new approach to detect abnormal traffic events such as traffic rule violation by observing traffic scenes at intersections. Our main novelty in this work is the modified lossy counting algorithm based on set/ subset superset approach for finding frequent item set. Instead of generating candidate set using trie in earlier approach, we use set method. Experimental results shown that the proposed abnormal event detection appro ach is capable of detecting more abnormal events than the existing works. So this method is well suited for real time traffic analysis. The results obtained from our experiments on junction dataset show that this approach is effective for abnormality deduction. In order to detect abnormal traffic events, first, normal vehicle flow patterns at the traffic scene junction are learned to differentiate with usual and unusual motion patterns. Second using stored frequent regular spatial patterns and rule violation datasets, the abnormal events at junction are detected. The proposed system has shown 89% performance as compared to existing techniques. In future aerial view traffic data set will be collected for occlusion free detection in order to improve the overall performance of the system Based on the current approach, the model is planned to be generalized for real-time traffic event analysis at intersections. Online detection of severe traffic incidents will help traffic operators to take immediate actions  REFERENCES  1 a n D o ng Z h e n g J i a, J i e S h ao a nd Z i y o u X i o n g  223 Traffic Abnormality Detection through Directional Motion Behavior Map 224 in Seventh IEEE International Conference on Advanced Video and Signal Based Surveillance pp. 80\22684, 2010 2 L i l i  Cu i K e huang  L i J i a p i n  C h e n a n d Z h e n bo  L i 224  Abnormal Event Detection in Traffic Video Surveillance Based on Local Features\224 IEEE Transactions on Image and Signal Processing, vol.1, pp  362 \226 366, 2011 3  K a m i jo  S   H a r a d a  M S a k a u c hi M   224  Incident Detection based on Semantic Hierarchy composed of the Spatio-Temporal MRF model and Statistical Reasoning 224, IEEE International Conference on Man and Cybernetics,  vol.1,415-421,2004 4 L a i r on g Ch en   Yua n  C a o a n d  R o n ghu a J i   224  Automatic Incident Detection Algorithm Based on Support Vector Machine 224 in Sixth IEEE International Conference on  Natural Computation, vol. 2,pp. 864-866, 2010 5 e i-L i e h H s u  C ha ng L ung T s ai an d P o L un Ch ang  224 Automatic Traffic Monitoring Method Based on Cellular Model 224 in Fifth IEEE International Conference on  Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, pp. 640-643, 2009 6 P i ci ar e l l i C  M i c h e l o n i  C an d F o r e sti G  L  224  Trajectory-Based Anomalous Event Detection 224  in  IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology, vol. 18, issue 11, pp. 1544-1554,2008 7 e e r ar ag hav a n, H S c hr a t e r P  an d P a pa ni ko l o po ul o s N  224 Switching Kalman Filter-Based Approach for Tracking and Event Detection at TrafficIntersections 224 , in IEEE Conference on Control and Automation,11671172,2005 8 Gi l b e r t  A  Il l i n g wo r t h  J   a n d  B o wd e n  R  224  Action Recognition Using Mined Hierarchical Compound Features 224 , in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence  Vol. 33, Issue: 5 , pp 883 \226897,2011  9 C  S t a u f f e r a n d W  G r i m s o n  223 Adaptive background mixture models for real-time tracking 224,in Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pages 246\226252 1999  G u rm eet Si n gh Ma nku and  R a j e ev M ot w a n i  224  Approximate Frequency Counts over Data Streams\224   in Proceedings of the 28th VLDB Conference Hong Kong, China, 2002  K i Y  L ee D  222 222 A traffic accident recording and reporting model at Intersections\222\222in IEEE Tranactions on  Intelligent Transportion System vol.8,issue.2, pp.188-196, 2007   Zo u Y S h i, G  S h i H W a n g Y  222 222  Image sequences based traffic incident detection for signaled intersections using HMM\222\222 in international Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems, 2009  W  H u L  W a ng an d T   T a n, \222 222 Recent developments in human motion analysis and Pattern Recognition 222\222, in Elsevier Journal ,vol. 36, pp. 585--601 2003 14 D Ha rwood  I Ha rit a og lu a n d L a rry S Da v i s 221 221 W4: Real-time surveillance of people and their activities 222\222, in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, vol.22, pp. 809--830, 2000  H  F u j i yos hi a n s  R S  P a t i l an d A  J  L i p t o n 222 222  Moving target classification and tracking from real-time video 222\222 in IEEE  Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision, pages 8-14, 1998  R  C u t l er a n d L a r r y S  D a v i s  221 221 Robust real-time periodic motion detection, analysis and applications 222\222 in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence vol 22 issue.8 pp.781-796 2000 17 a rs E   A Hoo g s  A a n d P e re ra  A G A 222 222 Learning motion patterns in surveillance video using HMM clustering 222\222, in Proceedings of IEEE Visual Motion Computing \(Motion\ Workshop, Copper Mountain/Colarado pp.1-8, 2008  L i n C T a i J   an d S o n g  K  221 221 Traffic monitoring based on real-time image tracking 222\222,  in Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation ,vol.2, pp. 2091-2096,2003  L o y C h e n C h a n ge T a o X ia n g  a n d S h ao ga n g G o n g 222 222 Stream-based active unusual event detection 222\222 in proceedings of springer on Computer Vision--ACCV 2010,pp. 161-175,2011  R a j u Bh u k y a a nd D V L N S o m a ya ju l u 221 221 Exact Multiple Pattern Matching Algorithm using DNA Sequence and Pattern Pair 222\222 in International Journal of Computer Applications,Vol. 17-- No.8, pp. \(0975 8887\2011

From Fig. 3\(a CloStream runs faster than Moment and NewMoment over 100 times when min_sup is less than 0.03% and 0.06 respectively. Particularly, when min_sup is less than 0.03 Moment runs out of memory, since it not only captures lots of non-closed nodes in CET-Tree but also maintains all frequent closed itemsets in CET-Tree and hash table.

Different from the previous approaches which need to take a lot of time to search from a tree structure CloStream only needs to do the intersections on the closed itemsets which return from the SET function and the added or deleted transaction without searching from our proposed structures. Besides, all the frequent closed itemsets can be obtained online based on any user-specified thresholds. The experimental results also show that our CloStream algorithm outperforms the three famous algorithms CFI-Stream, Moment and NewMoment on both synthetic datasets and real-world dataset R EFERENCES  1  R.

For the spatial partitioning we use the Military Grid Reference System MGRS Thus w ay  we represent an y location on the surface of the Earth at multiple granularities ranging from 1 002 1 m 2 to 100 002 100 km 2  by an alphanumeric value For temporal partitioning we use the typical temporal hierarchies from data warehousing hour day week month We drop cells with very low activity speci\002cally cells where the most popular term occurs in fewer than 5 messages at the 002nest granularity hour We will shortly describe how we 002x the spatio-temporal hierarchy in AFIA based on the considered workload We perform three sets of experiments The 002rst measures the space and accuracy of the proposed algorithms and compares them with two baselines The second evaluates the throughput memory consumption and number of checkpoints when varying the targeted k parameter The third evaluates the query processing performance when varying the size of the spatio-temporal query range We also show the number of checkpoints created during a time period B Data and Queries We collected all geo-tagged messages from the public Twitter FireHose during May 2013 The dataset contains 110,426,053 tweets yielding an average rate of circa 41 tweet per second Figure 9 provides insight into the workload and helps choose an appropriate spatio-temporal hierarchy Figure 9a shows the total number of cells that receive at least one tweet Thus the graph shows the expected number of active summaries at the given granularities For example every hour the number of 0.1 002 0.1 km 2  1 002 1 km 2  10 002 10 km 2  and 100 002 100 km 2 spatial grid cells that receive at least one tweet is circa 0.5M 200K 40K and 10K respectively i.e the 223Hour\224 curve in the 002gure Figure 9b considers the cells at the 0.1 km 002 0.1 km 002 1 hour granularity The y-axis depicts the number of such cells subject to different loads the number of terms t processed This shows that the number of 223interesting\224 cells with at least 100 terms is quite low barely reaching 100 Therefore we 002x the 002nest temporal granularity at an hour Figure 9c considers the cells at the 100 km 002 100 km 002 1 week granularity The 002gure shows that thousands of such cells have summaries that receive more than 1 thousand terms We 002x k at 25 and generate 2 query sets each consisting of 100 queries Each query in the 002rst set has a temporal extent with a length chosen at random among 1 hour 1 day and 1 week and it has a randomly selected spatial region The spatial granularity of the coarsest cell that is contained in the spatial query region is the query's spatial granularity and the query region is enlarged to cover all the cells at that granularity that it intersects with In visual terms this procedure corresponds to 223snapping\224 the spatial query region to the coarser granularity The underlying rationale for adopting this procedure is that 002ner-granularity cells do not contribute with term counts at the same magnitude as do cells at the granularity of the coarsest fully covered cell Since any rectangle can be created from a number of merged squares we limit the experiments to squares Each cell contains 10 002 10 cells at the next 002ner granularity Thus the largest number of cells any query square can cover is 18 002 18  324 As a result we employ queries that may cover up to 1,800 002 1,800 km 2  While the 002rst query set focuses on variation in the spatial range the second focuses on temporal variation Each of the 100 queries has a spatial region chosen at random from one of the spatial granularities The query resulting in most temporal summary merges is the query that spans from the 002rst hour after midnight on the 002rst day in May until the hour before midnight on the last day of May This query covers 2 002 23 hours 3  5 days and 3 weeks which amounts to 57 temporal summaries To avoid empty results we do not consider regions that only cover empty cells Note that we do not perform compaction on the last active temporal granularities to better re\003ect the real-life scenario where a stream is constantly keeping these summaries active To simplify the experiments the initCounters parameter which determines the initial number of counters is set to the same value as targeted k  C Baselines We consider two baselines for comparison and validation of our proposal SS In each active spatio-temporal summary we aggregate the most frequent items using the SpaceSaving algorithm Active summaries maintain a 002xed number  m  of items and their counts while archived summaries are compacted by keeping only the counters for the k most frequent terms Choosing a value for m represents a trade-off between storage size and result accuracy HT In each active spatio-temporal summary we maintain a full list of terms using a hash table Once the summary becomes inactive and is archived its time granularity passes the list is sorted and cleaned up by discarding all but the counters for the targeted topk terms This approach maintains the exact topk items at all spatio-temporal granularities and serves to measure the accuracy of the other approaches However since HT has excessive storage requirements we do not expect it to scale under the considered workloads D The Space Versus Accuracy Trade-Off In the 002rst set of experiments we evaluate the accuracy of our approach by comparing it with the baselines Since HT maintains the exact counts at all granularities its storage requirements are too high for large scale experiments Similarly SS maintains a 002xed number m of counters at all granularities and m cannot be set too high for large scale experiments Thus we consider only tweets occurring in the spatial region with the 11S grid zone designator a region in the US of size ca 900 002 550 km 2  We use the local machine We consider variants of SS where m is set to 50 100 and 200 In AFIA we set targeted k to 50 The 002rst week four days in May is used for warm-up and only the accuracies of the subsequent summaries are evaluated We perform topk queries on all summaries at each spatio-temporal granularity We compare the topk most frequent terms in each summary produced by AFIA and SS and compare with the corresponding topk items produced by HT We set k  20  156 


a Total number of active cells b Terms per hour per 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 cell c Terms per week per 100 002 100 km 2 cell Fig 9 Twitter Workload Intensity at Different Spatio-Temporal Granularities The results are shown in Figure 10 We measure the fraction of correct topk for varying spatial granularities and we report separate graph for each temporal granularity The coarser spatio-temporal summaries are subject to higher loads and more diverse terms At the 002nest granularity 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 in Figure 10a all approaches produce quite accurate results However as the spatial or temporal granularity gets coarser the accuracy of SS deteriorates Increasing m does not solve the problem but just postpones it On the other hand AFIA is virtually as accurate as HT at all spatial and temporal granularities Its Aggressive Increment procedure is effective in making it adapt its number of counters as needed to capture the most frequent items very accurately Due to checkpointing when several summaries have to be merged few topk terms are missed and we did not observe accuracies below 0.99 0.98 and 0.97 for hours days and weeks respectively Figure 11 reports the average number of counters maintained per summary in the same experiment Note the logscaled y-axis The 002gure con\002rms the impracticality of using HT in large scale scenarios SS maintains a 002xed number of counters The 002gure shows how AFIA adapts At hours and days Figures 11a\22611b AFIA follows SS  m  100  implying that on average 100 counters is enough to achieve the desired accuracy At weeks Figures 11c the adaptivity of AFIA is even clearer for 002ner cells it uses much fewer counters than for coarser cells This experiment shows how AFIA achieves the best of two worlds accuracy is at the level of HT which is 100 accurate while the space requirements are at the level of SS with a small number of counters Having demonstrated the accuracy of our approach we proceed to large scale performance experiments on the HMC machine E Varying targeted k In this experiment we vary targeted k and consider two cases where the 002nest spatial granularity is 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 and 1 002 1 km 2  For each case we also maintain all the coarser granularities Figure 12 shows the results AFIA always has a throughput of more than 13,000 items per second Figure 12a As expected the throughput increases as either targeted k decreases or the 002nest granularity becomes more coarse Figure 12b shows how the memory consumption increases with increasing targeted k  This is because increasing numbers of counters have to be maintained to guarantee correctness when there are more terms The memory consumption increases slowly at 002rst due to fewer checkpoints occurring Figure 12c Thus for small values of targeted k  much of the space consumption is due to checkpoints As expected more memory is required for maintaining 002ner granularities The results show that a single HMC machine can maintain between 2 and 3 months of data meaning that it takes 4 to 6 machines to support a full year At current costs 1  this is feasible for larger companies Note that the measured memory consumption represents the entire Java heap memory used by the application The actual aggregates not shown require much less When targeted k is set to a low value the number of required counters will most often also be low With only a few counters any small change in activity of a cell may impact the targeted k counters resulting in a checkpoint Therefore we see that the number of checkpoints decreases with targeted k  Having a high number of counters makes a cell more robust to changes in activity and any small changes can be captured without checkpoints The number of checkpoints increases as expected when a 002ner granularity is maintained F Varying Q:R and Q:T We 002x targeted k at 100 and vary the spatial and temporal extents of the queries We employ the two query sets and measure the average runtime Figures 13a and 13b show the results Retrieving a summary requires one or more constant time lookups in Algorithm 3 Line 3 depending on the spatial or temporal granularity of the query and it may also require the merging of checkpointed summaries Because 002ner granularity cells generally receive fewer items than coarser granularity cells the runtime is lower at 002ner granularities Fewer merges are required because more cells are empty The results show that this applies to both the spatial and the temporal granularities When the spatial extent increases more lookups are performed resulting in an expected higher runtime With more coarse temporal granularities more merges are performed increasing the runtime further The runtime is not made worse  1 The price for a Spot Instance in June 2013 was USD 0.343 per hour 157

Fig 14 Checkpoints Over Time V C ONCLUSIONS We present a new framework for the processing of spatiotemporally constrained topk most popular terms queries on streaming spatio-temporally tagged text content such as microblog posts The framework's index extends existing techniques for counting frequent items in summaries to allow the summaries to grow and shrink dynamically to adapt to changes in the incoming data Query processing works by merging relevant summaries To provide guarantees about the query results a new merging algorithm is proposed that supports spatio-temporal query regions Experimental studies with an implementation of the framework offers insight into the accuracy scalability and performance of the processing of incoming data and queries and they demonstrate that the framework is capable of offering very accurate query results at high performance at scale A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported in part by the MADALGO research center and in part by the

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
