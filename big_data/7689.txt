1 INTRODUCTION 
2 3 In the general normalization the proportion of different gases in total gas concentrations is normalized This method corresponds to the feature that gas content in oil reflects failure type and has real physical meaning But the potentially valuable information contained by some minor components tends to be neglected as a result of gas content feature Cumulative frequency normalization strengthens the dispersion of samples which makes samples distribute in the interval 0 and has strong mathematical meaning However this method only compares the same kind 
of gas longitudinally without considering gases concentration in the same group So the physical meaning is unclear Consequently finding a new normalized method which can not only strengthen the typical gas's characteristic of DGA but also differentiate samples in different conditions plays a key role in the improvement of accuracy of neural network diagnoses 
Dealing with the advantages and disadvantages of general normalization two new normalized methods which

named characteristic normalization and mix normalization are presented in this paper The process of characteristic normalization is The input data of such pattern Based on the analysis results of dissolved gases contents in transformer oil the failure diagnosis problem can be solved effectively by using artificial neural network In practical analysis of DGA  the sensitivity reflected by different typical gases has big difference For example the content of C2H2 in transformer 
oil is usually less but it must be strictly monitored once it appears Conversely the content of H2 is comparatively high but its reflection to failure is less sensitive Therefore the potentially valuable information contained by some minor components will be neglected if the results of contents of DGA are treated directly as the input of neural network It indicates that the differences between data must be decreased by using normalized treatment in order to normalized as follows can be 


3 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CP NEURAL NETWORKS Cf4k Cf4k Cf4k Cf4k A k  Eq.\(I shows that after the treatment of characteristic normalization H2 reflects the content of H2 in hydrogen hydrocarbon and various kinds of gases reflect their contents in hydrocarbon gas  indicates that the content of H2 in hydrogen hydrocarbon and the contents of various kinds of gases in hydrocarbon gas are closely related with the failure type of power transformer Therefore the characteristic normalization has strong physical meaning Meanwhile because the content of H2 in typical gas is likely to be comparatively high Eq.\(I normalized hydrocarbon gas by using the ratio of hydrocarbon gas and total hydrocarbon gas instead of the ratio of hydrocarbon gas and hydrogen hydrocarbon After such treatment some valuable information won't be neglected because data of hydrocarbon gas is too tiny So the characteristic normalization also has strong mathematical meaning For the cause of typical gas is complicated it is difficult to well differentiate certain failure only by a single treatment of these three methods So mix normalization is presented The process of mix normalization is H 2 k H 2 k H 2 k 2 k k Cf4k C14 k  4 k Cf4 I CICED2008 Technical Session 1 Distribution network equipment r-H r-H H2 in input samples is probabilistically normalized C2H2 C2H4 CH4 and C2H6 are characteristically normalized as follows by characteristic normalization Therefore mix normalization enhances the mathematical meaning of the algorithm In view of the fact that different dissolved typical gases in oil react differently to various failure types it is improper to identify all kinds of failures by uniform input vector for a single neural network model To realize better classification it's desirable to distinguish failures by using step-by-step division Based on this consideration the article refers to the gradual-judgment compound neural network pattern The Fig.I shows its structure Because the problem that whether the nature of overheating failure refers to solid insulation certainty by analysis of gas in oil has not been satisfactorily  it is more suitable to take H2 CH4 C2H6 C2H4 and C2H2 as network model input To well reflect the physical premonition of failure point e.g overheating discharge etc it is more proper to take high-temperature overheating low-temperature overheating arc discharge and spark discharge as network model output The structure figure for compound neural networks model of power transformer is shown in Fig.I 2 Spark Discharg high-temperature low-temperature overheating The definition of mix normalization shows that treating hydrocarbon gas by using the ratio of hydrocarbon gas and hydrogen hydrocarbon and H2 by using probabilistic normalization can prevent the complexity generated by H2 It is difficult to find the distinction between some failures only 2 Fig.I The structurefigure for compoundneural networksmodel of power transformer 2 2 r_R 6 k 2 H 2 k C 2H 2 k CH 4 k C 2H 4 k C 2H 6 k

We proposed a new dissemination protocol to guarantee D ata A ccessibility W ithin N hops, called the DAWN protocol, which is semi-proactive. The performance of the semi-proactive method was evaluated and compared with SPIN DAWN simultaneously takes into account three properties, namely high residual energy level, the ideal transmitted distance, and the small overlapped area of the transmission radius, to select backbone nodes for efficient data dissemination. Using the backbone nodes thus some nodes, such as arbitrary sink nodes, which want the data, are able to easily obtain the data within n hops. The sink node accesses the data within 1-hop in the previous proactive protocols, however, the energy loss of some nodes, which do not need it, is undoubtedly very high. Contrarily, if the only relatively few sink nodes suffer just within n hops in the proposed protocol, then the obtained benefit for energy consumption is very efficient  Acknowledgment  We are grateful to Youngsub Lee for supporting simulation.

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds.
