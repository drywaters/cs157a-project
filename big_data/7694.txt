With the abundant amount of information available on the World Wide Web \(WWW\traction of useful knowledge from the web has become a major issue and as a result has gained significant attention among researchers in data mining and knowledge discovery areas. Extensible Markup Language XML\as emerged as the dominant standard for describing and exchanging data on the web. XML data mining becomes a complex task because of the flexible nature of structural and semantical xml data. This makes mining from XML document a challenging task compared to traditional association rule mining in relational databases 
Since, last decade we experienced anexponential increase in the amount of publicly available data. Nowadays, Ecommerce is becoming more and more popular and eases of selling and purchasing in online mode has attracted the end users. This again adds up to the amount of data available on web. With the enormous amount of data stored in databases and other repositories, there isextensive need to develop powerful means to acquire knowledge from this structured data. This knowledge can be used for decision making in complex business problems and other areas of research. XML Extensible Markup Language\was first presented by The World Wide Web Consortium o sy st e m a t i ze t h e da t a  exchange format over the web and at the same time achieve 
interoperability between diverse technologies and tools involved As a result extracting knowledge from XML data repositories turned into a very important and necessary characteristic More efficient ways to traverse the data needs to be developed to get the desired information. Many algorithms are developed for traversing but need to be equipped to handle scalable data Most of the algorithms to mine XML data proposed till date rely on customary relational databasewith an XML interface Classification, Regression, Decision Rules, Decision trees Clustering are the many more approaches which are adapted in data mining. Among them, association rules[2 a v e b een  found to be useful especially in the area of discovering

Frequent Pattern Growth Approach 
 
Frequent patterns are mined from an FP-tree using a method called FP-growth. All the node-links from the header table are

traversed to generate complete frequentpatterns.  The general idea is to create conditional pattern bases depending on the support threshold and in turn generate rules based on minimum confidence The limitation of the algorithm is that it can mine only the set of items for which path expression can be written.  Because of the complexity and irregular structure of XML, implementing 2014 IEEE

The GPU provides a means to exploit massive amount of parallelism with even a single processor. The GPU has a significantly different design than a CPU. A GPU has many more processing cores than a CPU. Each processing core can manage many threads at once. A thread is a sequence of programmed instructions or operations. The processing unit\220s scheduling system manages the threads. The scheduler on a GPU can handle millions of threads, each of which can be charged with processing a separate row from a table Thousands of such threads can then be scheduled to execute simultaneously. Different from multi-core CPUs, the cores on the GPU are virtualized, and GPU threads are executed in SIMD \(Single Instruction, Multiple Data\d in turn are managed by the hardware. This is advantageous in speeding up and simplifying the parallel processing since programs are unconscious about physical cores and rely onhardware for thread management. In current scenario, the computation power of GPU is an order of magnitude higher than multiple core CPU. In past several attempts have been made to speed up the mining process by using multiple processors , simultaneous multithreading processors and using shared as well as distributed memory. The motivation behind using GPGPU\(General purpose graphical processing unit\ is it is very cost effective in comparison to the earlier methods used for parallel processing. We design a GPU-CPU co-processing algorithm, with the basic mining operations done on the CPU and parallelizing work such as pre-processing sorting of itemset done on the GPU                2014 5th International ConferenceCon\337uence The Next Generation Information Technology Summit Con\337uence Extensive study of literature on XML mining as well as Association rule mining suggests that lot of work is done separately both on xml mining as well as frequent itemset mining. But there is still scope for parallelizing both the processes in amalgamation with High Performance Computing This is the need of the hour since scalable data need to be handled efficiently in order to address the issue of computational speed In e a u t h ors propos e an  i m prov ed f ra m e w ork f o r m i n i n g  xml documents using XQuery and Apriori based approach The algorithm was not efficient in terms of time factor but worked well but work well for one transaction s e s a hierarchical approach HILoP \(Hierarchical layered structure of PairSet\The use of such data structure avoids numerous XML data scans to mine Association Rules from a Collection of XML Documents.

We note down these positions in a separate variable. Let the starting indices for the above xml files are as follows 129, 1103, 1198 Note that there are 2 transactions but 3 indices are noted down.

A indices of the first transaction. However, this gets conveniently ignored during the next few phases Step 3: In the next phase we pass the large character array and indices to the GPU and the GPU kernel is invoked. Blocks and threads are spawned on the GPU in such a manner that each block has 100 threads and each thread handles a unique transaction. So, if there are 1000 transactions, a total of 10 blocks will be spawned and each block will have 100 threads Thus we will have 10*100 = 1000 threads Each thread handles its own transaction. In this way all transactions can be processed simultaneously Once in the GPU, each thread then works on each set of transactions as indicated by the indices. Thus, there is no overlapping of search domains Step 4: Each thread in the GPU then locates and saves the Item mentioned between the tags <Item> and </Item In our case, thread 1 will work on transaction between indices 129 \205 1103 while thread 2 will work on the transaction between indices 1103 \205 1198 An example is illustrated as below The first transaction has 2 items: pencil & paper The second transaction has 3 items: pear, napkins and mobile Step 5: Once located, the item is then converted into a number by adding up all its ASCII values and storing this sum in a 2D integer array representing all the transactions. This mapping is then stored in another variable for reconversion back into the original string at a later stage Alternate mapping strategies may be used as well. In our mapping, the mapping produced is as follows        from the GPU to the host device. This is bus independent of than floating point operations dataset was tested on Intel Xeon E5-2620 \(6 cores, 12 threads clear increase in performance can be observed with the The resulting 2D integer array generated can then be passed on to the PSP algorithm  2014 5th International ConferenceCon\337uence The Next Generation Information Technology Summit Con\337uence B ENCHMARK AND R ESULTS  on the GPU. This time span also includes the calling overhead where left=the starting index of the part of the array and right the end index of the  part of the array. In this manner, the different blocks in the GPU do not use the same location in the array thus making all the blocks work on disjointed sets of the flattened array 1000 blocks, each with a single thread inside it, are called. The blockId is used to determine the starting position inside the 1D array and blockId + Y is used to determine the ending point Each block, knowing its starting and ending point, sorts that small part of the huge 1D array and writes the sorted section to the empty 1D array that was previously created in the same starting and ending position as the original array. The empty array is thus populated with the entries of the original array but sorted in ascending order.

The CUDA code implemented for sorting an array is done in the following way The initial input is read into a 2D character array. The frequency of each character is then found through a scan of the 2D array. The characters that do not meet the minimum threshold support count are eliminated from the array. This 2D integer array is then flattened into a 1D integer array as shown in the code below. This array is passed on to the GPU for sorting   The GPU addresses the flattened array as      intidx=blockIdx.x*Y+threadIdx.x int left=idx int right=left+Y-1 generated.

This is because we cannot consider whole data and must identify when a data becomes obsolete or invalid As the old information of a data stream may be no longer useful or possibly invalid at present.  In order to support various requirements of mining data stream, the mining window or the interesting recent range of a data stream needs not to be defined static but must be flexible. Based on this range, a data mining method can be able to identify when a transactions becomes stale or needs to be disregarded  In this paper, we have investigated the problem of mining frequent itemset over data stream using flexible size sliding window model and proposed a new algorithm for this problem. The size of sliding window is adaptively adjusted based on the amount of observed concept change in the underlying properties of incoming data stream. The size of window enlarges or increase when there is no significant amount of change observed. While the window size reduced or decrease when there is considerable amount of concept change or significant change in set of frequent itemsets occurs Based on the value of given by user, the size of window is being controlled. After every pane insertion the set of frequent itemsets are updated and value of concept change is calculated. If the value exceeds the given minimum change threshold the window gets smaller by deleting all the obsolete information before a point defined called checkmark  Experimental results shows that our algorithm tracks the concept change efficiently while mining data stream and is more adaptive to recent frequent itemsets than fixed size sliding window models or time fading window models. For the future work, we are trying to enhance the performance by using fuzzy sets for minimum change threshold value so that the values like low, medium, high and very high instead of certain value between ranges of 0 to 1 R EFERENCES  1                    H.

Our experiments show that YAFIM is about 18 faster than Apriori algorithms implemented in MapReduce framework Furthermore, we can achieve a better performance in both sizeup and speedup for different datasets. In addition, we also evaluated YAFIM for medical application and revealed that YAFIM outperforms MRApriori about 25 speedup  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is funded in part by China NSF Grants \(No 61223003\, and the USA Intel Labs University Research Program R EFERENCES  1
