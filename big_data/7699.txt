On the use of interwoven order of oncoming packets for reliable underw ater acoustic data transfer Oleksiy Kebkal EvoLogics GmbH Berlin Germany Email lesha@evologics.de Abstract 227 Physical properties of hydroacoustic communication channels differ essentially from those of conventional terrestrial radio channels videlicet the channel is characterized by the long propagation delays limited bandwidth extremely complex and quickly varying reverberation and half duplex nature of underwater acoustic modems This motivates a substantial redesign of the algorithms and techniques of the underwater data transfer concerning both physical and data link layers especially concerning the development of underwater acoustic 
sensor networks In this paper the task of point-to-point data transfer is addressed Since the task seems to be simple it captures the most important characteristics of the hydroacoustic channel and is the most practical case for the use of underwater acoustic modems nowadays Conventional protocols of reliable data transfer suffer from the long propagation delays of acoustic signals The protocols spend the major amount of time waiting for packets with acknowledgments This results in a poor ef\002ciency of the channel utilization The use of more complex solutions namely the packet train transmission or rate-less coding allows one to improve the ef\002ciency of the data transfer and to reduce the energy consumption signi\002cantly But in the case of packet train transmission the optimal number of packets in a train 
should have quite a high value Moreover in the case of the transmission of a packet sequence coded with rate-less code the feedback channel is either excluded or used to send a 223stop\224 message from the receiver side after the transmission of a big number of packets This results in a partial or complete elimination of the feedback channel blocking the remote side from oncoming data transfer The elimination of the feedback channel excludes a possibility to send urgent data from the receiver side as well as a possibility for the combination of an underwater acoustic modem with some other devices using the same bandwidth for instance position tracking devices Moreover this excludes a possibility of the parameter adaptation on a physical layer 
during the data transmission which is necessary f or the ef\002cient data transmission for given channel parameters The described restriction can be lifted with the use of the interwoven order of oncoming packets The idea is to measure the propagation delay between communicating devices during handshaking and then to send the data packets continuously one after another by interrupting only to accept the control packet from the opposite side at the estimated time of arrival The propagation delay change tracking during the data transfer is also possible and highly important for the communication between moving stations This makes the data transfer protocol fully propagationdelay-tolerant and returns the feedback channel which can be used to deliver acknowledgments and other urgent control data 
from the receiver side In the present paper the ef\002ciency of conventional methods and advanced methods of data transfer using the interwoven order of packets are compared In this analysis the task of data transfer is divided into two subtasks The 002rst one is to send a 002le namely the a priori speci\002ed amount of data and the second is to send a byte stream where the amount of data to transfer is not known by the modem initially I I NTRODUCTION Underwater technologies are rapidly improved during the last decades and induce in turn a further advance in underwater communication Challenges of hydroacoustic communication and particularly those of underwater acoustic sensor net 
working technologies attract a growing number of researchers Nevertheless the underwater acoustic networks are still in its infancy and its usability in practice remains considerably restricted On the other hand for the major number of practical applications including the data exchange with autonomous underwater vehicles and the uploading of sensor data from ocean bottom observatories the primarily reliable ef\002cient point-to-point communication is needed Since the task seems to be simple it captures the most important characteristics of the hydroacoustic channel and is the most practical case for the use of underwater acoustic modems nowadays The conventional protocols of reliable data transfer suffer from the long propagation delays of acoustic signals The protocols 
spend the major amount of time waiting for packets with acknowledgments This results in a poor ef\002ciency of the channel utilization In the ability to compensate the long propag ation delay s by means of the packet train transmission with the subsequent acknowledging delivery of packets in a train over a feedback channel has been studied Work introduced the idea of the interwoven order of oncoming packets This technique makes the data transfer fully propagation-delay-tolerant In  se v eral protocols of reliable point-to-point data tra nsfer are reviewed wherein protocols based on the use of rate-less codes are favored However the review doesn't include the technique of interwoven order of packets and contains some inaccuracies 
This paper contains a more comprehensive review of the protocols of reliable data exchange for hydroacoustic channels analysis of their ef\002ciency and applicability to practical tasks Protocol ef\002ciency is usually estimated in relation to the time required to deliver some 002xed data volume The less the delivery time the more effective is the protocol This seemingly simple de\002nition hides serious methodological issues related to the ef\002ciency intercomparison for different underwater communication techniques On the one hand the optimal bitrate depends on a structure of the intersymbol interference 


Doppler shift signal-to-noise ratio and other characteristics of a hydroacoustic channel and may rapidly 003uctuate even in the channels with stationary 002xed nodes Thus the physical layer implementation including its modulation/demodulation and synchronization techniques has decisive impact on the time required to deliver data On the other hand the reliability of data exchange and the channel utilization ef\002ciency with given bitrate and bit error rate are determined by the data link layer implementation what is the subject of investigation in this paper Let's de\002ne the channel utilization ef\002ciency similarly to  3 as the ratio of the data v olume per gi v en bitrate to the average duration of a data delivery The probability of a synchronization error is assumed to be negligible This parameter determines the in\003uence of a propagation delay on the data link layer protocol In practice the channel utilization ef\002ciency is not so important for the better part of real applications as bit delivery costs that vary depending on the energy consumption in the transmission/receiving and idle listening modes bitrate protocol overhead and the channel utilization ef\002ciency The bit delivery costs can be de\002ned as 017  T T N T X   T S 000 T T  N RX F  1 where N T X  N RX consumed power in transmission and receiving modes respectively and T T period of time spent for the signal transmission needed to deliver F bits of data with a data exchange session duration T S  The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II describes a packet train acknowledgment protocol the most common means of channel utilization ef\002ciency maximization Section III describes a protocol based on rate-less codes where a feedback channel is not required Section IV analyzes the ef\002ciency increase of the previously considered protocols using the interwoven-order technique Finally Section V concludes the paper with consideration of practical issues concerning the choice of a protocol for real applications II P ACKET T RAIN A CKNOWLEDGMENT P ROTOCOL The simplest protocol of reliable data transfer is an individual packet acknowledgment protocol where the data are split into packets and transmitted singly An acknowledgement is expected after every sequent packet transmission If the acknowledgment doesn't arrive during the estimated round trip time the packet considered to be lost and its transmission is repeated The receiving side transmits acknowledgments on every received packet and drops all duplicated and erroneous packets This is the most ineffective data transmission schema because the long propagation delay of acoustic signals implies long periods of idle listening before the acknowledge arrival and results respectively in a poor ef\002ciency of the channel utilization The ef\002ciency of this protocol can be considerably improved by means of the packet train transmission rather than by sending a single packet Receiver using the identi\002cator from a packet header schedules the acknowledgment transmission time after the successful reception of at least one packet from the train As the number of packets in the train increases the channel utilization ef\002ciency increases arbitrarily close to its limit The pack et train ackno wledgment protocol has been taken as the starting point of the investigation since the individual packet acknowledgment protocol is its special case Let H be the length of a packet header L be the length of a data payload in a packet and M be the number of packets in a train As in let s assume that a pack et consists of a header and a data payload and an acknowledgment consists of a header and a bit array of length M  where each bit denotes the result of a particular data packet reception In the header every packet includes its number in the train Let R be the bitrate D be the distance between communicating nodes c be the average sound speed in the channel and F be the size of a data volume to be delivered The data volume is split into the packets such that N  d F=L e 031 F=L where F 035 L 2 Let p be the probability of the bit error in a packet Then the probability of the correct packet reception for a packet of length H  L is P D  1 000 p  H  L  3 and that for an acknowledgment packet is P T A  1 000 p  H  M  4 The probability of the event that at least one packet from the train and the acknowledgment packet are successfully received is P T  1 000 1 000 P D  M  P T A  5 Assuming a packet processing time is negligible the single cycle duration of a packet train and the acknowledgment exchange is T 1  M H  L R  H  M R  2 D c  6 The ackno wledgment reception failure means that either a receiver was unable to receive at least one packet from the train or a transmitter failed to receive the acknowledgment packet Relation 5 implies that when the train length increases the probability of the failure on the transmitter side increases and that on the receiver side decreases We assume in the both cases that the train transmission is repeated The receiver aggregates the repeated and originally transmitted trains and sends a joint acknowledgment of both packet trains For the transmission of the same packet train k times the average number of successfully received packets is m k and the acknowledgment reception probability exactly after the k th transmission of the packet train are 


m k  M 1 000 1 000 P D  k   7 p k  P T 1 000 P T  k 000 1  8 Then the mean number of successfully received packets and the average train transmission time for the above-de\002ned transmission schema are M T  1 X k 1 m k p k  9 T T  1 X k 1 kT 1 p k  10 Disregarding the fact that the last train may be incomplete we obtain the average data delivery session duration T S 031 T T N M T 11 and the channel utilization ef\002ciency 021 T  F=R T S 031 LM T RT T  12 The bit delivery cost for this protocol is 017 T  T T X N T X   T S 000 T T X  N RX F  13 where T T X  1 X k  1 kN H  L R p k 14 is the time spent for the signal transmission With M 002xed the ef\002ciency and the bit delivery cost are dominated by the header size and the propagation delay when L is small Increasing L helps to improve the ef\002ciency and the bit delivery cost till the packet reception probability remains high At large values of L  the packet reception probability is a decisive factor for the ef\002ciency to decrease and for the bit delivery cost to increase The optimal packet length value corresponds to some intermediate value where the ef\002ciency is maximal and the bit delivery cost is minimal However the optimal packet lengths for the ef\002ciency and the cost don't coincide Figure 1 shows the ef\002ciency and the bit delivery costs for various values of D  p  and M with H  16 bits R  10 kbps c  1500 m=s  Higher ef\002ciency values are achievable with a longer train when the propagation delay in\003uence can be considerably decreased Thus 021 T value decreases only by 5 after changing the distance from 1 km to 5 km with p  10 000 4  M  1000  and by 18 with a shorter train M  10  even with lower bit error rate p  10 000 5  The ef\002ciency 021 T reaches 93  5 and 95  6 with p  10 000 5  M  1000  D  5 km and D  1 km  respectively With p  10 000 4  the high ef\002ciency values are also reachable at the expense of the essential train lengthening and the packet shrinking 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1        Packet Length \(L, bits Efficiency h T    10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 4 10 2 10 0 10 2 10 4 10 6 10 8 10 10 10 12 10 14   Packet Length \(L, bits Bit delivery costs e T J/bit   p = 10 4 M = 10, D = 1 km p = 10 5 M = 10, D = 1 km  p = 10 4 M = 10 3 D = 1 km  p = 10 5 M = 10 3 D = 1 km  p = 10 4 M = 10, D = 5 km p = 10 5 M = 10, D = 5 km  p = 10 4 M = 10 3 D = 5 km  p = 10 5 M = 10 3 D = 5 km  p = 10 3 M = 10, D = 1 km p = 10 3 M = 10 3 D = 5 km p = 10 4 M = 10, D = 1 km  p = 10 5 M = 10, D = 1 km  Fig 1 Ef\002ciency of packet train acknowledgement protocol For bit delivery costs the bit error rate is the dominating factor whereas the propagation delay and the train length are of secondary importance The packet train acknowledgement protocol proposed in  assumes implicitly that in the case of ackno wledgement reception failure all unacknowledged packets are dropped Let's name this version as oblivious protocol In this paper we assume that a receiver combines all retransmissions of a packet train Let's name it as stingy protocol It is possible to prove that a stingy protocol doesn't increase hardware requirements and is preferable for implementations In Fig 2 we plot the ef\002ciencies for these two versions of the protocol with p  10 000 3  p  10 000 4  p  10 000 5  The stingy version achieves a higher ef\002ciency and lower bit delivery costs The ef\002ciency difference increases with the bit error rate III A P ROTOCOL B ASED ON R ATE LESS C ODES An alternative to the above-described protocol is a protocol based on rate-less codes  This is a ne w class of error control codes for erasure channels The sender may generate a virtually in\002nite sequence of encoded packets based on the data volume consisting of N packets The data on the receiver side may be reconstructed using an arbitrary subset of size N 0 of this sequence where N 0 by a few percent greater than N for large N depending on the particular rate-less code Using this code the sender may stop the data transmission if he/she has decided that the reception probability of the data volume is high enough or after receiving some kind of a 223stop\224 packet from the receiver side In the second schema taking the halfduplex nature of an underwater link into account the feedback channel has to be reserved in the time division mode

6 Safety Properties There are a variety of different semantics and models for CSP processes We concentrate on the trace model and the failure model in this work In a trace model a process is represented by the sequences of communications or events it can perform In the stable failures model a process is represented by its failures A failure for a process P  is given by a pair  s X   where s is a trace of P and X is a set of things it can refuse to perform after performing s  We intend to provide some desired safety and liveness properties for the hospital AIDC system We will provide the speciìcations for a CSP process by providing the most nondeterministic process satisfying the speciìcation The CSP process for a hospital AIDC system satisìes a speciìcation S if the CSP process P representing the speciìcation is reìned by the AIDC system process We will consider two different types of reìnement trace reìnement for safety properties and failure reìnement for liveness properties  A process Q is a trace reìnement of another process P  denoted by P  T Q if traces  Q   traces  P   A process Q is a failure reìnement of another process P  denoted by P  F Q if failures  Q   F failures  P   If we have a process P and its safety speciìcation S and we have S  T P  then we can say P is a safe process as all its traces are traces of the speciìcation so no bad event can be performed by P  Similarly failure reìnement can be used to express liveness properties We now express the environment of a hospital AIDC system as the collection of all the identiìcation tags representing the devices and patients and the devices sending out the readings for patients together with the electronic records system These are the given components which we cannot control Given   d  Dev Dev  d     p  Pat Pat  p   BTDevs  EHR We shall refer to the combination of all instances of nurses and medical mediators as the system It is important that only one nurse have use a medical mediator at a time This is reîected in our speciìcation by allowing each medical mediator to choose a nurse System   m   n  Nurse  n m     y  x.y  HCI n m x    Med  n m     y  x.y  EHRCh m x    EHRInterface   y 012 nmpdx y   RFIDChan n p x  y   EHRBECh m x  y   BTAddr n,m d x  y   BTScan m x   System In the system we hide away almost all internal and interelement communication The only events that we are interested in are the actual scanning of patient and device identiìer tags and the ultimate sending of the medical measurement to the EHR for storage after it has been veriìed by the nurse We now provide the safety speciìcation for the hospital AIDC system where the speciìcation ensures that if a tuple of data is entered into a database stating that a particular device d was used to take a reading x from a patient p by a nurse n  then it had been the case that the nurse n did identify p and d and had taken a medical measurement x from the patient p using d after identifying them Safety   m   n  p  d  RFIDChan n,m p  IDnum  p     RFIDChan n,m d  IDnum  d      RFIDChan n,m d  IDnum  d     RFIDChan n,m p  IDnum  p      Skip   BTScan m  X   Skip   if BTAddr n,m d  X then  BTAddr n,m d  r   Skip  EHRBECh m   n m IDnum  p   IDnum  d  EHR  r   Skip  else Skip  Safety Now we are ready to specify the desired safety and liveness properties Let Vis   y   ndx.y  RFIDChan n,m d x     mz.y  EHRBECh m z    The properties then are as follows Safety    Vis    Given  T System    Vis    Given LIVE  F System    Vis    Given where LIVE   x x  LIVE  LIVE is the most nondeterministic process that is deadlock free The rst property states that no wrong random non-associated tuple gets stored in EHR and the second property states that the nurse can eventually take steps and will not get deadlocked We have sketched proofs for the above results based on their semantics using traces of events Due to the large number of cases to be considered we feel that such a proof is easily subject to accidental omissions and hence is best checked by automated assistant To this end we have encoded the CSP processes described in this paper two such tools The rst system we used was the fully automated CSP failures-reìned prover FDR2 Failures-Divergence Reìnement Our e xperience with this system is limited but a straightforward encoding led the system to run for hours probably indicating divergence The second system we used was the extension CSP-prover to the interacti v e theorem pro v e r Isabelle In this system there is a restricted type system for communications and the encoding entailed creating a number of functions for coercing data into this type system Also certain operators were lacking Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


index interleaving in particular and so we had to expand the code to accommodate this lack As of this writing the proofs in CSP-prover of the above two results are incomplete We conclude from this effort that there are interesting challenges to automating proofs of AIDC workîows such as the ones for the mediator To summarize these results in less technical language there are three possibilities for the outcome of operator actions First there are actions that make progress by providing proper updates of the EHR This will occur when the nurse adheres to the speciìed workîow Second there are actions that lie within the protection envelope but do not make progress For example repeated reading of a patientês tag is tolerated by the system although it is not the speciìed workîow A detected error occurs when reading tags on two devices rather than on a patient and a device Third there are actions that corrupt the EHR database These require signiìcant deviation from speciìed workîow such as reading the tag on one patient and then collecting a reading from a different patient 7 Related Work We are not aware of any prior work on formal modeling and analysis of ADIC workîows in health care but formal techniques have been applied to workîows in general there have been case studies in heath care applications and there is a signiìcant body of non-formal work on AIDC in health care Yong et al in use CSP to model and reìne workîows to prove correctness properties Puhlmann et al  use the  calculus to model workîow patterns Stafansen sho ws ho w the Calculus of Communicating Systems CCS can be used to model workîow Davulcu et al  use Concurrent T ransaction Logic CTR to specify analyze and schedule workîows Van der Alast et al  use Petri nets to model w orkîo w  Petri nets are able to model Yet Another Workîow Language\(YAWL which in turn can model a wide range of workîow patterns Barkaoui et al  use Petri nets to model v erify and improve an operating room workîow Song et al 22 provide a classiìcation of computer-aided health care workîows and workîow application issues Van der Alast et al  describes a method for nding w orkîo ws as Petri nets automatically from hospital process logs Ardissono et al  present a frame w ork for the management of context-aware workîow systems They use the framework to develop a prototype application handling medical guidelines specifying workîow for monitoring patients treated with blood thinners In our research on AIDC we attempted to use  calculus and Finite State Machines FSMs before concluding that CSP was better-suited to our needs because of its algebraic notation simple treatment of communication and its representation for internal and external choice However it is likely other models discussed above could provide good formalisms for reasoning about AIDC AIDC techniques are now being used in many different areas in the health care sector One notable area is the use of AIDC techniques for the blood management to reduce blood handling errors so that the chances of bad blood transfusions is reduced Clarke et al 7 model and verify an in-patient blood transfusion process Al Nahas et al  o v ervie w research in v arious applications of RFID-based AIDC systems in hospitals Automated identiìcation of patients pro vides more accurate and efìcient association of patients with their medical readings and the medical procedures they should undergo AIDC techniques are being deployed to provide error-free and fully-audited drug management in hospitals 4 Hospital-wide AIDC 9 10 is being investigated for tracking patients assets and staff 8 Conclusion We have introduced a methodology for modeling and analyzing AIDC workîows to provide high assurance protection envelopes Such techniques will aid the development of computer and networking systems that support AIDC in safety-critical workîows like those used in hospitals To illustrate and demonstrate the value of our approach we have designed and implemented a medical mediator system which provides RFID identiìcation using a mobile device that links to medical devices to collect patient readings and enters them automatically in the EHR of the correct patient within wellspeciìed and veriìed conditions This is the rst work on formal analysis of AIDC workîows it contributes insight into good primitives for clear speciìcations in this area and promises wide applicability Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by NSF CNS 07-16626 NSF CNS 07-16421 NSF CNS 05-24695 ONR N00014-08-1-0248 NSF CNS 05-24516 DHS 2006-CS-001-000001 and grants from the MacAruthur Foundation and Boeing Corporation Anh Nguyen was supported by a fellowship from the Vietnam Education Foundation The views expressed are those of the authors only References  FDR2\(F ailures-Di v e r gence Reìnement internet website http://www.fsel.com  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10

  12 the PL is intended to fulfill, thus many requirements and specifications that would be found in a PL design specification would need to be provided by the specific PL procurement agency. The ORS Phase III standards can be downloaded from http://projects.nrl.navy.mil/busstandards  Communications Interfaces  A key external interface for th e space segment \(bus and PL is RF communications to the ground. This topic investigated standardization for SC command and control \(C&C communications link and the tactical communication link Figure 11 presents a basic high-level view of the RF communications pathways envisioned in the standards Other issues investigated related to both current and future approaches the military is planning for RF communications including, data flow, frequency band definitions modulation techniques, data rates, communication security COMSEC\and basic defi nition of ground interface locations. Given the current maturity of the general military SC C&C network, the presen t SGLS architecture and the expected Unified S-Band \(USB\architecture were established as the standard. Fo r the tactical links, standard UHF was established for LDR application, and the Common Data Link \(CDL\ocol was established as the HDR standard Ground Support Checkout Interface In support of the rapid call-up scenario, standards for interfacing spacecraft bus and the payload, and processing the integrated space vehicle though launch, is one of the unique activities under the IS ET derived ORS system design. The need to develop an approach for this effort in sufficient detail in order to derive requirements that would influence the spacecraft bus design is critical. The approaches developed have design and manufacturing ramification on the bus, such as the ability to install batteries late in the flow, rapid \223built-in-test\224 capabilities periodic checks, and access a nd safety implications Data Interfaces: Bus to Payload and Ground This document defines the data exchange protocols, data transport formats, packet definitions and field definitions for the bus/PL interface. Underlying electrical interface for the bus/PL interface is the HDLC and SpaceWire. The bus/PL interface is defined such that the HDLC interface SpaceWire interface, or both can be used. The bus design will provide support for both interfaces. The PL may choose to implement either one or both. The bus/PL interface is defined to dynamically suppor t either or both interfaces without needing bus reconfiguration \(i.e., FSW changes This document also defines the data exchange protocols data transport and packet template for the space/ground interface. The space to ground interface definition assumes the use of a flight side SGLS transponder integrated with COMSEC slices. The SGLS forward link assumes a flightside Cardholder COMSEC slice. The SGLS return link  Figure 11 Radio Frequency Communications Architecture  


  13 assumes that the SGLS transponder supports both the narrow-band and wide-band inte rfaces. While a return link COMSEC is required, this document assumes that the return link COMSEC does not levy any blocking or packaging constraints for the return link This interface standard was developed as part of the ORS Phase 3 Bus effort. This interface standard was adopted by the ORS Phase 3 Bus and COMMx payload elements. As a result, the TACSAT-4 spacecraft implemented the encl osed interface standards for its bus to payload and space to ground interfaces This document is limited to and currently defines the interfaces between the spacecraf t bus and the payload, and between the spacecraft bus and the ground. Subsequent releases will define the add itional internal interfaces. The depth of detail required for in terface standardization and the need for coverage of additional interfaces is an ongoing assessment effort by ORS s upported standards definition efforts. The intent is to levy interface standards where these standards will lead to efficien t system integration, robust operational capabilities, and improved system flexibility while reducing overall system cost 4  C ONCLUSION  Both the STP-SIV and the ORS ISET efforts have developed standards that provide options for cost-effective capable, flexible spaceflight. Pathfinder SC buses are currently in development for both efforts and will have flight heritage within approximately one year Through the efforts of ISET and the associate prototype teams, the ORS program ha s successfully produced an extensive and well-documented set of ORS bus standards consistent with the ORS concept of operations \(CONOPS and classes of missions. The process used to produce these standards has resulted in technically sound standards which are understood, with buy in from industry. Business factors were also strongly considered to improve the transition of these standards into successful acquisition under a subsequent operational phase While ORS must provide the business foundation, these technical standards are intended to be more broadly useful in order to further volume production, standards acceptance, and the industry business cases. The ORS standards are readily available to Government organizations and payload developers SDTW employs lessons learned from decades of space flight to standardization of STP-SIV design. Flexibility is planned from the beginning and missions are adapted within the range of the SC\222s capability. Development of SC standards requires upfront investment in order to achieve a return on investment once multiple missions have been built and flown. The more PL provi ders who are willing to adopt the STP-SIV interfaces and deve lop experiments applicable to the capabilities of the SC the more successful this program will become R EFERENCES   National Research Council The Role of Small Satellites in NASA and NOAA Earth Observation Programs National Academy Press, Washington D.C., 2000  G F Squibb, \223Meeting the Needs of the Space Technology Industry,\224 ISO Focus, Oct 2005   T.

 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
