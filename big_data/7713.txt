Structure of the updated ANKE DAQ System P W 250ustner A Ackens W Erven G Kemmerling H Kleines W Loevenich Forschungszentrum J\250ulich GmbH  ZEL R Schleichert S Mikirtytchiants S Trusov Forschungszentrum J\250ulich GmbH  IKP Abstract 227The three big experiments at the Cooler Synchrotron COSY in Juelich ANKE WASA and TOF permanently require an improvement of their data aquisition systems We will use ANKE as an example for the overall structure of these data aquisition systems und the improvements in the last years We differentiate between three generations of our DAQ systems The 1st is not used any more The 2nd uses intel-compatible 
computers running NetBSD and dumb crate controllers The synchronisation was done with special PCI modules in the computers with point-to-point connections building a ring The 3rd generation was introduced with the transfer of the WASA detector from Uppsala to J 250ulich It uses special LVDS crates witch can be read out without any software overhead It required a new synchronisation system consisting of LVDS modules only ANKE now uses a mixture of the 2nd and 3rd generation in order to make use of some of the new features but still has to deal with old systems like FASTBUS which make it impossible to use the pure 3rd generation I I NTRODUCTION We differentiate between three generations of our DAQ 
systems 1st VME processors and intelligent crate controllers running the real time operating system OS-9 For the synchronisation of the crates a cable bus with special VME CAMACand Fastbus-modules was used 2nd intelcompatible single board computers running NetBSD and dumb crate controllers The synchronisation was done with special PCI modules in the computers with optical point-topoint connections building a ring 3rd newly developed crates with parallel LVDS bus and newly developed digitalisation modules various ADCs TDCs and controllers The readout is done by FPGAs in the controllers without any general purpose CPU involved Each controller communicates directly with a 
central synchronisation master in a star architecture The 1st generation is not used any more ANKE uses a mixture of generation 2 and 3 It has two new LVDS crates several CAMAC FERA crates and still one FASTBUS crate The two LVDS crates can be used with the 2nd generation synchronisation system But this would lead to a rather large dead time because of the DMA and interrupt overhead   60 026 s The 3rd generation synchronisation system allows to operate the LVDS crates with full speed dead time in the order of 5 026 s per event The 1st LVDS crates houses the new synchronisation system and some F1-TDCs which are already used in the other two experiments The second LVDS 
crate houses newly developed ADCs for the ANKE-VERTEXDetector II 3 RD G ENERATION OF S YNCHRONISATION In the 002rst two generations of our DAQ system each single event was read out by software in a genaral purpose processor The deadtime per event cannot further be decreased by use of faster prcessors The overall performance does not scale with the performance of the processors themselves it rather depends on interrupt latency and peripheral access There is a nearly constant overhead if one wants to read out the data of each event separately The higher data throughput of modern processors can only by used with large blocks of data several 
thousands events together Therefore the concept of a third generation of the DAQ was developed 3  B a s i c p r i n c i p l e i s t h e a v o i d a n c e o f s o f t w a r e f o r the readout All buffer and event management must be taken over by the hardware FPGAs This concept is in use since 2005 when the WASA detector was transferred from CELSIUS Uppsala to COSY J\250ulich Because of the higher luminosity at COSY and several problems with the existing DAQ system we decided to build a nearly complete new DAQ system using the 3rd generation of DAQ and synchronisation system III ANKE DAQ S YSTEM Although it would be the best for the performance of the ANKE system we cannot replace all existing DAQ modules 
ANKE is using mostly CAMAC/FERA modules one FASTBUS crate with TDCs and one LVDS crate with F1-TDCs Recently we added a LVDS crate with special ADC modules for the silicon microstrip detector analog multiplexed signals The readout of the two LVDS crates with the 2nd generation synchronisation system is rather slow because of the unavoidable DMA overhead for each single event The 3rd generation synchronisation system does not improve the situation with the old CAMAC and FASTBUS crates but helps very much to speed up the readout of the LVDS crates Fig 1 shows a sketch of a part of the ANKE DAQ system IV S YNCHRONISATION S YSTEM The functionality is similar to our old system The old 
system has four trigger inputs and 002ve trigger outputs the 002fth is the OR of the other four In some cases this was not enough therefore we now have 16 trigger inputs There is a veto input but the fast clear has been removed because it was never used For testing we have two auxiliary inand outputs A 32 Bit event counter is maintained and its content is propagated to the front end crates for each event Performance

In the boot loader section, the GRUB software which has a high degree of flexibility and customization has been used For Thin OS a special version of Linux called Slax  Frodo  which has small size and is modular, has been used. In PCSM, a number of modules are added or taken away from the Thin OS. In the CFS section, the TrueCrypt software which contains the required algorithm of this project has been used  Figure 4  The used memory by various sections of the implemented PCSM For programming environment and working with smart card, J2SE along with libraries such as JPCSC and card reader driver are used. The VMWare Player has also been used as virtual machine. The Figure 4 shows the size of the used memory by each software section in the implemented sample. The size of all components of the middleware is less than 120 MB In contrast to the other methods, due to the special feature of architecture of the PCSM, any kind of operating system could be used in the upper layer \(user layer\. In the implemented sample; the widely used operating system Windows XP Professional\en used [1 IV  S ECURITY A NALYSIS  In this section, the security goals of this project are explained, and PCSM and other methods are considered for comparing. It is noticeable that, only off-line security attacks and their defensive methods are examined, so the on-line security attacks are not supported by these methods. In other word, when the OS protection and permission services are off, these attacks can be occurred Five main security goals that have been considered in this paper are firmware integrity guarantee, boot software integrity guarantee, OS components integrity guarantee critical application integrity guarantee, and user’s data privacy. They include active codes, which are executable and interpretable programs, and configuration files. The comparison among these goals is summarized in Table I According to the results, both AEGIS and sAEGIS are same and good in low-level software integrity guarantee like firmware, boot, and OS because they have the chip on motherboard and can access it every time. However, they do not guarantee high-level software like application programs and do not have enough flexibility for supporting them Methods using U-Key have only OS integrity and some application integrity programs guarantee because they do not have access to the chip on motherboard TLC, BitLocker, Terra, and NGSCB, which use TPM have acceptable security level in the all of the five goals They have the chip on motherboard and require software libraries for accessing in high-level software. However, they are not suitable for our purpose because they need some hardware changes, and they are not applicable in present systems. Moreover, both TLC and BitLocker are strong dependent to the hardware, and they only support specific OS PCSM has acceptable security level in all security goals except firmware integrity guarantee because it does not have any trusted chip on motherboard. PCSM can guarantee both its boot software and middleware integrity by write-protected partition on disk. In addition, when we use virtual encrypted volume for saving, OS and application integrity are guaranteed and also user’s data privacy is supported because a key \(VEK\  which is stored in smart card securely, is required for reading or writing V  S OME S ECURITY A TTACKS AND D EFENSES  A  Phishing In some of the attacks against the operating system, the attacker by cloning the User Interface of the operating system tries to retrieve the name and password of the user and gain access to confidential information. These types of attacks are called Phishing. For example, by replacing GINA module in the Windows, such attacks could be done. This type of attack was carried out by authors of this paper against Windows XP. By using PCSM this type of attacks could be prevented because the operating system along with all its modules are first encrypted and then saved and therefore it could not be replaced when the system is not on TABLE I  C OMPARISON OF SECURITY GOALS  Goals Methods AEGIS sAEGIS U-Key TLC BitLocker NGSCB Terra PCSM Firmware Integrity Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes No Boot Integrity Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes OS Integrity Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Application Integrity No No No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Data Privacy No No No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No Hardware Change No No Yes No No No No Yes

 B  Trojan Horse The penetrating codes, known as Trojan horse are another attack to operating system services. In this method the user will not notice any unusual behavior but behind the scene, the user’s data would be subject to unauthorized access. These destructive codes could affect drivers, services or the libraries of the operating system. By using the PCSM method this problem could be avoided because the modules of the operating system are first encrypted and then stored C  Dictionary Attack Another attack carried out against the operating system is discovering the information about the user such as username and password by extracting their hash value in the account files of the operating system. This attack was also carried out by the authors of this paper against the Windows XP and it could be carried out on Linux as well. But PCSM, by encrypting the modules of the operating system including registry files prevents this type of attacks also known as dictionary attacks D  Logon Bypassing Another concerning issue is unauthorized access to user’s data outside the domain of the operating system. In this type of attacks, by booting the system by an operating system other than the original operating system, the access condition is ignored and user’s files, stored on the disk are accessed This attack has also been carried out by authors of this paper against the NTFS and Ext3 file systems. In PCSM method by using encrypted files in layer lower than the operating system, this type of attacks could be prevented E  Brute Force Another type of attack against computer system is called Brut Force. In this kind of attacks the attacker by entering all possible form of the user’s password, discovers its correct value. This type of attack is usually launched by software But in PCSM method such attack can not take place because the root key is stored in the smart card and protected by the user’s password and this password is the same as the card’s PIN code. In the designed smart card, the wrong PIN code could only be entered three times and then the code will be blocked and PUK would be demanded. PUK, due to its large size, could not be attacked by Brut Force F  Firmware Corruption A more sophisticated attack by viruses is the one that creates invalid modifications in the firmware. In this type of attacks, the internal codes of the EEPROM of the BIOS or other hardware which are updatable, are tempered with and consequently some sections of the system comes under attacker’s control or becomes useless. This attack was also carried out by the authors of this paper via the BIOS manufactured by Phoenix. PCSM is capable of preventing this attack because all hardware, from perspective of the upper layer of the operating system, is considered as virtual and the attacker has no access to the physical hardware VI  P ERFORMANCE E VALUATION  We have done some performance tests for evaluating PCSM by applying them on native OS \(Windows XP\ and PCSM \(with Windows XP for guest OS\. Moreover, we employed PassMark™ Performance Test which is software with many tools for performance tests like CPU, memory and disk test suits. The general system properties of our used test system are: Intel Pentium IV CPU with 3 GHz, 2048 KB cache size, 400 MB available RAM, and FAT32 file system An important difference between native OS and virtual OS was the available RAM. In virtual OS, it was 128 MB because host OS needs separated memory. However this is configurable and we can increase the guest OS memory. The results are summarized in Figures 5, 6 and 7. We have tested three main performance parts include CPU, memory, and disk. Figure 5 shows comparison for CPU tests. In this test we have done different 8 tests like floating point math finding prime number, and image rotation. In Figure 6 memory test results are shown, and we can see that they are near to each other, considerably. This test includes some parameters like allocating small block, reading cached and uncached data, and writing in memory. Last test suite is disk test which is shown in Figure 7. Disk is very important because usually it is bottleneck for total performance. This test includes both sequential reading and writing, and random searching for reading and writing operations  Figure 5  CPU test results  Figure 6  Memory test results

 Figure 7  Disk test results We can observe that CPU and memory have little difference in native and virtual OS. In other word virtualization has small and acceptable overhead Furthermore, nowadays, virtual machines have 80 to 90 percent performance in comparison with native. On the other hand, we can see that the disk performance has more difference because PCSM uses virtualization and softwarebased encryption. Encryption is fulfilled by software, which its algorithm is AES, and all of data including user and OS data are encrypted. If we use hardware-based encryption, we will not have any encryption overhead in software layer. The performance in some existing disks with encryption in firmware is about 90 percent VII  C ONCLUSION  This paper has reviewed the various introduced methods for securing client OS and then a new method called PCSM was proposed and was evaluated from security and performance perspective along with other methods. It became clear that this method is more flexible and has higher degree of compatibility with present systems. This method due to its special architecture, is capable of preventing various security threats and therefore provides an acceptable level of security for personal computers and workstations connected to the network R EFERENCES  1  H.

 7 if T i C i  When all the C i are equal, it is called singly Type-I censored.  The data from type-I censoring consists of n pairs of random variables  t i  i  where   min i i i C T t    i i i i i i C T if C T if 0 1  15 The joint pdf of    i i t is  i i i i C S t f 1     16  t i  is a mixed random variable with both discrete \(if censored\ and continuous parts  If the pairs    i i t are independent, th e likelihood function is  i i i n i i C S t f L 1 1     17 An observation from the above likelihood function is:  that each observed lifetime contributes a term f  t h censored time contributes a term S  C i This observation has wide applicability \(Lawless 2003, Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002  Random censoring occurs naturally.  For example, in medical research, patients may be admitted into the study in somewhat random fashion contingent on their diagnostic times.   If the study is terminated at some pre-specified time then the censoring times, which start from the random entry points until the termination, are random. If C i is specified with different distributions, each with density mass at one fixed point, Type-I censoring can then be treated as a special case of random censoring. Often the likelihood function for type-I can be used to approximate that of random censoring  If censorings and failure events are dependent, although it might be difficult to write down a model that represent the process, the above likelihood function structure still largely holds \(Lawless 2003, Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002\The above discussion of censoring is simplified greatly to highlight the principles of censoring and lifetime observations. The study of the failure-censoring pair random variables influences nearly every aspect of survival analysis  2.3. Modeling Survivability with Random Censoring  From the discussion of censoring in the previous section, in particular the random censoring mechanism, we propose to use the random censoring mechanism to describe the unpredictable events such as malicious intrusions in the modeling of network survivability A comparative analysis of random censoring and malicious intrusions to computer networks \(or any survivable systems arguments.  The most signifi cant similarity is that both random censoring and malicious intrusions are unpredictable.  In other words, we generally do not even know the prob ability that the event may happen Specifically, the striking time of malicious act can be considered largely random but the event is only describable after it occurs.  Therefore, the striking times can be treated as the censoring events. Similarl y, in a clinical trial of biomedicine, censoring should be unpredictable, otherwise the experiment is biased.   Furthermore, by introducing different levels of censoring \(e.g., percentage of censored individuals\one can simulate the effects of the strike intensity on the survivor function.  If one defines survivability as a threshold of reliability breakdown \(e.g survivor function crosses some threshold value kind of simulation can produce very important insights  2.4. Survival Distribution Models—Parametric Models   As we have mentioned previous ly, the basic definitions of survival analysis, such as hazard rate \(failure rate cumulative hazard function, p robability density function distribution functions are exactly the same as those in reliability theory introduced in Subsection 1 1 [Equations 1\\(5 T h e only di ffe re nce is the t e rm inology i e  survivor function vs reliability but both have exactly the same mathematical definitions. However, beyond the similarity at the definition level the two fields diverged significantly.  Through the remainder of this paper, the major concepts and models are drawn from the survival analysis literature  The following three concepts ex ist in both fields; however there are slight differences in their formulations mean residual lifetime  median lifetime and p-th quantile also known as the 100p-th percentile   The mean residual life mrl cted remaining lifetime for an individual of age t and is defined as mrl  t  E  T t  T t  It can be proved that the following equation holds               t S dx x S t S dx x f t T t mrl t t 18  The mrl is the area under the survival curve to the right of t  divided by S  t In contrast, the mean lifetime equivalent to the mean time to failure MTTF\reliability theory, is the total area under the survival curve  MTTF E  T  tf  t  dt S  t  dt 0 0   19  The variance of T is related to the survival function by  2 00     2   dt t S dt t tS T Var  20  The p th quantile of the distribution of T is the smallest t p  such that   1    inf    1   p t S t t e i p t S p p 21 


 8 If T is a continuous rando m variable, then the pth quantile can be found by solving p t S p 1     The median lifetime mlt h percentile t 0.5 of the distribution of T and is obtained by solving the following equation S  t p  1 0.5 0.5   Since failure time \(or lifetime\ply a non-negative random variable, the most natural approach is to study its probability distributions. Again the probability distributions used in both reliability and surv ival analysis are often the same.  The most commonly used distributions include exponential, Weibull extreme value distribution, gamma distribution, log-gamma, lognormal, generalized gamma logistic, log-logistic, and inverse Gaussian.  Distribution models discussed in this section are referred to as parametric models in the literature  We will look at two examples, exponential distribution and Weibull distribution.  The exponential distribution can serve as the baseline for more complex models, given its constant failure rate 0  0   t t h     22 with pdf   f  t  e t  23  The survivor function is  t e t S   24  and the mean and variances are  1 and 2  respectively  When 1 it is termed standard exponential distribution.  In addition, expo nential distribution is special cases of both the Weibull and gamma distributions  The Weibull distribution is perhaps the most widely used lifetime distribution.  Its hazard rate is   1     t t h 25  where 0 and 0 are parameters.  When 1  Weibull distribution becomes exponential distribution.  Its pdf and survivor functions are  0    exp     1 t t t t f  26   S  t  exp t   t 0  27  The hazard function of Weibull distribution is monotonic increasing if  1 decreasing if  1 and constant for  1  is therefore termed shape parameter. The is called scale parameter  Weibull distribution can be derived from uniform distribution U in the interval [0 1] conveniently       ln   1 U T  28  This formula can be used for Monte Carlo simulation of Weibull distribution  There is also a three-parameter version Weibull distribution by replacing the variable t with t–u where u is called location parameter  The following two distributions are with bathtub-shaped hazards functions   t t t h   29    exp   1 t t t h  30  Klein and Moeschberger \(2003\ummarized a near exhaustive list of distributions us ed in survival analysis. The distribution models described above are for continuous failure time data.  Any of the continuous failure time models can be used to generate a discrete model by introducing grouping on the time axis \(Kalbfleisch and Prentice 1980 2002, Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  The estimation and comparison of survival function S  t  which is equivalent to the reliability R  t y theory, with the above distribution models form a significant part of the early development  of  survival analysis.  Estimating survival function or fitting lifetime data to survival distributions was the earliest endeavor in this field.  Three approaches stand out: the Kaplan-Meier estimator for survivor function \(Kaplan and Meier 1958 Chiang's \(1960\he Nelson-Aalen estimator for cumulative hazard functions \(Nelson 1969 The life table approach is particularly important in population demography and actuarial study.  To compare the survival functions, several statistics have been devised or extended from classical statistics to censored data, such as the Wilcoxon test Savage log-rank test, and the KruskalWallis test \(Kalbfleisch and Prentice 1980, 2002\.  In recent years, great progress has been made in improving the estimations and comparisons of survivor functions, such as the integration of Bayesian approach and Markov Chain Monte Carlo \(MCMC\ simulation, and kernel-smoothed estimation. One can refer to Klein and Moeschberger \(2003 for comprehensive details  2.5.  Covariates Regression Models: Proportional Hazards  Models and Accelerated Failure Time Models  The previous section focu sed on using probability distributions to model survival of a homogenous population Translated into the reliability field, a homogenous population implies that devices experience exactly the same environmental covariates, a nd the covariates are not 


 9 correlated to failure times.  For example, this would imply that operation environment parameters such as temperature have no effects on the failure rates of devices.  The covariates regression approach introduced in this section eliminate this restriction.  Th e basic problem can be formed as follows: given survival time T 0, a vector     2 1 s z z z z of covariates that may influence T is observed.  Furthermore, the vector z itself can also be time dependent and may include bo th quantitative and qualitative indicative variables. In this approach, Cox's \(1972 proportional hazards model was initially treated as largely an empirical regression model, but later it was found that the framework of the model posse sses exceeding flexibility to capture major hazards effects and failure mechanisms.  The Cox model has been extended numerously and it forms the foundation for the covariates regression approach \(Therneau and Grambsch 2000  There are two ways to construct covariates regression models. The first is to extend survivor distributions such as the exponential and Weibull dist ribution, and this approach forms so-called mixture models. The second approach has no assumptions on the survival distribution, also called distribution-free approach, which is the approach adopted by Cox \(1972, 1975\. We briefly introduce the first approach by using exponential and Weibull distributions as examples. The approach can be extended to other distributions, including discre te distributions \(Kalbfleisch and Prentice 1980, 2002  2.5.1. Distribution-Dependent Regression Models Parametric Regression Models  With exponential distribution, the hazard rate is constant The hazard rate at time t for an individual with covariates z  can be written as    t  z   z  31  i.e, the hazard for a given vector z is constant; however, it varies with covariates z The  z ay be modeled in many ways.  In the simplest case it assumes a linear relationship  z and thus   t  z  g  z  32  where is the vector of regression coefficients for vector z and z is the  inner product of the two vectors.  Here g is a function form, for example   g  x  exp x  33  With g ing on an exponential form — the exponential distribution models under covariates z the hazard function is  t  z  exp z  34  The conditional pdf of T   given z is   f  t  z  e z exp te z  35  The above hazard function implies that the log failure rate is a linear function of covariates z Let Y ln T     ln   and W be a random variable with extreme value distribution  the log of the exponential failure time T nder covariates z  can be expressed as   Y z W  36  This is a log-linear model with many nice properties  Similar to the previous extens ion, Weibull distribution can be extended with covariates regression.  The conditional hazard for Weibull distribution is    t  z   t  1 e z  37  where  represent the covariate regression vector to avoid the confusion with the parameter of Weibull distribution The conditional pdf for Weib ull distribution is then     exp      1 z z e t e t z t f  38  The effects of covariates also act multiplicatively on the hazard in the Weibull distribution.  In terms of the log  failure time, the above conditi onal hazard function specifies the log-linear model. With Y ln T    ln     1 and   we get the log-linear Weibull model  W z Y   39  where W follows the extreme value distribution.  The above extensions of exponential and Weibull distributions demonstrate two important properties \(Lawless 2003 Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002\. First, the effects of covariates act multiplicatively on the hazard function This general relationship inspired the general proportional hazards model.  Second, the lo g-linear models suggest that the covariates act additively on the log failure time This inspired the development of the accelerated failure time model.  Both models are described briefly below  2.5.2. Distribution-Free Regression Models Semi-parametric Regression Models  The next two subsections introduce two of the most important survival analysis models.  They do not assume any specific statistical distribu tions, and are therefore called distribution-free or semi-parametric approaches.  Both models have been extended numerously.  The Cox proportional hazard model is probably the most influential one in the entire survival analysis subject  Cox's Proportional Hazards Model \(PHM  Let  t  z  be the hazard function at time t for an individual with 


 10 covariates z The proportional hazards model \(PHM\ first proposed by Cox \(1972, 1975\, is    t  z  0  t  e z   40  where 0  t  is an arbitrary unspecified base-line hazard function for continuous failure time T In the PHM, the covariates act multiplicativel y on the hazard function.  By substituting 0  t  with the corresponding hazard function for exponential or Weibull distributions, the previous distribution-dependent models for exponential or Weibull distribution can be derived as special cases  The conditional pdf of T given z corresponding to the general hazard function    z t is     exp      0 0 0 t z z du u e e t z t f  41  The conditional surv ival function for T under z is   S  t  z   S 0  t  exp z   42  where     exp   0 0 0 t du u t S 43  The allowance of an arbitrary 0  t  makes the model sufficiently flexible for many applications  Extensions of Cox's Proportional Hazards Model PHM There are numerous extensions to Cox's PHM Therneau and Grambsch 2000\. Among those extensions two of the extensions strata and time-dependent covariates  are particularly important, but do not substantially complicate the parameters estimation \(Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002, Lawless 2003   Suppose there is a factor that occurs on q levels and for which the proportionality assumption of PHM may be violated.  The hazard function for an individual in the jth stratum or level of this factor is    exp      0 z t z t j j 44 for j 1,2 q  where z is the vector of covariates for PHM The baseline hazard functions 01  0 q  for the q  strata are permitted to be arbitrary and are completely unrelated.  The direct product of the group \(stratum likelihood can be utilized to estimate the common parameter vector  Once the parameter is estimated, the survivor function for each stratum can be estimated separately  The second generalization to the proportional hazards model is to let the variable z depend on time itself.  For unstratified PHM, the hazard function is     exp       0 t z t t z t  45  and for stratified PHM it is      exp       0 t z t t z t j j     2  1 r j 46  The procedure used to estimate the is to maximize the socalled partial likelihood functions as described by Cox 1975\ and Kalbfleisch & Prentice \(1980, 2002  Time-dependent covariates may be classified into two broad categories: external and intern al \(Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002, Lawless 2003, Klein and Moeschberger. 2003\. The failure mechanism does not directly involve external covariates. External covariates may be distinguished into \(1 fixed measured in advance and fixed during the observation\, \(2 defined determined in advance but not fixed, for example, contro lled stress levels\nd \(3 ancillary output of a stochastic process external to an observed object\n internal covariate is attached to the individual, and its existence depends on the survival of the individual. It is the output of a stochastic process that is induced by the individual under study.  The process is only observable if the individual survives and is uncensored   The Accelerated Failure Time \(AFT  The PHM represents the mul tiplicative influences of covariates z n the hazard.  However, without specific   0 t this model does not tell how z affects failure time itself. The previous log-linear models for T answer this question   Suppose that Y ln T  is related to the covariance z in a linear model  Y z W  47  where is a constant or intercept parameter z is a vector of covariates is a vector of parameters to be estimated is a scale parameter which is the reciprocal of the shape parameter, and W is a random variable with a specified distribution.  Many distributions, including the Weibull exponential, log-norma l, and log-logistic  can be used to describe W   Exponentiation of Y gives    exp T z T  48 where 0  exp  W T has a hazard function 0  t  that is independent of It follows that the hazard function for T  can be written in terms of this baseline hazard  0 as    exp  exp     0 z z t z t 49  The survival function is  S  t  z  exp 0  u  du 0 t exp z   50 and the pdf  is the product of    z t and S  t  z  


 11 This model specifies that covariates act multiplicatively on time t r than on the hazar d function.  That is, we assume a baseline hazard function to exist and that the effects of the covariates are to alter the rate at which an individual proceeds along the time axis.  In other words, the covariates z accelerates or decelerates the time to failure Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002, Lawless 2003  It should be pointed out that the distribution-based regression models for exponential and Weibull distributions in the previous section are th e special cases of both PHM and AFT.  This correspondence is not necessarily true for models based on other distribu tions. Indeed, two-parameter Weibull distribution has the uniq ue property that it is closed under both multiplication of fa ilure time and multiplication of the hazard function by an arbitrary nonzero constant Lawless 2003, Kalbfleisch & Prentice 2002, Klein Moeschberger 2003  2.6. Counting Process and Survival Analysis   In the previous sections, we introduced censoring and survival analysis models th at can handle the censored information; however, we did not discuss how the censored information is processed.  Accommodating and maximally utilizing the partial information from the censored observations is the most challenging and also the most rewarding task in survival anal ysis.  This also establishes survival analysis as a unique fiel d in mathematical statistics Early statistical inferences for censored data in survival analysis were dependent on asymptotic likelihood theory Severini 2000\ Cox \(1972, 1975\ proposed partial likelihood as an extension to classical maximum likelihood estimation in the context of hi s proportional hazards model as a major contribution. Asymptotic likelihood has been and still is the dominant theory for developing survival analysis inference and hypothesis testing methods \(Klein and Moeschberger 2003, Severini 2000\. There are many monographs and textbooks of survival analysis containing sufficient details for applying survival analysis \(Cox and Oakes 1984, Kalbfleisch and Prentice 1980, 2002, Lawless 1982, 2003, Klein and Moeschberger, 2003\. A problem with traditional asymptotic lik elihood theory is that the resulting procedures can become very complicated when handling more complex censoring mechanisms \(Klein Moeschberger 2003\. A more elegant but requiring rigorous measure-theoretic probability theo ry is the approach with counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theorems.  Indeed, this approach was used by Aalen 1975\ to set the rigorous mathematical foundation for survival analysis, and later further developed and summarized by Fleming and Harrington \(1991\, Andersen et al. \(1993\several research papers.  In reliability theory Aven and Jensen \(1999\ dem onstrated such an approach by developing a general failure model, which we briefly introduced in Section 1.2. However, the counting process and Martingale approach require measure theoretic treatments of probability and st ochastic processes, which is often not used in engineering or applied statistics.  A detailed introduction of the topic is obviously beyond the scope of this paper, and we only present a brief sketch of the most important concepts involved.  Readers are referred to the excellent monographs by Andersen et al. \(1993 Fleming and Harrington \(1991\ Aven and Jensen \(1999\ for comprehensive details, and Kal bfleisch and Prentice \(2002 Klein and Moeschberger \(2003\, Lawless \(2003\ for more application–oriented treatments The following discussion on this topic is drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  A counting stochastic process N  t  t 0 possesses the properties that N  0 ro and N  t   with probability one. The sample paths of N  t ht continuous and piecewise constant with jumps of size 1  step function In a right-censored sample, \(we assume only right censoring in this section N i  t  I  T i t  i   which keep the value 0 until individual i fails and then jump to 1  are counting processes. The accumulation of N i  t ocess     1 t N t N n i i is again a counting process, which counts the number of failures in the sample at or before time t   The counting process keeps track of the information on the occurrences of events,   for instance, the history information such as which individual was censored prior to time t and which individual died at or prior to time t as well as the covariates information This accumulated history information of the counting process at time t is termed filtration at time t denoted by F t For a given problem F t  rests on the observer of the counting process.  Thus, two observers with different recordings at different times will get different filtrations.  This is what Aven and Jensen 1999\ referred to as different information levels or the amount of actual available information about the state of a system may vary  If the failure times X i and censoring times C i  are independent,  then the probability of an event occurs at time t given the history just prior to t  F t\n be expressed as  t T if dt t h t C t X dt t C dt t X t P F dt t T t P i i i i i i r t i i r          1     t T if F dt t T t P i t i i r 0   1    51  Let dN  t be the change in the process N  t over a short time interval    t t t Ignoring the neglig ible chance of ties 1   t dN if a failure occurred and 0   t dN otherwise  Let Y  t denote the number of individuals with an observation time T i t Then the conditional expectation of dN  t   dt t h t Y F dt t C dt t X t with ns observatio of number E F t dN E t i i i t              52 


 12 The process  t  Y  t  h  t  is called the intensity process  of the counting process.  It is a stochastic process that is determined by the information contained in the history process F t via Y  t  Y  t  records the number of individuals experiencing the risk at a given time t   As it will become clear that   t is equivalent to the failure rate or hazard function in tr aditional reliability theory, but here it is treated as a stochastic process, the most general form one can assume for it. It is this generalization that encapsulates the power that counting stochastic process approach can offer to survival analysis  Let the cumulative intensity process H  t be defined as   t t ds s t H 0 0      53  It has the property that  E  N  t  F t  E  H  t  F t  H  t   54  This implies that filtration F t, is known, the value of Y  t  fixed and H  t es deterministic H  t is equivalent to the cumulative hazards in tr aditional reliability theory  A stochastic process with the property that its expectation at time t given history at time s < t is equal to its value at s is called a martingale That is M  t martingale if           t s s M F t M E s  55  It can be verified that the stochastic process         t H t N t M 56  is a martingale, and it is called the counting process martingale The increments of the counting process martingale have an expected value of zero, given its filtration F t That is  0      t F t dM E 57 The first part of the counting process martingale [Equation 56  N  t non-decreasing step function.  The second part H  t smooth process which is predictable in that its value at time t is fixed just prior to time t It is known as the compensator  of the counting process and is a random function. Therefore, the martingale can be considered as mean-zero noise and that is obtainable when one subtracts the smoothly varying compensator from the counting process  Another key component in the counting process and martingale theory for survival analysis is the notion of the predictable variation process of M  t oted by    t M It is defined as the compensator of process   2 t M  The term predictable variation process comes from the property that, for a martingale M  t it can be verified that the conditional variance of the increments of M  t  dM  t  h e inc r em ents of   t M That is          t M d F t dM Var t  58  To obtain      t F t dM Var  one needs the random variable N  t  variable with probability   t of having a jump of size 1 at time t The variance of N  t   t  1 t   since it follows b i nom ial distribution    Ignoring the ties in the censored data 2  t  is close to zero and Var  dM  t  F t    t  Y  t  h  t   This implies that the counting process N  t on the filtration F t behaves like a Poisson process with rate  t    Why do we need to convert the previous very intuitive concepts in survival analysis in to more abstract martingales The key is that many of the sta tistics in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of the basic martingales described above The stochastic integral equations are mathematically well structured and some standard mathematical techniques for studying them can be adopted  Here, let   t K be a predictable  process An example of a predictable process is the process   t Y Over the interval 0 to t the stochastic integral of su ch a process, with respect to a martingale, is denoted by     0 u dM u K t It turns out that such stochastic integrals them selves are martingales as a function of t and their predictable variation process can be found from the predictable variation process of the original martingale by           0 2 0 u M d u K u dM u K t t 59 The above discussion was drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003 also provide examples of how the above process is applied. In the following, we briefly introduce one of their exampl es — the derivation of the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard estimator  First, the model is formulated as           t dM dt t h t Y t dN  60  If   t Y is non-zero, then               t Y t dM t d t h t Y t dN 61  Let   t I be the indicator of whether   t Y  is positive and define 0/0 = 0, then integrating both sides of above \(61 One get 


 13                     0 0 0 u dM u Y u I u d u h u I u dN u Y u I t t t 62  The left side integral is the Nelson-Aalen estimator of H t           0  u dN u Y u I t H t 63  The second integral on the right side           0 u dM u Y u I t W t 64  is the stochastic integral of the predictable process      u Y u I with respect to a martingale, and hence is also a martingale  The first integral on the right side is a random quantity    t H   t du u h u I t H 0        65  For right-censored data it is equal to   t H  in the data range, if the stochastic uncertainty in the   t W is negligible Therefore, the statistic    t H is a nonparametric estimator of the random quantity    t H   We would like to mention one more advantage of the new approach, that is, the martingale central limit theorem.  The central limit theorem of martingales ensures certain convergence property and allows the derivations of confidence intervals for many st atistics.  In summary, most of the statistics developed with asymptotic likelihood theory in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of some martingale.  The large sample properties of the statistics can be found by using the predictable variation process and martingale central limit theorem \(Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  2.7. Bayesian Survival Analysis  Like many other fields of statistics, survival analysis has also witnessed the rapid expansion of the Bayesian paradigm.  The introduction of the full-scale Bayesian paradigm is relative recent and occurred in the last decade however, the "invasion" has been thorough.  Until the recent publication of a monograph by Ibrahim, Chen and Sinhaet 2005\val anal ysis has been either missing or occupy at most one chapter in most survival analysis monographs and textbooks.  Ibrahim's et al. \(2005\ changed the landscape, with their comprehensive discussion of nearly every counterp arts of frequentist survival analysis from univariate to multivariate, from nonparametric, semiparametric to parametric models, from proportional to nonproportional hazards models, as well as the joint model of longitudinal and survival data.  It should be pointed out that Bayesian survival analysis has been studied for quite a while and can be traced back at least to the 1970s  A natural but fair question is what advantages the Bayesian approach can offer over the established frequentist survival analysis. Ibrahim et al 2005\entified two key advantages. First, survival models are generally very difficult to fit, due to the complex likelihood functions to accommodate censoring.  A Bayesi an approach may help by using the MCMC techniques and there is available software e.g., BUGS.  Second, the Bayesian paradigm can incorporate prior information in a natural way by using historical information, e.g., from clinical trials. The following discussion in this subsection draws from Ibrahim's et al. \(2005  The Bayesian paradigm is based on specifying a probability model for the observed data, given a vector of unknown parameters This leads to likelihood function L   D   Unlike in traditional statistics is treated as random and has a prior distribution denoted by   Inference concerning is then based on the posterior distribution which can be computed by Bayes theorem d D L D L D              66 where is the parameter space  The term    D is proportional to the likelihood    D L  which is the information from observed data, multiplied by the prior, which is quantified by   i.e          D L D 67 The denominator integral m  D s the normalizing constant of    D and often does not have an analytic closed form Therefore    D often has to be computed numerically The Gibbs sampler or other MCMC algorithms can be used to sample    D without knowing the normalizing constant m  D xist large amount of literature for solving the computational problems of m  D nd    D   Given that the general Bayesian algorithms for computing the posterior distributions should equally apply to Bayesian survival analysis, the specification or elicitation of informative prior needs much of the atte ntion.  In survival analysis with covariates such as Cox's proportional hazards model, the most popular choice of informative prior is the normal prior, and the most popular choice for noninformative is the uniform Non-informative prior is easy to use but they cannot be used in all applications, such as model selection or model comparison. Moreover, noninformative prior does not harness the real prior information. Therefore, res earch for informative prior specification is crucial for Bayesian survival analysis  


 14 Reliability estimation is influenced by the level of information available such as information on components or sub-systems. Bayesians approach is likely to provide such flexibility to accommodate various levels of information Graves and Hamada \(2005\roduced the YADAS a statistical modeling environment that implements the Bayesian hierarchical modeli ng via MCMC computation They showed the applications of YADES in reliability modeling and its flexibility in processing hierarchical information. Although this environment seems not designed with Bayesian surviv al analysis, similar package may be the direction if Bayesian survival analysis is applied to reliability modeling  2.8. Spatial Survival Analysis  To the best of our knowledge spatial survival analysis is an uncharted area, and there has been no spatial survival analysis reported with rigor ous mathematical treatment There are some applications of survival analysis to spatial data; however, they do not address the spatial process which in our opinion should be the essential aspect of any spatial survival analysis. To develop formal spatial survival analysis, one has to define the spatial process first  Recall, for survival analysis in the time domain, there is survival function   R t t T t S  Pr   68  where T is the random variable and S  t e cumulative probability that the lifetime will exceed time t In spatial domain, what is the counterpart of t One may wonder why do not we simply define the survival function in the spatial domain as   S  s  Pr S s  s R d  R > 0  69  where s is some metric for d-dimensional space R d and the space is restricted to the positive region S is the space to event measurement, e.g., the distance from some origin where we detect some point object.  The problem is that the metric itself is an attribute of space, rather than space itself Therefore, it appears to us that the basic entity for studying the space domain has to be broader than in the time domain This is probably why spatial process seems to be a more appropriate entity for studying  The following is a summary of descriptions of spatial processes and patterns, which intends to show the complexity of the issues involved.  It is not an attempt to define the similar survival function in spatial domain because we certainly unders tand the huge complexity involved. There are several monographs discussing the spatial process and patterns \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\.  The following discussion heavily draws from Cressie \(1993\ and Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  It appears that the most widely adopted definition for spatial process is proposed in Cressie \(1993\, which defines a spatial process Z  s in d-dimensions as    Z  s  s D R d  70  Here Z  s denotes the attributes we observe, which are space dependent. When d = 2 the space R 2 is a plane  The problem is how to define randomness in this process According to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005 Z  s an be thought of as located \(indexed\by spatial coordinates s  s 1  s 2  s n  the counterpart of time series Y  t  t   t 1  t 2  t n   indexed by time.  The spatial process is often called random field   To be more explicit, we denote Z  s  Z  s   to emphasize that Z is the outcome of a random experiment  A particular realization of produces a surface    s Z  Because the surface from whic h the samples are drawn is the result of the random experiment Z  s called a random function  One might ask what is a random experiment like in a spatial domain? Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\ offered an imaginary example briefly described below.  Imagine pouring sand from a bucket on to a desktop surface, and one is interested in measuring the depth of the poured sand at various locations, denoted as Z  s The sand distributes on the surface according to the laws of physics.  With enough resources and patience, one can develop a deterministic model to predict exactly how the sand grains are distributed on the desktop surface.  This is the same argument used to determine the head-tail coin flipping experiment, which is well accepted in statistical scie nce. The probabilistic coinflip model is more parsimonious than the deterministic model that rests on the exact \(perfect\but hardly feasible representation of a coin's physics. Similarly deterministically modeling the placement of sand grains is equally daunting.  However, th e issue here is not placement of sand as a random event, as Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\phasized.  The issue is that the sand was poured only once regardless how many locations one measures the depth of the sand.  With that setting, the challenge is how do we define and compute the expectation of the random function Z  s Would E  Z  s   s  make sense  Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\further raised the questions: \(1\to what distribution is the expectation being computed? \(2\ if the random experiment of sand pouring can only be counted once, ho w can the expectation be the long-term average  According to the definition of expectation in traditional statistics, one should repeat the process of sand pouring many times and consider the probability distributions of all surfaces generated from the repetitions to compute the expectation of Z  s is complication is much more serious 


 15 than what we may often reali ze. Especially, in practice many spatial data is obtained from one time space sample only. There is not any independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  How is the enormous complexity in spatial statistics currently dealt with? The most commonly used simplification, which has also been vigorously criticized, is the stationarity assumption.  Opponents claim that stationarity often leads to erroneous inferences and conclusions.  Proponents counte r-argue that little progress can be made in the study of non-stationary process, without a good understanding of the stationary issues Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  The strict stationarity is a random field whose spatial distribution is invariant under translation of the coordination.  In other word s, the process repeats itself throughout its domain \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005 There is also a second-order or weak\ of a random field  For random fields in the spatial domain, the model of Equation \(70  Z  s  s D R d  is still too general to allow statistical inference.  It can be decomposed into several sub-processes \(Cressie 1993             s s s W s s Z  D s  71  where  s  E  Z  is a deterministic mean structure called large-scale variation W  s is the zero-mean intrinsically stationary process, \(with second order derivative\nd it is called smooth small-scale variation   s is the zero-mean stationary process independent of W  s and is called microscale variation  s  is zero-mean white noise also called measurement error. This decomposition is not unique and is largely operational in nature \(Cressie 1993\he main task of a spatial algorithm is to determine the allocations of the large, small, and microscale components However, the form of the above equation is fixed Cressie 1993\, implying that it is not appropriate to sub-divide one or more of the items. Therefore, the key issue here is to obtain the deterministic  s  but in practice, especially with limited data, it is usually very difficult to get a unique  s   Alternative to the spatial domain decomposition approach the frequency domain methods or spectral analysis used in time series analysis can also be used in spatial statistics Again, one may refer to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  So, what are the imp lications of the general discussion on spatial process above to spatial survival analysis?  One point is clear, Equation \(69 S  s  Pr S s   s R d is simply too naive to be meaningful.  There seem, at least, four fundamental challenges when trying to develop survival analysis in space domain. \(1\ process is often multidimensional, while time pr ocess can always be treated as uni-dimensional in the sense that it can be represented as  Z  t  t R 1  The multidimensionality certainly introduces additional complications, but that is still not the only complication, perhaps not even the most significant 2\One of the fundamental complications is the frequent lack of independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process, as pointed out by Cressie \(1993\\(3\e superposition of \(1 and \(2\brings up even more complexity, since coordinates  s of each replication are a set of stochastic spatial process rather than a set of random variables. \(4\n if the modeling of the spatial process is separable from the time process, it is doubtful how useful the resulting model will be.  In time process modeling, if a population lives in a homogenous environment, the space can be condensed as a single point.  However, the freezing of time seems to leave out too much information, at least for survival analysis Since the traditional survival analysis is essentially a time process, therefore, it should be expanded to incorporate spatial coordinates into original survival function.  For example, when integrating space and time, one gets a spacetime process, such as          R t R D s t s Z d   where s is the spatial index \(coordinate t is time.  We may define the spatial-temporal survival function as   S  s  t  Pr T t  s D  72  where D is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidean space That is, the spatial-temporal survival function represents the cumulative probability that an individual will survive up to time T within hyperspace D which is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidian space.  One may define different scales for D or even divide D into a number of unit hyperspaces of measurement 1 unit  2.9. Survival Analysis and Artificial Neural Network   In the discussion on artificial neuron networks \(ANN Robert & Casella \(2004\noted, "Baring the biological vocabulary and the idealistic connection with actual neurons, the theory of neuron networks covers: \(1\odeling nonlinear relations between explanatory and dependent explained\ariables; \(2\mation of the parameters of these models based on a \(training\ sample."  Although Robert & Casella \(2004\ did not mentioned survival analysis, their notion indeed strike us in that the two points are also the essence of Cox s \(1972\roportional Hazards model  We argue that the dissimilarity might be superficial.  One of the most obvious differences is that ANN usually avoids probabilistic modeling, however, the ANN models can be analyzed and estimated from a statistical point of view, as demonstrated by Neal \(1999\, Ripley \(1994\, \(1996 Robert & Casella \(2004\What is more interesting is that the most hailed feature of ANN, i.e., the identifiability of model structure, if one review carefully, is very similar to the work done in survival anal ysis for the structure of the 


 16 Cox proportional hazards model. The multilayer ANN model, also known as back-propagation ANN model, is again very similar to the stratified proportional hazards model  There are at least two advantages of survival analysis over the ANN.  \(1\val analysis has a rigorous mathematical foundation. Counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theory form the survival analysis models as stochastic integral s, which provide insight for analytic solutions. \(2\ ANN, simulation is usually necessary \(Robert & Casella \(2004\which is not the case in survival analysis  Our conjecture may explain a very interesting phenomenon Several studies have tried to integrate ANN with survival analysis.  As reviewed in the next section, few of the integrated survival analysis and ANN made significant difference in terms of model fittings, compared with the native survival analysis alone The indifference shows that both approaches do not complement each other.  If they are essentially different, the inte grated approach should produce some results that are signifi cantly different from the pure survival analysis alone, either positively or negatively Again, we emphasize that our discussion is still a pure conjecture at this stage   3   B RIEF C ASE R EVIEW OF S URVIVAL A NALYSIS A PPLICATIONS     3.1. Applications Found in IEEE Digital Library  In this section, we briefly review the papers found in the IEEE digital library w ith the keyword of survival analysis  search. The online search was conducted in the July of 2007, and we found about 40 papers in total. There were a few biomedical studies among the 40 survival-analysis papers published in IEEE publications. These are largely standard biomedical applications and we do not discuss these papers, for obvious reasons  Mazzuchi et al. \(1989\m ed to be the first to actively  advocate the use of Cox's \(1 972\ proportional hazards model \(PHM\in engineering re liability.  They quoted Cox's 1972\ original words industrial reliability studies and medical studies to show Cox's original motivation Mazzuchi et al \(1989 while this model had a significant impact on the biom edical field, it has received little attention in the reliability literature Nearly two decades after the introducti on paper of Mazzuchi et al 1989\ears that little significant changes have occurred in computer science and IEEE related engineering fields with regard to the proportional hazards models and survival analysis as a whole  Stillman et al. \(1995\used survival analysis to analyze the data for component maintenance and replacement programs Reineke et al. \(1998 ducted a similar study for determining the optimal maintenance by simulating a series system of four components Berzuini and Larizza \(1996 integrated time-series modeling with survival analysis for medical monitoring.  Kauffman and Wang \(2002\analyzed the Internet firm su rvival data from IPO \(initial public offer to business shutdown events, with survival analysis models  Among the 40 survival analysis papers, which we obtained from online search of the IEEE digital library, significant percentage is the integration of survival analysis with artificial neural networks \(ANN In many of these studies the objective was to utilize ANN to modeling fitting or parameter estimation for survival analysis.  The following is an incomplete list of the major ANN survival analysis integration papers found in IEEE digital library, Arsene et 2006 Eleuteri et al. \(2003\oa and Wong \(2001\,  Mani et al 1999\ The parameter estimation in survival analysis is particular complex due to the requirements for processing censored observations. Therefore, approach such as ANN and Bayesian statistics may be helpful to deal with the complexity. Indeed, Bayesian survival analysis has been expanded significantly in recent years \(Ibrahim, et al. 2005  We expect that evolutionary computing will be applied to survival analysis, in similar way to ANN and Bayesian approaches  With regard to the application of ANN to survival analysis we suggest three cautions: \(1\he integrated approach should preserve the capability to process censoring otherwise, survival analysis loses its most significant advantage. \(2\ Caution should be taken when the integrated approach changes model struct ure because most survival analysis models, such as Cox's proportional hazards models and accelerated failure time models, are already complex nonlinear models with built-in failure mechanisms.  The model over-fitting may cause model identifiability  problems, which could be very subtle and hard to resolve 3\he integrated approach does not produce significant improvement in terms of model fitting or other measurements, which seemed to be the case in majority of the ANN approach to survival analysis, then the extra complication should certainly be avoided. Even if there is improvement, one should still take caution with the censor handling and model identifiability issues previously mentioned in \(1\ and \(2  3.2. Selected Papers Found in MMR-2004  In the following, we briefly review a few survival analysis related studies presented in a recent International Conference on Mathematical Methods in Reliability, MMR 2004 \(Wilson et al. 2005  Pena and Slate \(2005\ddressed the dynamic reliability Both reliability and survival times are more realistically described with dynamic models. Dynamic models generally refer to the models that incorporate the impact of actions or interventions as well as thei r accumulative history, which 


 17 can be monitored \(Pena and Slate 2005\he complexity is obviously beyond simple regression models, since the dependence can play a crucial ro le. For example, in a loadsharing network system, failure of a node will increase the loads of other nodes and influences their failures  Duchesne \(2005\uggested incorporating usage accumulation information into the regression models in survival analysis.  To simplify the model building Duchesne \(2005\umes that the usage can be represented with a single time-dependent covariate.  Besides reviewing the hazard-based regression models, which are common in survival analysis, Duchesne 2005\viewed three classes of less commonly used regression models: models based on transfer functionals, models based on internal wear and the so-called collapsible models. The significance of these regression models is that they expand reliability modeling to two dimensions. One dimension is the calendar time and the other is the usage accumulation.  Jin \(2005\ reviewed the recent development in statisti cal inference for accelerated failure time \(AFT\odel and the linear transformation models that include Cox proportional hazards model and proportional odds models as special cases. Two approaches rank-based approach and l east-squares approach were reviewed in Jin \(2005\. Osbo rn \(2005\d a case study of utilizing the remote diagnostic data from embedded sensors to predict system aging or degradation.  This example should indicate the potential of survival analysis and competing risks analysis in the prognostic and health management PHM\ since the problem Osborn \(2005 addressed is very similar to PHM. The uses of embedded sensors to monitor the health of complex systems, such as power plants, automobile, medical equipment, and aircraft engine, are common. The main uses for these sensor data are real time assessment of th e system health and detection of the problems that need immediate attention.  Of interest is the utilization of those remote diagnostic data, in combination with historical reliability data, for modeling the system aging or degradation. The biggest challenge with this task is the proper transformation of wear  time The wear is not only influenced by internal \(temperature, oil pressures etc\xternal covariates ambient temperature, air pressure, etc\, but also different each time   4  S UMMARY AND P ERSPECTIVE   4.1. Summary  Despite the common foundation with traditional reliability theory, such as the same probability definitions for survival function  S  t  and reliability  R  t  i.e  S  t  R  t well as the hazards function the exact same term and definition are used in both fields\rvival analysis has not achieved similar success in the field of reliability as in biomedicine The applications of survival analysis seem still largely limited to the domain of biomedicine.  Even in the sister fields of biomedicine such as biology and ecology, few applications have been conducted \(Ma 1997, Ma and Bechinski 2008\ the engin eering fields, the Meeker and Escobar \(1998\ monograph, as well as the Klein and Goel 1992\ to be the most comprehensive treatments  In Section 2, we reviewed the essential concepts and models of survival analysis. In Section 3, we briefly reviewed some application cases of survival analysis in engineering reliability.  In computer science, survival analysis seems to be still largely unknown.  We believe that the potential of survival analysis in computer science is much broader than network and/or software reliability alone. Before suggesting a few research topics, we no te two additional points  First, in this article, we exclusively focused on univariate survival analysis. There are two other related fields: one is competing risks analysis and the other is multivariate survival analysis The relationship between multivariate survival analysis and survival analysis is similar to that between multivariate statistical analysis and mathematical statistics.  The difference is that the extension from univariate to multivariate in survival analysis has been much more difficult than the developm ent of multivariate analysis because of \(1\rvation cens oring, and \(2\pendency which is much more complex when multivariate normal distribution does not hold in survival data.  On the other hand, the two essential differences indeed make multivariate survival analysis unique and ex tremely useful for analyzing and modeling time-to-event data. In particular, the advantages of multivariate survival analysis in addressing the dependency issue are hardly matched by any other statistical method.  We discuss competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis in separate articles \(Ma and Krings 2008a, b, & c  The second point we wish to note is: if we are asked to point out the counterpart of survival analysis model in reliability theory, we would suggest the shock or damage model.   The shock model has an even longer history than survival analysis and the simplest shock model is the Poisson process model that leads to exponential failure rate model The basic assumption of the shock model is the notion that engineered systems endure some type of wear, fatigue or damage, which leads to the failure when the strengths exceed the tolerance limits of th e system \(Nakagawa 2006 There are extensive research papers on shock models in the probability theory literature, but relatively few monographs The monograph by Nakagawa \(2006\s to be the latest The shock model is often formulated as a Renewal stochastic process or point process with Martingale theory The rigorous mathematical derivation is very similar to that of survival analysis from counting stochastic processes  which we briefly outlined in section 2.6  It is beyond the scope of the paper to compare the shock model with survival analysis; however, we would like to make the two specific comments. \(1\Shock models are essentially the stochastic process model to capture the failure mechanism based on the damage induced on the system by shocks, and the resulting statistical models are 


 18 often the traditional reliability distribution models such as exponential and Weibull failure distributions.  Survival analysis does not depend on specific shock or damage Instead, it models the failure with abstract time-to-event random variables.  Less restrictive assumptions with survival analysis might be more useful for modeling software reliability where the notions of fatigue, wear and damage apparently do not apply.  \(2\hock models do not deal with information censoring, the trademark of failure time data.  \(3\ Shock models, perhaps due to mathematical complexity, have not been applied widely in engineering reliability yet.  In contrast, the applications of survival analysis in biomedical fields are much extensive.  While there have been about a dozen monographs on survival analysis available, few books on shock models have been published.  We believe that survival analysis and shock models are complementary, a nd both are very needed for reliability analysis, with shock model more focused on failure mechanisms and the survival analysis on data analysis and modeling  4.2. Perspective   Besides traditional industrial and hardware reliability fields we suggest that the following fields may benefit from survival analysis  Software reliability Survival analysis is not based on the assumptions of wear, fatigue, or damage, as in traditional reliability theory.  This seems close to software reliability paradigm. The single biggest challenge in applying above discussed approaches to softwa re systems is the requirement for a new metric that is able to replace the survival time variable in survival analysis. This "time" counterpart needs to be capable of characterizing the "vulnerability" of software components or the system, or the distance to the next failure event. In other words, this software metric should represent the metric-to-event, similar to time-toevent random variable in survival analysis.  We suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(Li and Vitanyi 1997\n be a promising candidate. Once the metric-to-event issue is resolved, survival analysis, both univariate and multivariate survival analysis can be applied in a relative straightforward manner. We suggest that the shared frailty models are most promising because we believ e latent behavior can be captured with the shared fra ilty \(Ma and Krings 2008b  There have been a few applications of univariate survival analysis in software reliability modeling, including examples in Andersen et al.'s \(1995\ classical monograph However, our opinion is that without the fundamental shift from time-to-event to new metric-to-event, the success will be very limited. In software engineering, there is an exception to our claim, which is the field of software test modeling, where time variable may be directly used in survival analysis modeling  Modeling Survivability of Computer Networks As described in Subsection 2.3, random censoring may be used to model network survivability.  This modeling scheme is particularly suitable for wireless sensor network, because 1\ of the population nature of wireless nodes and \(2\ the limited lifetime of the wireless nodes.  Survival analysis has been advanced by the needs in biomedical and public health research where population is th e basic unit of observation As stated early, a sensor networ k is analogically similar to a biological population. Furthermore, both organisms and wireless nodes are of limited lifetimes. A very desirable advantage of survival analysis is that one can develop a unified mathematical model for both the reliability and survivability of a wireless sensor network \(Krings and Ma 2006  Prognostic and Health Management in Military Logistics PHM involves extensive modeling analysis related to reliability, life predictions, failure analysis, burnin elimination and testing, quality control modeling, etc Survival analysis may provide very promising new tools Survival analysis should be able to provide alternatives to the currently used mathematical tools such as ANN, genetic algorithms, and Fuzzy logic.  The advantage of survival analysis over the other alternatives lies in its unique capability to handle information censoring.  In PHM and other logistics management modeling, information censoring is a near universal phenomenon. Survival analysis should provide new insights and modeling solutions   5  R EFERENCES   Aalen, O.
