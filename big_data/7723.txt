dhrubajit.adhikary@gmail.com 2 swarup@nehu.ac.in Abstract Association rule mining ARM techniques are effective in extracting frequent patterns and hidden associations among data items in various databases These techniques are widely used for learning behavior predicting events and making decisions at various levels The conventional ARM techniques are however limited to databases comprising categorical data only whereas the real-world databases mostly in business and scientiìc domains have attributes containing quantitative data Therefore an improvised methodology called Quantitative Association Rule Mining QARM is used that helps discovering hidden associations from the real-world quantitative databases In this paper we present an exhaustive discussion on the trends in QARM research and further make a systematic classiìcation of the available techniques into different categories based on the type of computational methods they adopted We perform a critical analysis of various methods proposed so far and present a theoretical comparative study among them We also enumerate some of the issues that needs to be addressed in future research Index Terms Association Rules Quantitative Association Rules Clustering Fuzzy Evolutionary approach Information theory I I NTRODUCTION With the passage of time and advances in technology the nature and volume of data changed remarkably Due to numerous information sensing and information gathering devices and techniques the modern databases are no more alike the market-basket databases where classical association rule mining techniques can be applied Most modern databases in domains like business health-care stock-market bioinformatics etc are larger in size dimensions and contain attributes that are quantitative in nature Therefore to handle quantitative data and mine meaningful association rules in multidimensional quantitative databases better ARM techniques became a necessity Henceforth the concept of Quantitative Association Rule Mining was coined Then onwards a good number of QARM techniques has been proposed in recent decades These techniques follow different trends w.r.t time and need and have their own advantages and limitations when applied in different quantitative databases In this paper we try to articulate various trends followed in QARM research since the inception of the concept in the pioneering work by R Srikant et al W e present a comprehensive study of various QARM approaches and analyze a few techniques from each one of them To begin with we discuss the background of ARM and QARM techniques in the following section II B ACKGROUND An explicit deìnition of the ARM problem was given by Agrawal et al From the perspecti v e of analyzing mark etbasket data for a set of items I   I 1 I 2 I 3   I m  and a database of transactions D   t 1 t 2 t 3   t n  where each transaction t i  I  the ARM problem is to identify all interesting Association Rules AR of the form X  Y where X  I  Y  I are actually the non-empty frequentitemsets and X  Y    All such AR satisfying either or both the two thresholds of rule interestingness viz minimum support and minimum conìdence are considered relevant and informative Support of an association rule is calculated as the percentage of records containing X  Y to the total number of records in the database Conìdence is the strength of the implication in a rule it is calculated as the percentage of records that contain Y if they contain X QARM is an improvised form of association rule mining applied to databases containing both quantitative and categorical attributes Alike as an AR a Quantitative Association Rule QAR is formally an implication of the form X  Y The left side of the implication is called antecedent and the right side is called succedent also consequent  Both these cedents also called attribute sets  may be comprised of a single attribute trivial cedent  or multiple attributes non-trivial cedent  Unlike a conventional AR in a QAR both quantitative and categorical attributes may participate as any of the cedents and the common measures of rule interestingness i.e support and conìdence can be applied to it Other measures available for evaluating the quality of a QAR are Lift Leverage Conviction Gain Certainty-Factor etc which are widely discussed in and If both the left and right side of a QAR has tri vial cedent it is called single dimensional QAR else it is multidimensional An example of a multi-dimensional QAR is given below Salary 40 k  50 k   Married  Yes   N umLoans 2 1 In this QAR Salary and NumLoans are Quantitative attributes whereas Married is a nominal Categorical attribute with categories Yes  No It is a positive QAR as the consequent is positively correlated with the antecedent Similarly negative rules represented as X  Y may also be 126 2015 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Systems \(ReTIS 978-1-4799-8349-0/15/$31.00 ©2015 IEEE 


discovered that associate the presence of X to the absence of Y in the rule The antecedent X and consequent Y of a negative QAR may consist of one or more attributes and accordingly may be single or multi-dimensional Importantly for a QAR to be negative either antecedent part or consequent part or both of them have to be negated Following are some examples of negative QARs with negation 1 within the antecedent  X 2   q 1 q 2   Y 1   r 1 r 2   Y 2   s 1 s 2   2 within the consequent  X 1   p 1 p 2   Y 1   r 1 r 2   X 2   q 1 q 2   Y 2   s 1 s 2   3 within both antecedent  consequent  X 1   p 1 p 2   X 2   q 1 q 2   Y 2   s 1 s 2   Here X 1 X 2 Y 1 and Y 2 are quantitative attributes and   L b U b  means those intervals other than  L b U b  where L b  U b mean the lower and upper bound of an interval With these concepts to start with we may move on to present the research trends in QARM in the next section III QARM T RENDS T ECHNIQUES Since inception of the problem numerous contributions are made using different approaches to mine QARs Each approach follows a trend and has several techniques within it Each such technique has its own pros and cons when applied in different scenario To have a quick glimpse of the trends in QARM we classify these techniques into certain categories                Fig 1 Classiìcation of QARM techniques based on the computational techniques or approaches they adopted shown in Fig:1 To have a better comprehension of the same we review the prominent techniques under each category and discuss their merits and limitations A Partitioning Approach Srikant and Agrawal in their pioneering work introduce the partitioning approach to convert quantitative attributes into boolean attributes by partitioning large range of quantitative data into disjoint intervals and then map each  attribute interval  pair to a boolean attribute interpreting it as a marketbasket item They also identify the min-support and minconìdence problem lying within this approach The minsupport problem says if the count of intervals for a quantitative attribute is high the support for individual intervals may be low and so a few QARs comprising this attribute may not be detected for lacking minimum support To overcome this bottleneck if interval-size is increased to reduce the number of intervals the approach still suffers from information loss in terms of conìdence This information loss multiplies with the increase in interval size because some QARs comprising this attribute may not be detected for lacking minimum conìdence Moreover the number of rules generated goes very large and the rule-mining process becomes time consuming as well In Chan and Au pointed out another weakness of the partitioning approach that lies in the task of deciding appropriate thresholds for rule evaluation measures If thresholds are very large a user may not discover some useful rules and if thresholds are very small the user may get confused by many irrelevant rules They suggested an objective interestingness measure called adjusted difference that requires no user-supplied thresholds Fukuda et al use computational geometry that seem to enhance the partitioning approach They present optimized interval generation in linear time on sorted data However while dealing large databases sorting of each numeric attribute is a costly afìar and occupy large space in memory Therefore they propose the randomized bucketing idea to discover optimized ranges for partitioning quantitative attributes in huge databases Commonly used partitioning methods either follow equal-width or equal-depth also equal-frequency intervals Li et al in clariìed that the equal-width and equal-depth partitioning methods hardly consider both value similarities and densities simultaneously So they present an adaptive partitioning approach that merges smaller intervals to form larger intervals repeatedly Their unsupervised partitioning approach initially distributes quantitative attribute value in a different interval and merge adjacent similar intervals using a certain criterion considering both value similarities and densities of quantitative attributes Recently Dancheng et al introduce a concept that performs discretization using self-adaptive approach This approach generates better and reasonable partitions that gives high conìdence ARs thereby guaranteeing relatively high support To nd rules this technique pre-computes the conditional probability density curves of association between the quantitative attributes Next it includes some wide ranges as partitions that have values adjacent to the peak of the curve Such values help nding QARs having high conìdence and wider range helps nding QARs having higher support Finally these partitions are used for apriori association rule mining Though self-adaptive based technique helps in discovering stronger QARs thereby enhancing rule support  conìdence however it is limited to reveal single numeral to nominal implications only 1 Discussion The techniques using Partitioning approach are prone to suffer from Support-Conìdence conîict and many 127 


rules problem because reasonable range or interval detection is a challenge in partitioning Majority of the research works are inclined towards solving this issue In addition the use of user-given thresholds as rule interestingness measure is common throughout most of these techniques that ultimately drives the overall quantity and quality of mined rules QAR mining using partitioning approach also takes higher execution time and mostly yields single dimensional positive QARs B Clustering Approach Clustering is an effective alternative to nd meaningful quantitative regions for the discovery of association rules in quantitative databases An efìcient hierarchical clustering algorithm is proposed by Chien et al in relying upon variation of density to generate intervals for mining QARs DRMiner is a QARM technique that uses the notion of density to handle quantitative attributes It fairly nds positive multi-dimensional association rules and because of the density measure it can avoid trivial and redundant rules DBSMiner  aims t o scale up well for high dimensional quantitati v e association rule mining using the notion of density-connected  The N dimensional quantitative search space is divided into multiple grids of rectangular units using equal-frequency partitioning of every attribute such that no such unit apparently overlaps In the grid intersection of one interval from each attribute is performed to form cells containing records A cell is considered dense if quantity of records in it exceeds a user deìned threshold Finally connected-high-density cells are united to form clusters Based on dense grid Junrui et al proposes another method MQAR Mining Quantitati v e Association Rule that can solve the support-conìdence conîict as well as can help to get rid of the noise and redundant rules MQAR uses a FP-tree lik e DGFP-tree that helps to mine association rules in high dimensional databases The DGFP-tree compress the database effectively and hence there is no need of scanning the database many times MQAR uses a novel grid and density based clustering to cluster database using dense subspaces in the tree MQAR is scalable in dealing with high dimensional databases Miller and Yang identify the aws of the equal depth partitioning method and present a technique that suggests to discover clusters in the quantitative attributes and use the resultant clusters as itemsets for nding boolean association rules A further extension of this idea can be found in the work of Tong et al where the y impro v e d the partitioning method by taking into account the relations among attributes all together Initially they form clusters using quantitative attributes Next they map each cluster into the domain of the quantitative attribute Thus these projections return overlapped intervals which they consider reasonable and assert to be a good resolution to the min-support and min-conìdence issues in partitioning approach 1 Discussion The techniques using Clustering approach mostly concentrate on reasonable interval generation using the concept of variation of density or dense regions They also try to reduce the support-conìdence conîict and eliminate useless redundant rules The simpler clustering techniques are straightforward while the complex ones viz 13 and 14 uses concepts like hyperplanes dense-grids etc Not all clustering techniques are fairly scalable for high dimensional cases but most of them yield single as well as multi-dimensional QARs Use of min-sup min-conf thresholds is common but some techniques require the users to specify other thresholds The rules generated by the techniques from this approach are however only positive C Statistical Approach Various statistical measures such as mean median variance etc are also applied in QARM Aumann et al contrib ute towards QARM research by providing a new statistical theory for deìning quantitative association rules They considered the distribution of the continuous data via standard statistical measures This technique yields positive multi-dimensional quantitative association rules at the expense of larger database scans and has a feature of generating meaningful sub-rules Kang et al propose another w a y o f mining QAR using statistical measures but with a thin inîuence of the partitioning approach They adopt a two step process Firstly it pre-processes all quantitative attributes to convert them into binary attributes and next convert back the binary association rules into QARs The rst step focuses on domain partition of quantitative attributes by selecting the partitions whose collective standard deviations is smaller Once partitions are ready binary association rule BAR mining is used Finally the post-processing step integrates the BARs to reconvert them into corresponding QARs 1 Discussion Statistical approach uses various statistical measures to analyze distributions or to determine reasonable intervals for frequent itemset generation The bipartition techniques usually suffer from uneven distributions of values into intervals resulting uninteresting QARs Hence measures like standard deviation came into use However rules generated by statistical techniques are positive and multi-dimensional but rule-generation is costly due to greater number of database scans D Fuzzy Approach Sometimes detected intervals of attributes participating in a QAR may not be precise or meaningful for analysts to unleash non-trivial knowledge with ease Instead of using intervals if linguistic terminologies could be used to represent certain associations frequent patterns etc then knowledge discovery could be more easier Some applications may cosider an AR interesting if only it discovers association amid some useful concepts such as regular customer  low salary and new house  Such concepts may be modelled using fuzzy concept using fuzzy set theory The rules having these terms are called fuzzy association rules and the approach is considered as Fuzzy QARM approach Zhang formulates a method to mine rules containing 1 crisp values 2 intervals and 3 fuzzy terms It employed equal frequency partition with fuzzy concept to handle quantitative and categorical attributes For discovering frequent item-sets it uses an extended 128 


Apriori algorithm Gyenesei assigns each quantitati v e attribute with several fuzzy sets instead of sharp intervals that characterize the attribute Fuzzy support fuzzy conìdence and fuzzy correlation are used as interestingness measures Importantly this method may suffer from anomalies if fuzzy sets are not well chosen In an another attempt numerical attributes are converted to fuzzy binary attributes and employs efìcient thread based mechanism for mining the quantitative rules quickly Recently Zheng et al proposed a generic Optimized Fuzzy Association Rule Mining OFARM method which is easy to extend for continuous data It optimizes the partition points for fuzzy sets where a multiple objective function is used A two-level iterative method is used to generate association-rules In addition to MinSup  MinConf this method uses one of the newer effective measures for evaluation of association rules called the Certainty Factor  1 Discussion In classical fuzzy techniques linguitic terminologies for deìning partitions was the idea but the modern ones convert the quantitative data into fuzzy sets and partition points are used to divide neighbouring fuzzy sets One problem with classical fuzzy QARM techniques is that they do not optimize the selection of partition points and use Extended Apriori which takes higher exec-time as dimensions increases But the modern fuzzy techniques take care of it The fuzzy QARs using newer techniques are strong positive and comprise at most two dimensions within antecedents and one dimension in the consequent However these techniques may even suffer from the Support-Conìdence conîict if the thresholds are not wisely chosen E Evolutionary Approach The QAR mining problem is also treated with evolutionary algorithmic EA approach by different researches in due course The most popular type of EA is the genetic algorithm GA that has found utilization in QAR mining Recent research on QAR mining witnesses the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms too Alatas  et al proposes a genetic algorithmic strategy for both positive and negative QAR mining With the help of 1 adaptive mutation probability 2 uniform operator and 3 an efìcient tness function their method is capable to mine QARs without taking any thresholds and without data preparation QuantMiner is a G A based approach that follows a set of rule templates while mining rules A template is nothing but a preset format of a QAR It may be selected by the user or may be system computed QuantMiner nds reasonable intervals in ARs dynamically by optimizing the support count and rule-conìdence The QARM research also encompases multi-objective evolutionary algorithm The ARM process can be considered as a multi-objective problem instead of a single objective in which the rule evaluation measures may have different objectives Kaya et al 25 proposes tw o n o v e l methods to optimize QARs They use three important criteria support conìdence and amplitude as thresholds Recently Martin et al proposes a n e w multi-objecti v e e v olutionary approach for mining a smaller set of ve and ve QARs with better comprehensibility and lower cost of computation 1 Discussion Evolutionary algorithms often perform well in nding approximate solutions to all types of problems using mechanisms inspired by biological evolution The GA approach has the specialty to mine both positive and negative QAR without discretizing attributes at prior Hence it takes lesser database scans and also yields rules with optimized support and conìdence Multi-objective evolutionary techniques are result of recent research that try to reduce the cost of mining and optimize the number of positive and negative QARs generated without compromising rule interestingness F Other Approaches There are several approaches other than those which are classiìed above that try to solve quantitative association rule mining in their own ways Cheng et al in highlight that another combinatorial explosion problem may get triggered by the task of combining the adjacent intervals of a quantitative attribute to increase support and detect meaningful intervals To address this combinatorial explosion problem using information-theoretic approach they introduce the MIC Mutual Information and Clique framework to inspect the mutual information MI between every attribute pairs and establish a MI Graph representing attributes having strong informative relationship w.r.t a pre-deìned threshold Thus each frequent item-set is represented by a Clique present in the MI Graph In this method the attribute sets and their corresponding intervals to be combined or joined can be reduced effectively Li et al e xtends a grid-based QAR mining method using meta-rules that store data tuples in linked lists where QAR mining is executed In meta-rule guided association rule mining some syntactic or semantic constraints are speciìed in the form of rules Nemmiche and Guillaume introduce another dif ferent method for mining optimal positive and negative QARs They state that irrespective of the fact whether an AR is ve or ve the use of support and conìdence as rule interestingness measures is not sufìcient for optimal QAR generation Therefore in their method they used tables to summarize the trend of variable interactions thereby highlighting the zones that are interesting Moreover the method also introduces a new rule semantic of the form inîuential\(s  Inîuenceable\(s and an impact measure Inîuence that analyses variable behavior and guarantees that rules of higher potential will be discovered discarding the irrelevant ones 1 Discussion The above techniques are applied on QAR mining without having much inîuence from the general approaches They have their own unique way of dealing with QAR mining problem Most of these techniques strive to minimize the many-rules generation and irrelevant-rules generation problem The metarule guided technique tries to nd multidimensional rules and is linearly scalable to database size and dimensions The next technique deploying impact measure usage has capability to mine both positive and negative QAR 129

QARM techniques found applications in various domains Therefore a large number of research works are contributed towards efìciently solving the problem of QAR mining In this work we highlight various trends in QARM research and present a comprehensive study on various approaches with their relative merits and limitations To conclude it can be stated that from the broad variety of techniques in existence no particular technique seems to be suitable for application in all domains because the appearance size and nature of data belonging to different domains vary Moreover current solutions may be considered inadequate because there are several issues pertaining to the available QARM techniques which we identify and enlist below 1 Inability to mine both Positive and Negative QARs 2 Failure to generate efìcient multi-dimensional QARs 3 Dependence on proper selection of thresholds for generating rules 4 Redundant uninteresting and misleading rules generation 5 Poor scalability of the mining technique w.r.t database dimensions and volume 6 Large database scans to generate frequent itemsets and mine rules 7 High computational cost or execution time Further works are required to

Retail is a sparse dataset  consists of product sales data from retail stores Each transaction in the Retai dataset represents purchase information from one consumer at a time The details of the datasets are presented in gure 6 The programming language used to implement all the three algorithms is java and run in 3.3 GHz Intel processor 4 Gbyte memory and Windows 7 32bit OS Figs 7Ö9 show results of runtime experiments regarding the real and synthetic datasets shown in gure 6 In these gures we can observe that IHT-growth outperforms the others in all of the cases IHT-growth uses the proposed header tree structure to store the 1-frequent items instead of the older header table to minimize access times to search items As a result its advantages have a positive effect on reducing runtime in whole experiments Especially in the case of Retail dataset the difference of runtime between our algorithm and the others is much more than the other datasets  In all experiments FP-growth shows the worst performance Note that IHT-growth method can be used with any fptree mining to improve its efìciency We suggested here two methods to implement the new algorithm If we dont know the number of items in advance the First method is suggested In this experiments we used the second method By using the second method we can create a more efìcient BSHTree because all the items with highest frequency will be appeared on the top of the BSHTree By using this method the run time can be improved by minimizing the searching time of items while sorting out the transactions VI CONCLUSION This study proposes an efìcient transaction processing method during the transaction scanning time By applying the efìcient binary search tree the mining time drastically reduced The new transaction sorting method is also improves the performance of mining The experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the fp-growth and IFP-growth two well known and widely used algorithms Here we used a BSHTree after the rst scan to store the items with support count While using the BSHTree we used the actual names of items as keys This method can be applied to improve the mining process with any frequent itemset mining algorithm which is using a header table R EFERENCES  Jia wei H an Jian Pei and Y iwen Y in Mining Frequent P atterns without CandidateGeneration,SIGMOD 00 Proceedings of the 2000 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data.Pages 1-12  Gw angb umPyun a Unil Y u n a  K eun Ho Ryu  E f cient frequent pattern mining based on Linear Preìx tree Knowledge-Based Systems 55 2014 125Ö139  Y uh-JiuanTsay a T ain-Jung Hsu a Jing-Rung Y ub,FIUT  A n e w method for mining frequent itemsets,Information Sciences 179 2009 1724 1737  K e-Chung Lin I-En Liao  Zhi-Sheng Chen An impro v e d frequent pattern growth method for mining association rules Expert Systems with Applications 38 2011 5154Ö5161  F an-Chen Tseng An adapti v e approach to mining frequent itemsets efìciently Expert Systems with Applications 39 2012 13166Ö13172  R Agra w al T  Imielinski A.N Sw ami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases in Proceedings of the ACMSIGMOD Conference on Management of Data pages 1993 pp 207Ö216  R Agra w al R Srikant F ast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules very Large Data Bases\(VLDB 1994 487499  Xiaobing Liu K u n Zhai W itold Pedrycz An impro v e d association rules mining method,Expert Systems with Applications 39 2012 13621374  Qiao yongwei,Y ang Hui Dong T ingjian,Research On QAR Data Mining Method Based On Improved Association Rule,Physics Procedia 24 2012 1514-1519  T  Hu S.Y  Sung H Xiong Q Fu Disco v ery of maximum length frequent itemsets Information Sciences 178 1 2008 69-87  G Lee U Y un K Ryu Sliding windo w based weighted maximal frequent pattern mining over data streams Expert Systems with Applications 41 2 2014 694-708  S.K T anbeer  C.F  Ahmed B.S Jeong Y  Lee Ef cient single-pass frequent pattern mining using a preìx-tree Information Sciences 179 5 2008 559583  V S Tseng C.W  W u B.E Shie P S Y u  UP-Gro wth an ef cient algorithm for high utility itemset mining Knowledge Discovery and Data mining KDD 2010 253-262  T  W u  Y  Chen J han Re-e xamination of interestingness measures in pattern mining a uniìed framework Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery DMKD 21 3 2010 371-397  J Han H Cheng D Xin X Y an Frequent pattern mining current status and future directions Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery DMKD 15 1 2007 55-86  Zaki Mohammed J Naren Ramakrishnan and Lizhuang Zhao Mining frequent boolean expressions application to gene expression and regulatory modeling International Journal of Knowledge Discovery in Bioinformatics IJKDB 1.3 2010 68-96 1084 2015 International Conference on Advances in Computing Communications and Informatics ICACCI

paying a price of a slightly worse ratio for subsets Taken together the price of having more subsets is preferred because subsets contain only items actually in the assembly while superset and overlap patterns also contain unrelated items The 002rst and second row of 002gure 8 correspond to the instance and the pattern-based approach for graded synchrony The third corresponds to the instance-based approach for binary synchrony Comparing the diagrams for unrelated patterns our graded method detects all injected patterns 050\002rst and second rows\051 while the binary method also produces unrelated pattern In 050Borgelt et al 2015\051 it is demonstrated that the instance-based approach yields slightly better results than the pattern approach However this approach does not consider the precision of synchrony Surprisingly using only the pattern-based approach with a graded notion of synchrony yields a better ratio for overlap and superset patterns 7 CONCLUSIONS In this paper we presented a method to detect frequent synchronous patterns in event sequences using a graded notion of synchrony for mining patterns in the presence of imprecise synchrony of events constituting occurrences and selective participation 050incomplete occurrences\051 Our method adapts methods presented in the literature to tackle selective participation using binary synchrony especially the instancebased approach which looks at instances of patterns to improve the detection by removing instances that are likely chance events checking the precision of synchrony of these instances We demonstrate in our experiments that using a graded notion of synchrony for support computation helps to simplify the detection of selective participation because a pattern-based approach yields better results or at least equally good results as an instance-based approach This is a considerable advantage since identifying the individual pattern instances is costly and thus it is desirable to avoid it ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The work presented in this paper was partially supported by the Spanish Ministry for Economy and Competitiveness 050MINECO Grant TIN2012-31372\051 and by the Principality of
