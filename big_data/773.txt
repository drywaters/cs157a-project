 One of the major challenges of designing a dissemination protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks WSNs\ is energy efficiency. Flooding and SPIN, which are very well-known proactive methods, spontaneously disseminate the sensed data without a request from an arbitrary sink node. However, these proactive protocols disseminate the data even to some nodes that do not need it, which is energy inefficient. In order to overcome this weakness, we introduce a novel semiproactive protocol to disseminate only to pertinent nodes instead of all nodes. Thus some nodes, such as arbitrary sink nodes that want the sensed data, are able to obtain the data easily within 
n hops. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol has higher average node energy efficiency than that of well-known earlier work, SPIN. If a proactive protocol, such as SPIN, is changed to semi-proactive and has only a 1hop burden, then the energy efficiency enhancement is up to 83.7% compared with SPIN     1. Introduction  A Wireless Sensor Network \(WSN\hich is used to observe changes of environment and/or collect data is a core technology that makes possible interactions between humans and the environment in applications such as ubiquitous computing, smart homes, and office 
automation. Recently, despite developments in semiconductors and telecommunication, WSNs still have several problems such as limitations on sensor nodes \(computational capacities and memory communication bandwidth, and more important battery powe th e s e WS N env i ronm en t s t h e sensor node performs not only transmission of data but also relay of data. If some nodes become energyexhausted then the whole network lifetime may be reduced. Hence, an efficient low power consumption design is very important not only for the network 
protocol, but also for the operating system, middleware and security t h is pa per w e rais e a qu e s tion about this weakness of traditional proactive protocols and present a new dissemination protocol to guarantee D ata A ccessibility W ithin N hops, called the DAWN protocol, which is semi-proactive Data dissemination [3 is a f u n d a m e n tal f e at u r e o f a WSN, since thousands of sensor nodes may collect exchange, and transmit data. Flooding and Sensor Protocols for Information via Negotiation \(SPIN   
two well-known proactive schemes, have been employed for data dissemination. First, in Flooding each node retransmits the received data from all its neighbors. This is a very simple and primitive protocol It rapidly disseminates the data; however, it quickly wastes energy when a data implosion occurs. SPIN solves this issue by exchanging information and negotiating at each node. However, since general proactive protocols spontaneously disseminate data to all nodes without a request from an arbitrary sink node 
they still have an inefficient energy problem If we can appropriately disseminate the sensed data through only suitable nodes, almost all nodes may save energy. Based on this characteristic, DAWN disseminates only to particular nodes that are called backbone nodes. An arbitrary sink node is able to obtain the sensed data within n hops through backbone nodes. When DAWN carefully selects backbone nodes to disseminate the data, DAWN simultaneously takes into account three properties First, a backbone node may have a high residual energy level, because it has to disseminate the data to its 
neighboring low-level nodes. Second, the transmission distance between nodes has to guarantee more efficient energy consumption. Finally, the overlapped area of the transmission radius should be small. In this paper we compare our proposed scheme, DAWN, with SPIN Simulation results show that DAWN has higher node energy efficiency and more efficient energy consumption distribution than SPIN Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 explains previous work about proactive protocols on WSNs, Section 3 presents details of the proposed protocol, Section 4 evaluates our proposal by employing a simulation, and finally, Section 5 concludes this paper  2. Previous Work  Traditionally, with proactive dissemination protocols, the source node distributes the sensed data through the entire network without a request from an arbitrary sink node. Flooding and SPIN, two wellknown proactive schemes, have been previously employed for data dissemination. In Flooding, this protocol need not have a special scheme to disseminate the sensed data. The data are continuously sent to neighbor nodes until it reaches maximum-hop or destination. Flooding is easy to implement but has some problems  e of t h e m  is t h e data  duplication problem. As shown in Figure 1\(b\ince node B and node C transmit the data to D at the same time, node D receives duplicate data from the two nodes. This is very inefficient from the viewpoint of energy consumption   a\ \(b Figure 1 The duplication problem for Flooding  Since a node transmits data to its neighbors irrespective of whether the neighbor already has the data or not in Flooding, SPIN is proposed to solve the data duplication problem. To overcome this problem nodes negotiate with their neighbors before transmitting the data in SPIN, therefore it guarantees that only needed data will be transmitted. SPIN uses metadata  which describes the information to negotiate successfully SPIN has three phases, which are as follows. The first step, Figure 2\(a\ the advertising phase wherein a sensor node with data broadcasts an advertising message including metadata to its neighbor nodes. The second step, Figure 2\(b\ the request phase. The neighbor nodes that have received the advertising     In the reference paper [4 au t h o r s r e fe r to the  de s c r i p t o r s us e d i n  SPIN negotiations as metadata message check the metadata to determine whether the data is necessary or not. If the data is necessary, the neighbors send a request message to the sensor node that sent the advertisement. The third step, Figure 2\(c is the data transmission phase. The sensor node that received the request message transmits the data to the neighbors that sent the message. By the repeated use of the three steps, SPIN disseminates data throughout the entire network  a\dvertising b\equest  c\smission Figure 2 The main three phases for SPIN  However, the proactive protocol has a limitation regarding information transmission. Since it only disseminates data to all nodes in the network, it disseminates data even to some nodes that do not need it. That is very inefficient from the viewpoint of energy consumption. Since there is no method to know whether a node wants the data or not, it is impossible to find the most efficient way or only path to disseminate the data in proactive protocols. In contrast, if the only relatively few sink nodes suffer within just 1-hop, then the obtained benefit for energy consumption may be very efficient. In addition, we simulate the performance for n hops compared with SPIN. In this paper, we refer to this as a semi-proactive method and introduce the proposed protocol in the next section  3. A Dissemination Protocol to Guarantee Data Accessibility within N-hops  3.1. Preliminaries  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


Due to weaknesses of traditional proactive protocols as mentioned previously, we present a new dissemination protocol to guarantee D ata A ccessibility W ithin N hops, called the DAWN protocol, which is semi-proactive. Here, we assume that the sensor network is connected and dense. Each sensor node can acquire its residual energy level and maintain neighbor node information  DA WN f o r m s back bon e nodes and disseminates the sensed data to the whole network through backbone nodes. Only the backbone nodes actually receive the data; the other nodes receive only metadata. The nodes, having received the metadata, record the next hop to access the backbone node in their routing table. Before describing the proposed protocol, we define the following terms   Type of nodes  Waiting nodes A node that has received no message up to now, and has no relation with the data  Backbone node A node that has data. It can transmit the data to its low level nodes whenever they send a request message  Low level node  n A node that does not have data and may be in n hops away from backbone nodes  Ready node  n node that is waiting until it becomes a backbone node or low level node. If n is 1, then the node is the candidate node of the backbone node. If n is bigger than 1, it refers to the n th low level node   Type of messages  Backbone message The message that the node which became a backbone node, sends to its neighbor nodes. The ready node, which receives this message, may become its low level node and the waiting node may become the ready node in order to become the next backbone node  Low level message  n he message that the n th low level node sends to make its low level node. If the waiting node receives this message and then becomes the n th level ready node, and after waiting some time, it may become the 1  n st low level node   Waiting time  When DAWN selects the next backbone node or the low level node of neighbor candidates, this time provides a delay time  Since the waiting time is calculated by considering both network lifetime and energy efficiency, we take into account the two attributes as follows. The first attribute is e F  residual energy   initial energy  which refers to the remaining energy of a node. The second attribute is d F   1 min 1      d  and it means how close the distance is to  which is the most efficient distance. To explain  we use the following energy m  p tx d E 2 11      1  12   rx E  2 where tx E and rx E denote the energy consumption for transmitting and receiving a bit over a distance d  respectively 11  is the energy  bit consumed by the transmitter electronics 2  is the energy dissipated in the transmit op-amp and 12  is the energy  bit  consumed by the receiver electronics. Since tx E  increases exponentially with distance when data are transmitted, it may consume less energy when relaying data as opposed to directly transmitting data. However if the data are relayed too many times, it may consume even more energy. Therefore, determining an ideal distance is important for realizing energy efficient transmission     Figure 3 Data dissemination through relay nodes  Figure 3 shows data dissemination between nodes 0 n and K n When data are transmitted, the energy consumption through the path    0 K n n P is represented as follows      K r r r K n n P E n n P E 1 1 0        3 We define the average distance between each relay node as  The optimized number of relay nodes is  D as calculated by  Therefore, the energy consumption between nodes 0 n and K n is as follows   p K D n n P E      2 12 11 0        4 The energy consumption     0 K n n P E is minimized when it has a minimum value. Therefore when  0    0    K n n P E  the value of  is p p  1  2 12 11        The waiting time    d e w w T is set using two attribute e F and d F adding weight value e w and d w  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


We have to get the waiting time from  F  d d e e F w F w  1   d e w w using the formula         1     random F w w T d e where  is the maximum waiting time and random   a random function uniformly distributed from 0 to small delay which is near 0. If every node has the same value F  the random function can discriminate between the nodes  3.2. Operation Overview for DAWN Protocol  Since backbone nodes save and relay the data, we have to select carefully the node to ensure both energy efficiency and long network lifetime. To select the best node among the ready nodes, we should make the waiting time as short as possible. If there are some backbone nodes around the current ready node, the ready node that has received the backbone message becomes the low level node of the backbone node because the ready node need not be a backbone node Through this process, backbone nodes are being made while avoiding the overlapping area toward the whole network. The proposed protocol 1 DAWN forms backbone nodes so that an arbitrary sink node can access the data within 1-hop. The detailed 1 DAWN is as follows     1 d e w w DAWN  01 Data is generated 02 The sensing node disseminates the backbone message to its neighbor nodes, as shown in Figure 4\(a\igure 5\(d 03 A waiting node which has received the backbone message becomes a ready node, as shown in Figure 4\(b 04 Calculate waiting time    d e w w T and wait for the time 05 While There exist ready nodes 06 If There is no any message 07   The waiting time is expired and the node becomes the backbone node, as shown in Figure 4\(c 08   Disseminate the backbone message to its neighbor nodes, as shown in Figure 4\(c 09   The node receives the actual data from the backbone node, as shown in Figure 4\(d 10 Else if It receives a backbone message 11  If The node is the waiting node 12    A waiting node becomes the ready node, as shown in Figure 4\(d 13 Calculate the waiting time    d e w w T and wait for the time 14  Else if The node is the ready node 15    The node becomes the low level node of the node which it sent the backbone message, as shown in Figure 4\(d 16    Record the high level node to its routing table  a\ \(b c\ \(d Figure 4 Operation scenario for 1 DAWN      1 d e w w DAWN enables an arbitrary sink node to obtain the sensed data from backbone nodes within 1hop.

We continuously generate data until the star occurs. In the present paper, we define the network lifetime as the time from network initialization to the first node failure; in the worst case failures may result in network disconnection.

The performance of the semi-proactive method was evaluated and compared with SPIN DAWN simultaneously takes into account three properties, namely high residual energy level, the ideal transmitted distance, and the small overlapped area of the transmission radius, to select backbone nodes for efficient data dissemination.

The sink node accesses the data within 1-hop in the previous proactive protocols, however, the energy loss of some nodes, which do not need it, is undoubtedly very high. Contrarily, if the only relatively few sink nodes suffer just within n hops in the proposed protocol, then the obtained benefit for energy consumption is very efficient  Acknowledgment  We are grateful to Youngsub Lee for supporting simulation.

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.

Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds.
