Support is a measure of the importance of the association rules which shows that the association rules in all transactions are much more representative, the more support, the more important the association rules. Credibility is a measure of the accuracy of the association rules, although some of the rules of the association rules are very high, but the degree of support is very low, indicating that the association rule is very small, so it is not important 105 ____________________________ ________ 978-1-4 7 8126 0 1  31 00 ©201 IEEE

database to identify coverage holes for next coverage closure step  C  Automatically Generated Test Specification for ITBA The coverage goal for the given example is described using System Verilog Functional Coverage Syntax h o w n in Figure 8a. It is a cross coverage between 3 variables namely \(out, pos, a\with iff \(! rst\ditional guard for the cross coverage calculation. Cross coverage of a set of N coverage points is defined as the coverage of all combinations of all bins associated with the N coverage points, that is, the Cartesian product of the N sets of coverage point bins or exa m ple t h e cov e r g rou p i n  Figure 8a identifies a cross coverage between two 1íbit variables \(a, out\e 3íbits variables \(pos\ystem Verilog implicitly creates a coverage point for each variable. \(a, out\ill both have a cover point with 2 bins namely au  w h ile pos ill h a ve a co v e r poin t  with 8 bins, au t o [7  T h e cros s of ou t pos an d a  labeled out_XX_pos_XX_a\, therefore, has 32 cross products, and each cross product is a bin of out_XX_pos_XX_a    Figure 8: a. Cross-Coverage Declaration, b. Illegal Cross Points Combinations  The real difficulty in defining cross coverage goals is to get the exclusions correct, and this can be really difficult when the variables in the cross coverage have some constraints that determine the relationships that must be maintained between them. If these exclusions are not properly identified then the ability to accurately judge the actual coverage achieved becomes impossible since the missing coverage may contain a significant percentage of illegal cases. To illustrate the difficulty letís consider our simple three variable example: Our coverage goal is to test all of the legal combinations of all three variables \(out, pos and a\he definition of the legal cross coverage goals is not trivial even for this case, since we have to determine which combinations of \(out, pos, a\ are unreachable. Analyzing RTL implementation of the design Figure3, the illegal combinations turn out to be the ones listed in Figure 8b This leaves 5 valid combinations out of a total of 32, which would mean that if the exclusions are not specified then the maximum coverage attainable is 15  The proposed frame work passes the automatically extracted design constraints from the mining of the simulation data to the ITBA tool, Questa inFact, which respects those constraints and can provide an accurate count of the legal solutions in a cross. So if the following automatically generated constraint as explained in the data mining step ,ìconstraint assum_all {if\(!rst && \(pos 3'b001 || pos == 3'b010 || pos == 3'b011 \& a == 1'b1 out == 1'b0;}}î, is given to the ITBA, it will guide the tool to identify correct unreachable bins as indicated in Figure 9a and will result in the suppression of the test paths that violates the above constraint, i.e tests for cross coverage combination in which out==1íb0 where pos 3íb000..3íb111 and a= 1íb0 or tests in which out 1íb0 where pos==3íb000..3íb111 and a==1íb1 as indicated in Figure 9b. So respecting such constrain resulted in the suppression of 15 test scenarios that are unreachable for the DUV and focus to cover more meaningful coverage targets As more constraints are added the more the ITBA will be guided for better tests generation     Figure 9:  a. Constraints-aware Cross-Coverage Declaration b. Ignorable Cross-Coverage Combinations by ITBA Step  Finally Formal reach-ability analysis is used to identify unreachable coverpoints after ITBA step. The formal verifier reads the coverage results from ITBA simulation coverage database, then it leverages the formal engines under the hood to flag the coverage items that are unreachable so it can be  safely ignored and list them in coverage exclusion file that can be used to refine final coverage calculations  As a conclusion the initial simulation coverage of the running example from which the design constraints have been extracted was 65.6% which was boosted to 87.5% after the algorithmic test stimulus generation phase and finally applying formal exclusions resulted in final coverage of 98.5  2015 10th International Design & Test Symposium \(IDT 64 


Table  1: Progress of Coverage Ratios Increase During the Proposed Framework IV  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  In this experiment, the proposed verification framework has been exercised against a group of industrial designs downloaded from Opencores [22 b tain ed f r o m a set of  in-house regression test suites Table 1 lists some information about the designs under study such as the number of design modules, design size in LOC \(line of code\d the number of design covergroups and coverbins Table 1 illustrates the number of design constraints that have been extracted during the mining step and have been verified/proven by formal verification. It demonstrates the coverage results progress from the initial random simulation runs to the tests coverage after constraintsguided test stimulus generation step and finally the impact of applying formal exclusions \(formally proven unreachable cover items\e ITBA simulation runs and how each step contributes in the coverage closure of designs under verification V  C ONCLUSION  Due to the increasing complexity of modern circuit designs, a complementary set of functional verification techniques should work together to assure complete and fast verification cycle. This paper introduces a complete framework to accelerate coverage closure for the DUV which makes use of the initial simulation data analysis to identify frequent patterns as design input constraints and to extract coverage holes. The coverage holes as well as formally proven un-reachable coverage goals are used to automatically identify test specification to guide ITBA for better test scenarios and effective coverage closure. Our experimental results show the feasibility of proposed framework to achieve good increments in coverage closure cycle using many industrial designs  VI  R EFERENCES  1  S. Fine, A. Freund, I.

This is because we cannot consider whole data and must identify when a data becomes obsolete or invalid As the old information of a data stream may be no longer useful or possibly invalid at present.  In order to support various requirements of mining data stream, the mining window or the interesting recent range of a data stream needs not to be defined static but must be flexible. Based on this range, a data mining method can be able to identify when a transactions becomes stale or needs to be disregarded  In this paper, we have investigated the problem of mining frequent itemset over data stream using flexible size sliding window model and proposed a new algorithm for this problem. The size of sliding window is adaptively adjusted based on the amount of observed concept change in the underlying properties of incoming data stream. The size of window enlarges or increase when there is no significant amount of change observed. While the window size reduced or decrease when there is considerable amount of concept change or significant change in set of frequent itemsets occurs Based on the value of given by user, the size of window is being controlled. After every pane insertion the set of frequent itemsets are updated and value of concept change is calculated. If the value exceeds the given minimum change threshold the window gets smaller by deleting all the obsolete information before a point defined called checkmark  Experimental results shows that our algorithm tracks the concept change efficiently while mining data stream and is more adaptive to recent frequent itemsets than fixed size sliding window models or time fading window models. For the future work, we are trying to enhance the performance by using fuzzy sets for minimum change threshold value so that the values like low, medium, high and very high instead of certain value between ranges of 0 to 1 R EFERENCES  1                    H.

Our experiments show that YAFIM is about 18 faster than Apriori algorithms implemented in MapReduce framework Furthermore, we can achieve a better performance in both sizeup and speedup for different datasets. In addition, we also evaluated YAFIM for medical application and revealed that YAFIM outperforms MRApriori about 25 speedup  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is funded in part by China NSF Grants \(No 61223003\, and the USA Intel Labs University Research Program R EFERENCES  1
