Parallel Association Rule Mining with Minimum Inter-Processor Communication 001 Mohammad El-Hajj Department f Computing Science University of Alberta Edmonton AB Canada mohammad@cs.ualberta.ca Osmar R Za\250 031ane Department f Computing Science University of Alberta Edmonton AB Canada zaiane@cs.ualberta.ca Abstract Existing parallel association e mining algorithms suffer from many problems when mining massive transactional datasets One major problem is that most of the parallel algorithms for a shared nothing environment are Apriori 
based algorithms Apriori-based algorithms are proven to be not scalable due to many reasons mainly 1 the repetitive I/O disk scans 2 the huge computation and communication involved during the candidacy generation This paper proposes a new disk-based parallel association rule mining algorithm called Inverted Matrix which achieves its ef\336ciency by applying three new ideas First transactional data is converted into a new database layout called Inverted Matrix that prevents multiple scanning 
of the database during the mining phase in which 336nding globally frequent patterns could be achieved in less than a full scan with random access This data ructure s replicated among the parallel nodes Second for each frequent item assigned to a parallel node a relatively small independent tree is built summarizing co-occurrences Finally a simple and non-recursive mining process reduces the memory requirements as minimum candidacy generation and counting is needed and no communication between nodes is required to generate all globally frequent patterns 1 Introduction 
Recent days have witnessed an explosive growth in generating data in all 036elds of science business medicine military etc The same rate of growth in the processing power of evaluating and analyzing the data did not follow this massive growth Due to this phenomenon a tremendous volume of data is still kept without being studied Data mining a research 036eld that tries to ease this problem proposes some 001 This research is partially supported by a Research Grant from NSERC Canada solutions for the extraction of signi\036cant and potentially 
useful patterns from these large collections of data One of the canonical tasks in data mining is the discovery of association rules Discovering association rules considered as one of the most important tasks has been the focus of many studies in the last few years Many solutions have been proposed using a sequential or parallel paradigm However the existing algorithms depend heavily on massive computation that might cause h dependency on the memory size or repeated I/O scans of the datasets The published parallel implementations of association rule mining inherited most 
of these problems in addition to the new costly communication cost most of them need Parallel association rule mining algorithms currently proposed in the literature are not suf\036cient for extremely large datasets and new solutions that do not heavily depend on repeated I/O scan less reliant on memory size and do not require a lot of communication costs between nodes still have to be found In this paper we are introducing a new parallel association rule mining disk-based algorithm that is based on the COFItrees concept discussed in detail in this paper This algo 
rithm is divided into two main phases The 036rst one considered pre-processing requires only two full I/O scans of the dataset and generates a special disk-based data structure called Inverted Matrix In the second phase the Inverted Matrix is replicated among nodes and mined in parallel using different support levels to generate association rules using the Inverted Matrix algorithm explained later in this paper The mining process might take in some cases less than one-full I/O scan of the data structure in which only frequent items based on the support given by the user are scanned and participate in generating the frequent patterns 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 illustrates the transactional layout and the motivations of the Inverted Matrix approach Section 3 describes the design and constructions of the parallel Co-Occurrence Frequent Item trees Section 4 concludes by discussing some issues and highlights our future work Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications \(DEXA\22203 1529-4188/03 $17.00 \251 2003 IEEE  


2 Transaction Layout Frequent itemset mining algor ithms mine the database on a given 036xed support threshold If the support threshold changes the mining process is repeated and the previous accumulated knowledge is not taken into account For instance in the simple transactional database of Figure 1A where each line represents a transaction called horizontal layout we can observe that when changing support one can avoid reading some entries If the support level is greater than 4 then Figure 1B highlights all frequent items that need to be scanned and computed Non-circled items in Figure 1B are not included in the generation of the frequent items and reading them becomes useless It is known that all of the existing algorithms scan the whole database frequent and non-frequent items more than once generating a huge amount of useless work 2 W e cal l t hi s s uper\037 uous processing Figure 1C represents what we actually need to read and compute from the transactional database based on a support greater than 4 Obviously this may not be possible with this horizontal layout but with a vertical layout avoiding these useless reads is possible The transaction layout is T T T T1 A G D C B T1 A G D C B T1 A D C B T2 BCH D T2 BCH ED T2 BC ED T3 BD EAM T3 BD EAM T3 BD EA T4 C E F A N T4 C E F A N T4 C E F A T5 A B N O P 5 A B N O P T5 A B T6 ACQRG T6 ACQRG T6 AC T7 A C H I G 7 A C H I G T7 A C T8 L B T8 L EFKB T8 EFB T9 A F M N O 9 A F M N O T9 A F T10 C F P J R T10 C F P J R T10 C F T11 A D B H I T11 A D B H I T11 A D B T12DEBKL T12DEBKL T12DEB T13MDCGO T13MDCGO T13DC T14 C F P Q J T14 C F P Q J T14 C F T15 B D E F I T15 B D E F I T15 B D E F T16 JEBAD T16 JEBAD T16 EBAD T17 AKEFC T17AKEFC T17 AEFC T18 C D L B A T18 C D L B A T18 C D B A Item s C Item s A Item s B  Figure 1 A Transactional database B Frequent items circled C Needed Items to be scanned 001 4  the method in which items in transactions are formatted in the database Currently there are two approaches the horizontal approach and the vertical approach In this section these approaches are discussed and a new transactional layout called Inverted Matrix is presented and compared with the existing two methods 2.1 Horizontal vs Vertical layout The format of storing transactions in the database plays an important role in determining the ef\036ciency of the association rule-mining algorithm used Existing algorithms use one of the two layouts namely horizontal and vertical The 036rst one which is the most commonly used relates all items on the same transaction together In this approach the ID of the transaction plays the role of the key for the transactional table Figure 1A represents a sample of 18 transactions made of 18 items The vertical layout relates all transactions that share the same items together In this approach the key f each record is the item Each record in this approach has an item with all transaction numbers in which this item occurs The horizontal layout has a very important advantage which is combining all items in one transaction together In this layout and by using some clever techniques such as the one used in 4 the candidac y generation step can be eliminated On the other hand this layout suffers from limitations such as the problem mentioned above that we called super\037uous processing since there is no index on the items The vertical layout however is an index on the items in itself and reduces the effect of large data sizes as there is no need to always re-scan the whole database On the other hand this vertical layout still needs the expensive candidacy generation phase Also computing the frequencies of itemsets becomes the tedious task of intersecting records of different items of the candidate patterns 2.2 Inverted Matrix Layout The Inverted Matrix layout combines the two previously mentioned layouts with the purpose of making use of the best of the two approaches and reducing their drawbacks as much as possible The idea of this approach is to associate each item with all transactions in which it occurs i.e an inverted index and to associate each transaction with all its items using pointers ilar to the vertical layout the item is the key of each record in this layout The difference between this layout and the vertical layout is that each attribute on the Inverted Matrix is not the transaction ID but a pointer that points to the location of the next item on the same transaction The transaction ID could be preserved in our layout but since it is not needed for e purpose of frequent itemset mining it is discarded The pointer is a pair where the 036rst element indicates the address of a line in the matrix and the second element indicates the address of a column Each line in the matrix has an address sequential number in our illustrative example and is pre\036xed by the Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications \(DEXA\22203 1529-4188/03 $17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

once to 036nd the frequency of each item and orders them into ascending order The second phase scans the database again once to sort each transaction into ascending order according to the frequency of each item and then 036lls in the matrix appropriately To illustrate the process let us consider the construction of the matrix in Figure 2 The 036rst transaction in Figure 1A has items A G D C B This transaction is sorted into G D C B A based on the item frequencies process Item G has the physical location line 12 in the Inverted Matrix in Figure 2 D has the location line 15 the location of C is line 16 B s in line 17 and 036nally A s in line 18 This is according to the vertical approach Item G has a link to the 036rst empty slot in the transactional array of item D that is 1 Consequently 15,1 entry is added in the 036rst slot of item G to point to the 036rst empty location in the transactional array of D At the First empty location of D 15,1 an entry is added to point to the 036rst empty location of the next item C that is 16,1 The same process occurs for all items in the transaction The last item of the transaction item A produces an entry with pointer null  002  002  The same is performed for every transaction 3 Parallel Co-Occurrence Frequent Itemtrees Design and Construction The generation of frequencies is considered a costly operation for association rule discovery In ri based algorithms this step might become a complex problem in cases of high dimensionality due to the sheer size of the candidacy generation In methods s u ch as F P Gro wth  4   the candidacy generation is replaced by a recursive routine that builds a very large number of sub-trees called conditional FP-trees that are on the same order of magnitude as number of the frequent patterns Our approach for computing frequencies relies 036rst on replicating the Inverted Matrix among all parallel nodes By doing so a full set of trans actional database would be available to each processor to generate all globally frequent patterns with minimum communication cost at parallel node level This replication is executed from a designated master node Second this approach relies on distributing frequent items among the parallel nodes Our strategy for evenly distributing the frequent items to the different processors such that the load is as balanced as possible is explained later Each parallel node is responsible for generating all frequent patterns related to the frequent items associated to that node To do so each node reads sub-transactions for frequent items directly from the Inverted Matrix then builds independent and relatively small trees for each frequent item in the transactional database Each parallel node mines separately each one of these trees as soon as they are built with minimizing the candidacy generation and without recursively building conditional sub-trees The trees are discarded as soon as mined Finally all globally frequent patterns generated at each parallel node are gathered into the master node to produce the full set of frequent patterns The small trees we build Co-Occurrence Frequent Itemtree or COFI-tree for short are similar to the conditional FP-Tree 3 in general in the s ens e that the y h a v e a header with ordered frequent items and horizontal pointers pointing to a succession of nodes containing the same frequent item a counter that computes the occurrences of this item in the tree and the pre\036x tree per-se with paths representing sub-transactions However the COFI-trees have bidirectional links in the tree allowing bottom-up scanning as well and the nodes contain not only the item label and a frequency counter but also a participation counter as explained later in this section Another difference is that a COFI-tree for a given frequent item x contains only nodes labeled with items that are more frequent or as frequent as x  In our example if we need to mine the Inverted Matrix in Figure 2 using a two-processors machine with 001 4 the starting line for each parallel node would be location 13 as it is the location of the 036rst frequent item Processor 1 036nds all frequent patterns related to items at locations 13 15 and 17 which are items F D and B Processor 2 would generate all frequent patterns related to items at locations 14 and 16 which are for items E and C The 036rst Co-Occurrence Frequent Item-tree is built for item F In this tree for F all frequent items which are more frequent than F and share transactions with F participate in building the tree The tree starts with the root

ing the item in question F For each sub-transaction containing item F with other frequent items that are more frequent than F a branch is formed starting from the root node F If multiple frequent items share the same pre\036x they are merged into one branch and a counter for each node of the tree is adjusted accordingl y Figure 3 illustrates COFI-trees for frequent items F and E In Figure 3 the rectangle nodes F\(70 E4 E 40 A 0 C\(20 D2 C4 B2 C\(20 B\(10 D\(10 A3 A\(20 B\(10 E\(80 D5 D\(50 0 B 10 C3 B6 A4 C\(10 B 0 A 20 B\(10 A\(20 A\ F-COFI-tree B\ - E-COFI-tree  Figure 3 F and E COFI-trees are nodes from the tree with an item label and two counters The 036rst counter is a support for that node while the second counter called participation-count  is initialized to 0 and is used by the mining algorithm discussed later The nodes have also pointers a horizontal link which points to the next node that has the same item-name in the tree and a bi-directional vertical link that links a hild node with its parent and a parent with its child The bi-directional pointers facilitate the mining process by making the traversal of the tree easier The squares in the 036gures are actually cells from the header table as with the FP-Tree This is a list made of all frequent items that participate in building the tree structure sorted in ascending order of their global support Each entry in this list ontains the item-name  itemcounter anda pointer to the 036rst node in the tree that has the same item-name To explain the COFI-tree building process we will highlight the building steps f or the F-COFI-tree in Figure 3 Frequent item F is assigned to processor 1 that reads from the Inverted Matrix in Figure 2 all sub-transactions that starts with item F The 036rst sub-transaction has items FECA and consequently 4 nodes are created as FECA 1 forms one branch with support  1 for each node in the branch The second sub-transaction has FEB Nodes for F and E already exist and only new node for B is created as a another child for E The support for all these nodes are incremented by 1 B becomes 1 E and F become 2 FA is read then and a new node for A is created with support   and e F support is incremented by 1 to become 3 FC is read twice and a new node for item C is created with support 2 and F support becomes 5 FEDB is read after that FE branch already exists and a new child branch for DB is created as a child for E with support  1 The support for E nodes becomes 3 F becomes 6 Finally the last sub-transaction FECA is read its branch already exist and only the counters for all nodes are incremented by 1 The participation count for each node is initialized to 0 The header in the F-COFI-tree like with FP-Trees constitutes a list of all frequent items to maintain the location of 036rst entry for each item in the COFI-Tree A link is also made for each node in the tree that points to the next location of the same item in the tree if it exists The COFI-tree for a frequent item x contains only nodes labeled with items that are more frequent or as frequent as x  and share at least one transaction with x  Based on this de\036nition if A has support greater than B then the B COFItree is most likely larger than the COFI-tree for item A as more items would participate in building the B COFI-tree In other words the higher the support of a frequent item the smaller its COFI-tree is We use this observation to improve the load balance between processors We need to distribute the creation and mining of these COFI-trees among the available processors in a away that the load is distributed normally and no processor has to build large trees while others build small ones Our strategy in distributing s oad s simple After ordering the frequent items by their support starting from the least frequent each processor successively receives one item The process is repeated until all items are distributed In other words if we have m processors and n COFI-trees need to be built assuming m<n then processor 1 builds the COFI-tree for the least frequent item processor 2 builds the COFI-tree for the next least frequent item,andsoonuptoprocessor m  After that processor 1 takes item m 1 and so on until all n items are distributed 3.1 Mining the COFI-trees The mining process is done for each tree independently with the purpose of 036nding all frequent k itemset patterns that the item on the root of the tree participates in Steps to produce frequent patterns related to the E item for example are illustrated in Figure 4 From each branch of the tree using the support count and the participation count candidate frequent patterns are identi\036ed and stored temporarily in a list The non-frequent ones are discarded at the end when all branches are processed Figure 4 shows the frequent itemsets containing E discovered assuming a support threshold greater than 4 Mining the 223COFI-tree of item E\224 starts by identifying all non-frequent items with respect to the E item Proceedings of the 14th International Workshop on Database and Expert Systems Applications \(DEXA\22203 1529-4188/03 $17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

CONCLUSIONS Real-time feature extraction is a core component for any intrusion detection system that claims to be truly real-time Signature detection can be done live but live anomaly detection requires a comprehensive picture of the network environment Our feature extraction module provides this functionality using feature sketches which map well onto reconÞgurable hardware We took advantage of pipelining and inherent parallelism in FPGAs to increase throughput Many network behavior parameters can be monitored using our architecture by making small modiÞcations to the design These characteristics include ow size number of open connections number of un-serviced connection requests etc The novelty of our design lies in modifying a single FS row into multiple FS rows to increase the accuracy up to 97.61 reduce the estimation error to an average of 0.0365 packets and achieve throughputs up to 21.25 Gbps for a 16K entry FEM 8 REFERENCES  J  W  L  S arang D harmapuri k

6. Conclusion In this paper a number of alternative rule ordering and case satisfaction strategies have been considered. Four established ordering strategies were examined. In addition the authors proposed a ?fth strategy, ACS, where more speci?c rules are given a higher precedence than less speci?c rules but using con?dence as the most signi?cant factor for tree pruning during the generation process The principal ?ndings of the evaluation are as follows 1 used in the experiments, \(2 mechanism works better than “best ” in all the data sets tested, \(3 that a relatively high con?dence threshold is used \(a threshold of % is suggested 4 olds \(% to a “best ?rst” case satisfaction produced good results References 1] Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. \(1994 for mining association rules.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
