Abstract In the past several algorithms were developed to mine fuzzy frequent itemsets FFIs in which each item is represented at most one linguistic term based on maximum scalar cardinality In real-life situations multiple fuzzy linguistic terms instead of the single one can however produce more useful and meaningful fuzzy association rules The Apriori-based algorithm was developed to mine multiple fuzzy frequent itemsets MFFIs which requires to generate the amounts of candidates and determine them in a level-wise way In this paper a fuzzy-listbased FL algorithm is developed to mine the complete set of MFFIs without candidate generation Two ef“cient pruning 
strategies are also developed to reduce the search space thus speeding up the mining process to directly discover the MFFIs Experiments are conducted to show the performance of the proposed approaches compared to the state-of-the-art level-wise algorithm in terms of execution time and memory usage I I NTRODUCTION It is an important issue to mine the implicit relationships and information from a very large database 3 5 9  Agra w a l e t al 2 rst presented the Apriori algorithm to mine ARs in a level-wise manner Since the Apriori algorithm requires time-consuming computations to nd the frequent itemsets FIs level-by-level and the numerous candidate item 
sets have to be generated Han et al designed the frequent pattern FP structure with a FP-growth mining algorithm to nd FIs without candidate generation Many algorithms have been extensively designed to mine FIs or ARs from the binary databases based on Apriori-like approach or FP-tree structure In real-life situations the quantitative databases can be used to provide more information for decision making than that of the traditional binary databases It is dif“cult to handle the quantitative databases based on the crisp sets Fuzzy-set theory w a s proposed and can be used to handle the quantitative databases In the past Hong et al stated the fuzzy data mining approach to discover fuzzy frequent 
itemsets FFIs in a level-wise manner It uses the maximum cardinality mechanism to generate-and-test the candidate itemsets level-by-level This process can greatly reduce the computations for discovering FFIs but some information may thus be lost Hong et al then designed gradual datareduction GDF approach for mining multiple fuzzy frequent itemsets MFFIs This approach is used to mine FFIs with multiple fuzzy regions based on Apriori-like mechanism the amounts of computations are still required to generate-andtest candidates in a level-wise manner In this paper a fuzzylist-based FL algorithm is presented to mine MFFIs Two ef“cient pruning strategies are respectively designed to reduce the search space of the enumeration tree based on the 
fuzzy-list structure In the conducted experiments it can be found that the proposed approaches outperform the state-ofthe-art Apriori-based algorithm in terms of execution time and memory usage II R ELATED W ORK It is an ef“cient way to adopt fuzzy-set theory for mining fuzzy association rules from the quantitative databases since the discovered information can be represented in linguistic terms using natural language which is more understandable for human beings In the past Chan et al proposed the F-APACS algorithm to discover the fuzzy association rules FARs by transforming the quantitative values of attributes 
into linguistic representations Kuok et al then designed an ef“cient method to discover the FARs from the numerical databases Hong et al de v eloped the FDT A algorithm to mine FARs from the quantitative databases Lin et al then respectively designed the fuzzy frequent pattern FFP algorithm the compressed fuzzy frequent pattern CFFP tree algorithm and upper bound fuzzy frequent pattern UBFFP algorithm for deri ving FFIs 2113 978-1-5090-0626-7/16/$31.00 c  2016 IEEE 


The above approaches adopt the maximal cardinality mechanism to keep at most one linguistic term of each item which is insuf“cient to present the complete information from the transformed databases To reveal more complete information Hong et al then presented an ef“cient algorithm called GDF to merge the same fuzzy sets of the transformed transactions into smaller transformed databases thus speeding up the computations for level-wisely mining the FARs This approach is used to generate the MFFIs thus revealing more complete information than traditional ones The multiple database scan is however required to level-wisely mine the MFFIs III P RELIMINARIES AND P ROBLEM S TATEMENT In this section the preliminaries and the problem statement of multiple fuzzy frequent itemset mining MFFIM are respectively described as follows A Preliminaries Let I   i 1  i 2    i m  be a nite set of m distinct items attributes in a quantitative database D   T 1  T 2    T n   in which each transaction T q  D is a subset of I  contains several items with its purchase quantities v iq and has an unique identi“er called TID  An itemset X is a set of k distinct items  i 1  i 2    i k   where k is the length of an itemset called k itemset An itemset X is said to be contained in a transaction T q if X  T q  A minimum support threshold is de“ned as   The user-speci“ed membership functions is set as  A quantitative database is shown in Table I as a running example to illustrate the proposed approach in this paper It consists of 8 transactions and 5 distinct items which are respectively denoted as  A o E  The minimum support threshold is initially set as   25 The membership functions used in this example are shown in Fig 1 Note that all items in the given example used the same membership functions to fuzzi“er their quantitative values TABLE I A quantitative database  TID Items 1  C 3  D 2  E 1 2  B 1  C 2  D 1 3  B 3  C 3  E 1 4  A 3  C 5  D 3 5  A 1  B 1  C 2  D 1 6  B 1  D 1  E 2 7  A 4  B 3  D 5  E 3 8  B 1  C 2  D 1 De“nition 1 The linguistic variable R i is an attribute of a quantitative database whose value is the set of fuzzy linguistic terms represented in natural language as  R i 1  R i 2    R ih  and can be de“ned in the membership functions   For example there are ve attributes as  A   B   C   D  and  E  in Table I and the number of linguistic terms is set as 3 which can be are represented as Low  L   M iddle  M   and High  H   shown in Fig 1       Fig 1 The used membership functions of fuzzy linguistic 3-terms De“nition 2 The quantitative value of i denoted as v iq  is the quantitative of the item i in transaction T q  For example the quantitative values of the items  C   D  and  E n T 1 respectively are v C 1  3 v D 1  2 and v E 1  1 De“nition 3 The fuzzy set denoted as f iq  is the set of fuzzy linguistic terms with their membership degrees fuzzy values transformed from the quantitative value v iq of the linguistic variable i by the membership functions  as f iq   i  v iq   fv iq 1  R i 1  fv iq 2 R i 2    fv iqh R ih   1 where h is the number of fuzzy linguistic terms of i transformed by   R il is the l th fuzzy linguistic terms of i  fv iql is the membership degree fuzzy value of v iq of i in the l th fuzzy linguistic terms R il and fv iql  0  1  For example the item  C  with its quantitative value 3 in T 1 is transformed by the membership functions in Fig 1 as  0  67 C.M  0  5 C.H  Thus the Table I is then transformed by the membership functions shown in Fig 1 and the transformed results are shown in Table II TABLE II Transformed results from Table I TID Transformed linguistic terms 1 0  67 C.M  0  5 C.H  0  5 D.L  0  67 D.M  1  0 E.L 2 1  0 B.L  0  5 C.L  0  67 C.M  1  0 D.L 3 0  67 B.M  0  5 B.H  0  67 C.M  0  5 C.H  1  0 E.L 4 0  67 A.M  0  5 A.H  1  0 C.H  0  67 D.M  0  5 D.H 5 1  0 A.L  1  0 B.L  0  5 C.L  0  67 C.M  1  0 D.L 6 1  0 B.L  1  0 D.L  0  5 E.L  0  67 E.M 7 1  0 A.H  0  67 B.M  0  5 B.H  1  0 D.H  0  67 E.M  0  5 E.H 8 1  0 B.L  0  5 C.L  0  67 C.M  1  0 D.L De“nition 4 The transformed fuzzy linguistic term R il is represented and denoted as the fuzzy itemset in the eld of fuzzy data mining For example the fuzzy linguistic term  A.L  can be represented as a fuzzy itemset of the transformed databases 2114 2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 


De“nition 5 The support of the fuzzy itemset denoted sup  R il   is the sum of its transformed fuzzy values which can be de“ned as sup  R il   R il  T q  T q  D  fv iql  2 where D  is the quantitative database D transformed by membership functions    and the size of D  is the same as the original D  For example in Table II the fuzzy itemset  C.M  appears in transactions T 1  T 2  T 3  T 5 and T 8  the support of  C.M  can be calculated as sup  C.M   0.67  0.67  0.67  0.67  0.67  3.35 De“nition 6 The support of fuzzy k itemset  k  2  denoted as sup  X   is the sum of the minimal fuzzy value among k items of X  which can be de“ned as sup  X   X  R il   X  T q  T q  D  min  fv aql fv bql   a b  X a   b   3 For example in Table II the fuzzy 2-itemset  B.L C.M  appears in transactions T 2  T 5  and T 8  The support of  B.L C.M  is thus calculated as sup  A.L C.H    min 1  0  0  67  min 1  0  0  67  min 1  0  0  67   0.67  0.67  0.67  2.0 B Problem Statement The problem of MFFIM in this paper is to discover the complete set of MFFIs in which the support count of each fuzzy itemset X is no less than the pre-de“ned minimum support count as MFFIs  X  sup  X     D   4 where  is the minimum support threshold and  D  is the database size IV P ROPOSED FL-M INER A LGORITHM In the past most algorithms handle the fuzzy frequent itemset mining using the maximum scalar cardinality mechanism to derive the FFIs 12 13 15 In this paper  a n e f cient fuzzy-list structure is presented to compress the databases and keep the necessary information for later mining process Two ef“cient pruning strategies are also developed to prune the search space for discovering the MFFIs For the quantitative database the pre-de“ned membership functions are rst used to convert the quantitative value of each linguistic variable item into several fuzzy linguistic terms fuzzy itemsets with their membership degrees fuzzy values The fuzzy values of the same fuzzy itemset are then summed up together as the support value of it In this phase if the fuzzy itemset with its support count is no less than the minimum support count it is concerned as the fuzzy frequent itemset and kept in the transformed databases This process is then performed for all fuzzy linguistic terms to nd the set of the complete multiple fuzzy frequent 1-itemsets in the databases and concerned them as the multiple fuzzy frequent 1-itemsets  L 1  After that the fuzzi“ed quantitative database is then revised to keep the discovered fuzzy itemsets in L 1  The remaining itemsets in L 1 are then sorted in support-ascending order of each transaction After that the set of complete fuzzy frequent 1-itemsets and the revised database is then outputted Line 11 The revised database from Table II is shown in Table III TABLE III A revised database  TID Items 1 0  5 C.H  1  0 E.L  0  67 C.M  0  5 D.L 2 0  67 C.M  1  0 B.L  1  0 D.L 3 0  5 C.H  1  0 E.L  0  67 C.M 4 1  0 C.H 5 0  67 C.M  1  0 B.L  1  0 D.L 6 0  5 E.L  1  0 B.L  1  0 D.L 7 0  67 C.M  1  0 B.L  1  0 D.L A Fuzzy-list Construction After the original database is transformed and revised the remaining fuzzy itemsets in L 1 are used to build their own fuzzy-list structure for keeping the necessary information The de“nitions used in the fuzzy-list structure are given below De“nition 7 A fuzzy itemset R il in transaction T q  and R il  T q  The set of fuzzy itemsets after R il in T q is denoted as T q R il  For example in Table III T 1   C.H    E.L C.M D.L  and T 1   E.L    C.M D.L   De“nition 8 The fuzzy value of R il in transaction T q is de“ned as the internal fuzzy value and denoted as if  R il T q  For example the internal fuzzy value of  C.H  in T 1 is if  C.H T 1   0.5 De“nition 9 The resting fuzzy value except R il in transaction T q is denoted as rf  R il T q   This value is calculated by performing the maximum operation to get the maximum fuzzy value among the resting fuzzy itemsets in the transaction which can be considered as the upper-bound value of T q R il in T q and de“ned as rf  R il T q  max  if  z T q   z   T q R il    5 For example in Table III the resting fuzzy value in T 1 after  C.H  is calculated as max  1.0 0.67 0.5   1.0 and the resting fuzzy value in T 3 after  C.H  is calculated as max  1  0  0  67   1.0 Thus in the designed fuzzy-list structure it consists of three elements as 1 transaction TID  tid  indicates a transaction T q containing R il  2 internal fuzzy value  if  shows the fuzzy value of R il in T q  3 resting fuzzy value  rf  states the maximum fuzzy value of the resting fuzzy itemsets after R il in T q  From the given example shown in Table III the initial fuzzy-list structures of the fuzzy frequent 1-itemsets in L 1 are 2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2115 


respectively constructed Since the support-ascending order of the itemsets in L 1 are sorted as  C.H  E.L  C.M  B.L  D.L   the results of the constructed fuzzy-list structure for all fuzzy frequent 1-itemsets in L 1 are shown in Fig 2 tid rf  C.H    if C.M      B.L     D.L  E.L    Fig 2 The initial constructed fuzzy-list structures For example in Fig 2 the element 1 0.5 0.67 in the fuzzy-list of  C.H  showed 1 represents the transaction T 1  0.5 represents the internal fuzzy value is 0.5 0.67 represents the resting fuzzy value after  C.H  is 0.67 The rest fuzzy 1-itemsets are processed in the same way For the fuzzy-list structures of fuzzy k itemsets  k  2  it is unnecessary to scan the revised database but only perform the intersection operation of the fuzzy-list by the tids in k fuzzy-list structures The fuzzy-list structures are performed in 2-way comparisons to quickly nd the combined fuzzy-list structures Suppose the lengths of two fuzzy-list structures are respectively m and n  Thus it requires at most  m  n  comparisons to form the fuzzy-list structures of fuzzy 2-itemsets The construction algorithm of fuzzy-list structure is shown in Algorithm 1 Algorithm 1 Fuzzy-list Construction Input P x F L  the fuzzy-list of P x  P y F L  the fuzzy-list of P y  P xy F L the fuzzy-list of x and y  1 if P x and P y belong to the same item then 2 return null  3 P xy F L  null  4 for each E x  P x F L do 5 if  E y  P y F L and E x tid  E y tid then 6 E xy tid  E x tid  7 E xy if  min  E x if E y if   8 E xy rf  E y rf  9 E xy  E xy tid E xy if E xy rf   10 append E xy to P xy F L  11 return P xy F L  First the fuzzy k itemsets can be combined together to form the fuzzy  k 1 iff the combined itemsets are not from the same item since it produces meaningless information Lines 1 to 2 The fuzzy itemsets with the same tids are found to generate the fuzzy k itemsets Line 6 The minimum intersection operation is used to nd the internal fuzzy value of fuzzy k itemsets Line 7 Since the support-ascending order is used for constructing the initial fuzzy-list structures the resting fuzzy values of later fuzzy itemsets are directly assigned to the element of fuzzy k itemsets Line 8 The combined results of fuzzy  k 1 Lines 9 to 10 are thus constructed De“nition 10 The SUM.R il rf is to sum the fuzzy values of R il in D   which can be de“ned as SUM.R il if   R il  T q  T q  D  if  R il T q   6 For example in Fig 2 the summation of the fuzzy value for  C.H  is calculated as 0.5  0.5  1.0  2.0 De“nition 11 The SUM.R il rf is to sum the resting fuzzy values after R il in D   which can be de“ned as SUM.R il rf   R il  T q  T q  D  rf  R il T q   7 For example in Fig 2 the summation of the resting fuzzy values for  C.H  is calculated as 0.67  0.67  0  1.34 B Search Space of Enumeration Tree Based on the designed fuzzy-list structure the search space of the proposed FL-Miner algorithm can be represented as an enumeration tree according to the developed supportascending order strategy First the root node is built The fuzzy frequent 1-itemsets are then respectively created as the child nodes of the root node The fuzzy frequent 1-itemsets are rst built as the child nodes of the root The depth-“rst search strategy is used to traverse the enumeration tree and decide whether the child superset nodes are required to be generated and explored In this example the search space of the enumeration tree is shown in Fig 3  C.H <E.L C.M < B.L < D.L     root C.H          E.L         C.M        B.L        D.L C.H, B.L  C.H, E.L  C.H, D.L E.L, C.M  E.L, B.L C.H, B.L, E.L  C.H, B.L, D.L  Fig 3 An enumeration tree of the used example Since the complete search space of the enumeration tree is very huge for discovering all MFFIs it is necessary to reduce the search space but still can completely nd the MFFIs The designed pruning strategy is given below 2116 2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 


Strategy 1 Pruning by internal value  For an itemset X if SUM.X.if is less than the minimum support count it is not considered as a fuzzy frequent itemset and the supersets of X are unnecessary generated and explored in the enumeration tree Theorem 1 Given the fuzzy-list of a fuzzy itemset R il Ifthe summed up fuzzy values of R il is less than minimum support count    D    any extensions of R il are not the MFFIs and can be discarded in the search space Proof For  T q  X   suppose a fuzzy itemset R il is denoted as X  and X  is the extension of X  thus  X   X   X  X    X 012 X   T q   X  X    T q X    if  X  T q  min  if  X T q  if  X   X  T q    min  if  X T q  if  X  X  T q    X 012 X   X  tids  X.tids  SUM.X  if   X   T q  T q  D  if  X  T q    X   T q  T q  D  if  X  X T q   min  if  X T q  if  X  X  T q    SUM.X.if  Strategy 2 Pruning by resting value  For a fuzzy itemset X  if SUM.X.rf of X is less than the minimum support count the supersets of X are unnecessary generated and explored in the enumeration tree Theorem 2 Given the fuzzy-list of R il  If the summed up resting fuzzy values of R il is less than minimum support count    D    any extensions of R il are not the MFFIs and can be discarded in the search space Proof For  T q  X   suppose R il is denoted as X  and X is the extension of X  thus  X   X   X  X    X 012 X   T q   X  X    T q X    if  X  T q  min  if  X T q  if  X   X  T q    min  if  X T q  if  X  X  T q    min  if  X T q  rf  R il T q    X 012 X   X  tids  X.tids  SUM.X  rf   X   T q  T q  D  if  X  T q    X   T q  T q  D  if  X  X T q    X   T q  T q  D  rf  X  X T q   SUM.X.rf Thus if the sum of the internal fuzzy values or resting fuzzy values of the fuzzy itemset X is less than the minimum support count any extensions of X will not be the MFFIs and can be directly ignored to avoid the construction phase for its fuzzylist structure and the search space can thus be reduced and pruned in the enumeration tree For example consider the fuzzy 3-itemset  C.M  B.L  D.L  is the extension of the fuzzy 2-itemset  C.M B.L   Since the summed up internal fuzzy values and resting fuzzy values of  C.M B.L  are respectively calculated as 0.67  0.67  0.67  2.0  2.0 and 1.0  1.0  1.0  3.0  2.0 the extension  C.M B.L D.L  in the enumeration tree is generated and explored For the fuzzy 3-itemset  E.L C.M B.L  which is the extension of the fuzzy 2-itemset  E.L C.M   the summed up internal fuzzy values and the resting fuzzy values of  E.L C.M  are respectively calculated as 0.67  0.67  1.34  2.0 and 0.5  0  0.5  2.0 the fuzzy-list structure for the extension  E.L C.M B.L  is unnecessary constructed since this fuzzy 3-itemset cannot be considered as a fuzzy frequent itemset based on the two pruning strategies Details of the proposed fuzzy-list-based FL algorithm is described in Algorithm 2 Algorithm 2 FL-Miner Input FLs  fuzzy-list of 1-itemsets   Output MFFIs  the set of MFFIs 1 for each fuzzy-list X in FLs do 2 if SUM.X.if    D   then 3 MFFIs  X 015 MFFIs  4 if SUM.X.rf    D   and SUM.X.if    D   then 5 exF Ls  null  6 for each fuzzy-list Y after X in FLs do 7 exF L  exF Ls  Construct  X Y   8 FL-Miner  exF Ls    9 return MFFIs  The FL-Miner algorithm rst checks the sum of internal fuzzy values of the determined itemset X against to the minimum support count Line 2 If the sum of internal fuzzy value for X is no less than the minimum support count it is then put into the set of MFFIs Line 3 The sum of the resting fuzzy values is also checked against to the minimum support count Line 4 If the sum of fuzzy value and resting fuzzy value are both no less than the minimum support count the extension fuzzy-list structure of X is constructed in the enumeration for later mining process Lines 5 to 8 This process is repeated until no extensions are generated After that the complete set of the nal MFFIs are discovered Line 9 V E XPERIMENTAL E VALUATION In this section the FL-Miner algorithm adopts the pruning interval value strategy is named as FL-Miner1 and the FL-Miner algorithm adopts both pruning interval value and pruning resting value strategies is named as FL-Miner2 in the experiments The state-of-the-art GDF algorithm is used to compare with the designed approaches in terms of runtime and memory usage The compared algorithms in the experiments were implemented in Java performing a PC with 2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2117

mining process The GDF algorithm still suffers the generateand-test approach to mine the MFFIs in a level-wise way When the dataset is a very dense one the designed fuzzylist structure becomes larger more memory usage is required to keep more MFFIs which can be observed in Fig 5\(a Overall the memory usage of the designed approaches have better performance than that of the GDF algorithm in most cases VI C ONCLUSION In the past a level-wise GDF algorithm was presented to mine the MFFIs which takes more computations to generateand-test candidates at each level In this paper an ef“cient fuzzy-list structure is presented to keep the necessary information for mining MFFIs Two pruning strategies are also designed to reduce the search space thus speeding up computations and reducing memory usage to mine MFFIs From the conducted results it can be observed that the proposed approaches outperform the state-of-the-art GDF algorithm in terms of runtime and memory usage in both real-world and synthetic datasets A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China NSFC under grant No.61503092 by Ministry of Science and Technology Taiwan R.O.C under grant no MOST 104-2632-S-424-001 and MOST 104-2221-E-230-019 R EFERENCES  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A Sw ami Database mining A per formance perspective IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 5\(6 pp 914-925 1993  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases The International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  pp 487-499 1994  R Agra w a l and R Srikant Mining sequential patterns The International Conference on Data Engineering  pp 3-14 1995  K C C Chan and W  H Au Mining fuzzy association rules International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management  pp 209-215 1997  M S Chen J Han and P  S Y u  Data mining An o v ervie w from a database perspective IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 8\(6 pp 866-883 1996  SPMF An Open-Source Data Mining Library  http://www  philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf  J Han J Pei Y  Y in and R Mao Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation A frequent-pattern tree approach Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery  Vol 8\(1 pp 53-87 2004  T  P  Hong C S K uo and S C Chi Mining association rules from quantitative data Intelligent Data Analysis  Vol 3\(5 pp 363-376 1999  T  P  Hong C W  Lin and Y  L W u  Incrementally f ast updated frequent pattern trees Expert Systems with Applications  Vol 34\(4 pp 24242435 2008  T  P  Hong G C Lan Y  H Lin and S T  P an An ef fecti v e gradual data-reduction strategy for fuzzy itemset mining International Journal of Fuzzy Systems  Vol 15\(2 pp 170-181 2013  C M K uok A Fu and M H W ong Mining fuzzy association rules in databases ACM SIGMOD Record  Vol 27\(1 pp 41-46 1998  C W  Lin T  P  Hong and W  H Lu Linguistic data mining with fuzzy fp-trees Expert Systems with Applications  Vol 37\(6 pp 4560-4567 2010  C W  Lin T  P  Hong and T  C Lin An ef cient tree-based fuzzy data mining approach International Journal of Fuzzy Systems  Vol 12\(2 pp 150-157 2010  C W  Lin T  P  Hong and W  H Lu An ef fecti v e tree structure for mining high utility itemsets Expert Systems with Applications  Vol 38\(6 pp 7419-7424 2011  C W  Lin T  P  Hong and W  H Lu Mining fuzzy frequent itemsets based on UBFFP trees Journal of Intelligent  Fuzzy Systems  Vol 27\(1 pp 535-548 2014  L A Zadeh Fuzzy sets Information and Control  8 pp 338-353 1965 2016 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2119

The architecture enables discovery or interesting patterns with data from different domains related to Telecom Network Monitoring. The architecture is composed of five sub-modules: Data Analyzer, Mining Controller, Data Miner, Combiner, and Episode Analyzer. Each sub-module is described in detail along with implementation approach  functions in turn. The approach leverages and combines frequent itemset discovery over data streams, association rule learning, frequent sequential pattern mining, and frequent temporal pattern mining techniques while also making use of distributed processing platforms to achieve high-volume throughput. To test the functionality of the model, three classic pattern mining algorithms, namely, NewMoment PrefixSpan, and HTPM, are implemented Their performances are compared in terms of different parameter settings by executing the algorithms with a simulated streaming dataset Fig.10

be trusted to hold the raw data The master generates association rule candidates from the joint database containing ctitious data For each rule candidate X  Y  the master sends the ID lists of the transactions containing X  Y and the transactions containing X to the third-party server The server veriÞes if the rule is qualiÞed or not Similar to our solutions a semi-trusted third-party is utilized for the mining However unlike our solutions a data owner i.e the master does the majority of the computational work Therefore we can hardly say that such a solution is an outsourced mining solution Though ctitious data are added in datasets to lower data usability the master is able to learn signiÞcant information about other data owners raw data from the received datasets In cont rast our solutions do not leak such information as we do not rely on one particular data owner to undertake the computations and we also encrypt the datasets All existing solutions with the exception of  d

mining The rst solution exposes exact supports which is not desirable The second solution does not expose exact supports However association rules cannot be mined based on the result of second solution because conÞdences cannot be computed without the exact supports In addition this solutionÕs method cannot be used to mine association rules because securely computing conÞdence is more complicated than computing support In comparison with this solution our frequent itemset mining solutionÕs computational complexity is signiÞcantly lower Our solutions do not expose exact supports or conÞdences to data owners Different from existing solutions based on homomorphic encryption we use symmetric homomorphic encryption instead of asymmetric homomorphic encryption and the manner in which we use homomorphic encryption also differs from existing solutions In our approach we use homomorphic encryption to create ERVs and build our secure outsourced comparison scheme B Privacy-Preserving

this paper our adversary model is different We assume the cloud has knowledge of the item frequencies instead of chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs and our solutions are resilient to frequency analysis

solution for vertically partitioned databases This allows the data owners to outsource mining task on their joint data in a privacy-preserving manner privacypreserving manner Based on this solution we built a privacypreserving outsourced association rule partitioned databases Our solutions protect data ownerÕs raw data from other data owners and the cloud Our solutions also ensure the privacy of the mining results from the cloud Compared with most existing solutions our solutions leak less information about the data owners raw data Our evaluation has also demonstrated that our solutions are very efÞci ent therefore our solutions are suitable to be used by data owners wishing to outsource their databases to the cloud but require a high level of privacy without compromising on performance To realize our solutions an efÞcient homomorphic encryption scheme and a secure outsourced comparison scheme were presented in this paper Both schemes have potential usage in other secure computation applications such as secure data aggregation beyond the data mining solutions described in this paper Demonstrating the u tility of the p roposed homomorphic encryption scheme and outsourced comparison scheme in other settings will be the focus of future research A PPENDIX I NSERTING F ICTITIOUS T RANSACTIONS  s A LGORITHM  An algorithm to counter frequency analysis attacks on the outsourced database encrypted with a substitution cipher was proposed in F or the purpos e o f c oncealing t he item frequency this algorithm inserts ctitious transactions in the database to be oursourced The goal is to ensure that each item share the same frequency with at least k  1 items The algorithm is summarized as follows also see  Firstly the data owner scans the database to count each individual itemÕs support  Secondly the data owner groups items considering the supports and co-occurrence of items The data owner sorts items in decreasing order of support Starting from the rst of the sorted item list i.e the item with the highest support the data owner assigns every k adjacent items to a new created group If there are less than k unassigned items remaining these items will be assigned to the last created group The data owner swaps items from different groups to ensure that all items in the same group do not occur together in the same transaction  Thirdly for each item in each group the data owner calculates the difference between the itemÕs support and the highest support in the group The difference is deÞned as the noise of the item  Fourthly to achieve k anonymity frequency the data owner generates ctitious transactions based on the result of the third step The number of an itemÕs occurrences in the ctitious transactions is equal to its noise calculated in the third step After inserting the ctitious transactions all items in the same group share the same support A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Quach Vinh Thanh the Associate
