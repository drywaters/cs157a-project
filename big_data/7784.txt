Parallel Mining of Maximal Frequent Itemsets from Databases Soon M Chung  and Congnan Luo Dept of Computer Science and Engineering Wright State University Dayton Ohio 45435 USA Abstract In this paper we propose a parallel algorithm for mining maximal frequent itemsets from databases A frequent itemset is maximal if none of its supersets is frequent The new parallel algorithm is named Parallel Max-Miner PMM and it is a parallel version of the sequential Max-Miner algorithm 3 Most of existing mining algorithms discover the frequent k itemsets on the k th pass over the databases and then generate the candidate  
k  1 for the next pass Compared to those level-wise algorithms PMM looks ahead at each pass and prunes more candidate itemsets by checking the frequences of their supersets We implemented PMM on a cluster of workstations and evaluated its performance for various cases PMM demonstrated better performance than other sequential and parallel algorithms and its performance is quite scalable even when there are large maximal frequent itemsets i.e long patterns in databases Key words Parallel data mining maximal frequent itemsets association rules scalability 1 Introduction Let I   i 1 i 2 i 
m  be a set of items Let D be a set of transactions where each transaction T contains a set of items An association rule is an implication of the form X  Y where X I  Y I and X  Y    The association rule X  Y holds in the database D with condence c if c  of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y  The association rule X  Y has support s if s  of transactions in D contain 
X  Y  Mining association rules is to nd all association rules that have support and condence greater than or equal to the user-specied minimum support called minsup  and minimum condence called minconf  respectively  T he rst step in the d isco v e ry of association rules is to nd each set of items called itemset hathaveco-occurrencerateabovethemini This research was supported in part by Ohio Board of Regents LexisNexis NCR and Wright Brothers Institute WBI mum support An itemset with at least the minimum support is called a 
frequent itemset  The size of an itemset represents the number of items contained in the itemset and an itemset containing k items will be called a k itemset The second step of forming the association rules from the frequent itemsets is straightforward as described in 1 F o r e v e r y fr equen t itemset f  nd all non-empty subsets of f  For every such subset a  generate a rule of the form a   f  a fthe ratio of support f  to support a satleast minconf  In mining association rules the most timeconsuming job is nding all frequent itemsets from a 
large database with respect to a given minimum support Many sequential and parallel algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem The most common sequential algorithms are Apriori 1 an d i t s v ari ations Apriori-like algorithms employ a strict bottomup breadth-rst search and enumerate every frequent itemset 3  T hey r equir e m ultiple pa sses o v e r t he database In the rst pass the occurrences of individual items are counted and frequent 1-itemsets are determined Then the frequent 1-items are used to generate the potentially frequent 2-itemsets called candidate 2-itemsets In the second pass we count the occurrences of the candidate 2-itemsets so that we can determine the frequent 2-itemsets Frequent 2 
itemsets are used to generate the candidate 3-itemsets andsoon Thisprocessisrepeateduntilthereisno new candidate itemset generated In Apriori if F k  1 denotes the set of frequent  k  1 discovered in the  k  1 pass over the database then the set of candidate k itemsets for the next pass denoted by C k  is obtained by the natural join of F k  1 and F k  1 on the rst k  2 items For example if F 2 includes  1 2 
 and  1 3  then  1 2 3  is a candidate 3-itemset However a candidate k itemset is pruned if any of its  k  1\-subsets is not frequent Thus for  1 2 3  to remain as a candidate 3-itemset  2 3  also should be a frequent 2-itemset This subset-infrequency based pruning step prevents many candidate k itemsets from being counted in each Proceedings of the 15th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI03 1082-3409/03 $17.00  2003 IEEE 


pass k  Due to the large size of the database to be mined parallel data mining is a very promising direction and a few parallel algorithms were proposed for mining association rules The most well-known one is Count Distribution CD algorithm 2 whic h i s a pa r a llel version of the Apriori algorithm The database is partitioned and distributed over multiple processing nodes initially At each pass k  every node collects local counts of the same set of candidate k itemsets Then these counts are merged between processing nodes so that each node can identify the frequent k itemsets and generate the candidate  k  1 for the next pass as in Apriori To merge the local support counts of the candidate itemsets synchronization between nodes is required at every pass and maintaining the same set of candidate itemsets in all the nodes is redundant In Apriori-like algorithms if there is a frequent itemset with length l  then they will generate and count its 2 l subsets This exponential complexity makes Apriori-like algorithms just suit for mining small frequent itemsets i.e short patterns 3 T o address this problem algorithms that can eciently mine the maximal frequent itemsets MFI were proposed The basic idea is that if we nd a large frequent itemset i.e long pattern early we can avoid counting all its subsets because they are all frequent So these algorithms always look ahead and try to nd large frequent itemsets early Once we nd all the maximal frequent itemsets all frequent itemsets can be obtained from them In this paper we propose a new parallel algorithm named Parallel Max-Miner PMM for mining maximal frequent itemsets PMM is a parallel version of the sequential Max-Miner algorithm 3 Ho w e v e r  it requires multiple passes over the database like the Count Distribution algorithm In each pass all the nodes have the same set of candidate groups to be counted and after each pass the count information is exchanged between nodes so that every node holds the same global count information and then generates the same candidate groups for the next pass PMM uses this bottom-up search but it looks ahead at each pass and prunes more candidate itemsets by checking the frequences of their supersets Moreover PMM does not require the transfer of transactions between nodes 2 Max-Miner Algorithm Unlike Apriori-like algorithms the Max-Miner algorithm 3 e xtr a cts o nly t he ma xima l fr equen t itemsets from which all the frequent itemsets can be obtained Max-Miner always attempts to look ahead in order to identify large frequent itemsets early so that all subsets of these discovered frequent itemsets can be pruned from the search space This method is called superset-frequency based pruning  Max-miner used the set-enumeration tree to represent the search space How to construct the set enumeration tree is illustrated in Figure 1 for four items 1 2 3 and 4 The set-enumeration tree lists all combinations of the four items from level 0 to level 4  Level   0 Level   1 Level   2 Level   3 Level   4   012  015   1 2   012  015  4 3 3,4 1,2 012\015  1,4 1,3 2,3 2,4 2,3,4 1,3,4 1,2,3 1,2,4 1,2,3,4 015\012  012    012  015  Figure 1 Search space of Max-Miner Each node in the tree is called a candidate group and a candidate group g consists of two components which are actually two itemsets The rst itemset is called the head of the group and denoted by h  g  The second itemset is called the tail of the group and denoted by t  g  t  g  is an ordered set and contains all the items not in h  g  but can potentially appear in any subnode derived from node g  For example the node i.e candidate group g 1 enumerating item 1 which is the leftmost node at level 1 has two components h  g 1   1  and t  g 1   2  3  4   The main procedure of Max-Miner can be explained as follows From the root of the tree at level 0 we count the support of 1-itemsets Only the 1-itemsets which are frequent can be enumerated at level 1 In this example 4 nodes are generated at level 1 if 1 2 3 and 4 are all frequent 1-itemsets For the node g 1  which corresponds to item 1 at level 1 we need to count the support of  h  g 1   t  g 1     1  2  3  4  If the support of  h  g 1   t  g 1   is equal to or greater than minsup  then we do not need to expand the tree from the node g 1 anymore Similarly for the node g 2  which corresponds to item 2 at level 1 the support of  h  g 2   t  g 2     2  3  4  is counted If  h  g 2   t  g 2   is frequent then the subnodes of node g 2 are not generated at level 2 At any node g if  h  g   t  g   is not frequent for each item i in t  g  we check if  h  g   i  is frequent Proceedings of the 15th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI03 1082-3409/03 $17.00  2003 IEEE 


If  h  g   i  is frequent a corresponding subnode is generated The head of the subnode is  h  g   i  and its tail contains all the item j  such that  h  g   j  is frequent and j comes after i in t  g  For example if  1  2    1  3  and  1  4  are frequent when  1  2  3  4  is not frequent then we generate three subnodes of node g 1  They are enumerated at level 2 as  h  g    1  2   t  g    3  4    h  g    1  3   t  g    4   a n d  h  g    1  4   t  g     This pro cess c on tin u es level by level until the whole tree is completed Here we can notice that for a candidate group node g ifanitemappearslastinthetailof g in ordering it will appear in most osprings of the node g 3 For example item 4 is the last item in the tail of the root node in Figure 1 and appears in either the head or tail of every node at level 1 and below On the other hand item 2 appears in a much smaller number of nodes Thus to discover the long patterns maximal frequent itemsets early we better order the subnodes of each node in ascending order of their support At level 1 of the set-enumeration tree Max-Miner orders the frequent 1-itemsets in ascending order of their support And at lower levels it orders the tail items of each node g in ascending order of support  h  g   i   for i  t  g  In the above example if support  1  4    support  1  2    support  1  3  whenwegenerate the subnodes of node g 1  then the items are reordered in its tail t  g 1 s  4  2  3   and the corresponding subnodes are generated in that order as  h  g    1  4  t  g    2  3    h  g    1  2  t  g    3   a n d  h  g    1  3  t  g     This heur istic reordering strategy increases the eectiveness of the superset-frequency based pruning In t h ey also prop osed ho w t o e st imat e a lo w e rbound of the support of each itemset using the support of some of its subsets By discovering the maximal frequent itemsets early Max-Miner can reduce the number of passes over the database As a result it can reduce the total execution time considerably compared to other level-wise algorithms 3 Parallel Max-Miner PMM Algorithm We present the PMM algorithm in this section It is implemented on a shared-nothing multiprocessor system where each node has private memory and a private disk All nodes communicate with each other by passing messages through a communication network The database is evenly divided into N partitions  D 0 D 1 D 2 D N  1   one for each of the N nodes  P 0 P 1 P 2 P N  1  involved in the parallel mining i.e each node has the same number of transactions allocated PMM requires multiple passes over the database For each pass k  all the nodes have exactly the same set of candidate groups which is denoted by C k and each node counts the occurrencies of the candidate groups in the local database independently At the end of each pass all nodes exchange the count information so that they can generate the same set of candidate groups C k 1 for the next pass After the rst pass each node determines which items are frequent and in the second pass each node counts the occurrencies of all the pairs of frequent 1-itemsets using a twodimensional data array to maintain the counts of the candidate 2-itemsets appearing in the local database Here we do not count the occurrences of the large itemset  h  g   t  g   of each candidate group g because those large itemsets turn out to be infrequent most of the time at this stage as reported in  After exchanging and merging of the local counts of the candidate 2-itemsets every node can identify the same set of frequent 2-itemsets Then each node generates the same set of candidate groups for the following third pass The procedure of generating the candidate groups for the k th pass k  3 is exactly same as that of sequential Max-Miner algorithm For example if  1  2    1  3  and  1  4  are frequent 2itemsets then we generate candidate groups whose heads are  1  2  3    1  2  4  and  1  3  4   respectively In general each candidate group generated for the k th pass has k items in its head This process of counting candidate groups exchanging and merging count information and generating candidate groups for the next pass is repeated until there is no more candidate group for the next pass PMM algorithm is simple and ecient and it has lower communication overhead because it does not require the transferring of transactions between nodes during the processing Like Count Distribution PMM requires the synchronization between nodes to exchange the count information after each pass However the number of passes required in PMM is smaller than that of Count Distribution because the supersetfrequency based pruning is performed in each pass by looking ahead to nd maximal frequent itemsets 3.1 Cube-based Communication between Processors To perform the communication between nodes eciently we impose a logical binary n cube structure on the processing nodes Then the nodes can exchange and merge the local count information through increasing dimensional links between them 4 In the n cube there are 2 n nodes and each node has n bit binary address Also each node has n neighbor nodes Proceedings of

which are directly linked to that node through dierent dimensional links For example there are 8 nodes in a 3-cube structure and node 000 2 is directly connected to 001 2  010 2 and 100 2 through a 1stdimensional link a 2nd-dimensional link and a 3rddimensional link respectively Thus in the n cube all the nodes can exchange and merge their local counts in n steps through each of the n dierent dimensional links 3.2 Pseudo-code of PMM As we assume a homogeneous distributed computing environment where all the nodes are the same we just give the pseudo-code of the PMM algorithm running on a node P i   Pass 1  P i counts the occurrencies of items in D i  n log 2 N  N nodes are used for mining  for  j 1 j  n  j  P i exchange and merge the local counts of items with a neighbor node through a j dimensional link P i determines F 1  F 1 is the set of frequent 1-itemsets   Pass 2  P i generates C 2 by pairing the members of F 1  P i counts the occurrences of the C 2 members in D i  for  j 1 j  n  j  P i exchange and merge the local counts of C 2 members with a neighbor node through a j dimensional link P i determines F 2  F 2 is the set of frequent 2-itemsets  P i generates C 3  all nodes have same C 3   C 3 includes all candidate groups generated based on F 2 for pass 3   Pass k for k  3  C k includes all candidate groups generated based on F k  1 for pass k  while  C k      P i scans D i to count the candidate groups in C k   counting all  head  i  for i  tail and  head  tail  for each candidate group in C k  for  j 1 j  n  j  P i exchange and merge the local counts of C k members with a neighbor node through a j dimensional link P i identies frequent itemsets P i inserts frequent itemsets into GM  and keeps only maximal frequent itemsets in GM  P i generates C k 1 using F k  superset-frequency based pruning is applied  k    GM is the set of all maximal frequent itemsets  4 Performance Evaluation Our test platform is an 8-node Linux cluster system where nodes are connected by a Fast Ethernet switch Each node has a 800 Mhz Pentium processor 512 MB memory and a 40 GB disk drive The processes are communicating using the MPI Message Passing Interface The databases used in our experiments are synthetic sales transaction databases generated as in 1 All parameters used for generating databases are described in Table 1 For all databases c  0.5 m  0.5 v  0.1  L   2000 and NI  1000 Table 2 lists all databases used in our performance evaluation experiments The size of each database is about 360 MB When running the parallel algorithm on a database we need to partition it into local databases To balance the size of the local databases each transaction is randomly allocated to a node In order to compare the performance of PMM and Count Distribution we also implemented Count Distribution on the same platform Table 1 Synthetic database parameters  D  Number of transactions in the database  T  Average size of the transactions  I  Average size of the maximal potentially frequent itemsets  L  Number of maximal potentially frequent itemsets NI Number of items c Correlation level m Mean of the corruption level v Variance of the corruption level Table 2 Databases Name  T   I   D  T10 I02 D7852K 10 2 7852K T20 I04 D4288K 20 4 4288K T25 I06 D3504K 25 6 3504K T30 I08 D2954K 30 8 2954K T40 I10 D2256K 40 10 2256K 4.1 Improvement of PMM over Count Distribution We ran both PMM and Count Distribution on different synthetic databases with dierent minsup values Table 3 shows the speedup of PMM over Count Distribution CD If we dene T CD and T PMM as the execution times of CD and PMM respectively then the speedup of PMM over CD is T CD T PMM In Table 3 the speedup of PMM is shown for dierent databases listed in the rst column and for dierent values of minsup listed in the rst row In these experiments all 8 nodes in our cluster system were used Proceedings of the 15th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI03 1082-3409/03 $17.00  2003 IEEE

Manager manages the agreed proposals and provides necessary information for the process of derived data generation The Template Generators generate templates based on the proposals A template is similar to a multi-resolution cache object 10 and a n X SL stylesheet 13   I t c ontains information for the Data Generators to generate different 221views\222 based on different p ermissions to the levels of behavior logs For example a simple ACL Template Generator can be implemented by attaching ACL s Access Control Lists to raw data on which derived data depend In addition an ACL Filter can be developed to 036lter out unauthorized components from the template produced by the ACL Template Generator To illustrate suppose a derived data 000 002 004 006 002 t 013 depends on the raw data 002 r 006 002 020 and 002 021 where 002 004 023 002 r 025 002 020  and 002 t 023 030 031 002 033  When a template about the pair is generated the ACL Template Generator attaches the ACLs of 002 r and 002 020 to 002 004  and the ACL of 002 021 to 002 t  If a requester wishes to obtain the pair but he has no permission to view 002 r then 002 004 will be 036ltered out and only 002 t is provided For some applications rather than 036ltering out entirely a component of a derived data a more sophisticated template may be developed to leave the component but removing the effect of the raw data on which the component depends but a requester has no permission to view it This will be left to our future work 7 Future Work Other than a concrete implementation of DDS there are many interesting things left to be done st we observe that this paper focuses on user behaviors in using services in cyberspace Similar methods may be used to develop a framework for studying user behaviors in more general applications Secondly current design in DDS does not consider storage limitation The retention of outdated logs and their destruction time may be considered to save storage space Third XQuery is u sed in DDS for derived data de\036nition However XQuery provides only simple aggregate functions such as sum count min max etc More complicated data mining functions such as 036nding association rules or sequence patterns may be included Finally in case a user wishes to manually modify the generated derived data should such modi\036cation be allowed If so should requesters be aware of such

the initial global candidate set would be similar to the set of global MFIs. As a result, during the global mining phase the communication and synchronization overhead is low  0 2 4 6 8 1 0 Number of Nodes Figure 5. Speedup of DMM 4.4.2 Sizeup For the sizeup test, we fixed the system to the 8-node con figuration, and distributed each database listed in Table 2 to the 8 nodes. Then, we increased the local database sire at each node from 45 MB to 215 MB by duplicating the initial database partition allocated to the node. Thus, the data distribution characteristics remained the same as the local database size was increased. This is different from the speedup test, where the database repartitioning was per formed when the number of nodes was increased. The per formance of DMM is affected by the database repartitioning to some extent, although it is usually very small. During the sizeup test, the local mining result of DMM is not changed at all at each node The results shown in Figure 6 indicate that DMM has a very good sizeup property. Since increasing the size of local database did not affect the local mining result of DMM at each node, the total execution time increased just due to more disk U 0  and computation cost which scaled almost linearly with sizeup 5 Conclusions In this paper, we proposed a new parallel maximal fre quent itemset \(MFI Max-Miner \(DMM tems. DMM is a parallel version of Max-Miner, and it re quires low synchronization and communication overhead compared to other parallel algorithms. In DMM, Max Miner is applied on each database partition during the lo 0 45 90 135 180 225 270 Amwnt of Data per Node \(ME Figure 6. Sizeup of DMM cal mining phase. Only one synchronization is needed at thc end of this phase to construct thc initial global candi date set. In the global mining phase, a top-down search is performed on the candidate set, and a prefix tree is used to count the candidates with different length efficiently. Usu ally, just a few passes are needed to find all global maximal frequent itemsets. Thus, DMM largely reduces the number of synchronizations required between processing nodes Compared with Count Distribution, DMM shows a great improvement when some frequent itemscts are large \(i.e long patterns employed by DMM for efficient communication between nodes; and global support estimation, subset-infrequency based pruning, and superset-frequency based pruning are used to reduce the size of global candidate set.

sketch-index in answering aggregate queries. Then Section 5.2 studies the effect of approximating spatiotemporal data, while Section 5.3 presents preliminary results for mining association rules 5.1 Performance of sketch-indexes Due to the lack of real spatio-temporal datasets we generate synthetic data in a way similar to [SJLL00 TPS03] aiming at simulation of air traffic. We first adopt a real spatial dataset [Tiger] that contains 10k 2D points representing locations in the Long Beach county \(the data space is normalized to unit length on each dimension These points serve as the  airbases  At the initial timestamp 0, we generate 100k air planes, such that each plane \(i uniformly generated in [200,300], \(ii, iii destination that are two random different airbases, and iv  the velocity direction is determined by the orientation of the line segment connecting its source and destination airbases move continually according to their velocities. Once a plane reaches its destination, it flies towards another randomly selected also uniform in [0.02, 0.04 reports to its nearest airbase, or specifically, the database consists of tuples in the form &lt;time t, airbase b, plane p passenger # a&gt;, specifying that plane p with a passengers is closest to base b at time t A spatio-temporal count/sum query has two parameters the length qrlen of its query \(square number qtlen of timestamps covered by its interval. The actual extent of the window \(interval uniformly in the data space \(history, i.e., timestamps 0,100 air planes that report to airbases in qr during qt, while a sum query returns the sum of these planes  passengers. A workload consists of 100 queries with the same parameters qrlen and qtlen The disk page size is set to 1k in all cases \(the relatively small page size simulates situations where the database is much more voluminous specialized method for distinct spatio-temporal aggregation, we compare the sketch-index to the following relational approach that can be implemented in a DBMS. Specifically, we index the 4-tuple table lt;t,b,p,a&gt; using a B-tree on the time t column. Given a count query \(with window qr and interval qt SELECT distinct p FROM &lt;t,b,p,a&gt WHERE t?qt &amp; b contained in qr The performance of each method is measured as the average number of page accesses \(per query processing a workload. For the sketch-index, we also report the average \(relative Specifically, let acti and esti be the actual and estimated results of the i-th query in the workload; then the error equals \(1/100 set the number of bits in each sketch to 24, and vary the number of sketches The first experiment evaluates the space consumption Figure 5.1 shows the sketch index size as a function of the number of sketches used \(count- and sum-indexes have the same results more sketches are included, but is usually considerably smaller than the database size \(e.g., for 16 signatures, the size is only 40% the database size 0 20 40 60 80

Given a query, this tree facilitates the retrieval of all qualifying tuples, after which a post-processing step is performed to obtain the Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE  04 1063-6382/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE number of distinct planes \(in the sequel, we refer to this method as 3DR method introduces a regular res  res grid of the data space, where the resolution res is a parameter.

Conclusions While efficient aggregation is the objective of most spatio-temporal applications in practice, the existing solutions either incur prohibitive space consumption and query time, or are not able to return useful aggregate results due to the distinct counting problem. In this paper we propose the sketch index that integrates traditional approximate counting techniques with spatio-temporal indexes. Sketch indexes use a highly optimized query algorithm resulting in both smaller database size and faster query time. Our experiments show that while a sketch index consumes only a fraction of the space required for a conventional database, it can process 


required for a conventional database, it can process queries an order of magnitude faster with average relative error less than 15 While we chose to use FM sketches, our methodology can leverage any sketches allowing union operations Comparing the efficiency of different sketches constitutes a direction for future work, as well as further investigation of more sophisticated algorithms for mining association rules. For example, heuristics similar to those used for searching sketch indexes may be applied to improve the brute-force implementation ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Yufei Tao and Dimitris Papadias were supported by grant HKUST 6197/02E from Hong Kong RGC.
