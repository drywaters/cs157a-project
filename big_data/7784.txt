2016 IEEE International Conference on Big Data \(Big Data 978-1-4673-9005-7/16/$31.00 \2512016 IEEE 1946 Very Fast Frequent Itemset Mining Simplicial Complex Methods Extended Abstract Tsau-Young Lin Department of Computer Science, San Jose State Uiversity San Jose, CA 95192, ty.lin@sjsu.edu  Abstract 227 Based on the concept of isomorphism of relations, a relation is turned into a simplicial complex, which is a combinatorial representation of a polyhedron. So frequent itemsets mining is transform turned into geometric traversal problem.  By leveraging on geometric structure of simplicial complex, a very fast algorithm for traversal is found; it is based on a geometric concept, called sub-cone construction. It is not only very fa st but also use much less memory than existing methods. For a real world medical database of 1257 columns with 65K rows, the new algorithm takes only 5 seconds to find all frequent itemsets, while FP-growth takes approximately 1000 seconds; so simplicial complex method is about 200 times faster Moreover the memory usage is substantially less; see the data  Keywords\227 geometry, frequent it emset, frequent- pattern growth simplicial complex I  I NTRODUCTION  Frequent itemsets mining is a well-known technique to find correlation relationships among vast amount of data. Over last two decades Apriori and Frequent Pattern Growth \(FP-growth are two most popular methods. In this paper, we will introduce a new method called a simplicial complex method A  An Outline of Key Points The fundamental concept, stated in Theorem 1, im plies that to mine patterns from a given relation A, one may find the same patterns by mining another is omorphic relation A\222.  The main point of this paper is to use geometric concept to mine isomorphic geometric relation. Such a frequent itemset mining is turned into a geometric traversal of the simplicial complex The key idea in this traversal is the sub-cone construction B  Experiment Results  In the experiments, we use three sets of data 1  the first set is provided to us by Jian Pei group, one of the author of FP-growth method 2  The second set of data is a real world data that is provided by National Taiwan University Hospital. This database consists of total of 65,536 transactions and 1257 columns in bit form 3  The third test is a \223theoretical data\224; we setup a stress testing scheme that allows us to gauge into the kind of improvements that we have made.  Using the program of FP-growth, it takes 44.7 hours to search frequent itemsets of length 28, while using the program of simplicial complex method it takes 5.25 minutes. For 32 columns and 30-dimensional data simplicial complex method, it takes 16.615 minutes; for FPmethod; it would be too lo ng, we skip the test Frequent Pattern \(FP\Method 200  It represents a relation by a tree 200  A tuple is a linear branch from root to leaf Dataset Time Memory Notes 5k rows 1.38 sec 8 MB 4 dimensions 0.097 threshold, 77 columns 65k rows 14.6 min 100 MB 4 dimensions 0.042 threshold, 1257 columns 2 rows 44.7 hour 30 MB 28 dimensions, no threshold, 30 columns  Simplicial Complex  1  It represents a relation by a simplicial complex \(a polyhedron 2  A tuple represented by a closed simplex Dataset Time Memory Notes 5k rows 0.01 sec 2.3 MB 4 dimensions, 0.097 threshold, 77 columns 65k rows 3.18 sec 35.2 MB 4 dimensions, 0.042 threshold, 1257 columns 2 rows 5.25 min 0.8 MB 28 dimensions, no threshold, 30 columns 2row 16.615 min 2.26 MB 30 dimensions, no threshold, 32 columns II S IMPLIAL C OMPLEXES  Let us consider the following unit points in a very high dimensional Euclidean space, E  v 0= \(1  0  0 205  v 1= \(0  1  0 205  205\205 0 205 0  1  0 205 0 An open 0-simplex 002 vi\ consists of a vertex vi,  the unit point of the i-th coordinate, i=0, 1, 2 , . . . If E is an XY plane 002 v0\ is the point \(1, 0\ and 002 v1\ is \(0, 1 2\  An open 1-simplex 002  v i v j\ consists of two unit points vi v j of the i-th and j-th coordinates, where i, j =0, 1, 2 Each 002  v 0 v 1\ is an open segment that connects two unit points, but does not include its two end points.  In X-Y plane 002  v0, v1 e open segment connecting  the unit point \(1, 0\ of X-coordinate and the unit point \(0, 1\ of Ycoordinate; it does not contains the two end points 3\  An open 2-simplex 002  v i v j v k\nsists of three unit points v i v j v k, where  i, j, k= =0, 1, 2 , . . .  In X-Y-Z space 002  v 0 v 1 v 2\ can be interpreted as the an open triangle that

This is a slight modification of the concept in pp 108    Definition 2 A simplicial complex \(V, S of a set V={v of vertices and a bag S={s} of finite nonempty subsets called open\plexes such that  1  Any set consisting of one vertex is a simplex 2  Closed condition: Any nonempty subset of a \(open simplex is a \(open\plex  Remark: A more accurate name is a bag simplicial complex It follows from condition 1 that 0-simlex of \(V, S  corresponding bijective to the vertices of \(V S\ from condition 2 that any simplex is determined by its 0-simplexes. Therefore \(V S is equal to the set of its simplexes and we shall identify a vertex with 0-simplex  Definition 3: A closed n-simplex is a simplicial complex that consists of a unique open n-simplex and all its faces  III  F UNDEMENTAL T HEOREMS  I NFROMAL E XPOSITOIN   In this section, we will explain the main ideas of this paper.   Let us quote from ental th eorem about relational tables which are formally bag relation instances Theorem 1 Isomorphic relations have isomorphic frequent itemsets Instead of  a formal proof, we w ill use an example to illustrate the idea: This example consists of two tables, a Market Basket table \(M-table\ and an  isomorphic geometric table \(G-table both tables are interpretations of the abstract table, Table 1.  The identity map of Table I can be interpreted as an isomorphism from M-table to G-table. He re is the abstract table    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 A B C D E F G T1 1 1 1 1   T2 1 1 1 1  T3 1 1  1 1 T4 267 \267 \267 \267 \267 \267 \267 267 267 \267 \267 \267 \267 \267 \267 Table I  Table I may allow repeated rows, so they are bag relations The leftmost column is the set of \223real world objects\224, each of which is represented by T1. T2, \205  Next are the two interpretations 1\-table: each column of Table I represents an Item in a store First row represents the items purchased by the first customer. Second row the second customer, etc. So columns are merchandise, namely. A, B, C, D, etc., are Bread, Beer, Milk, etc 2\ G-Table: each column represents the unit point, called a vertex, of a coordinate in a high dimensional Euclidean space.  Observe that A is the unit point of first coordinate B is the second, and etc. So the first tuple T1 represents 4 unit points, A, B, C, D that forms the first tetrahedron 002 ABCD; the second tuple T2, the second tetrahedron 002 EBCD;  T3, the third tetrahedron 002 GABF. Their \223union\224 is a simplicial complex in Figure 1    Figure 1  Here is an intuitive explanation of Figure 1: geometrically, T1 is a tetrahedron \(pyramid\ can visualize BCD as a triangle on the ground and A as a vertex above the ground in the sky.  T2 is a similar tetrahedron whose base is the same triangle BCD lying on the ground, and E is a vertex deeply under the ground. These two tetrahedrons are glued together along the triang le BCD. T3 is another tetrahedron stands on the ground in which the vertex G is in the sky and shares the edge AB with T1.  The \223union\224 is a simplicial complex, which is displayed in Fig 1.  So we may conclude 1\T3 determine 3 tetrahedra 2\ \223union\224 of T1, T2, and T3 is a polyhedron  


1948 In terms of simplicial complexes \(next section a close simplex and a polyhedron is a simplicial complex So we conclude the next three theorems Theorem 2: For every bag relation there is an isomorphic geometric bag relation Theorem 3: For every geometric bag relation H there is a bag simplicial complex \(V H S H such that every sub-tuple \(frequent itemset without threshold\ corresponds to an open simplex and every tuple corresponds to a closed simplex  Theorem 4: The collection of frequent itemsets \(above a threshold\ determines a bag simplicial sub-complex V f S f  of the simplicia l complex \(V H S H above the same threshold\ of the relation H To see the idea intuitively, let us examine Fig 1, we can see the simplicial sub-complex \(V f S f of frequent items \(threshold =2 has following open simplexes 1\he open simplex 002 B, C, D\, which is an open triangle that is shared by T1 and T2, together with all its faces 2\The open simplex 002 A, B\which is an open segment is shared by T1 and T3, together with all its faces their frequencies are 2, 2 The geometrical \223union\224 is the sub-complex \(V f S f ere V f  A, B, D, E, F, G}, and S f has been specified above IV  T RAVESAL A LGORITHM  Now, we will describe how Frequent Itemsets can be mined by geometrical traversal.  The main idea is a minor modification of cone constructions in algebraic topology.  Roughly, it builds a new object by adding one vertex on the \223sky\224 of what has already been constructed; we can construct a tetrahedron by adjunct a point on the sky over a triangle lying on the ground Definition 4 a The cone construction. Let V; S   be a given simplicial subcomplex. Let n be a new point not in V A new bag simplicial complex, denoted by n  V; S   and called the cone on V; S   with a new vertex n is the pair \(n V; nS where n V consists of all the original vertices and new vertex n, and nS consists of all original simplexes and new simplexes 002  n; original vertices  b The sub-cone construction. Roughly, it is constructed by the cone construction but with on e additional constraint that is all new simplexes have to be a cone with a base being an existing simplexe in S. Let V W S W   be a given simplicial subcomplex of V; S  n be a point in V but not in V W Then a new bag simplicial sub-complex of V; S denoted by V W  S W sub-cone in V; S   with a new vertex n is the pair \(n V W nS W  V W  consists of all the original vertices and new vertex n, and nS W consists of all original simplexes and new simplexes 002  n; original vertices  003 S  0 1 2 3  A B C D S1 1 1 1 0 S2 0 1 1 1 S3 1 0 1 1 S4 1 1 0 1 Table II  Example 1 Let \(S, V\be the simplicial complex of hollow tetrahedron whose geometric relation is Table II. The four triangles are: S1 is an open triangle 002 A, B, C\ined by three points A, B, C \(the colu mns that have values 1 in the first tuple; S2 is 002 B, C, D\; S3 is 002 A, C, D 002 A, B D  Here are the detail steps of sub-cone constructions. By it we have traverse the hollow tetrahedron  1\ Let V W S W pty simplicial complex, and let the new vertex n be D, then \(D V W  D S W   002 D 002 D 3}\re the number indicates the repetition; for the repetition=1; we skip the display. For example we use 002 D} to mean 002 D1  2\ Let V W S W D V W  D S W nd the new vertex n be C then \(CD V W  CD S W  002 D 002 C 002 D3 002 C 3 002 D, C\ 2  3\ Let V W S W CD V W  CD S W nd n be B, then BCD V W  BCD S W  002 D 002 C 002 B 002 D 3 002 C 3 002 B 3 002 D, C 002 D, B 002 C, B\2 002 D, C, B  4\ Let V W S W BCD V W  BCD S W nd n be A, then ABCD V W  ABCD S W   4.1\ If the construction just described were a CONE construction, the answer would be  002 D 002 C 002 B 002 A 002 D 002 C 002 B 002 A 002 D, C 002 D, B 002 C, B 002 D, C, B 002 D, A 002 C, A 002 B, A 002 D, C, A 002 D, B, A 002 C, B, A 002 D, C, B, A  4.2\ Since what we need is sub-cone construction, we strike out the simplexes that are not in \(V, S\o we have ABCD V W  ABCD S W   002 D 002 C 002 B 002 A 002 D3 002 C3 002 B 3 002 A 3 002 D, A 002 D, B\ 2 002 C, B\ 2 002 D, C, B\1 002 D A 002 C, A\ 2 002 B, A 002 D, C, A\ 1 002 D, B, A\1 002 C B, A\1 002 D, C, B, A  The second component is the geometric traversal  Example 2 Let \(S, V\be the simplicial complex of hollow tetrahedron with missing one open 2-simplex, whose geometric relation is Table III 0 1 2 3  A B C D S1 1 1 1 0 S2 0 1 1 1 S3 1 0 1 1 S4-1 1 1 0 0 S4-2 1 0 0 1 S4-3 0 1 0 1 Table III  Let us select a point that has the highest repetition count. In this case, let us start with an empty set V  1\vertex B and form a cone V1=BV 002 B, 4\where the second component is the frequency 


1949 2\ choose A and form a cone V2 002 A 4 002 B4 002 A,B\\; the count is based on the  frequency count of Table III 3\e C and form a cone V3=CV2 002 A 4 002 B 4 002 A,B 2 002 C 002 A, C 002 B, C\ 2 002 A,B, C\1 4\e D from a cone V4=DV3  002 B 4 002 A,B 002 C 3 002 A, C 002 B, C\2 002 A,B C  002 A, D\ 2 002 B, D\ 2 002 A, C, D\1 002 B, C, D  The basic idea in traversal is very simple, it merely applies the sub-cone construction repeatedly  V  C ONCLUSIONS  From the experiments, it is clear simplicial complex method is faster than FP-growth meth od; its memory usage is more efficient.  The stress test tells us that we can handle frequent itemsets of length 30 in reasonab le time; no existing method can do that. This method has a great potential in big data analysis The key difference is on the respective representation; the FPgrowth method represents each tuple by a linear sequence of branches from root to leaf; such a representation implicitly regard the tuple as an ORDERED sequence.  Hence FP-growth method has to deal with such an order. While simplicial complex method represents a tupl e by closed simplex, there is no order in this representation. F or example, FP-Growth has to scan the input dataset more than once; it scans data during                                    constructing of conditional FP-Tree, which is a recursive procedure; this probably is, we believe, one of the major causes.  Another point is that once a bag relation is given, its bag simplicial complex of the relation and its bag simplicial sub-complex of frequent itemsets are there, so the association rule mining algorithm does not need to \223construct the FPtree\224; it just simply goes directly to traversal the sub-complex of frequent itemsets  References   ielinsk i, and A.

Number of Class Association Rules Generated The Class-Association-Rules are generated based on closed frequent itemset with support of 50% and confidence of 100 The generated rules are used for classification. The antecedence of each rule is the consequent is the membership of class c. Then the class association rules classifier model is constructed which is represented in figure 4   Fig. 4. Class Association Rules Model  The last step of associative classification is prediction or class assignment techniques. The last phase of classification reads the unknown discretized sample or test set and association rules for the class. The score based function evaluates the how many rules are satisfied, even partially in ea ch rule. Then compute the score values for each rule. Finally the score value is assigned the class of the maximally satisfy to the test object. In our proposed methodology, the process of prediction or class assignment for test data, the researcher implemented the score based prediction For testing data, label removed breast cancer data and classification performance tested via leave one out cross validation method. The following table 5 presents the class prediction results using score based values. It has been analyzed that the use of gene intervals improves the classification accuracy as well as under or over expres sion and generates significant rules that are capable to find individual variation

    Fig. 8. Comparative Analysis Classification Algorithms V  CONCLUSION Associative Classification techniques are used to make better decision in critical situations. The proposed associative classification called as Classification of microarray gene expression data using associative classification and gene expression intervals used to clas sify the gene expression with gene intervals in affected gene expression. The experimental results are carried out by using the gene expression of breast cancer. The associative classification on gene expression data obtained the best prediction and accuracy of the classification result. The proposed algorithm was tested with two class and multi class data sets. The classification algorithm was compared with the classical classification algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, SVM, and Decision Tree. After the comparison of traditional classification algorithms, as per the view of possible error rates the Associative Classification algorithm is best for biological data. The results of this work are used to drug designer for cancer diseases. The proposed algorithm works on gene expression data.

on items contained in each item group When the number of pivots increases the entire database is split into a ner granularity and the number of partitions increase correspondingly Such a ne granularity leads to a reduction in distance computation among transactions On the other hand when the pivot number k continues growing the number of transactions mapped into one hash bucket signiﬁcantly increases thereby leading to a large candidate-object set and high shufﬂing cost see Figs 3b and 3c Consequently the overall execution time is optimized when k is 60 for both algorithms see Fig 3a 6.2 Minimum Support Recall that minimum support plays an important role in mining frequent itemsets We increase minimum support thresholds from 0.0005 to 0.0025 percent with an increment of 0.0005 percent to evaluate the impact of minimum support on FiDoop-DP The other parameters are the same as those for the previous experiments Fig 4a shows that the execution times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp decrease when the minimum support is increasing Intuitively a small minimum support leads to an increasing number of frequent 1-itemsets and transactions which have to be scanned and transmitted Table 2 illustrates the size of frequent 1-itemsets stored in FList and the number of nal output records of the two parallel solutions under various minimum-support values Fig 4a reveals that regardless of the minimum-support value FiDoop-DP is superior to Pfp in terms of running time Two reasons make this performance trend expected First FiDoop-DP optimizes the partitioning process by placing transactions with a high similarity into one group rather than randomly and evenly grouping the transaction Fig 4b conﬁrms that FiDoop-DP’s shufﬂing cost is signiﬁcantly lower than that of Pfp thanks to optimal data partitions offered by FiDoop-DP Second this grouping strategy in FiDoop-DP minimizes the number of transactions for each GList under the premise of data completeness which leads to reducing mining load for each Reducer The grouping strategy of FiDoop-DP introduces computing overhead including signature-matrix calculation and hashing each band into a bucket Nevertheless such small overhead is offset by the performance gains in the shufﬂing and reduce phases Fig 4a also shows that the performance improvement of FiDoop-DP over Pfp is widened when the minimum support increases This performance gap between FiDoop-DP and Pfp is reasonable because pushing minimum support up in FiDoop-DP lters out an increased number of frequent 1-itemsets which in turn shortens the transaction partitioning cost Small transactions simplify the correlation analysis among the transactions thus small transactions are less likely to have a large number of duplications in their partitions As a result the number of duplicated transactions to be transmitted among the partitions is signiﬁcantly reduced which allows FiDoop-DP to deliver better performance than Pfp 6.3 Data Characteristic In this group of experiments we respectively evaluate the impact of dimensionality and data correlation on the performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp by changing the parameters in the process of generating the datasets using the IBM Quest Market-Basket Synthetic Data Generator 6.3.1 Dimensionality The average transaction length directly determines the dimensions of a test data We conﬁgure the average transaction length to 10 40 60 and 85 to generate T10I4D 130 blocks T40I10D 128 blocks T60I10D 135 blocks T85I10D 133 blocks datasets respectively In this experiment we measure the impacts of dimensions on the performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp on the 8-node Hadoop cluster The experimental results plotted in Fig 5a clearly indicate that an increasing number of dimensions signiﬁcantly raises the running times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp This is because increasing the number of dimensions increases the number of groups thus the amount of data transmission sharply goes up as seen in Fig 5b The performance improvements of FiDoop-DP over Pfp is diminishing when the dimensionality increases from 10 to 85 For example FiDoop-DP offers an improvement of 29.4 percent when the dimensionality is set to 10 the improvement drops to 5.2 percent when the number of dimensions becomes 85 In what follows we argue that FiDoop-DP is inherently losing the power of reducing the number of redundant transactions in high-dimensional data When a dataset has a low dimensionality FiDoop-DP tends to build partitions Fig 4 Impact of minimum support on FiDoop-DP and Pfp TABLE 2 The Size of FList and the Number of Final Output Records Under Various Minimum-Support Values minsupport 0.0005 0.001 0.0015 0.002 0.0025 FList 14.69k 11.6k 9.71k 6.89k 5.51k OutRecords 745 588 465 348 278 XUN ET AL FIDOOP-DP DATA PARTITIONING IN FREQUENT ITEMSET MINING ON HADOOP CLUSTERS 109 


each of which has distinct characteristics compared with the other partitions Such distinct features among the partitions allow FiDoop-DP to efﬁciently reduce the number of redundant transactions In contrast a dataset with high dimensionality has a long average transaction length therefore data partitions produced by FiDoop-DP have no distinct discrepancy Redundant transactions are likely to be formed for partitions that lack distinct characteristics Consequently the beneﬁt offered by FiDoop-DP for highdimensional datasets becomes insigniﬁcant 6.3.2 Data Correlation We set the correlation among transactions i.e corr to 0.15 0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 0.65 and 0.75 to measure the impacts of data correlation on the performance of the two algorithms on the 8-node Hadoop cluster The Number of Pivots is set to 60 see also Section 6.1 The experimental results plotted in Fig 5c clearly indicate that FiDoop-DP is more sensitive to data correlation than Pfp This performance trend motivates us to investigate the correlation-related data partition strategy Pfp conducts default data partition based on equal-size item group without taking into account the characteristics of the datasets However FiDoop-DP judiciously groups items with high correlation into one group and clustering similar transactions together In this way the number of redundant transactions kept on multiple nodes is substantially reduced Consequently FiDoop-DP is conducive to cutting back both data transmission trafﬁc and computing load As can be seen from Fig 5c there is an optimum balance point for data correlation degree to tune FiDoop-DP performance e.g 0.35 in Fig 5c If data correlation is too small Fidoop-DP will degenerate into random partition schema On the contrary it is difﬁcult to divide items into relatively independent groups when data correlation is high meaning that an excessive number of duplicated transactions have to be transferred to multiple nodes Thus a high data correlation leads to redundant transactions formed for partitions thereby increasing network and computing loads 6.4 Speedup Now we are positioned to evaluate the speedup performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp by increasing the number of data nodes in our Hadoop cluster from 4 to 24 The T40I10D 128 blocks dataset is applied to drive the speedup analysis of the these algorithms Fig 6 reveals the speedups of FiDoop-DP a nd Pfp as a function of the number of data nodes The experimental results illustrated in Fig 6a show that the speedups of FiDoop-DP and Pfp linearly scale up with the increasing number of data nodes Such a speedup trend can be attributed to the fact that increasing the number of data nodes under a xed input data size inevitably 1 reduces the amount of itemsets being handled by each node and 2 increases communication overhead among mappers and reducers Fig 6a shows that FiDoop-DP is better than Pfp in terms of the speedup efﬁciency For instance the FiDoop-DP improves the speedup efﬁciency of Pfp by up to 11.2 percent with an average of 6.1 percent This trend suggests FiDoopDP improves the speedup efﬁciency of Pfp in large-scale The speedup efﬁciencies drop when the Hadoop cluster scales up For example the speedup efﬁciencies of FiDoopDP and Pfp on the 4-node cluster are 0.970 and 0.995 respectively These two speedup efﬁciencies become 0.746 and 0.800 on the 24-node cluster Such a speedup-efﬁciency trend is driven by the cost of shufﬂing intermediate results which sharply goes up when the number of data nodes scales up Although the overall computing capacity is improved by increasing the number of nodes the cost of synchronization and communication among data nodes tends to offset the gain in computing capacity For example the results plotted in Fig 6b conﬁrm that the shufﬂing cost Fig 5 Impacts of data characteristics on FiDoop-DP and Pfp Fig 6 The speedup performance and shufﬂing cost of FiDoop-DP and Pfp 110 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS VOL 28 NO 1 JANUARY 2017 


is linearly increasing when computing nodes are scaled from 4 to 24 Furthermore the shufﬂing cost of Pfp is larger than that of FiDoop-DP 6.5 Scalability In this group of experiments we evaluate the scalability of FiDoop-DP and Pfp when the size of input dataset dramatically grows Fig 7 shows the running times of the algorithms when we scale up the size of the T40I10D data series Figs 7a and 7b demonstrate the performance of FiDoop-DP processing various datasets on 8-node and 24-node clusters respectively Fig 7 clearly reveals that the overall execution times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp go up when the input data size is sharply enlarged The parallel mining process is slowed down by the excessive data amount that has to be scanned twice The increased dataset size leads to long scanning time Interestingly FiDoop-DP exhibits a better scalability than Pfp Recall that see also from Algorithm 1 the second MapReduce job compresses an initial transaction database into a signature matrix which is dealt by the subsequent process The compress ratio is high when the input data size is large thereby shortening the subsequent processing time Furthermore Fidoop-DP lowers the network trafﬁc induced by the random grouping strategy in Pfp In summary the scalability of FiDoop-DP is higher than that of Pfp when it comes to parallel mining of an enormous amount of data 7R ELATED W ORK 7.1 Data Partitioning in MapReduce Partitioning in databases has been widely studied for both single system servers e.g and distributed storage systems e.g BigTable PNUTS[31 The existing approaches typically produce possible ranges or hash partitions which are then evaluated using heuristics and cost models These schemes offer limited support for OLTP workloads or query analysis in the context of the popular MapReduce programming model In this study we focus on the data partitioning issue in MapReduce High scalability is one of the most important design goals for MapReduce applications Unfortunately the partitioning techniques in existing MapReduce platforms e.g Hadoop are in their infancy leading to serious performance problems Recently a handful of data partitioning schemes have been proposed in the MapReduce platforms Xie et al  developed a data placement management mechanism for heterogeneous Hadoop clusters Their mechanism partitions data fragments to nodes in accordance to the nodes processing speed measured by computing ratios In addition Xie et al  designed a data redistribution algorithm in HDFS to address the data-skew issue imposed by dynamic data insertions and deletions CoHadoop is a H a d oop s lightweight extension which is designed to identify relateddataﬁlesfollowedbyamodiﬁeddataplacement policy to co-locate copies of those related les in the same server CoHadoop considers the relevance among les that is CoHadoop is an optimization of HaDoop for multiple les A key assumption of the MapReduce programming model is that mappers are completely independent of one another Vernica et al  broke such an assumption by introducing an asynchronous communication channel among mappers T his c hannel e nables the m appers to see global states managed in metadata Such situationaware mappers SAMs can enable MapReduce to exibly partition the inputs Apart from this adaptive sampling and partitioning were proposed to produce balanced partitions for the reducers by sampling mapper outputs and making use of obtained statistics Graph and hypergraph partitioning have been used to guide data partitioning in parallel computing Graph-based partitioning schemes capture data relationships For example Ke et al applied a graphic-execution-plan graph EPG to perform cost estimation and optimization by analyzing various properties of both data and computation Their estimation module coupled with the cost model estimate the runtime cost of each vertex in an EPG which represents the overall runtime cost a data partitioning plan is determined by a cost optimization module Liroz-Gistau et al proposed the MR-Part technique which partitions all input tuples producing the same intermediate key co-located in the same chunk Such a partitioning approach minimizes data transmission among mappers and reducers in the shufﬂe phase The approach captures the relationships between input tuples and intermediate keys by monitoring the execution of representative workload Then based on these relationships their approach applies a min-cut k-way graph partitioning algorithm thereby partitioning and assigning the tuples to appropriate fragments by modeling the workload with a hyper graph In doing so subsequent MapReduce jobs take full advantage of data locality in the reduce phase Their partitioning strategy suffers from adverse initialization overhead Fig 7 The scalability of FiDoop-DP and Pfp when the size of input dataset increases XUN ET AL FIDOOP-DP DATA PARTITIONING IN FREQUENT ITEMSET MINING ON HADOOP CLUSTERS 111 


7.2 Application-Aware Data Partitioning Various efﬁcient data partitioning strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of parallel computing systems For example Kirsten et al  developed two general partitioning strategies for generating entity match tasks to avoid memory bottlenecks and load imbalances Taking into account the characteristics of input data Aridhi et al proposed a novel density-based data partitioning technique for approximate large-scale frequent subgraph mining to balance computational load among a collection of machines Kotoulas et al built a data distribution mechanism based on clustering in elastic regions Traditional term-based partitioning has limited scalability due to the existence of very skewed frequency distributions among terms Load-balanced distributed clustering across networks and local clustering are introduced to improve the chance that triples with a same key are collocated These selforganizing approaches need no data analysis or upfront parameter adjustments in a priori Lu et al studied k nearest neighbor join using MapReduce in which a data partitioning approach was designed to reduce both shufﬂing and computational costs In Lu’s study objects are divided into partitions using a Voronoi diagram with carefully selected pivots Then data partitions i.e Voronoi cells are clustered into groups only if distances between them are restricted by a speciﬁc bound In this way their approach can answer the k-nearest-neighbour join queries by simply checking object pairs within each group FIM for data-intensive applications over computing clusters has received a growing attention efﬁcient data partitioning strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of parallel FIM algorithms A MapReducebased Apriori algorithm is designed to incorporate a new dynamic partitioning and distributing data method to improve mining performance This method divides input data into relatively small splits to provide exibility for improved load-balance performance Moreover the master node doesn’t distribute all the data once rather the rest data are distributed based on dynamically changing workload and computing capability weight of each node Similarly Jumbo adopted a dynamic partition assignment technology enabling each task to process more than one partition Thus these partitions can be dynamically reassigned to different tasks to improve the load balancing performance of Pfp Uthayopas et al  investigated I/O and execution scheduling strategies to balance data processing load thereby enhancing the utilization of a multi-core cluster system supporting association-rule mining In order to pick a winning strategy in terms of data-blocks assignment Uthayopas et al incorporated three basic placement policies namely the round robin range and random placement Their approach ignores data characteristics during the course of mining association rules 8F URTHER D ISCUSSIONS In this study we investigated the data partitioning issues in parallel FIM We focused on MapReduce-based parallel FPtree algorithms in particular we studied how to partition and distribute a large dataset across data nodes of a Hadoop cluster to reduce network and computing loads We argue that the general idea of FiDoop-DP proposed in this study can be extended to other FIM algorithms like Apriori running on Hadoop clusters Apriori-based parallel FIM algorithms can be classiﬁed into two camps namely count distribution and data distribution  For the count distribution camp each node in a cluster calculates local support counts of all candidate itemsets Then the global support counts of the candidates are computed by exchanging the local support counts For the data distribution camp each node only keeps the support counts of a subset of all candidates Each node is responsible for delivering its local database partition to all the other processors to compute support counts In general the data distribution schemes have higher communication overhead than the count distribution ones whereas the data distribution schemes have lower synchronization overhead than its competitor Regardless of the count distribution or data distribution approaches the communication and synchronization cost induce adverse impacts on the performance of parallel mining algorithms The basic idea of Fidoop-DP—grouping highly relevant transactions into a partition allows the parallel algorithms to exploit correlations among transactions in database to cut communication and synchronization overhead among Hadoop nodes 9C ONCLUSIONS A ND F UTURE W ORK To mitigate high communication and reduce computing cost in MapReduce-based FIM algorithms we developed FiDoop-DP which exploits correlation among transactions to partition a large dataset across data nodes in a Hadoop cluster FiDoop-DP is able to 1 partition transactions with high similarity together and 2 group highly correlated frequent items into a list One of the salient features of FiDoopDP lies in its capability of lowering network trafﬁc and computing load through reducing the number of redundant transactions which are transmitted among Hadoop nodes FiDoop-DP applies the Voronoi diagram-based data partitioning technique to accomplish data partition in which LSH is incorporated to offer an analysis of correlation among transactions At the heart of FiDoop-DP is the second MapReduce job which 1 partitions a large database to form a complete dataset for item groups and 2 conducts FP-Growth processing in parallel on local partitions to generate all frequent patterns Our experimental results reveal that FiDoop-DP signiﬁcantly improves the FIM performance of the existing Pfp solution by up to 31 percent with an average of 18 percent We introduced in this study a similarity metric to facilitate data-aware partitioning As a future research direction we will apply this metric to investigate advanced loadbalancing strategies on a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster In one of our earlier studies see for details we addressed the data-placement issue in heterogeneous Hadoop clusters where data are placed across nodes in a way that each node has a balanced data processing load Our data placement scheme can balance the amount of data stored in heterogeneous nodes to achieve improved data-processing performance Such a scheme implemented at the level of Hadoop distributed le system HDFS is unaware of correlations among application data To further improve load balancing 112 IEEE
