brossi,chren,buhnova,tomp g mail.muni.cz Abstract 227In recent years we have been witnessing profound transformation of energy distribution systems fueled by Information and Communication Technologies ICT towards the so called Smart Grid However while the Smart Grid design strategies have been studied by academia only anecdotal guidance is provided to the industry with respect to increasing the level of grid intelligence In this paper we report on a successful project in assisting the industry in this way via conducting a large anomaly-detection study on the data of one of the power distribution companies in the Czech Republic In the study we move away from the concept of single events identi\002ed as anomaly to the concept of collective anomaly that is itemsets of events that may be anomalous based on their patterns of appearance This can assist the operators of the distribution system in the transformation of their grid to a smarter grid By analyzing Smart Meters data streams we used frequent itemset mining and categorical clustering with clustering silhouette thresholding to detect anomalous behaviour As the main result we provided to stakeholders both a visual representation of the candidate anomalies and the identi\002cation of the top-10 anomalies for a subset of Smart Meters Index Terms 227Smart Grids Smart Meters Anomaly Detection Clustering Frequent Itemset Mining I I NTRODUCTION The Smart Grid can be regarded as an electricity network that bene\002ts both from two-way cyber-secure communication technologies and computational intelligence for electricity generation transmission substations integration distribution and consumption to reach the goals of a clean safe secure reliable resilient ef\002cient and sustainable infrastructure The investment into large-scale Smart Grid deployment can be very risky as con\002rmed for instance by investment losses during the Xcel Energys SmartGridCity project 2 There is a recent trend in adding more 223smartness\224 in the Smart Grid infrastructure so that the large amount of information that can be mined from normal usage can be used to drive the decision-making process and optimize the overall infrastructure management 4 This ef fect is enhanced by the two-way nature of the more modern infrastructures that allow operators to 002ne-tune parameters remotely based on the knowledge acquired from the operating conditions In the this paper we deal with anomaly detection from Smart Grid data that is looking for speci\002c patterns in Smart Meter's data streams that do not conform to expected behaviour In general terms anomaly detection is a broad concept that has been applied to different 002elds ranging from systems intrusion detection to fraud detection with varying de\002nitions of expected behaviour Based on real data from one of the power distribution companies in the Czech Republic we propose an approach for the detection of the anomalies in the Smart Metering infrastructure that could be useful to promptly intervene to investigate the cause of unexpected behaviour Based on this analysis we report also about the insights acquired in terms of extensions of the approach that would allow us to implement such online system within the Smart Grid infrastructure The proposed approach is based on frequent itemset mining by encoding the different event types streamed from Smart Meters applying segmentation of the itemsets and using categorical clustering for the evaluation of the itemsets and detection of unexpected patterns The proposed approach is based on the analysis of event types from the Smart Meters It allows us to detect anomalies that might have impact on the Smart Grid security reliability or maintenance\227for example suspicious manipulation with Smart Meter casing under/overvoltage in speci\002c locations or failure to switch remotely controlled appliances The paper is structured as follows Section II overviews related work in the area of anomaly detection within Smart Grids Section III then discusses the context of the study and provides descriptive information about the dataset The anomaly detection approach is described in Section IV together with the rationale for its derivation Section V presents the application within the Smart Grid domain according to the contextual information provided The main evaluation and discussion from the experimental part is presented in Section VI while Section VII brings up the conclusions II R ELATED W ORK As the Smart Grid implementation is a strategic act for many countries extensive attention has been paid to the study of smart infrastructures in recent years 6 F ang et al  di vide the smart infrastructure into three subsystems 1 the smart energy

concerned with wireless and wired communication technologies and the end-to-end communication management Within the smart information subsystem 2 which frames our work signi\002cant advancement can be observed in both industry and academia In industry these projects are mainly led by electric utilities or related organizations which are however often lacking expertise in information and communication technologies Evaluation of the devised strategies is hence realised rather via pilot projects than via analytical and simulation means While simulation is not that uncommon within the design of smart energy subsystem 1 and smart communication subsystem 3 it is rather rare within the smart information subsystem 2 In academia many approaches for the analysis of data 003owing within the Smart Grid and hence the identi\002cation of smart information exist mostly in the cyber-security domain  9 W ithin the c yber security  the approaches are mainly concerned with intrusion detection harming the con\002dentiality integrity or availability of the Smart Grid 11 12 although more work has been done on preventative measures such as secure communication protocols and architectures in the Smart Grid Ov erall the c yber security in the frame of Smart Grids is very well researched and hence we will invest more effort in investigating the other domains Besides cyber-security the analysis of the Smart Grid information 003ow is concerned mainly with the detection of faults and failures 14 15 and to minor e xtent with the study of consumer behaviour Calderaro et al detect f ailures in data transmission and f aults in the distribution network with the help of petri nets analysis and matrix operations Kalaitzis et al study po werline faults on the level of the amplitude frequency or phase of powerline signal with the help of a sliding window approach in multivariate time series He et al are concerned with fault detection and localization in transmission lines using a network inference algorithm based on Markov random 002elds and dependency graphs However all these approaches are based on the powerline level i.e modelling and observing individual relays po werline signal 14 or phasor angles across the transmission line buses not the information 003ow above it which differentiates them from our aim The application of clustering to Smart Grids data is not a novel idea and has been successfully applied to Smart Grid data to steer towards a more intelligent Smart Grid infrastructure 4 Ho we v er  applications are more speci\002c to clustering customers according to behaviour from Smart Meters data or looking into clustering sensor data to segment the network topology and identify set of clusters according to energy pro\002les III C ONTEXT OF THE S TUDY This study was conducted in cooperation with the major energy distribution company in the Czech Republic in which the smart metering infrastructure has been tested and examined in several pilot projects since 2006 The pilot projects have been part of the European Grid4EU initiative Currently there have been almost 40,000 Smart Meters deployed in total which constitutes about 1 of all consumers managed by the Distribution company The individual pilot projects have speci\002c goals e.g evaluation of available technologies communication infrastructure quality of service In our case we utilise the data sets from a project focusing on local load management in low voltage power grids The selected consumers both households and industry are equipped with Smart Meters that collect data about the power consumption pro\002le The data is periodically sent to the data concentrator which is installed at the Distribution Transformation Station DTS is one data concentrator per each DTS From the data concentrator the data is collected and stored by the Data Central DC server which is located at the power grid operation centre Besides the data related to the power consumption attributes the individual devices generate variety of events used for the grid monitoring and maintenance A central role is played by the Smart Meter an electronic device used for the measurement and provision of billing information to customers In this study  we consider Smart Meters as data sources of data streaming allowing the analysis of all data derived from the Smart Meters operations The Smart Meter events are used to notify the data central about important state changes that happened at the level of the Smart Meter such as powering up or down of the meter tariff and rate switching time synchronization etc Each event belongs to one of possible 76 event types An event entry is described by the origin time event type and a Smart Meter device it was created by For the device there is a number of additional attributes available such as its GPS coordinates date of installation tariff category or type of deployment site e.g apartment house agriculture/industry etc The entire dataset contains 364,107 event entries that have been collected from 381 Smart Meters over the timespan from December 2014 to July 2015 IV A NOMALY D ETECTION A PPROACH D EFINITION When dealing with anomaly detection one important distinction is based on the way we aggregate data to determine unexpected behaviour We usually distinguish among i point anomalies ii context anomalies and iii collective anomalies  A point anomaly means that one individual event instance can be considered anomalous when compared to the remaining data For example counting the number of occurrences of a 224gateway on\224 event from a Smart Meter might be considered anomalous if its frequency is too low or high on a speci\002c day Context anomalies start from the assumption of dividing the behaviour from the context the same behaviour might not be considered an anomaly if it happens in a different context Based on the previous example the same number of occurrences of 224gateway on\224 might not trigger an anomaly detection mechanism if they happen on a speci\002c time of the day  period of the year Compared to point anomaly we need to take into account the context of the event instance The third\227 and more interesting for our context\227category is referred to as collective anomaly  In this case the event instance does 2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and

Fig 1 Proposed Approach for Smart Meters anomaly detection  E set of events S set of data segments T set of transactions F frequent itemset M F I most frequent itemset C set of clusters not represent an anomaly per se  but only if considered within the collection of all the other events instances Continuing the previous example we might consider as anomalous the collection of events 224gateway on\224  224gateway off\224  224gateway on\224  224gateway off\224 rather than 224gateway on\224  224transmission start\224  224gateway off\224  For this type of anomaly looking at single event instances is not meaningful as they need to be considered together with the other collection of events A typical further characterization of anomaly detection is based on the availability of label data for the event instances that can constitute anomalies supervised semi-supervised and unsupervised approaches In the former cate gory  there is the availability of labelled data for either all instances or positive instances meaning usually one human expert dealing with labelling of each anomalous instance or the availability of some form of failure data from which labels can be derived\227 also known as tagging information In our speci\002c context we did not have any of such information available so we ruledout the option of applying a supervised classi\002cation approach for anomaly detection In fact due to the characteristics of the Smart Metering dataset we opted for what we can refer to as an unsupervised contextual and collective anomaly detection approach The main reasons were the unavailability of tagging information the needs to consider events within their context and within the broader concept of itemsets Given all the considerations about the way to tackle the problem in the Smart Grid domain our approach is similar to the one of Barbar 264 a et al that has been successfully applied in the context of intrusion detection Ho we v er  i n our approach we use a different way to detect outliers 227 clustering silhouette indicators Furthermore by applying the approach to Smart Grids data streams we identi\002ed several improvements that we discuss in the paper The approach is based on the idea to 002rst identify clusters of what can be considered as normal behaviour and then to look into itemsets that deviate from the knowledge learned from the dataset We present in detail the steps of the approach Fig 1 Step1 We 002rst apply Association Rule Mining to identify frequent itemsets that is sets of e v ents instances that are more recurrent For this we need to identify sets of transactions from the data streams We de\002ne one transaction as the set of all the items derived per one day and per each Smart Meter  Data Segmentation  Fig 1 Step1  Thus each Smart Meter will be associated with a list of daily transactions of operations Step2 Based on the aforementioned concept of collective anomaly  we extract the most frequent itemsets from data transactions by applying the the Apriori algorithm This will yield for each Transaction a list of frequent itemsets within each transaction  Frequent Itemsets Identi\002cation  Fig 1 Step2  As an example after running the 002rst two steps we might end up with the following itemsets f R2XR1On,Rate 2 switching g f Overcurrent L1,Overcurrent L3 g f R2XR1Off,R2XR1On g f R2XR1Off,R2XR1On,Rate 1 switching g  Step3 For each data segment we have now the list of frequent itemsets derived from all the transactions We look then for the Most Frequent Itemsets that are present in more than one segment  MFI Filtering  Fig 1 Step3  The assumption is that the itemsets that appear in more than one segment can be considered as an initial normal behaviour while the other can be considered potential anomalies at this stage Step4 Following the concept of contextual anomaly  each frequent itemset is further augmented with additional information so that the same itemset in different segments will be represented by additional features e.g whether a working day  Contextual Information Enhancement  Fig 1 Step4  Note that this will increase the number of features but will also increase the number of itemsets as the same itemset might appear in two different contexts  working day  non-working day  At this point the additional features can be derived from additional data sources not only Smart Meters\227as long as they can be associated to the itemsets An example of itemsets at this stage f R2XR1On,Rate 2 switching,week-day g f Overcurrent L1,Overcurrent L3,week-day g f Overcurrent L1,Overcurrent L3,week-end g  Step5 We cluster all the normal itemsets identi\002ed in Step2 The assumption is that we cluster these as representative of the normal behaviour  Clustering MFI  Fig 1 Step5  We might also look at this stage from the clustered data if there are 2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics € SM\C 2016 | October 9-12, 2016 € Budapest, Hungary SMC_2016    002315 


Fig 2 Clustering of 17 devices n=681 k=10 itemsets that are isolated or do not 002t well in their clusters As the itemsets are represented by categorical  nominal variables we use a categorical clustering based on entropy minimization  227 used also in the original approach T o continue with the example if clustering the previous data with a number of clusters k  2  we can get the following clusters as they minimize the entropy C1 f R2XR1On,Rate 2 switching,week-day g C2 f Overcurrent L1,Overcurrent L3,week-day g C2 f Overcurrent L1,Overcurrent L3,week-end g Step6 The 002nal step looks into the identi\002cation of anomalies  Anomalies Identi\002cation  Fig 1 Step6  In this step we consider again all the itemsets that were considered as potential anomalies in Step2 For each of them we cluster them and we look how well they 002t according to the clusters created with the previously clustered data For this last step to identify the goodness of 002t of the new itemsets we use the concept of clustering silhouette 23 Given an itemset i  a  i  represents the average dissimilarity between all the other itemsets in i s cluster Given all the other clusters  8 C j where i  2 C j   d  i Cj  represents the dissimilarity of i with all the itemsets in C j and b  i   min  d  i Cj  represents the minimal distance of itemset i to the nearest cluster The silhouette represents how well an element 002ts in its cluster s i  b  i  000 a  i  max  a  i   b  i  We can have three cases 017 s i  0  the itemset 002ts generally well into the cluster 017 s i 031 0  the itemset is clustered between two clusters 017 s i  0  the itemset is probably clustered in the wrong cluster that is from the silhouette de\002nition the itemset has higher dissimilarity with the elements of the belonging cluster than some nearby cluster When looking for anomalies we look for the third type of cases that is those in which the itemset does not 002t well in created clusters Furthermore we can set a threshold value for the silhouette In the next section we present the application of the approach to the Smart Meter data and we will also use a visual representation of the clustering silhouette to aid in anomalies identi\002cation V A PPLICATION WITHIN THE S MART G RIDS D OMAIN The 002rst consideration in analysing the Smart Meter data is about parameters 002ne-tuning Overall for the frequent itemset mining we need to de\002ne support 227proportion of transactions that contain a speci\002c itemset\227and con\002dence 227for association rules X   Y  the proportion of the transactions that contain both X and Y In the current analysis we used support 0  1 and con\002dence 0  8  Varying these parameters can bring a different number of itemsets considered in the initial steps A third relevant parameter is the number of clusters k  Unluckily the identi\002cation of the best number of clusters based on the underlying dataset can be computationally demanding and unfeasible for a large number of Smart Meters Sensitivity analysis can be used to optimize some clustering quality indicator but such approach does not scale up to larger number of itemsets In the current experimental section we used k  10  A last parameter is the threshold for the clustering silhoutte to determine the anomalies We set this parameter to 000 0  20  but such value does not need to be evaluated apriori and can be set by looking at the visual representation of the clustering silhouette  Running the approach on the dataset with 381 devices brings to a total of 364,107 overall events generated on the devices based on the 76 event types We map these events into 20,670 transactions associated to the 381 segments  Step1  Running the Apriori algorithm brings overall 273,829 nonunique itemsets  Step2  We can note how this is a large 2016 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics € SM\C 2016 | October 9-12, 2016 € Budapest, Hungary SMC_2016    002316 


number of itemsets due to the fact that at this stage the same itemset might appear in different transactions The next step goes into 002ltering the itemsets based on the condition that they are present in 025 2 segments considering the unique itemsets at this stage not anymore their association to a transaction This brings 44,450 unique itemsets that can be considered normal behaviour according to the discussion above  Step3  The list of itemsets at this stage is too large to give useful insights to a decision maker We can at this stage add more contextual information  Step4  Since we are considering unique events in Step3  by mapping back the events to the ones in the segment we increase the number of events as an event might happen under a different context This differentiates further two events and is conforming to the idea of augmenting the data points with contextual information In the current analysis we skipped this step but it is applicable with the assumption that the added contextual information is categorical or can be converted in such form We run then the clustering algorithm on the mapped events to create clusters of itemsets that are similar in terms of the identi\002ed categorical features  Step5  We use categorical clustering based on entropy minimization T o represent the clusters we use the Clusplot representation in which clusters are represented as ellipses after multi-dimensionality reduction by showing the two principal components After clustering has been completed we have a set of clusters that represent the way in which all the itemsets are mapped to each cluster To simplify the representation we show the categorical clustering with k  10 clusters performed on 681 itemsets for 17 devices as a subset of the whole dataset Fig 2 The size of the clusters shows the spread of the itemsets within the cluster and the shadowed area shows the density within clusters Clustered data represent the normal behaviour according to our initial assumptions However as noted in the previous section we can still see areas worth investigation like cluster nr 2 that is more spread apart compared to the others We run then the 002nal step  Step6  We now take back the itemsets that were not frequent in the original dataset  NMFI  We cluster each one of the new itemsets to see how well they 002t into the existing clusters based on MFI  If we look at the 002tting of different itemsets for the case of 17 devices we can represent each itemset according to the silhouette width Fig 3 We can see that some itemsets on the upper part of the plot  s i near 1  0  are 002tting better in the clusters On the bottom part those that have negative s i  As new itemsets are clustered according to Step6 of the approach we look for those that have negative s i  Based on the analysed data if we set a threshold of 000 0  20  we can identify the top-10 anomalies after running the overall approach Table I We report events that were detected as anomalies together with their s i silhouette value and a reference index i  In particular there are 002ve itemsets that might signal some forms of missing voltages associated with overcurrents itemset indexed 1  3  4  8  9  These are itemsets that can be worth further investigation by decision makers Fig 3 Lower part of the Clustering Silhouette 17 devices n=681 k=10 VI E VALUATION  D ISCUSSION There are several lessons learned from the application of the approach to anomaly detection in Smart Meters data We approached initially the problem from different angles but we found out that the most important aspect when considering anomalies is to provide a collective and contextual overview At least in the experimental project we described single point anomaly detection did not prove to be suf\002cient to determine anomalous events The addition of contextual information and the inclusion of an event type instance in relation to other event types instances proved to be a more powerful

an established ground truth As such the opinion of domain experts becomes very relevant it is however unrealistic to provide indicators such as false negatives and false positives due the vast amount of itemsets to review This makes the evaluation of the approaches dif\002cult to perform Running the project also allowed to identify several drawbacks of the approach These constitute an interesting list of requirements for the improvement of the implemented solution One of the drawbacks of the proposed approach is that we considered itemsets and not sequences That is we did not discriminate the order of events within itemsets both in frequent itemset mining and in clustering One of the aspects we are keen to explore is the usage of sequences for the segmentation part with a different algorithm to cluster sequences Together with experts opinions we might derive a comparison of several approaches Another consideration is about using the approach for online learning\227streaming data and real-time system behaviour This poses different issues than those considered in this paper but working towards the implementation of such a system can be useful to support the concept of 224smarter grids\224 Finally in this paper we did not explore in detail the usage of contextual information in the experimental part Given how the features have been built this is not a problem as long as numerical features are converted to categorical data We were considering also an initial phase in which domain experts could rule-out non-interesting or non-relevant event types However this initial phase can also be detrimental to the possibility to detect unexpected events VII C ONCLUSION Modern Smart Grids will permeate our lives in years to come While in their initial appearances data communication was mostly one-way we are now in the context of two-ways Smart Grids that can not only monitor but also 002ne-tune behaviour based on knowledge mining capabilities In this sense there is a growing need to introduce smarter behaviours in the infrastructure and a central role is played by Smart Meters as devices that can engage in two-way communications In this paper we evaluated an approach for anomaly detection in Smart Grids derived from data streamed from Smart Meters We proposed to approach the problem by taking into account the aspects of collective and contextual anomalies that can bring bene\002ts in building a wider set of dependencies among events derived from Smart Meters We presented the application of a proposed unsupervised contextual and collective detection approach to data streams from a large energy distributor in the Czech Republic to reason about different types of possible anomalies e.g over-voltages  under-voltages  We discussed the bene\002ts of the approach but also identi\002ed drawbacks that can lead to improvements towards the implementation of an online learning system In running the project we found several key needed characteristics the necessity to provide a constantly online-learning system scalable and that can support detection of unexpected events possibly leading towards a self-healing system R EFERENCES  X F ang S Misra G

 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation \(ICCCA2016   93     Fig. 7  Execution time of trie based Apriori on three different block distributions x-none In Fig   7, BD1 exhibits minimum execution time compared to BD2 and BD3 In BD1 blocks are located only on three DNs i.e two physical a nd one VMs DN So in this case Mappers are not running on both slower DNs tha t make the execution faster. Execution time for BD2 is poor than that o f BD1 due to using both VMs DNs  BD3 exhibits the worst performance since all the blocks are available on each DN MapReduce processes a data block locally on the DN where the block is present. F or block distribution BD3, all Mappers are running on the same DN since all blocks are locally available to each node In different attempt of running a job DN may be d ifferent each time but all the Mappers are being run on a same DN. All Mapper s running on the same DN does not make use of available resources which leads to increased execution time Here it can be seen that due to higher replication factor data locality may be a hurdle that slow down the execution  x-none E  Controlling Parallelism with Split Size x-none Hadoop is designed to process big datasets that does not mean one cannot be benefited for small datasets. Apriori is a CPU-intensive algorithm and consumes a significant time for smaller datasets. To reduce the execution time we need more than on e task running in parallel Split is used to control the number of map tasks for a MapReduce job A split may consist of multiple blocks and there may be multiple splits for a single block So without changing the block size user can control the number of Mappers to be run for a particular job We have used the method setNumLinesPerSplit\(Job job int numLines  of class NLineInputFormat  from MapReduce library to set the number of lines per split. In our earlier cases we were running multiple Mappers against different parts of the same block Here we set the split size 5K lines on block distribution BD3 which contains 5 data blocks This creates 12 splits i.e 12 Mappers  size for BD3 the n  blocks are considered as input s plits. Fig   8 shows the difference in execution time for these two cases  Here it can be seen that how the split size controls the parallelism Smaller split size launches more number of Mappers which consequently increase the parallelism. It does not mean that more number of Mappers always results into better performance. Increasing the number of Mappers beyond a particular point starts to degrade the performance due to unnecessary overheads and shortage of resources   To achieve the right level of parallelism it must be taken care that the map task is CPU-intensive or CPU-light as well as the size of dataset to be processed Fig. 8  Execution time of trie based Apriori with Input Split and without Input Split on BD3 x-none F  Issues Regarding MapReduce Implementation The efficiency of an algorithm running as a MapReduce job is extensively influenced by data structure used and algorithm itself A third factor that cannot be ignored is the implementation technique.  Implementation technique may be regarding to implementation of various modules of Apriori e.g candidate generation support counting of candidates against each transaction pruning of infrequent itemsets or regarding to MapReduce implementation of Apriori MapReduce implementation of Apriori is central to discussion here. A major issue in MapReduce based Apriori is to invoke candidate generation i.e apriori-gen  Algorithm 7 at appropriate place inside Mapper class. In our implementations we have invoked apriori-gen  inside customized method map of Mapper class. In Mapper class, two methods setup  and map  are customized and one method apriori-gen  is defined Method setup  is called once at the beginning of a task It is customized to read frequent itemsets of previous iteration from distributed cache and to initialize prefix tree Method apriori-gen  generates candidates using prefix tree containing frequent itemsets The map  is invoked for each line of input split of dataset If there are 100 lines of input assigned to a Mapper then map method will be invoked for 100 times Subsequently it invokes apriori-gen  repeatedly each time Since apriori-gen  method produces candidates which is independent of input instance, so need not to invoke repeatedly inside map  method The apriori-gen  metho d is  computation intensive and increases the execution time when invoked repeatedly. This repeated computation can be fixed if we invoke apriori-gen  outside of map  Theoretically it sounds good but did not work when invoked inside setup  method We have also tried another way in which apriorigen  is invoked inside overrided method run  of Mapper class but again could not achieve expected reduction in execution time VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper we have investigated a number of factors affecting the performance of MapReduce based Apriori algorithm on homogeneous and heterogeneous Hadoop

Figure 6 Throughput for increasing length rule candidates The Y-axis is measured in billion evaluations per second The X-axis shows the corresponding rule length As before the gures include the theoretical trend-line computed from amplifying naive-sc on the GPU using Eq 4 reason the observed improvement is stable depending mostly on the item number Assigning multiple candidate rule collections to a single block resulted in Figure 7 Percentage improvement in execution time as compared to the default-tpsc kernel for the individually optimized kernels when using synthetic data   Figure 8 Percentage improvement in execution time as compared to the default-tpsc kernel for the individually optimized kernels when using real data For both kernels we observe a similar behaviour when we increase rule candidate length to a number larger than 32 After that point we require evaluating the pre“x in two phases following a technique similar to parallel reduction although using warp vote functions This extra phase requires an additional synchronization step which increases the total execution time per iteration Additionally when we have prominent rules with item indices in sequence i.e accidents dataset as indicated by its sparsity pattern caching transactions does not provide any improvement However when there are many rules with out of sequence pre“xes the cost of uncoalesced memory accesses matches the synchronization cost as indicated by experiments on dataset 1 VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we studied the support count operation commonly used in association rule mining problems We proposed a work-ef“cient parallel algorithm that is suitable for massively parallel architectures Furthermore we presented a data layout scheme used to enable low overhead coordination of the processing elements reduce the memory requirements and achieve high off-chip memory bandwidth utilization Furthermore we discussed in detail low level optimization strategies related to effective use of shared memory while presenting a simple strategy for resolving shared memory bank con”icts incurring minimal additional work However there is still some additional issues that we need to address Firstly we already considering resolving the issue of

improvement over the default-tpsc execution time A combination of loop unrolling and increase shared memory utilization from storing more candidate rules in the same block was the reason for the observed improvement In contrast enabling caching of transactions in shared memory with kernel mrs-tpsc presented less improvement in the relative execution time compared to mr-tpsc The culprit is this case is the additional synchronization step which is required after loading the data in shared memory Finally experiments performed on dataset 2 and 4 indicate similar behavior to our previous experiments where multiprocessor underutilization was limiting the maximum possible performance increase Even in the case where we increase the workload of participating blocks interleaved execution of warps is limited since as the block size is small In this section we discuss the effects of discovering rules with length larger than 32 Due to lack of space we present the results from the execution on synthetic data 1 and accidents which are good representatives of the observed behaviour We focus on the mrs-tpsc and mr-tpsc variations which we established to be highly optimized throughout our experiments
