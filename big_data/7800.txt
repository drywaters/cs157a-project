I 204 Mining Frequent Itemsets from a transaction database is an very important and most widely used task for analyzing data in any business. It is the preliminary step to find the correlation between the items which are called Association Rules Closed Frequent Itemsets are the compact representation of the Frequent Itemsets which can save memory and time for large dense data. It is very challenging to mine Closed Frequent Itemsets in uncertain data streams due to concept drifts. This paper presents a detailed survey on various popular algorithms developed for mining closed frequent itemsets from data streams T The support S of an itemset X is defined as the number of transaction the itemset X present in the give list of transactions Minimum Support \(min_sup\is the support threshold where itemsets with support count below this threshold are considered 002 T and Y 2016 IEEE  I NTRODUCTION  Data Mining is an inter-disciplinary subject applied by many businesses such as health care, retail, manufacturing etc. for retrieving valuable information from the large amount of data which are used to make better business decisions. Finding frequently occurring patterns which are called Frequent Itemsets and correlations between different items/attributes which are called Association Rules are being used from many years by the business analysts and data scientists as they provide vital information about the business or any phenomenon. Association rules can also be used as base algorithms for Classification and Clustering of the data which are named as Associative Classification and Associative Clustering respectively In a dense and high dimension data, a large number of long frequent itemsets can be found. As per the Apriori Principle [1   all subsets of a frequent itemset are also frequent. So for an frequent itemset of length L there are 2L - 2 additional frequent itemsets. Mining all frequent itemsets from a large, dense and high dimension dataset will be very expensive in terms of memory and processing time Due to the downward closure property of the frequent itemsets, a large number of frequent sub-itemsets can be merged with their superset if their support is same as their superset thus reducing number of frequent itemsets to store and process. These supersets are called Closed Frequent Itemsets \(CFI\. Few of the most popular algorithm for mining CFIs have been discussed in the next subsection of this paper Many efficient algorithm for mining CFIs on both static and streaming data have been proposed. Conventional CFIs mining algorithm requires multiple pass over the data and needs complete dataset to be available to its disposal which cannot be satisfied by data streams. The mining algorithm used on data streams should process the data incrementally. Thus finding CFIs over data streams poses additional challenges than mining static data due its uncertainty nature In this paper, we have provided a detailed survey on the techniques used to mine CFIs over data streams.  This survey is not an exhaustive research on the every work carried out on the subject but considers popular algorithms developed since its inception till date The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides preliminary information about Frequent Itemsets Association Rules and Closed Frequent Itemsets. A detailed analysis on the previous work carried out on mining CFIs over data streams is provided in Section 3. In Section 4, the key findings of the survey is discussed.

Zaki and Ching-Jui Hsiao [2 p r o pos ed a n  efficient algorithm named CHARM for mining all CFIs from static data. The algorithm enumerates closed itemsets using Itemset and Tidset search tree called IT-Tree. They proposed a hybrid search method which skips levels of IT-Tree to quickly find the closed frequent itemsets which reduces the search time Vertical data representations are used to produce diffsets which helps in fast computation of frequencies of the itemsets However, for large datasets the system will run out of memory as the algorithm requires all CFIs to be present in the memory for checking closed itemsets Jianyong Wang, Jiawei Han and Jian Pei [3  p erf orm e d  extensive study on various strategies for efficient mining of CFIs and proposed CLOSET+ algorithm which integrates advantages of various other effective algorithms along the new strategies. It uses depth-first search strategy as it shrinks search space for long patterns. Horizontal format of data is used to avoid maintaining tidset which will be large and memory consuming for large databases. FP-Tree has been used as compression technique and a novel Hybrid Tree Project method which build bottom-up projection tree for dense data and top-down tree for sparse data The item skipping technique efficiently merges the itemsets to form closed frequent itemsets. Experimental results show that CLOSET+ is more memory and time efficient than CHARM Xin Ye, Feng We, Fan Jiang and Shaoyin Cheng p r o pos e d  NewCHARM which is the optimized version of CHARM. Along with CHARM, it uses checkset which to hold the tidset in bit format.

Recent techniques are focused on mining top K CFIs where user need not have mention minimum support but need to specify the K value. From our previous work on mining approximate frequent itemsets from data streams [2 w e  have observed that specifying an optimum minimum support threshold is not possible for an uncertain data stream. For lower minimum support threshold, we will find a very large number of frequent itemsets for dense data but none or very small number for sparse data. So either the algorithm should mine all CFIs or shall learn the value of minimum support threshold value from the data itself based density and drifting concepts Due to limited memory in the computational systems algorithms have been continuously improved for better memory utilization. Different data structures like tree, lattice, table form etc have been proposed. Since tree and lattice format compresses the original database to a large extent, traversing it is complex and time consuming. So hybrid method of using tree or lattice along with table format is preferred. The algorithm shall not require the complete list of CFIs to be in the memory for searching. Instead should adopt techniques to merge itemsets with acceptable approximation and develop an compact structure to quickly identify CFIs from latest transactions from data streams reducing the memory footprint and processing time To make the algorithms faster and memory efficient approximation, minimum length, maximum length of itemsets etc have been used to prune infrequent and uninterested itemsets. If the dimensionality of the data is uncertain then it will be difficult to specify the minimum and maximum length of the interested itemsets. The error introduced due to approximation will not be constant for all the itemsets for both dense and sparse data. The error will be more for less frequent sparse data bur less for frequent and dense data. So there is a need for an algorithm to use approximation with less error or specified acceptable error with uniform error distribution Big data has gained lot of focus in the recent years. Due to the wide use of internet enabled smart portable devices, increased deployment of Internet-of-Things \(IoT\etc has pushed several applications to process the high speed data stream in faster and distributed manner. Since big data analytics and distributed computing has gained focus from recent years, the algorithm for mining CFIs on high speed data from parallel different source shall be developed using distributed computing techniques. This also complicates the data structure used to store CFIs as it also needs to be distributed Last but not the least, the distributed data structure used to store CFIs from big data stream shall be queried in real-time. A distributed query processing framework shall be developed which can process user queries and return the result in real-time V 002 002 threshold are 002 002 002 002 002 002 002 Shah M.

But as the size and frequency of micro data generation increased like IoT, Retail transactions, GPS, Smart Phones etc, demand for faster and realtime data mining algorithm have raised. Businesses requires decision to be taken in real-time with change in nature of the business operations and customer preferences. These demands can be fulfilled by mining data streams as they arrive before storing in the persistent storage 546 Experimented on Big Data context where the algorithm is tested on itemset and their support values Error gets introduced due to timely deletion of low density itemsets which can be improved to increase the accuracy of the closed frequent         1   1    1          Itemsets are stored in lattice format

Also data stream mining algorithms can be used on static data directly by reading the static data record by record as stream. But it is not possible to use any algorithm designed for static data mining to mine streaming data directly In this paper, we have performed a detailed analysis of the important techniques used till date to mine CFIs from uncertain continuous data streams and analyzed their advantages and limitations. Also the applicability of these algorithm for parallel and distributed computing environment to mine big streaming data is studied. From this study, few major research gaps have been identified and discussed in detail.

The architecture enables discovery or interesting patterns with data from different domains related to Telecom Network Monitoring. The architecture is composed of five sub-modules: Data Analyzer, Mining Controller, Data Miner, Combiner, and Episode Analyzer. Each sub-module is described in detail along with implementation approach  functions in turn. The approach leverages and combines frequent itemset discovery over data streams, association rule learning, frequent sequential pattern mining, and frequent temporal pattern mining techniques while also making use of distributed processing platforms to achieve high-volume throughput. To test the functionality of the model, three classic pattern mining algorithms, namely, NewMoment PrefixSpan, and HTPM, are implemented Their performances are compared in terms of different parameter settings by executing the algorithms with a simulated streaming dataset Fig.10

LI et al  PRIVACY-PRESERVING-OUTSOURCED ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ON VERTICALLY PARTITIONED DATABASES 1859 the publication of this seminal work a number of privacypreserving association rule mining or frequent itemset mining solutions have been published in the literature see 11   1 3   28]–[31 The most relevant work is the privacy-preserving association rule mining solution presented in I n t hi s s ol ut i on a d at a owner known as the master is responsible for the mining The other data owners known as slaves insert ctitious transactions to their respectiv e datasets and send the datasets to the master Each data owner will also send his set of real transactions IDs to a semi-trusted third-party server The third-party server is assumed not to be colluding with any data owner but it cannot be trusted to hold the raw data The master generates association rule candidates from the joint database containing ctitious data For each rule candidate X  Y  the master sends the ID lists of the transactions containing X  Y and the transactions containing X to the third-party server The server veriﬁes if the rule is qualiﬁed or not Similar to our solutions a semi-trusted third-party is utilized for the mining However unlike our solutions a data owner i.e the master does the majority of the computational work Therefore we can hardly say that such a solution is an outsourced mining solution Though ctitious data are added in datasets to lower data usability the master is able to learn signiﬁcant information about other data owners raw data from the received datasets In cont rast our solutions do not leak such information as we do not rely on one particular data owner to undertake the computations and we also encrypt the datasets All existing solutions with the exception of  d

owners resulting in the leakage of information about the data owners raw data  The only exception is one of s s o l u t i ons  I n  13 t here are two privacy-preserving solutions for frequent itemset mining The rst solution exposes exact supports which is not desirable The second solution does not expose exact supports However association rules cannot be mined based on the result of second solution because conﬁdences cannot be computed without the exact supports In addition this solution’s method cannot be used to mine association rules because securely computing conﬁdence is more complicated than computing support In comparison with this solution our frequent itemset mining solution’s computational complexity is signiﬁcantly lower Our solutions do not expose exact supports or conﬁdences to data owners Different from existing solutions based on homomorphic encryption we use symmetric homomorphic encryption instead of asymmetric homomorphic encryption and the manner in which we use homomorphic encryption also differs from existing solutions In our approach we use homomorphic encryption to create ERVs and build our secure outsourced comparison scheme B Privacy-Preserving

and returns the result frequent itemsets and their supports to the data owner The data owner revises these itemsets supports by subtracting them with these itemsets corresponding occurrence counts in the ctitious transactions respectively Finally the data owner decrypts the received itemsets with the revised supports higher than the frequency threshold an d generates association rules based on

this paper our adversary model is different We assume the cloud has knowledge of the item frequencies instead of chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs and our solutions are resilient to frequency analysis

solution for vertically partitioned databases This allows the data owners to outsource mining task on their joint data in a privacy-preserving manner privacypreserving manner Based on this solution we built a privacypreserving outsourced association rule partitioned databases Our solutions protect data owner’s raw data from other data owners and the cloud Our solutions also ensure the privacy of the mining results from the cloud Compared with most existing solutions our solutions leak less information about the data owners raw data Our evaluation has also demonstrated that our solutions are very efﬁci ent therefore our solutions are suitable to be used by data owners wishing to outsource their databases to the cloud but require a high level of privacy without compromising on performance To realize our solutions an efﬁcient homomorphic encryption scheme and a secure outsourced comparison scheme were presented in this paper Both schemes have potential usage in other secure computation applications such as secure data aggregation beyond the data mining solutions described in this paper Demonstrating the u tility of the p roposed homomorphic encryption scheme and outsourced comparison scheme in other settings will be the focus of future research A PPENDIX I NSERTING F ICTITIOUS T RANSACTIONS  s A LGORITHM  An algorithm to counter frequency analysis attacks on the outsourced database encrypted with a substitution cipher was proposed in F or the purpos e o f c oncealing t he item frequency this algorithm inserts ctitious transactions in the database to be oursourced The goal is to ensure that each item share the same frequency with at least k  1 items The algorithm is summarized as follows also see  Firstly the data owner scans the database to count each individual item’s support  Secondly the data owner groups items considering the supports and co-occurrence of items The data owner sorts items in decreasing order of support Starting from the rst of the sorted item list i.e the item with the highest support the data owner assigns every k adjacent items to a new created group If there are less than k unassigned items remaining these items will be assigned to the last created group The data owner swaps items from different groups to ensure that all items in the same group do not occur together in the same transaction  Thirdly for each item in each group the data owner calculates the difference between the item’s support and the highest support in the group The difference is deﬁned as the noise of the item  Fourthly to achieve k anonymity frequency the data owner generates ctitious transactions based on the result of the third step The number of an item’s occurrences in the ctitious transactions is equal to its noise calculated in the third step After inserting the ctitious transactions all items in the same group share the same support A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Quach Vinh Thanh the Associate
