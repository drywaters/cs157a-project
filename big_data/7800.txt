Let it move down along the path ofmeasuring attributes level by level When it reaches a leaf node the maximum classification of the leaf would be the classification prediction of the unknown data Moreover every path that originates from the root to a leaf gives rise to a classification rule A set of such mles makes a decision table which is also a frequently-used method in prediction C Associo~ion Rules Association Rules analysis[3 41 aims at discovering the hidden relationship within a data set Frequently occurring patterns and unusual patterns are identified by iteratively scanning the data set, with the results cast into a number of rules that take a form such as 224 X  I\222 224 or 223If X Then Y\224 More formally let I  11 In  I be the set of several nominal attributes Each attribute is called an Item A data record in the data set can be represented by an n-dimensional vectOr This Yeclor B Decision Trees Decision trees are the most popular model in classification analysis for the mined results can be conveniently visualized with a tree structure providing the user with knowledge that is easy to undentand[7J.

Data was mainly collected from the collecting points located in the intersections Two types of indices are used, listed as follows 12 151 4 Static indices 3 Parking Conditions 9 Phase Plan 4 Dynamic Indices These indices have numeric values that change with time  Volume by Movement vh  Percent Heavy Vehicles  9 Ratio of Parking 9 Operating Speed hh  Peak Hour Factor 3 Cycle Length s 3 Green lime s 3 Split The information about the static indices can be acquired from the government\222s traffic administration department whereas the dynamic indices can be measured with the help of electronic devices \(e.g vehicle detectors etc A dynamic index is usually measured in a time interval. ranging from 5 minutes to 30 minutes a shorter interval is selected if it is in peak hours or in a period in which traffic varies with time frequently Besides intersections lo which the above indices apply other types of mad segments also need to be considered They include interchanges roundabouts tunnels etc Both types of indices in the above can still be applied here so long as the intersection-specific attributes are not used These indices have values that are fixed or relatively stable in B period of time IV BUILDING THE PREDICTION MODEL Z AreaType 3 Number ofLanes 4 Predicrion arfribures and Prediction model 3 LaneWidth\(m Z The purpose of building the prediction model is to be able to predict the traffic flow status in the next period of time by processing and analyzing historical and current data blost ofthe time it is of little meaning to get an accurate Exclusive Left-turn Lane or Right-tum Lane and Length of Storage Bay for Left-tum Lane or Right-turn Lane Association Rules Constrains sct Dynamic data   __  0\221 Fig 3  Structure oftht Prediction Model on a Collecting pint 398 


Level of Service A B D I 36-55 F l EO E 55-80 Level of Senice is discrete rhus more macroscopic in a sense dependent upon traffic conditions road conditions and signal conditions It will he taken as the main prediction index value in the model A map from thc six classes Level of Senk to numbers I to 6 can he huilt 221er easily therehy preserving the sequence information of the traffic flou status and making ii more convenient for the model to process After the prediction index is determined thc traffic flow status prediction model of a single collecting point in the region can be constructed In essence this model is a compound BP neural network with decision trees constraints and association rules constraints as shown in Fipre  It not only predicts the trafic flow status in the next period through dynamic indices but also takes into account the relationships between dynamic and static indices and sequential panems in the data of the whole region which is to amend the prediction results So compared with the pditional neural network prediction model our model is more reasonable and accurate E Predictin C/ass Muork The predicting class neural network focuses on the real-time prediction of the Level of Senice which is very important to the whole model Its input is the Level of Service in time period I_ obtained from the real-time volumes collected at the collecting point And it outputs the prediction of the Level of Senice in period I which is S  One thing worth mentioning is that the incoming Level of Service is related not only to the current Level of Service directly but also to the collecting points all around to a reat estent So it seems not very reliable to get a prediction from data coming from only this point A common solution is to feed the real-time data collected from the point to predict and its neighboring points that are directly connected into the input layer For regions in which network connections are relatively complex or the collecting points are close to each other data from those 4\\.erage Slopped Delav\(s/i lo 17 20 indirectly connected points can also be fed into the input layer The structure and the corresponding parameters of the prediction class neural network need to be determined in advance Some historical data are needed to train the network Through the error feedback mechanism the weights of all links between the neurons become reasonable As the network converges and becomes stable its structure can be saved and used to predict dynamic changes of the Level of Service For the correctness of the prediction the training data set must contain a large amount of data typically it should span at least I to 3 months to make it statistically significant C Decision Trees C&.rrrainls Se1 The prediction class network only predicts the Level of Senice from the Level of Sensice itself and takes no consideration about the influence from those static indices For instance in cenain periods of time changes in parking conditions and bus operation can affect the Le\\,el of Sewice near the collecting point To analyze this type of influences decision trees are used First select several sets of static indices Multiple traininp data sets are thus constructed hy combining the data of a set of static indices in period f for the static attributes wlues can still change in some situations\and the Level of Service in period I Each training set generates a decision tree TA which takes the Level of Service as the classification attribute to examine the influences from different combinations of static indices Then these decision trees are saved into a set DTsef  I\224 Ti  which is called a Decision Trees Constraints Set  The mechanism of the decision trees constraints set can be described as follows In eveiy data collection period the time period information and the static indices data are imported to decision tree constraints seL Each.decision tree could generate a Level of Service prediction of next period because of the prediction ability of the trees Then these predictions are compared with the result of prediction class network and convened to correctors lo the network prediction Formally a corrector is defined as v\222,AJ w,,\(fn Px where Pn is the prediction from the i-th decision tree and PN is the prediction from the prediction class network w is the weight tied to the i-th decision tree All w,\222s are initiated equally that is a11 decision trees have the same correcting influence to network prediction Once the real Level of Sen,ice in next period is collected all w would be adjusted gradually by the error feedback from the correcting class network The more accurate a corrector is the more the corresponding w will increase Decreasing can also take place Once the weight of cenain decision tree continues to decrease and falls below certain threshold the 222 222 399 


tree will be removed from the decision tree constraints set for it has only negative effect on correcting prediction The constraints set is thus a dynamic set Trees of higher quality remain and lower quality ones are washed out New members will be generated periodically to keep dynamic update D Associalion Rules Consmints Set The idea and hnction of an association rules consmints set is similar lo a decision tree constraints set They differ in that the association rules constraints set takes into account the influences from dynamic indices at the collecting point and its neighbors rather than those from the static indices as the decision trees do One example is that when the data of all collecting points around a main street that links a city to its suburb shows that the number of heavy vehicle increases the percentage of heavy vehicles on this main street will also increase and the Level of Service of this street will be affected So a data set can be constructed by combining the dynamic indices data of the current collecting point and its neighbors in period 1 with the Level of Service data of the current collecting point in period t+I thereby generating association rules from historical data If the association rules are expected to conshain the Level of Senke then it needs to make certain constraints in rules generation In other words it is to find out every association rule Ri with the form X a S IC  which satisfies c  Count\(SUS   c m  and s  COund.YUS  shn This avoids the generation of those useless rules and saves computing resources by setting conditions while generating candidate itemsets in the association rule algorithm 41 Those generated rules form the association rules constraints set ARsef   R  It is a dynamically updated rules table in essence And its function in constraining is similar to the decision trees constraints set E Correcfing Class Nenvork The use of the correcting class neural network is to compare the corrected Level of Service S  with the real Level of Service S  collected from the next c?cle By propagating errors it adjusts the weight Wn of the raw prediction result from the predicting class network the weight W of the correction from the decision trees constraints set, and the weight W of the correction from the association rules constraints set These weights represent the degree of their intluence on the final prediction result There is a Structural uncerlainty in prediction of neural networks that is many trials of their structures and parameters need to be done before the best network appears Factors like the size and distribution of the training set and the way networks are trained will influence the correctness of the predicting class network If the predictins class network is well trained then S will be greatly dependent on S and W and W will turn to be very CO""f\(S 5 Level of Service small in this situation But if there is quite some difference between S and S,r W and W,w ill be increased The target of placing the correcting class network is to compensate the falling accuracy in case of a terriblytrained predicting class network F The prediction ability of this model at a collecting point depends on the way the training historical data is constructed If the prediction of the Level of Service after n periods is needed a training data set that consists of the static and dynamic indices value the Level of Service in period t and the Level of Service in period t+n should be joined together Thus the trained model could reveal the variation of the Level of Service with an n-periods interval If predictions of variant intervals are needed there is a need to train and save multiple models The collected data of all collecting points in the region should be saved to a central data warehouse AI1 components of the prediction model are in general updated through historical data with a fixed time interval say one month The model thus represents the up-to-date tratiic flow panem all the time Besides the periodic update the model should be updated or even reconsuucted once the arc events like road construction and maintenance etc in the legion Ertending and Updating

indices mentioned in section 3 yere collected fmm the main intersections of a certain metropolitan area in Shanghai 90?6 of the data were used as historical data to train the model- and the model took the remainins lO?6 s unseen set to predict their states oftraific tlow and the Level ofSrrvice in the next period In this application the association rules constmints set was used to analyze the dynamic indices of one intersection and its neighboring ones Then the decision trees constraints set was used to take into account the inkluences of the static indices The above two steps could be regarded as a kind of data pre-processing When the processing was finished the data was then imported to the two-phase-neural networks for training Table 1 Training data distribution 3.1-V 10.7-19.5

Also a correcting class network is set up to correct prediction errors.

CONCLUSIONS This paper derives a Bayesian procedure for track association that can solve a large scale distributed tracking problem where many sensors track many targets. When noninformative prior of the target state is assumed, the single target test becomes a chi-square test and it can be extended to the multiple target case by solving a multidimensional assignment problem. With the noninformative prior assumption, the optimal track fusion algorithm can be a biased one where the regularized estimate has smaller mean square estimation error. A regularized track fusion algorithm was presented which modifies the optimal linear unbiased fusion rule by a less-than-unity scalar. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed track association and fusion algorithm through a three-sensor two-target tracking scenario 7. REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and W. D.

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
