Knowledge Discovery from Databases on the Semantic Web Bryan Scotney and Sally McClean School of Computing and Information Engineering, University of Ulster bw.scotney, si.mcclean }@ulster.ac.uk Abstract We provide a flexible me thod for Knowledge Discovery from semantically heterogeneous data, based on the specification of ontology mappings from the local data sources to pre-existing \(superior\ ontologies in an ontology server.  We also provide an innovative method for the construction of a Dynamic Shared Ontology; data the Kullback-Leibler information divergence using the EM 
algorithm. The new knowledge learned by this process is potentially richer than any of the contributing data sources We also show how the approach may be extended to Knowledge Discovery from a number of database attributes; association rules or Bayesian Belief Networks may then be induced. An architecture for a KDD system in such an environment is described; this is an extension of a previous architecture for distributed data processing that we have already implemented 1. Background We are concerned with the integration of data that have heterogeneous classification schemes where local ontologies, in the form of such classification schemes, may 
be mapped onto each other; this is frequently achieved via a superior ontology such as an internationally recognised classification. Thus the user may specify an ontology that is familiar/interesting to him, the system may utilise a superior ontology, which the user maps his ontology to and the data provider may utilise a third ontology which is also mapped to the superior ontology. In such situations metadata, describing the various ontologies in the system and mappings between these ontologies are used to describe the native data in the heterogeneous databases 
The mappings, which are generally provided ab initio by the databases owners, are described by correspondence matrices When the system is searching for new rules, we first construct a dynamic shared ontology DSO\ analysing trices to determine the derivable granularity after integration. This phase, which involves constructing the DSO, can be thought of as Metadata Integration where the metadata take the form of ution of such ontological conflicts remains an important problem for database integration and 
for Knowledge Discovery in Databases Once the metadata have been integrated, the aggregate data, in the form of summaries, are then integrated by minimisation of the Kullback-Leibler information divergence using the EM \(Expectation-Maximisation algorithm. The EM algorithm provides an intuitive approach to the integration of aggregates. A significant contribution of this paper in extending our previous work 6, 9  i s  t h at w e n o l ong er n eed t o s p eci fy on t o l ogy mappings to a global ontology; instead, dynamic shared ontologies are computed on-the-fly. This approach 
provides a way of mapping ontologies that is appropriate to the Semantic Web, and which is much more flexible than previous centralised approaches. In previous work w e have used the EM algorithm for the related problem of aggregation of imprecise and uncertain information for knowledge discovery in databases Finally we show how the approach may be extended to Knowledge Discovery using the Cartesian product of a number of attributes; association rules or Bayesian Belief Networks may then be induced. An architecture for a KDD system in such an environment is also described; this is an 
extension of a previous architecture for distributed data processing that has been implemented as part of the EUfunded MISSION project [8 Our problem has a unique maximum likelihood solution in that the Dynamic Shared Ontology is defined as the finest level of granularity that is derivable from the contributing ontologies. Our problem differs from that in  h ere a co m m o n on tolog y  is deriv ed t h at can  t h e n  be used for querying. Such a common ontology is not dynamic 2. Definitions Definition 2.1 
An ontology is defined as the Cartesianproduct of a number of attributes, along with their corresponding classifications Definition 2.2 Two ontologies are defined to be semantically equivalent en their respective classifications \(domain values Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Sci entific and Statistical Database Management \(SSDBM\22204 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00 \251 2004 IEEE 


Definition 2.3 An ontology, together with a set of counts for each element in the Cartesian-product of the classifications in the ontologies, comprises a multidimensional contingency table  The product or join\ two classifications P and Q is the coarsest partition that is finer than both P and Q. The sum or meet\ two classifications P and Q is the finest partition that is coarser than both P and Q. The relationship between two classifications may be described by a correspondence matrix [2 in w h ic h a 1 repres en ts a nts the absence of such a mapping. We use the term micro class for an element of a product classification and the term macro class for an element of a sum classification Definition 2.4 A combination of two classifications C 1 and C 2 is a classification whose classes are subsets of the macro classes in the sum of C 1 and C 2 and supersets of the micro classes in the product of C 1 and C 2  In what follows, we develop an approach that seeks to integrate aggregate views that are heterogeneous with respect to classifications by computing the richest ontology that can be derived from the contributing ontologies. This we call the Dynamic Shared Ontolog y \(DSO\which provides terminology for the query response. Mappings from the local data source ontologies to the DSO allow semantic integration to be carried out. The DSO may be at the granularity of the product of the classifications or at a granularity that is intermediate between that of the product and that of the contributing ontologies. Our aim here is to answer the query at the finest \(richest\ranularity possible using the data sources available. In many cases this will be g ontologies, thus providing a superstructure for the discovery of new knowledge Definition 2.5 An ontology O 1 is said to be refined by another ontology O 2 if O 1 and O 2 can be combined to provide a derivable classification finer than O 1 The refined ontology is denoted by O = O 1 001 O 2  The correspondence matrices identify how the local ontologies, via their classifications, map onto other ontologies these mappings can be stored in an ontology server. Typically local ontologies map onto one of a number of standard \(or superior\tologies, which then map onto each other. We can then chain these mappings to provide mappings from local ontologies to the Dynamic Shared Ontology. A query involving multiple datasets may thus be answered using the Dynamic Shared Ontology that is created by the algorithm described in Section 3. The creation of the DSO involves analysis of the correspondence matrices to determine the derivable granularity after integration 3. Metadata Integration - DSO A query is issued using an ontology O Q C Q1 x\203x C Qm  where C Q1 203, C Qm are the classifications relating to attributes \(concepts\A 1 203, A m that are of interest to the user. O Q is the user's chosen language of discourse The data used to answer this query are then from those datasets in the system that adhere to ontologies that are semantically equivalent to O Q Thus we answer the query using datasets that have classifications that we can map onto the relevant classifications in O Q ese mappings, we may be able to refine the classification in O Q using the classifications in C i for one or more of the available datasets DS i i = 1, ..., m\, thus providing new knowledge in the form of richer \(finer grained\owledge than would be obtainable from any of the contributing datasets individually. Typically, the user might create an ontology O Q by mapping to the \(superior\tology Server ontology O S and the Data Providers D 1 and D 2 may have mapped their data \(with ontologies O 1 and O 2 respectively to O S The system needs to construct an ontology of discourse \205 the DSO - and carry out the mappings accordingly The algorithm Ontint that refines the contributing ontologies to the DSO proceeds by iterating through the classifications of each ontology to identify if a classification can be used to refine O Q the query ontology to form a richer DSO; this is called classification refinement If any classification of the current ontology can refine a classification of the DSO \(initially this is O Q en ontology refinement can be achieved; in this case we update the classifications and correspondence matrices refine classification C 1 by C 2 for each macro category of the sum of C 1 and C 2 we first test if refinement is possible for that macro category; such refinement is possible if the number of non-zero elements in that macro category of the correspondence matrix is less than macrosum where macrosum is the sum of the number of values \(from C 1 and C 2 the corresponding macro category. For each macro category, the labels from C 1 are added to the refined classification C, if they cannot be refined further. If a new element can be added to C corresponding to a label from C 2 then this is done next Finally, the new value labels that are intersections of a value from C 1 and a value from C 2 are added to the refined ontology  Once we have computed the DSO and correspondence matrices, metadata integration is complete; the next stage which we discuss in Section 4, is to integrate the aggregate data at a level of detail prescribed by the DSO 4. Data Integration We now develop an algorithm that allows us to integrate different aggregates, or aggregate views, where the data exhibit semantic heterogeneity. The approach, which Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Sci entific and Statistical Database Management \(SSDBM\22204 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00 \251 2004 IEEE 


integrates the aggregates by minimisation of the KullbackLeibler information divergence using the EM algorithm, is scalable to any number of databases. The EM \(ExpectationMaximisation\ algorithm is a widely used general class of iterative procedures used for learning in the presence of missing information ou r cas e, th e problem  m a y  be shown to belong to a general class termed Linear Inverse Problems \(LININPOS\y Vardi and Lee Su ch problems may not in general have a unique solution however, we will show that, in our case, the process of reduction to the Dynamic Shared Ontology is guaranteed to lead to uniqueness. We integrate the aggregates to give probabilities of each class in the Dynamic Shared Ontology; such probabilities may then be further processed for knowledge discovery, e.g., via association rules or Bayesian Belief Networks. However, if required, we can easily use the same framework to integrate cardinalities instead of probabilities, by scaling accordingly Notation 4.1 We consider a DSO with domain D  v 1 v k  lues for attribute A s of the classification schemes. Then for aggregate data views V r  r = 1, \203, m the domain D is partitioned into sets, or classes  r1 S 203 r rg S   where n rs is the cardinality of set S rs each partition represents a classification. Here g r is the number of classes in the classification for attribute A in aggregate data view V r  We further define 002 003 004 005  otherwise0 S vif1 rsi irs q and f r 000\002 s 000\002  000\002 n r 000\002 s N \(the proportion of values within the entire data collection\, where N 006\006  m 1r g 1j rj r n 000\002 the total cardinality The matrix Q r q irs is the correspondence matrix that relates the classification of V r to the DSO Definition 4.1 The Kullback-Leibler information divergence between two distributions p = \(p 1 203, p n d q = \(q 1 203, q n  is defined as log   j jj 006  qppqpD j Definition 4.2 The aggregate integration operator from a number of aggregate data views V 1 203 V m derives probabilities 007 1 203 007 k for values of attribute A, and is denoted aggint It is defined as a vector-valued function aggint  V 1 203 V m   007 1 203 007 k  where the 007 I 220s are computed from the iterative scheme k 1 ifor m 1r k 1u urs 1 u irs g 1=s r 1 i  i r 006\006 006  212\212  qqf n s nn 007 007 007 1 Here 007 i is the probability of value v i for i = 1, \203, k for the integrated aggregate view in the Dynamic Shared Ontology. Where the data are crisp, i.e., if we are trying to determine v i from a singleton set  i v  rs S of aggregate V r  then the contribution to 007 i is simply f rs Otherwise, if  i v is a proper subset of rs S we apportion the proportion f rs to 007 i where v i 005 rs S in the proportion 007 i  006 005 rsj Sv j 007  The iteration equations \(1\at define the aggint operation minimise the Kullback-Leibler information divergence between the aggregated probabilities 007 i and the data  rs f This is equivalent to maximising the likelihood of the model given the data. When the distributed aggregates are summarised under the DSO, the iterative scheme defined by equations \(1\as a unique solution. The scheme always converges to a set of feasible probabilities \(i.e., between 0 and 1 and summing to 1 5. Knowledge Discovery and KDD Architecture In the previous sections we have described a methodology for integrating metadata and data from semantically heterogeneous databases based on a single attribute However, for Knowledge Discovery we are usually interested in considering a number of attributes simultaneously: our current approach readily extends to a Cartesian product of attributes using the concept of a datacube, as follows Definition 5.1 An additive summary function b is a set function the maps a set onto the integers or real numbers such that for two disjoint sets S 1 and S 2  b S 1 t S 2  b S 1  b S 2  Definition 5.2 A datacube D consists of the Cartesian product of attributes A 1 203, A n with corresponding classifications C 1 203, C n along with additive summary functions b 1 203 b k We restrict the definition to a single additive summary function b  which aggregates by counting the number of values in a subset of the Cartesian product Since the aggregation operator aggint allows us to compute joint probabilities for any combination of attributes, we may therefore use it to assess the validity of any rules of this type. Thus, if we wish to examine the rule A 1  A r n B 1  B s where A 1  A r  B 1  B s are all attributes of a relation R  then we compute the joint probabilities Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Sci entific and Statistical Database Management \(SSDBM\22204 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00 \251 2004 IEEE

3 REPRESENTATION Causal representation is an underdeveloped question The representation used constrains and supports the methods that can be used Several representations have been proposed 3.1 Graphs Some authors have suggested that sometimes it is possible to recognize causal relations through the use of directed graphs \(digraphs\[Pearl 19911 Spirtes 19931 In a digraph the vertices correspond to the variables and each directed edge corresponds to a causal influence Diagraphs are not cyclic the same node in the graph cannot be visited twice An exam ple is shown in Figure 3 Pearl 2000 and Spirtes 2001 use a form of digraphs called DAGS for representing causal relationships 3 Figure 3 a An example digraph DAG b ample insranrioting a drinking alcohol education J Salary Figure 4 Cyclic cnusol relorionships Sometimes cycles exist For example a person\222s family medical history influences both whether they are depressive and whether they will have some diseases. Drinking alcohol combined with the genetic predisposition to certain disease in fluences whether the person has a particular disease which then influence depression which in tum may influence the person\222s drinking habits Figure 4 shows the cyclic digraph for this example Developing directed acyclic graphs from data is computa tionally expensive The amount of work increases geometri cally with the number of attributes For constraint based methods, the reader is directed to Pearl 2000 Spirtes ZOOO Silverstein 1998 and Cooper 1997 For Bayesian discou very the reader is directed to Heckerman I9951 and Geiger 119951 Quantitatively describing the relationships between the nodes can be complex One possible general model is an extension of what can be found in Rehder 2002 shown in Figure 5 The state value is 1/0 as an event either happens or does not E m Fizure 5 Rehder\222s quanrirative relarimship between digraph nodes c  PfD m  rhe probabiliry rhr when D iF presenl the causal mechanism brings obour E b  the probobiliry rhal some other unspecified causal mechanism brings abour E b Figure 6 Figure 5 applied ion 223bird\224 cmmple 3.2 Probabilify And Decision Trees Various forms of root initiated tree-like graphs have been suggested Shafer 19961 Among them are Probability trees: Have a probability for every event in every situation and hence a probability distribution and expected value for every variable in every situation 221Decision trees Trees in which branching probabilities are supplied for some while others are unknown An example of these is Martingale trees A tree is a digraph starting from one vertice, the root In this case, the vertices represent situations Each edge repre sents a particular variable with a corresponding probability Time ordering of the variables is represented via the levels in the tree The higher a variable is in the tree the earlier it is in time This can become ambiguous for networked repre sentations i.e., when a node can have more than two parents and thus two competing paths and their imbedded time se quences By evaluating the expectation and probability changes among the situations or nodes in the tree one can decide whether the two variables are causally related 3.3 First Order Logic Hobbs 2000 uses first-order logic to represent causal rela tionships One difficulty with this approach is that the epre sentation does not allow for any gray areas. For example if an event occurred when the wind was blowing east how could a wind blowing east-northeast be accounted for The causality inferred may be incorrect due to the representation\222s rigidity Nor can first order logic deal with dependencies that arc only sometimes true. For example sometimes when the wind blows hard a tree falls This kind of sometimes event description can possibly be statistically described Altema tively, a qualitative fuzzy measure might be applied Another problem is recognizing differing effect strengths For example if some events in the causal complex are more 688 The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 


strongly tied to the effect Also it is not clear how a rela tionship such as the following would be represented a causes j3 some of the time j3 causes a some of the time other times there is no causal relationship 4 EPILOGUE Causality occupies a central position in human common sense reasoning In particular it plays an essential role in common sense human decision-making by providing a basis for choosing an action that is likely to lead to a desired result Whether recognizing causality can be done at all has been a speculation for thousands of years At the same time in our daily lives we make the conimonsense observation that causality exists Carrying this commonsense observation further, the concem is how to computationally recognize a causal relationship Data mining holds the promise of extracting unsuspected information from very large databases Methods have been developed to build association rules Association rules indi cate the strength of association of two or more data attributes In many ways the interest in association rules is that they offer the promise or illusion of causal or at least predictive relationships However association rules only calculate a joint Occurrence frequency not causality There are several open questions across all types of association rules A funda mental question is determining whether or not recognizing an association can,lead to recognizing a causal relationship A particular interest is in determining when causality can be said to be stronger or weaker Either in the case where the causal strength may be different in two independent relation ships or where in the case where two items each have a causal relationship on the other Causality is a central concept in many branches~of science and philosophy In a,way the term causality is like truth  a word with many meanings and facets Some of the defini tions are extremely precise Some of them involve a style of reasoning best be supported by fuzzy logic Defining and representing causal and potentially causal rela tionships is necessary to using machine-based methods A graph consisting of a collection of directed edges will most likely not offer a sufficiently rich representation Representa tions that embrace some aspects of imprecision are necessary A deep question is when anything can be said to cause any thing else And if it does, what is the nature of the causality There is a strong motivation to attempt causality discouvery in association rules The research concern is how to best ap proach the recognition of causality or non-causality in asso ciation rules Or if there is to recognize causality as long as association rules are the result of secondary analysis REFERENCES 0 Chatin I 9871 Algorithmic Information Theory Cambridge University Press Cambridge United Kingdom G Chatin I9901 A Random Walk In Arithmetic New Scientist 125 n 1709 March 1990 44-66 G Cooper I9971 A Simple Constraint-Based Algorithm for Efficiently Mining Observational For Causal Relationships in Doto Mining and Knowledge Discouvery v 1 n 2,203-224 D Geiger D Heckerman I9951 A Characterization Of The Dirichlet Distribution With Application To Leaming Bayesian Networks in Pro ceedings of the 11 Conference on Uncerrainry in AI Montreal Quebec 196-207.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
