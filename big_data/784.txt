attention for military and nonmilitary application in the recent years. Information fusion technique combines data from multiple sensors, and related information to achieve improved accuracies and more specific inferences than those could be achieved by the use of a single sensor alone.[1-3  Information fusion methods have many kinds, such as Bayes decision theory, Kalman filter method, fuzzy reasoning and neural network fusion etc. Kalman filter[4-6 m an  f ilter is used to fuse dynamic sensor information in real time. The method decides the best fusion data estimate of statistical meaning with statistical recursiveness of measure m  If the system has linear dynamical model and the noise of system and sensor is white noise model with Gaussian distribution, Kalman filter can provide unique best estimate of 
statistical meaning. Fuzzy reasoning and Kalman fiter are used to fuse the location data of an autonomous robot. The fuzzy kalman filter is designed II  L OCATION S YSTEM OFAN A UTONOMOUS R OBOT  Move-in-mud robot is a kind of robot which is used in the wreck salvages. It can excavate the hole according to the planed path automatically. At the same time, move-in-mud robot also can be used in excavating a hole on the land. Therefore, the study of move-in-mud robot has the broad application prospect A  Structure of Move-in-mud Robot Based on the analysis of autonomous underwater operation vehicle and snake-like mini-robot, and studying on the

Electronic compass is fixed on the back part of the robot. The measure of azimuth and rolling angle is used to accomplish the supervision of robot\222s attitude. The pitch angle is the attitude angle of the robot, which is used to calculate the location of robot. The depth sensor is a pressure transforming exchanger which is linked together with a water pipe parallel with a complex pipe. The measurement of the robot\222s depth is accomplished by the pressure changes affecting in the water pipe The move-in-mud robot moves forwards by squirming means. In the process of move-in-mud robot\222s squirm, the pitching angle of move-in-mud head changes small. So the dispersion of the attitude angle between before and after the squirm is small. In fact, the movement of move-in-mud head is made up of the moving and turning, for short-cut calculation According to the location and attitude of the head, we can receive the location and attitude of every other part of the robot by its structure parameter and pitching angle. In Move-in-mud robot\222s positioning system, the depth information can be received with the relative positioning method based on the analysis as ahead. The depth information can be measured directly with depth sensor, which is a absolute positioning method. Thus, it is the redundant in the depth information. The redundant information can be processed with the data fusion theory, this will improve the precision and reliability of the positioning system. Kalman filter arithmetic is used to fuse the redundant depth III  D ESIGN OF F UZZY K ALMAN F ILTER  Kalman filter is used to fuse dynamic sensor information in real time.

There is a squirm feeding mechanism among the former sustaining mechanism and back sustaining mechanism B  Kinematic Analysis According to the structure and movement process, the movement model can be set up. The robot is made up of move-in-mud head, the former and back sustaining mechanism When we are setting up the movement model, the three sections are considered as poles of even character. The actual movement trajectory of move-in-mud robot is special three dimensions curve. However, in the process of excavating the hole, the robot is crawling from one side of the sinking boat to another side so the change of azimuth is small. When we set up the model, the movement of the level direction can be supposed as zero. So the movement is defined to a vertical plane xoy. The movement model of move-in-mud robot is shown in Fig.2 Suppose that each segment of the robot is 2 l i in length g m i in mass, the angle between x axis and each segment is i     i and the relative corner angle of each axis is i i i  i en the relations is as follows 002 002 l y y l x x 1     3 Get the differential coefficient of the three formulas, we can get the speed of each segment Suppose that the robot is moving in the vertical plane xoy and it will not do the side movement. In the movement process of robot\222s head, the former sustaining mechanism and back sustaining mechanism can both sustain well and there isn\222t any movement when the move-in-mud head excavate holes. Then the moving process of the head forward a step distance is the turning round the head and middle section. Because each segment of the robot can\222t make a side movement, that is, there is only the turning and moving along the direction of the body So we can conclude that sin cos 0 iii i xy 002\002 002  3  2  1  002 002 003 212   1  2  1 002 002 002 002 l l y y l l x x  2  3112233 3112233 2 cos 2 cos cos 2sin 2 sin sin xxl l l yyl l l

An arc whose chordal length is 20m and chordal height is 3 m is chosen as the planned trajectory of the robot in simulation. Then the turning mechanism of the move-in-mud robot can constantly control the changes of the pitching angle, when the robot movies along the whole trajectory The depth information of the robot is simulated with two fusion location ways of Kalman filter and Fuzzy Kalman filter The simulation results are shown in Fig.4- Fig.5 The simulation result shows that fuzzy Kalman filter is better than Kalman filter It not only improves the accuracy of the robot depth location obviously, but also the dependability of the position system is increased IV  C ONCLUSION  Move-in-mud robot is a new kind of underwater robot which is used in wreck salvage.

associated with is full, it is placed in the queue with the next highest priority which has available space If an incoming packet arrives and there is no space available in any of the virtual sub-queues, then the incoming packet replaces the oldest lowest priority packet in the queue, unless it is of a higher priority than the incoming packet. For example, if a packet arrives with priority 5 and all of the virtual sub-queues are full, then it is compared with the oldest lowest priority packet. Note that the oldest lowest priority packet will be the last element in the lowest priority virtual queue, thus, no searching is necessary. Since the incoming packet is priority 5, it will replace the last element unless the old packet has a higher priority \(priority 6 or greater\sure that if the last element is also priority 5, that the newer incoming packet replaces the older packet to preserve the freshness of the data. Thus, an incoming packet will only be dropped if none of the virtual sub-queues have available space and the incoming packet is of a lower priority than all other packets in the queue  4.2. Dequeuing  The dequeuing portion of the algorithm takes into account four distinct parameters in its computation current network congestion \(packets per virtual subqueue pv 1 pv 2  pv n he free or available space in the pending virtual queue \(packets in pending virtual queue pp\e number of virtual sub-queues \(n\d the weight of each virtual sub-queue \(w 1 w 2 w 3   w n  The virtual queue weights are defined as a function of congestion. Congestion is defined as the total used space in the lightweight queue divided by the size of the lightweight queue. We implemented the congestion levels as ranges.  The number of ranges is application specific and can be altered to fit the user s needs. For our application we implemented four congestion levels: 0-40%, 41-75%, 76-90%, 91100%. Thus, each of the four congestion levels is associated with a set of weights, one for each of the virtual sub-queues  Assignment of weights \(w 1  w 8 for each virtual queue, is determined as a function of both the free space in the virtual pending queue \(pp\d the congestion levels, as shown in Table 2. Note, that the sum of the weights for each congestion level must equal pp. By assigning the weights of each virtual sub-queue based on the current free space in the virtual pending queue, we continually and dynamically re-adjusting the weights, as the network changes in order to reflect its current conditions  Table I: Virtual queue weights based on congestion level  Index Level 1 0-40 Level 2 41-75 Level 3 76-90 Level 4 91-100 VQ1 0.20*pp 0.30*pp 0.40*pp 0.50*pp VQ2 0.20*pp 0.20*pp 0.20*pp 0.15*pp VQ3 0.15*pp 0.15*pp 0.15*pp 0.10*pp VQ4 0.15*pp 0.10*pp 0.10*pp 0.10*pp VQ5 0.10*pp 0.10*pp 0.05*pp 0.05*pp VQ6 0.10*pp 0.05*pp 0.05*pp 0.05*pp VQ7 0.05*pp 0.05*pp 0.025*pp 0.025*pp VQ8 0.05*pp 0.05*pp 0.025*pp 0.025*pp  4.2.1. Dequeuing algorithm details There are four steps that take place in the dequeuing algorithm First, the current congestion level at the node must be determined. Second, the weight of each of the virtual sub-queues must be calculated based on the current congestion, the available space in the virtual pending queue, and the application constants associated with each congestion level. Once the weight of each virtual sub-queue is calculated, the third step is to determine the number of packets to be dequeued from each virtual sub-queue. The number of packets to be dequeued from virtual sub-queue 1 \(DP 1  determined by dividing the free space in the virtual pending queue by the number of virtual sub-queues then multiplying the result by the weight of virtual sub-queue 1. For example, if the network is 50 congested \(note:  w 1 30*pp\ere is room for 24 packets in the virtual pending queue, and there are 8 virtual sub-queues, then the most packets that can be dequeued from virtual sub-queue 1 is  \(.30*24 24/8\1. However, we cannot dequeue more packets from the virtual sub-queue than it has \(S 1  Say that there are only 4 packets in virtual sub-queue 1, thus, we can only take 4 packets from virtual subqueue 1. Thus   S 1 21- 4 = 17.  This is shown below in Equations 4 and 5    n pp w pv DP   min 1 1 1   4 1 1 1 1   max DP n pp w pv S    5  Now, the number of packets that we can dequeue from virtual sub-queue 2 \(DP 2 note w 2 20*pp 20*24\ \(24/8\4, but we can also add the 17 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


packets that we did not dequeue from virtual subqueue 1. Thus, the most we can dequeue from virtual sub-queue 2 is 14 + 17 = 31. However, if we only have 3 packets in virtual sub-queue 2 then that is the most that we can dequeue \(S 2 his is depicted below in Equations 6 and 7    1 2 2 2   min S n pp w pv DP  6  2 1 2 2 2   max DP S n pp w pv S    7  This process continues until the number of packets to be removed form the last virtual priority sub-queue is determined. The general forms of the equations are shown below in Equations 8 and 9           2 2 2 1 1 1   max   max n n n n n n DP n pp w pv n pp w pv S 8    1   max n n n n S n pp w pv DP 9  The final step is to remove the appropriate number of packets form each of the virtual sub-queues. This is done according to the number of packets to be removed from each virtual priority sub-queue described above  5. Results  In order to evaluate our Tiny-DWFQ algorithm we designed and ran a series of tests. Our goal was to design a Quality of Se m a n a g e m e n t  algorithm for wireless sensor networks. Thus, in order to accurately test whether or not we had accomplished this we felt that it was necessary to forgo all simulations and physically implement this algorithm on a real wireless sensor network Naturally, implementation on real sensors brings to the forefront all of the limitations and obstacles associated with these resource constrained devices For example, measuring the packet loss, for each priority level, with simulations is a relatively easy task. It simply requires the counting and recording of the number of packets sent and received for each priority level which can be displayed through print or output statements. However, due to the limited resources of the individual nodes, this addition of a print statement \(which is actually an additional packet\or each packet, can cause serious congestion and in some cases failure of nodes. This caused us to use alternative measures to compute the packet loss for each priority level while not overloading the nodes. Our approach is discussed in detail in Section 5.2 Evaluation of our algorithm was done by measuring two network statistics, packet loss and throughput. Each of these was measured for each of the different priority levels. In our evaluations we compared our Tiny D-WFQ algorithm with Tiny WFQ. Additionally, we also implemented a simple FIFO queue for additional comparison which, when full, drops newly arriving packets. For each algorithm we implemented a queue size of 40, in order to achieve a fair comparison   5.1. Network scenario  Our experiments were all conducted using a testbed consisting of 10 Imote2 wireless sensor nodes. The testbed was setup inside our laboratory Due to the limited space and the goal of capturing a realist scenario we turned down the radio range of each node so that we could induce the multihop nature which would be present in the field. The nodes were arranged in a random or scattered fashion. The tesbed includes Panorama \(see Figure 3\which we designed and used as a monitoring tool for simulation of the senor nodes on Mount St. Helens. Each node s generated and multihop data was sent to a sink node through a dynamic multihop path\d then forwarded to its final destination which was a laptop computer. This laptop computer is representative of the computer which would be housed at the command and control center in a real volcanic monitoring scenario    Figure 3: Panorama monitoring tool Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


We implemented the tests by generating seven different types of data streams, emulating data collected at a volcanic site, at each node: seismic Real-Time Seismic-Amplitude Measurement RSAM\mic triggered event data, seismic interevent data \(continuous\rasonic RSAM data infrasonic triggered event data, infrasonic inter-event data \(continuous\, and lightning data. The reason for the simulation of these data types is due to the cost of acquiring 10 of each of these sensors. Additionally we were able to adjust the data rates to that which would be sampled from the actual sensors thus causing no difference in the evaluation of our algorithms. The sampling rates and the priorities assigned to each of the different data types are shown below in Table 3   Table 3: Data rates and priorities  Data Type Sampling Rate bytes/sec Priority Seismic RSAM 4 6 Seismic Event 0-200 4 Seismic Inter-Event 100 2 Infrasonic RSAM 4 5 Infrasonic Event 0-200 3 Infrasonic Inter-Event 100 1 Lightning 2 5  It should be noted that these sampling rates and priority assignments were not arbitrary, rather there were used as recommended by Earth Scientists who specialize in volcanic monitoring. Additionally, for the event data for both seismic and infrasonic the sampling rates are 0-200 bytes per second. This is due to the fact that event data refers to data that is representative of a triggered or actual physical event or activity. Thus, at some times there is not event data \(0 bytes/sec\owever, when event data is being generated it can be sampled at a very high rate \(200 bytes/sec   5.2. Packet loss  We had two goals to accomplish in evaluating the packet loss. First, we wanted to make sure that our experiment was performed in as realistic an environment as possible.  In order to accomplish this we ran all of our tests on a real testbed of Imote2 sensors. Additionally, we ran the tests with data types, rates, and priorities defined by Earth Scientists as discussed in Section 5.1. These are real scenario parameters that are being used in volcanic monitoring scenarios. Second, we wanted to evaluate the packet loss for each individual priority level for each of the three algorithms. In order to compute packet loss PL i or each individual priority level i, we measured the total number of packets generated at each node for each priority level, x k where k is the node s id. Next, we measured the total number of packets received by the destination \(laptop\or each priority level, y. This allowed us to compute the packet loss for each priority level by computing one minus the sum of each of the number of packets generated at each node divided by the number of packets received by the destination \(laptop\or each priority level. The total pack et loss for each priority level is displayed below in Equation 10    1 11 1 y x PL k k i    10 In order to accurately capture a realistic scenario we felt that it was necessary take the average of multiple runs. More specifically, since we used realistic data generated on real motes we were not necessarily getting the exact same data set for each run, which introduces some variances in the results To reduce the affects of this we ran 10 experiments each for 20 minutes and took the average of these 10 runs. The results are shown in Figures 1-6  0 10 20 30 40 Packet Loss 5 101520 Time \(minutes Priority 1: Packet Loss FIFO Tiny-WFQ Tiny-DWFQ  Figure 1 0 10 20 30 40 Packet Loss 5101520 Time \(minutes Priority 2: Packet Loss FIFO Tiny-WFQ Tiny-DWFQ  Figure 2 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7

It is interesting to note that a simple FIFO algorithm outperforms the Tiny-WFQ in most cases, especially for low priority messages \(Figures 5 and 6 messages with higher sampling rates \(Figures 3 and 4\. Additionally, it can be seen that Tiny-DWFQ s best relative improvements are for the mid range priorities \(priorities 3 and 4 in Figures 3 and 4\. This is due to the high rate at which these priority packets were generated. It can be seen from Table 3 that priorities 3 and 4 have the highest sampling rates Therefore, as the number of packets increases so does the relative improvement of Tiny-DWFQ over the other algorithms However, Tiny-DWFQ s primary goal is to ensure a high level Quality of Service for high priority data. Thus, we are particularly interested in the performance of Tiny-DWFQ for the high priority data \(note priority 6 is the highest\igure 6 shows that for the highest priority data Tiny-DWFQ only lost between 12.09% and 14.93% of the data while Tiny-WFQ lost between 17.09% and 21.82% of the data and the FIFO queue lost between 15.68% and 18.25% of the data  5.3. Throughput   Computation of the total throughput of our system using each of the three algorithms was measured with the same goals in mind as we had with the packet loss. We wanted to ensure a realistic environment and compute the total throughput for each individual priority level. The total throughput \(TP i or each priority level i is defined as the number of packets p k which traverse from the source to the destination per unit of time, u.  This is shown below in Equation 11  u p TP k k i  11 1     11  However, since we are using realistic data generation, as discussed in the previous section, the precise number of packets generated for each of the different runs varied slightly. Thus, in order to accurately evaluate the throughput it was necessary for us to take the throughput, TP i and divide it by the total number of packets generated g i for priority level i during that experimental run.

As described for the packet loss we also ran 10 experiments each for 20 minutes and took the average of the 10 runs for throughput. The results are shown below in Figures 7-12  50 60 70 80 90 Throughput  5101520 Time \(minutes Priority 1: Throughput FIFO Tiny-WFQ Tiny-DWFQ  Figure 7  50 60 70 80 90 Throughput  5101520 Time \(minutes Priority 2: Throughput FIFO Tiny-WFQ Tiny-DWFQ  Figure 8 50 60 70 80 90 Throughput  5101520 Time \(minutes Priority 3: Throughput FIFO Tiny-WFQ Tiny-DWFQ  Figure 9 50 60 70 80 90 Throughp ut 5101520 Time \(minutes Priority 4: Throughput FIFO Tiny-WFQ Tiny-DWFQ  Figure 10  50 60 70 80 90 Throughput  5101520 Time \(minutes Priority 5: Throughput FIFO Tiny-WFQ Tiny-DWFQ  Figure 11  50 60 70 80 90 Throughput 5101520 Time \(minutes Priority 6: Throughput FIFO Tiny-WFQ Tiny-DWFQ  Figure 12   In all cases, Figures 7-12 show that Tiny-DWFQ outperformed both of the other algorithms in terms of improving the network throughput. Similar to the previous results, the FIFO algorithm performs better than Tiny-WFQ for high frequency data \(Figures 9 and 10\w priority data \(Figures 11 and 12 Additionally, it can be seen that Tiny-DWFQ s best relative improvements are for the mid range priorities priorities 3 and 4 in Figures 9 and 10\se of the very high sampling rates of these data While we are primarily concerned with the highest priority data, we also do not want to starve the lower level data. If we did not care about any of the lower priority data we would just not transmit it at all. Therefore, it is good that we are able to maintain better Quality of Service than the other algorithms even for low level traffic For the highest priority data, Figure 12 shows that Tiny-DWFQ achieved a throughput percentage between 85.07% and 88.18% while Tiny-WFQ only achieved a throughput percentage between 78.63 and 82.59% and the FIFO queue s throughput percentage was between 81.75% and 84.32 Hence, Tiny-DWFQ was able to show improvement over the other algorithms for all priorities of data but most importantly for high priority data Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


We believe that the reason for this improvement is twofold. First, our enqueuing algorithm allowed us to fully utilize the entire queue structure for high priority packets in the midst of congestion. Secondly our dequeuing algorithm utilized not only information about the DWP of the packet but also the current network congestion as well as the available network resources. This allowed us to essentially store the higher priority packets in the queue until there was room for them in the network  6. Conclusions and future work  In conclusion, we have designed and implemented a lightweight dynamic weighted fair queuing algorithm, Tiny-DWFQ on a real wireless sensor network testbed. Our goal was to introduce a novel dynamic scheduling algorithm to increase the bandwidth for high priority data. We accomplished this by ensuring a high level of Quality of Service for high priority data without starving the lower priority data. In order to compare our algorithm against others we implemented a lightweight version of WFQ Tiny-WFQ, as well as a simple FIFO queue. The metrics that we used for evaluation were packet loss and throughput. After conducting our tests we were able to show improvement in both an increased throughput percentage as well as decreased packet loss for all types of data We are currently in the process of implementing a large-scale Optimized Autonomous Space In-Situ Sensorweb \(OSAIS\or monitoring Mount St Helens, with Tiny-DWFQ integrated into the middleware component. This sensorweb will be deployed continuously for one year \(2009-2010   10.

selection is dominated by O   C k  2   Finally the space requirement is O  MAX  C k  2    Since the size of a community is small both the time and space are also small VII E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS We now evaluate the performance of our algorithm for object connection discovery We run all experiments on an AMD Opteron 248 with 1GB RAM running Linux 64-bit We use the DBLP co-authorship dataset modeled as a graph The graph has approximate ly 316K nodes and 1,834K edges where a node represents an author and the edge weight is the number of papers co-authored between two authors A Performance of Community Partition We rst evaluate the performance of community partition by our greedy algorithm We test three settings of c local 10 50 and 100 and four settings of c global 10 100 1000 10000 We also compare with Newman’s algorithm 13 Figure 11\(a shows that our algorithm is about an order of magnitude faster than Newman’s when c local 10 Theresult also shows that when c local increases the efﬁciency decreases which demonstrates the effectiveness of Heuristic 1 10 100 1000 10000 10 2 10 3 10 4 c g lobal Running Time \(sec c local 10 c local 50 c local 100 Newman a Running Time 10 100 1000 10000 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 c g lobal Peak Memory Consumption \(MB c local 10 c local 50 c local 100 Newman b Memory Consumption Fig 11 Performance of Community Partition For the effect of Heuristic 2 i.e c global  the performance is the best when c global  1000 When c local 10  the running time is 682 613 570 and 667 seconds for c global  10 100 1000 and 10000 respectively The result can be explained as follows When c global is too small many items are not kept in the global max-heap and hen ce we need to rebuild the heap more often When c global is too large there are too many items in the heap and hence the update of the heap takes longer Figure 11\(b shows that the peak memory consumption of our algorithm increases when c local increases since the size of the local max-heaps increases when c local increases Increasing c global  i.e the size of the global heap from 10 to 10000 only increases the memory usage for less than 1 MB since we have only one global heap However in all cases our algorithm consumes considerably less memory than Newman’s We also record that the value of the modularity of the optimal community partition obtained by the greedy algorithm is 0.71 note that all the algorithms compute the same partition According to Newman 13 a m odul ari t y v a l u e o f g reat er t h an 0.3 indicates a signiﬁcant comm unity structure Therefore 0.71 is a very high value of modularity and indicates a highquality community partition B Semantics of Answer Graph A Case Study We conduct a case study to compare our answer graph with the center-piece subgraph  CEPS  10 Thi s s t udy ai ms to rst provide a more intuitive view on the answer graphs obtained by our algorithm and CEPS Then we perform a more systematic comparison in the following subsection We use the query  Jim Gray  Jennifer Widom  Michael I Jordan  Geoffrey E Hinton   The four scholars are from two different communities Gray and Widom are from the database community while Jordan and Hinton are from the machine learning community This is clearly captured by our answer graph as shown in Figure 1 which is displayed in Section I Figure 12 shows the answer graph of CEPS which is very similar to our answer graph The similarity is because both our algorithm and CEPS nd nodes that are closely related to the query nodes in order to connect them Thus the result shows that both algorithms are able to capture important nodes and paths related to the query nodes However our method not only nds a good connection between all query nodes but also for query nodes that are in the same context we put more emphasis on their connection than the existing methods Compare Figure 1 with Figure 12 we clearly see a stronger connection between Gray and Widom through both Ceri and Hellerstein in our answer graph than CEPS Michael I Jordan Jim Gray Alexander Aiken 1 3 Jennifer Widom Michael Stonebraker Tommi Jaakkola Lawrence K.

than three orders of magnitude faster than CEPS for both query types We nd that PCquery takes more time to process an incommunity query than a random query This is because the computation of the

algorithm is three orders of magnitude faster and also consumes signiﬁcantly less memory we can conclude that our method is both efﬁcient and effective VIII C ONCLUSIONS We propose context-aware object connection discovery in a large graph We adopt a partition-and-conquer approach to achieve both high performance efﬁciency and high quality results Our method rst partitions a large graph into a set of communities The concept of community not only naturally deﬁnes the context of the nodes but also signiﬁcantly improves the efﬁciency of connection d iscovery since a community is much smaller than the original graph We compute the connection between query nodes rst at the intra-community level by maximizing the information throughput of the nodes and the information ow of the paths in the answer graph and then at the inter-community level by retaining the close relation between the commun ities as deﬁned by modularity The quality of both the intraand intercommunity connection is thus controlled by the integration of information throughput/ﬂow and modularity We verify by experiments that our community partition algorithm is efﬁcient and the set of communities obtained has high quality We also show that our method obtains comparable high-quality answers as the state-of-the-art algorithm but is more than three orders of magnitude faster and consumes signiﬁcantly less memory

  13 false \(double\argets Figure 12 illustrates this situation. The conditional update correctly updates the tracker wh ich is tasked with following the target. However, the detector which is partially spatially coincident with the tracker also receives energy from the conditional update. This can lead the detector to initiate falsely\second target nearby the first target This effect can be countered a number of ways. First, we can adjust the speed at which the tracker re-centers itself The double initialization phenomenon occurs when the PDF peaks near the edge of the tracker grid. However, this method has the side effect of potentially allowing probability to fall off of the grid in low SNR environments causing track loss. Of course if the SNR is low enough or measurement outages occur tracks will be dropped. Second a guardband around the tracker that does not allow any detector sufficiently near the tracker to receive reinforcement via the conditional density can mitigate the double target problem. However, this has the side effect of preventing detection of closely spaced targets. Third increasing the spatial extent of the tracker has a similar effect as the using a guardband. It does require increased computation, but generates a better representation of the posterior There are several engineering tradeoffs. The first is that large tracker grids \(or large guard bands\ prevent falsely detecting new targets because of conditional probability spill over. However, if applied too aggressively, this will prevent correctly detecting cl osely spaced targets. Second quick tracker grid translation correctly centers the target mass, again preventing spillover into nearby detectors However, overly liberal trac ker repositioning may in fact move trackers to spurious energy locations and drop true targets off of the finite grid On Ambiguous Targets As discussed earlier, ambiguous targets will eventually move non-physically and this will cause the tracker to remove them via its natural prediction and update process Figure 13 illustrates this phenomenon. There are two real targets that create two persistent ambiguities. All four are detected and tracked automati cally. The ambiguous targets however, eventually move non-physically due to their reliance on the node bearing angles. The tracker automatically penalizes the non-physical motion and the targets\222 present hypothesis decrease quickly over time Ambiguous target removal is done automatically in the Bayesian framework as follows The PDF on target state is predicted forward in time according to the kinematic model True targets will have behavior consistent with the kinematic model \(note the kinematic model is a statistical model so it is predicting a range of possibilities for the future target state\biguous targets may behave consistently with this model for a period of time, but eventually they will appear to perform a non-physical maneuver \(these epochs typically come when the ambiguous target crosses a line of symmetry in the sensor\this point, the predicted target position will be in strong disagreement with the inco ming measurements on that target. This mismatch in predicted target position and measurements leads to a decr ease in the target present hypothesis as calculated in eq. \(4\long, only true targets remain   Figure 12 \226 Improper selection of grid resolution leads to multiple initializations on the same target. Left Measurement update of a Tracker \(red=highest likelih ood, blue=lowest\Right Measurement update of a detector which lies near the Tracker.  Since the track er size has been improperly chosen, some energy from the measurements of a single target leak s on to the detector. This can le ad to false double-initializations 


  14 8  C ONCLUSION  This paper has described a Bayesian approach to detecting and tracking multiple moving targets using acoustic data from multiple passive arrays In contrast to traditional undersea acoustic systems, which develop tracks at the single array level and require track association, our approach fuses data at the m easurement level and operates directly in the target state space We have detailed a well known nonlinear filtering approach to single target detection and tracking [1, 4 and desc ri be d our computationally efficient finite-grid approach to the required density estimation. We have furthermore extended this to the multiple target case by employing a bank of single target detector tracke rs and approximation methods that adjust for closely spaced targets. This approximate approach avoids fully treating the computationally complex joint multitarget problem Future work includes modified approaches to posterior estimation including dynamic grid extent, dynamic grid resolution, and particle filtering. It is anticipated that adaptive sampling of the posterior will lead to computational savings. Furthermore, future work includes more detailed modeling and estimation of closely spaced targets allowing a more accurate representation of the joint target density. Naively implemented, this implies exponential growth \(in the number of targets\r the probability state space being es timated. However, recent work in a related tracking domain on adaptive density factorization [5 c h a stic sa m p lin g  p article filtering    pr ovi de m e t h o d s t h at m i t i g at e t h i s com put at i o n gr owt h  when the full joint density is treated  A PPENDIX  This section discusses the details of how the single target probability density is time evolved on a discrete grid. This discussion is similar to that found elsewhere [15, 14, 13 We wish to compute the single target probability density at time      from the density at time     The relation between these two densities can be expressed using the law of total probability as                We expand     using a second order Taylor series as               where  is the vector of partial derivatives, i.e and is the matrix of second order partial derivatives Then the relation of \(23\ approximated as   Figure 13\226 Left: P h1 over time for four targets, two of which are real and two of which are ambiguous.
