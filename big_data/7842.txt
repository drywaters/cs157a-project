However, it also causes a threat to privacy. We investigate to find an appropriate balance between a need for privacy and information discovery on association patterns. In this paper, we propose an innovative technique for hiding sensitive patterns. In our approach, a sanitization matrix is defined. By multiplying the original transaction database and the sanitization matrix, a new database which is sanitized for privacy concern, is gotten Moreover, a set of experiments is performed to show the effectiveness of our approach     Keywords association patterns, privacy preservation sanitized database, data mining 1.Introduction Data mining techniques have been developed in many applications and researches. However, it also brings the problem of privacy. A motivating example is discussed in Suppose we have a server and many clients in which each client has a set of data The clients want the server to gather statistical information about association among items in order to provide recommendations to the customers However, the clients do not want the server to know some sensitive patterns Sensitive pattern is the frequent itemset that contain highly sensitive knowledge. Thus, when a client sends its database to the server, some sensitive patterns are hidden from its database according to some specific privacy policies Therefore, the server only can gather statistical information from the modified database In recent years, more and more researchers emphasize the seriousness of the problem about privacy. The privacy problem can be classified into two classes data privacy problem and information privacy problem. Data privacy is to protect the privacy of sensitive data, while information privacy is investigated privacy of patterns that contain highly sensitive knowledge Privacy-preserving mining in the context of data privacy for classification rules has been investigated in using a ra ndom iz ing funct ion wit h Gaussian or Uniform perturbations, the sensitive values in users record will be perturbed. Based on probabilistic distortion of user demonst rates a schem problem  of how to avoi d pri vacy breaches in privacy preserving data mining is introduced Information privacy preserving problem is to hide the sensitive patterns or rules by updating the original database and with as little effect on non-sensitive patterns as possible.

proved to be NP-Hard ABE99 Similar to ABE99  the other heuristic method is proposed in h ey falsify some value or replace known values with unknown values such as question marks In a f r a m ewor k is pr opose d to e n force privacy in mining frequent itemsets. In the approach the victim items that should be eliminated for each restrictive pattern are selected. And transaction retrieval engine is used to identify sensitive transactions for each restrictive pattern. Based on the disclosure threshold, the number of sensitive transactions is computed and the victim items are removed from the select transactions In this paper we propose an innovative technique for hiding sensitive patterns. By observing the relationship between sensitive patterns and non-sensitive patterns a sanitization matrix is defined. By setting the entries in sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original transaction database to the sanitization matrix, a sanitized database is gotten The sanitized database is the database that has been modified for hiding sensitive patterns with privacy concern The reminder of this paper is organized as follows The problem and the framework of our approach is presented in section 2 In section 3, the sanitizing algorithms are discussed. The metrics to estimate the performance of our approach is introduced in section 4. The experimental results are also reported in section 4. We conclude with a summary and directions for future work in section 5 2. Basic Concept 2.1 Problem Formulation In our approach, a transaction database D is represented as a matrix in which the rows represent transactions and the columns represent the items. If D contains m transactions and n kinds of items D is represented as an mxn matrix. The entry D t,i is set to 1 if item i is purchased in transaction t. Otherwise, it is set to 0 Our problem can be formulated as follows. Let D be a transaction database P be the set of frequent patterns that can be mined from D Let P h denote a set of sensitive patterns that need to be hidden according to some security policies, and P h P  P h is the set of non-sensitive patterns P h  P h P Our problem is to transform D into a sanitized database D such that only the patterns belong to P h can be mined from D  1  2  3 1  2   3 1  2  3 t1 t2 t3 t4 10  1 11 0 0  0  1 1  1 1 1  0   0 1 1  0 0   0  1 t1 t2 t3 t4 1  0  1 0  1 0 0  0  1 0  1 1 1 2 3 X  CM DD Figure 1 Setting r 21 1 in S 2 Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference \(COMPSAC04 0730-3157/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 


2.2 Sanitization matrix In our approach, original database D is multiplied by a sanitization matrix S  get a sanitized database D  By setting S ij where i j to appropriate value, a sanitized database D will be gotten In the following the basic concept of our approach is discussed 2.2.1 New definition for the matrix multiplication In our approach, the matrix multiplication method is defined as follows 1. If D ti equals zero, no multiplication proceeds on it. That is D ti is set to 0 directly. This is because our goal is to hide the sensitive pattern by decreasing its support. Moreover, if an entry with value zero can be converted to 1, new patterns may be produced 2 If the resulting value larger than 1, set it to 1 3 If the resulting value smaller than 0 set it to 0 2.2.2 The Setting of -1 A sensitive pattern can be hidden by decreasing its support. If D ti and D tj are both equal to 1, set D ti or D tj be 0 can reduce the support of {i, j}. Refer to Figure 1. Let minimum support be 50% and {1, 2} be a sensitive pattern. If S 21 is set to -1 D 21 D 41 will become 0. Oppositely, if S 12 is set to -1 D 22 D 42 will become 0.Therefore, the support of {1,2} can be decreased by setting S 21 or S 12 to -1. Moreover, if S ij is set to 1, then for a transaction t, where D ti and D tj are both equal to 1, D tj will be 0 2.2.3 The Setting of 1 Setting appropriate entries in S to 1 can reduce the support of the sensitive patterns However it also leads to accidentally conceal the non-sensitive patterns. We remedy this defect by setting some entries in S to 1 to minimize the effect on losing non-sensitive patterns. Continue above example, the frequent patterns in D are {1,2} and {1,3 Let {1,2 and {1,3} be the sensitive and non-sensitive pattern respectively. If S 21 is set to 1, D 21 and D 41 will be 0 As a result, the support of {1, 3 will be decreased to 25% in D and no longer be a frequent pattern. To reserve the non-sensitive pattern {1,3} in D S 31 is set to 1 to make D t1 keep the same value as D t1 for those transaction t where D t1 1and D t3 1. The purpose of setting the specific entry to 1 is to reinforce the relation of {1 3 and avoid eliminating 1, 3} accidentally. Setting corresponding entries between any two items contained in non-sensitive patterns in S to 1 can preserve non-sensitive patterns after the sanitization process  3.The Sanitization Algorithms 3.1 Hidden-First Algorithm The main idea of Hidden-First algorithm denoted by HF, is to eliminate all patterns in P h from D by setting proper entries in S to 1. The entries of S are set to the proper values according to the following rules 1. S ii 1, diagonal entry 2. S ij  1 If P h such that {i, j and   P h i j  Moreover, the number of patterns containing {j} in P h is smaller than 3 Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference \(COMPSAC04 0730-3157/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 


that of the patterns containing {i} in P h The reason is that by setting S ij to 1, the support of item j will be reduced. Moreover, item j has smaller effect on P h than item i 3. S ij 0, otherwise Hidden-First Algorithm Input: Ph Ph, D, S Output: D Step 1: Set the values of the entries in S according to the rules Step 2: \(matrices multiplication For every transaction i in D do For j=1 to number of items do If \(D ij 0 ij 0 Else D ij max  0 items of number k kj ik 1 S D However, in this approach, some non-sensitive patterns may be accidentally hidden due to setting the value of some entries in S to 1 3.2 The Non-Hidden-First Algorithm \(NHF The main idea behind the Non-Hidden-First algorithm, denoted by NHF, is to reserve all non-sensitive patterns and endeavor to hide sensitive patterns from D at the same time The entries in S are set according to the following rules 1. S ii 1, diagonal entry 2. S ij  1 If P h such that {i, j and  P h i, j  Moreover the number of patterns containing {j in P h is smaller than that of the patterns containing {i} in P h The reason is that by setting S ij to 1, the support of item j will be reduced Moreover, item j has smaller effect on P h than item i 3. S ij 1, If P h i j  and  P h  such that {i, j  4. S ij 0, otherwise Non-Hidden-First Algorithm Input: P h P h D, S Output: D Step 1: Set the values of the entries in S according to the rules Step 2: \(matrices multiplication For every transaction i in D do For j=1 to number of items do If \(D ij 0 ij 0 Else Temp items of number k kj ik 1 S  D If \(Temp 1 D ij 1 Else D ij 0  However the sanitized database produced by NHF algorithm may contain sensitive patterns That is, not all the sensitive patterns can be hidden successfully by applying NHF algorithm 3.3 HPCME Algorithm The main idea of HPCME algorithm \(Hiding sensitive Patterns Completely with Minimum side Effect on non-sensitive patterns\bine the advantages in HF and NHF. All sensitive patterns will be hidden with minimal side effect on non-sensitive patterns Restoration probability 4 Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference \(COMPSAC04 0730-3157/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 


Based on HF algorithm, NHF algorithm set proper entries in S to 1 to avoid canceling non-sensitive patterns accidentally. However some sensitive patterns may be hidden unsuccessfully  Therefore, a new factor restoration probability 0 p r 1\d to decide whether the value of D tj would follow the multiplication result when the multiplication result is 1 and there exist a S kj 1 1 k number of items A higher value of p r will let HPCME algorithm tend to preserve non-sensitive patterns, and vice versa Because our goal is to hide all the sensitive patterns with minimum side effect on non-sensitive patterns p r is set to a small value in HCPME algorithm Moreover, the entries in S are set according to the rules defined in NHF algorithm HPCME Algorithm Input: P h P h D, S p r Output: D Step 1 Set the values of the entries in S according to the rules Step 2: \(matrices multiplication For every transaction i in D do For j=1 to number of items do If \(D ij 0 ij 0 Else Temp  items of number k kj ik 1 S  D If \(Temp 0 D ij 0 Else if S kj 1, 1 k numebr of items D ij 1 with probability p r D ij 0 with probability 1-p r  else D ij 1  4.Performance Evaluation 4.1The Metrics for Quantifying Performance Two metrics are introduced to evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms Error 1 some sensitive patterns can still be discovered after sanitization process.

Moreover, p r is set to 0.35 in our experiments Figure 2 shows the accuracy of algorithms HF HPCME and NHF As shown in the result, HF and 5 Proceedings of the 28th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference \(COMPSAC04 0730-3157/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 


HPCME algorithm approach at 100% accuracy no matter what the values of overlap rate. NHF works like HF and HCME when the overlap rate is low However, as overlap rate increases, its accuracy decreases           Figure 2 Effect of overlapped rate on Accuracy Figure 3 shows the wrongness of algorithms for HF HPCME and NHF The more the sensitive patterns need to be hidden, the more the entries in CM are set to 1 As a result, non-sensitive patterns are missed easily     Figure 3 Effect of overlapped rate on Wrongness 5. Conclusion and Future Work s In this paper, a new framework is presented for enhancing privacy in mining frequent patterns. By setting the entries in the sanitization matrix to appropriate values, and multiplying original DB and sanitization matrix, a sanitized database is gotten According to different settings in sanitization matrix we bring up three sanitization algorithms for hiding sensitive patterns successfully or for no legitimate pattern missing Acknowledge This work was partially supported by the National Science Council in Republic of China under the Contract No 922213E259006 Reference  Atallah, E.

That is, item 1 and item 2 never appear toge ther, and they are mutual exclusive! This situation almost never happens in the normal database. The attackers may interest in this situation and infer that {1, 2} is hidden deliberately. To hide the sensitive patterns, only need to make their supports smaller than minimum support and need not to decrease their support to 0. To solve the problem, we inject a probability ? which is called Distortion probability into this approach. Distortion probability is used only when the column j of the sanitization matrix S contains only one  1  i.e. Sjj = 1 0 1 d   m k k j i k  S D  m j n i j i  d d d d   1  1     D  i j  h a s   j probability to be set to 1 and 1  j probability to be set to 0 Lemma 1: Given a minimum support ?, and a level of confidence c.

It is to guarantee that the size of the sanitized database equals the size of the original database 4. Performance Evaluation 4.1. Performance Quantifying There are three potential errors in the problem. First of all some sensitive patterns are hidden unsuccessfully. Secondly some non-sensitive patterns cannot be mined from D'. And the third, new artificial patterns may be produced. However, the third condition never happens in both of our approach and SWA Besides, we also introduce the other two criteria, dissimilarity and weakness. All of the criteria are discussed as follows Criterion 1: some sensitive patterns are frequent in D'. This condition is denoted as Hiding Failure [10], and measured by     DP DP HF H H , where XPH represents the number of patterns contained in PHwhich is mined from database X Criterion 2: some non-sensitive patterns are hidden in D'. It is also denoted as Misses Cost [10], and measured by      DP DPDP MC

The attack is quantified by        DPDP DPairSDPDP Weakness HH HH    where DPairS is the set of sensitive patterns whose pair subsets can be completely mined from D 4.2. Experimental Results Table 1: Experiment factor The experiment is to compare the performance between our approach and SWA which has been compare with Algo2a [4 and IGA [10] and is so far the algorithm with best performances published and presented in [12] as we know. The IBM synthetic data generator is used to generate experimental data. The dataset contains 1000 different items, with 100K transactions where the average length of each transaction is 15 items. The Apriori algorithm with minimum support = 1% is used to mine the dataset and 52964 frequent patterns are gotten Several sensitive patterns are randomly selected from the frequent patterns with length two to three items to be seeds With the several seeds, all of their supersets are included into the sensitive patterns set since any pattern which contains sensitive patterns should also be sensitive 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.0205 0.04 0.0618 0.0855 0.1006 ratio of sensitive pattern H id

RS and weakness Fig.8, Fig.9, Fig.10, Fig.11 and Fig.12 show the effect of RS by comparing our work to SWA. Refer to Fig.8, because the level of confidence in our sanitization process takes the minim um support into account, no matter how the distribution of the sensitive patterns, we still are C confident to avoid hiding failure problems. However, there is no correlation between the disclos ure threshold in SWA and the minimum support. Under the sa me disclosure threshold, if the frequencies of the sensitive patte rns are high, the hiding failure will get high too. In Fig.9, beca use our work is to hide the sensitive patterns by decreasing the supports of the pair-subpatterns of the sensitive patterns, the val ue of weakness is related to the level of confidence. However according to the disclosure threshold of SWA, when all the pair subpatterns of the sensitive patterns have large frequencies, it may cause serious F-I Attack problems.

However if the sensitive pattern set is composed of too many seeds, a lot of victim pair-subpatterns will be contained in Marked-Set. And as a result, cause a higher misses cost, such as x = 0.04 in Fig.10 Moreover, refer to the turning points of SWA under x = 0.0855 to 0.1006 in Fig.10 and Fig.11. The reason of violation is that the result of the experiment has strong correlation with the distri bution of the sensitive patterns. Because the sensitive patterns Proceedings of the 29th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference  COMPSAC  05 0730-3157/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE are chosen randomly, several variant factors of the sensitive patt erns are not under control such as the frequencies of the sensiti ve patterns and the overlap between the sensitive patterns if the overlap between the sensitive patterns is high, some sensitive patterns can be hidden by removing a common item in SWA Therefore, decrease the misses cost and the dissimilarity 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 0.0205 0.04 0.0618 0.0855 0.1006 ratio of sensitive pattern E x ec u ti o n T im e h  SP SWA 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.3784 0.6392 0.7646 0.9081 1 ratio of large2 in sensitive pattern set H id in g F a il u re SP SWA

On the other hand, our approach can be separated roughly into two parts, one is to get Marked-Set which is strong dependent on the data, the other is to set sanitization matrix and execute multiplication whose execution time is dependent on the numbers of transactions and items in the database. In the experi ment, because the items and transactions are fixed, therefore, the execution time of our approach is decided by the setting of Marked-Set which makes the execution time changing slightly 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.3784 0.6392 0.7646 0.9081 1 ratio of large2 in sensitive pattern set W ea k n es s SP SWA 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.3784 0.6392 0.7646 0.9081 1 ratio of large2 in sensitive pattern set M is se s C o st SP SWA Fig.14: Rel. bet.

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
