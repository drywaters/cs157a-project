Introduction Modern hardware and database technology has made it possible to store gigabytes of information in databases However, this rapid digitalization has pointed out an im portant need for tools techniques to delve and ef ficiently discover valuable non obvious information from large databases Data mining techniques have been pro posed and studied to help users better understand and an alyze the information Much research in data mining from large databases has focused on the discovery of as sociation rules [2, 11 Association rule generation is achieved from a set of frequent itemsets in an extraction context 
for a minimal support An associa tion rule is a relation between itemsets of the form  X Y in which X and Y are frequent itemsets and X c Y X and Y X are called, respec tively premise and conclusion of the rule T  The valid asso ciation rules are those of which the measure of confidence is greater than or 
equal to a minimal Engelbert Mephu Nguifo Centre de Recherche en Informatique de Lens IUT de Lens Rue de SP 16,62307 Lens Cedex threshold of confidence, named If  1 then r is called exact association rule ER otherwise it is called approximative association rule AR The problem of the relevance and usefulness of extracted association rules is of primary importance. Indeed, in most real life databases, thousands and even millions of confidence rules are generated among which many are re dundant Various techniques are used to 
limit the number of reported rules starting by basic pruning techniques based on thresholds for both the frequency of the represented pat tern and the strength of the dependency between premise and conclusion This pruning can be based on patterns de fined by the user user dejined templates on boolean op erators 25 The number of rules can be reduced through pruning based on additional information such as a taxonomy on items  or a metric of specific interest  Pearsons correlation or a combination of item taxonomy and user-driven process More advanced techniques that produce 
only a limited number of the entire set of rules called generic bases The generation of such generic bases draws heavily on a battery of results provided by concept analysis FCA  In this paper, we are interested in the study of the most used kind of visualization categories in data mining use visualization techniques to present the information catched out the mining process Graphical visualization tools became more appealing when handling large data sets with complex relationships since information presented in the form of images is more direct and easily understood by hu mans Visualization tools allow users to work in an inter active environment 
with ease in understanding rules. In a based tabular view of association rules all strong rules are represented as in a tabular representation format \(rule table in which each entry corresponds to a rule. All rules can be The number of transactions of K containing Y I Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Tools with Artificial ICTAI 2004 20.00 2004 C OM P U T E R SOCIETY 


displayed in different order such as order by premise, con clusion, support or confidence This helps users to have a clearer view of the rules and locate a particular one more easily.The tabular view is advocated for representing a large number of rules with varied length. As a drawback, tabular based technique draws heavily on a  boring  logical infer ence that a user should perform, and is not suitable for visu alizing rules from different aspects For example if a user is interested in a comprehensive view of the relationship be tween rules and items. In this case, the tabular view is not very convenient since an item repetitively appears in the rule table as long as it is contained by a rule These facts un derline the importance of graphical rule visualization tools permitting a clearer and more user friendly view of rules and items. Indeed, visual representation has the capability of shifting load from the user's cognitive system to the per ceptual system However as pointed out in the ded icated literature, the graphical based techniques 3D Histograms or 2D matrix actually interesting if only a small size of rules are handled In this paper, we are interested in presenting a graphical based visualization prototype for handling generic bases of association rules. We try to find an answer to the following question   Which is the most adequate visualisation tech nique depending on the intrinsic structure of generic bases of association rules, specially as their sizes is by far lower than the set of all redundant association rules   As we will show later 3D histograms based technique is particu larly advocated for visualizing generic bases extracted from sparse contexts. While 2D matrix based technique is indi cated to visualize generic bases extracted from dense con texts An interesting feature of the aforementioned prototype is that it provides a  contextual  exploration of such rule set Indeed, additional information are provided to a user select ing a given displayed rule  1 All the rule are displayed To derive such rules, we use the set of inference axioms that we in troduced in 2 All the  connected  rules are displayed to the user in an interactive manner. The contextual interaction is performed through the construction of fuzzy meta rules rules where both premises and conclusions are composed of rules Interestingly, such additional displayed knowledge allows improved man machine interaction by emulating a cooper ative behavior The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec tion 2 sketches briefly the mathematical background for the extraction of generic bases of association rules. In section 3 we present the process of the extraction of fuzzy associ ation meta rules Then we discuss in depth in section 4 the opportunity of the rule set contextual exploration. Section 5 concludes this paper and points out future research direc tions 2 Extracting generic bases of association rules In the following, we recall some key results from the Galois lattice based paradigm in FCA and its applications to association rules mining. A formal context is a triplet  A R where represents a finite set of objects or transactions A is a finite set of attributes and R is a bi nary relation R g x d Each couple a R expresses that the transaction o contains the attribute a A We define two functions that map sets of objects to sets of attributes and vice versa Thus for a set 0 we define  a 0 R and for A A A   0 A R Both functions and form a Galois connection between the respective power sets and Consequently both compound operators of and are closure operators in particular w  o Frequent closed itemset An itemset A A is said to be closed if A  and is said to be frequent with re spect to the minsup threshold if   minsup An itemset g A is called minimal generator of a closed itemset A if and only if  A and g such that  A Iceberg Galois lattice When only frequent closed item sets are considered with set inclusion, the resulting structure only preserves the joint operator In the remaining of the paper, such structure is referred to  Iceberg Galois lat tice   With respect to and given an Iceberg Ga lattice, representing precedence relation based ordered closed itemsets, generic bases of association rules can be derived in a straightforward manner. We assume that, in such structure, each closed itemset is  decorated  with its associated list of minimal generators. Hence, generic approximative association rules GAR represent  inter node  implications, assorted with a statistical information the confidence, from a sub closed itemset to a super closed itemset while starting from a given node in an or dered structure. Inversely, generic exact association rules are  intra node  implications extracted each node in the ordered structure For example, let us consider the transaction database given by Table I Left The set of extracted closed itemsets denoted by with their associated minimal generators is depicted by Table 1 Right Table 2 yields, re spectively, the set of generic exact association rules and the set of approximative association rules that it may be possi ble to derive for Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence ICTAI 2004 20.00 2004 SOCIETY 


 Table 1 Left: Transaction database Right Closed iternsets list Table 2 Generic association rule set Rig 3 Extracting fuzzy association rules In the following, we present the basic fuzzy constructs and our proper notations 3.1 Basic Fuzzy constructs Fuzzy Sets  Let be a finite classical set of objects called universe of discourse A fuzzy set in a universe of discourse is characterized by a membership function where denotes the degree of mem bership of in the fuzzy set Hence the fuzzy set is denotedby      In the following the notion of fuzzy extraction context made up of objects and attributes related under a fuzzy type 1 relation, is formalized Fuzzy context fuzzy extraction context is a triple describing a finite set of objects a fuzzy finite set of database items or descriptors\and a fuzzy binary relation x Each couple denotes that the object o has the item at least with a degree a a Fuzzy Galois connection Let  be a fuzzy extraction context For X and the functions   and  are defined as follows   a  b a 0 b b The fuzzy operator is applied on a crisp set of objects and determines to which degree each property is satisfied by all objects according to their respective degrees Note that as defined formerly presents a desired abstraction voca tion. Indeed the retrieved fuzzy set is the least generaliza tion through the function of all sets or de scriptions associated respectively to the input set objects Similarly, the fuzzy operator is applied on a set of properties represented by a fuzzy set and determines to which degree each object satisfies all of them. The implicit use of the Rescher Gaines fuzzy implication permits to obtain the desired interpretation effect Hence, the operator permits to filter only objects fulfilling the constraint that the associated descriptions are more general than the input description It is noteworthy that the proposed definition of fuzzy Galois connection without context transformation can not be unique This constatation is due to the exis tence of multitude of parameters to take into account in any extension to the con text fuzzy implication choice For instance, we mention based Lukasiewicz implication propositions of Belohlavek and Pollandt where a fuzzy for mal concept is defined by a pair of two fuzzy sets and where  and  The reader is re ferred to for a critical discussion on these propo sitions based on semantic interpretations attached to membership degrees in a fuzzy set 3.2 The F A R D algorithm The F ARD 6 algorithm falls in the  Test and-generate  characterization for mining frequent closed\algo rithms It handles as input an extended extraction context a database in which quantities of the purchased items are available The peculiarity of the F ARD algorithm stands in the fact that it is dedicated Indeed it tackles the orig inal context without binarizing it since it takes advantage of the particular properties of the fuzzy descriptions to limit the computation effort The algorithm traverses iteratively the search space in a level-wise manner During each iteration corresponding to a level a set of candidate patterns is created by joining fre quent patterns discovered during the previous iteration.

Fuzzy association rules are generated in two successive steps Discovering all frequent fuzzy closed itemsets 2 From the discovered frequent fuzzy closed itemsets generate all fuzzy association rules that it is possible to derive As input the F ARD algorithm takes a fuzzy extraction context minsup and this paper, we consider that the fuzzy context is constituted as follows  R where represents the finite set of ob jects RS is a finite set of and GAR and is a fuzzy binary relation where R  con R Q o and Following the general principle of a level wise algo rithm, the F ARD algorithm performs in each iteration the following two steps \(assuming that items are sorted in a lex icographic order Construction step The G EN CLOSED function, is ap plied to each generator in determining its sup port and possibly its closure \(if it is frequent enough This set is pruned with respect the anti monotonous constraint, through the minsup threshold 2 Pruning step  The set of generators to be utilized in the next iteration is computed by ap plying the G EN NEXT function to the set The algorithm terminates when there are no more gener ators to process is empty. F ARD al gorithm performances are discussed in while its pseudo code is given by Algorithm Note that sub routines pseudo code is not given due to lack of available space R u GAR Algorithm 1 F ARD Input  fuzzy extraction context constraints, minsup Output begin 1 fuzzy itemsets for i  do return end Let us consider the fuzzy extraction context depicted by Table 3 In this context, each couple means that the object j is covered by the rule with a confidence equal to From such context, by applying the F ARD algorithm it is a possible to extract the fuzzy closed itemsets from which we derive fuzzy generic exact fuzzy association rules, which are depicted by Table 4 I Table 4 Exact fuzzy meta-association Rules set 4 Graphical visualization and cooperative ex ploration Let us keep in mind that given a generic association rule set, we aim to set up a graphical visualization prototype per mitting to enhance the man machine interaction by provid ing a contextual  knowledge   minimizing a boring large amount of knowledge exploration. To do so we construct a set of fuzzy meta rules, where both premise and conclusion rule's refer to classical association rules. The role of such fuzzy meta rules is to highlight  connections  between as sociation rules without loosing rule's confidence informa tion Here we come to a turning point: Why is it interesting to try to understand why a user a knowledge ex pert may be interested in a particular rule, and to deter mine what interesting information or knowledge, not ex plicitly requested, we could provide him, in addition to the proper answer Indeed, improving man machine inter action by emulating a cooperative behavior has been pro posed by some researchers through various techniques  In the author states  requestsfor data can be classi fied roughly into two kinds  requests and goals A specific request establishes a rigid qualification, and is con cerned only with data that matches it precisely A goal on the other hand, establishes a target qualification and is con cerned with data which is close to the target   For Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence ICTAI 2004 20.00 2004 C OM P U T E R SOCIETY 


 Table 3 meta-context and Demolombe  the basic idea is that when a person asks a question, he is not interested to know the answer just to increase his knowledge but he has the intention to real ize some action, and the answer contains or use ful information to realize this action In our context, when such additional knowledge is not supplied, this forces the user to retry a tedious rule exploration repeatedly, until ob taining a satisfactory matching The visualization prototype takes as input an XML file complying to the DTD depicted by Figure This stor ing format is argued by the fact that XML, the ble Markup Language, has recently emerged as a new stan dard for data representation and exchange on the Internet As output, the set of selected rules can be saved in a file with HTML or TXT format 1.0 encoding ISO 8 859 1  ELEMENT rule  ELEMENT rule premise   ELEMENT   ELEMENT   ELEMENT     premise item  conclusion  1 s t Ob ect s rule id ID REQUIRED rule conf CDATA #REQUIRED  premise id ID REQUIRED premise deg CDATA #REQUIRED  Figure 1 Associated DTD of accepted input XML file In the prototype interface Figure the user can select items that can both appear in the premise the conclusion part Once the minsup and minconf thresholds are fixed, the user can generate the desired rules. Both tex tual and graphical representation are provided. The user can further filter specific rules from the generated ones 4.0.1 The suitable visualization technique In the 3D histograms based visualization technique the shot depicted by Figure 2 Middle floor rows repre sent items and columns represent item associations The red and blue blocks of each column rule represent the premise and the conclusion, respectively 2  Item identities are shown along the right side of the matrix. The associated confidence and support are represented by a scaled histogram. While on 2D matrix based visualization technique, rule premise items are on one axis, and the rule conclusion items are on the other axis. We use the solution introduced by software allowing items in rule premise or con clusion, by grouping each of the items combinations in rule premise or rule conclusion as one unit. The confidence value is indicated by different colors. The higher the confidence value is, the darker the color. Currently, the user has to in dicate which visualization technique he \(she\prefers. How ever we are trying to set up an automatic indicator which can choose the most adequate visualization technique de pending on an assessment of the density of the extraction context. In fact, as indicated by experimental experiments on real life and synthetic extraction contexts whose parame ters are summarized by Table 5 when the extraction context is dense, generic association rules drawn from such context tend to present large conclusions \(depending on the num ber of items\in Table 6 we tried to assess, for mul tiple minsup values, the difference between the size of the minimal generator and the average size of its associated fre quent closed itemsets. the larger the difference is, the larger the generic conclusions association rule part. From the en tries dedicated to dense extraction contexts in Table 6 we remark that this difference is important comparatively to that pointed out in by sparse contexts. Therefore, when we consider sparse extraction contexts, the length of premise and the length of the conclusion of generic association rule tend to be equal Then given that it is known 3D histograms visualization technique is adapted to visualize rules with a small number of items in the conclusion part, we can 2 3 Available at In black and white displaying, red blocks are the dark ones while blue blocks are the clearer ones Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence ICTAI 2004 20.00 2004 c OM U T E R SOCIETY

 1   1   l  1 i 2  i  Hence the true frequency count of any item occurring on some input stream must be C  l  1 j  x 1  tc  j    j    where  is a small quantity 3  The number of items present in each input stream is thus n  C 4  Since synopses for d l  1  x input streams are transmitted through a node at level x  the load on the most heavily loaded link\(s is L  x  d l  2  x  n C  Clearly the maximum value of L  x  is achieved when   0  The expression for L  x  can be simplied to L  x  1  l  1 j  x 1  j  d x  j 1  Now our expression for the worst-case load on any link can be reduced to W  T    max x 0  1 l  2  L  x   We desire to minimize W  T   subject to the constraints  2   l  1  0 and  l  1 j 2  j   1 It is easy to show that this minimum is achieved when L 0  L 1    L  l  2  Solving for  2   l  1  we obtain  i   1  d  1  l  2   d  1 d  2  i  l  2 and  l  1   1  d  l  2   d  1 d  Translating to error tolerances we set  i   1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d for all 2  i  l  1  This setting of  2  l  1 minimizes worst-case communication load on any link We term this strategy MinMaxLoad WC Under this strategy the maximum possible load on any link is L wc   l  2   d  1 d d   1 counts per epoch Lastly we note that MinMaxLoad WC remains the optimal precision gradient even if nodes of the same level can have different  values Informally since with worst-case inputs all incoming streams have identical characteristics maximum link load cannot be improved by using non-uniform  values for nodes at a given level we omit a formal proof for brevity 2.1.4 Good Precision Gradients for Non-Worst-Case Inputs Real data is unlikely to exhibit worst-case characteristics Consequently strategies that are optimal in the worst case may not always perform well in practice In terms of minimizing the maximum communication load on any link the worst-case inputs are ones in which the set of items occurring on each input stream are disjoint When this situation arises a gradual precision gradient is best to use as shown in Section 2.1.3 Using a gradual precision gradient some of the pruning of frequency 3 Recall that we allow the frequency of an item to be a real number 4 More precisely each stream contains  n C  items of weight 1 each and one item of weight  n C  n C   Note that each input stream contains at most one item with weight less than 1 as stipulated earlier counts is delayed until a better estimate of the overall distribution is available closer to the root thereby enabling more effective pruning In the opposite extreme when all input streams contain identical distributions of item occurrences there is no benet to delaying pruning and performing maximal pruning at the leaf nodes as in strategy SS2 is most effective at minimizing communication In fact it is easy to show that SS2 is the optimal strategy for minimizing the maximum load on any link when all input streams are comprised of identical distributions we omit a formal proof Note however that SS2 still incurs a high space requirement on the root node R since it sets  1    We posit that most real-world data falls somewhere between these two extremes To determine where exactly a data set lies with regard to the two extremes we estimate the commonality between input streams S 1 S m by inspecting an epoch worth of data from each stream We compute a commonality parameter   0  1 as   1 m   m i 1 G i L i  where G i and L i are dened over stream S i as follows The quantity G i is dened as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i and also at least   S  times in S  S 1  S 2  S m  where  S  denotes the number of item occurrences in S during the epoch of measurement The quantity L i is dened as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i  Hence commonality parameter  measures the fraction of items frequent enough in one input stream to be included in a leaf-level synopsis by strategy SS 2 that are also at least as frequent globally in the union of all input streams A natural hybrid strategy is to use a linear combination of MinMaxLoad WC and SS2 weighted by   The strategy is as follows set  i 1       1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d        for 2  i   l  2  and  l  1 1       1  d  l  2   d  1 d         We term this hybrid strategy MinMaxLoad NWC for non-worstcase Commonality parameter  1 implies that locally frequent items are also globally frequent and SS2 modied to use  1   is a good choice Conversely  0 indicates that MinMaxLoad WC is a good choice For 0  1  a weighted mixture of the two strategies is best 2.1.5 Summary The precision gradient strategies we have introduced are summarized in Table 3 Sample precision gradients are illustrated in Figure 3 3 Experimental

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
