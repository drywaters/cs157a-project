 Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Machine Laming and Cybernetics Shanghai 26-29 August 2004 AN EFFICIENT MINING ALGORITHM FOR DEPENDENT PATTERNS JIAN-JTN ZHANG12 YOU-LIN RUA QING-HUA LI SHI-DA YANG Department of Computer Science and Technology 1 HuaZhon University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, 430074 China E-MAIL wahh0912@163.com kaval University of Engineering Wuhan 430033, China Abstract Since many current IDSs are constructed by manual encoding of expert 
knowledge updating of IDSs are expensive and slow It is very dear that the frequent patterns mined from audit data can be nsed as reliable intrusion detection models In this paper we propose efficiently parallel methods to extract an extensive set of features that descrihe each network connection and learn frequent patterns that accurately caphue.the behavior of intrusions and normal activities which areemploied to faditate model 
construction and incremental updates Keywords Intrusion Detection frequent patterns Updating 1 Introduction Securi of network system is becoming increasingly important as more and more sensitive information is being  stored and manipulated online Intrusion detection systems\(IDSs\has thus become a critical technology to help protecting these systems Most IDSs are based on hand-crafted signatures that are developed by manual encoding of expert knowledge These systems match activity on the system being monitored to known signatures 
of attacks The major problem with this zpproach is that these IDSs fail to generalize to detect new attacks or attacks without known signatures Recently there has been an increased interest in data mining-based approaches to building detection models for IDSs These models generalize from both known attacks and normal behavior in order to detect.unknown attacks Several effective data mining techniques for detecting intrusions have been developed However successful data miniig techniques are themselves not enough to create deployable IDSs There are multiple penetration 
points for intrusions to take place in a network system. Therefore it is imperative bat IDSs be updated frequently and timely While the accuracy is the  essential requirement of IDS its extensibility and adaptability are also critical in today's network computing environment At first data mining-based IDSs tend to be inefficient during both training and evaluation This prevents them from being able to process audit data and detect intrusions in real time Also these systems require large amounts of training datas and are significantly 
more complex than traditional systems Therefore parallel algorithms are required and a viable solution 2 Related Works There is empirical evidence that program executions and user activities exhibit frequent correlations among system features The goal of mining association rules is to derive correlations from a database table Association rule mining has become one of the core data mining tasks and has attracted tremendous interest among researchers and practitioners In recent years several algorithms have been proposed in the literature to address the problem of 
mining association rules One of the key algorithms Apriori algorithm is the foundation of most known algorithms whether sequential or parallel There are various methods to improve Apriori performance Apriori-like algorithms iteratively obtain candidate itemsets of size I from frequent itemsets of size k Each iteration requires a scan of the original database It is costly and inefficient to reptedly scan the database and check a large set of candidate for their occurrence frequencies Recently an FP-tree based frequent pattems mining method developed by Han 
achieved high efficiency compared with Apriori and TreeProjection algorithms It avoids iterative candidate generations. This algorithm creates a relatively compact tree-structure that alleviates the multi-scan problem and improves the candidate itemset generation The algorithm requires only two full U0 scans for the dataset In spite of the significance of the association rule mining and in particular the generation of frequent itemsets few advances have been made on parallelizing association rule mining algorithms.

The number of tuples created by this step is S  50  c  1   2  4   The rest of the steps create itemsets that should not participate in the count We create three different kind of tuples that break one implication condition The relative weight of each kind is 1  3 Generate   A  S   3 pairs  a i  b j  where each a i is different than all itemsets of A created before As in the previous step for each a i create at most c different b j  For each combination  a i  b j  write 50 tuples Then for each a i create eight b  j different than all b j s created before And write the eight tuples  a i  b  j   This step creates   A  S   3 new itemsets of A that should not participate in the implication count because they do not satisfy the minimum top-condence level although they satisfy both the minimum support and the maximum multiplicity constraint The number of tuples created by this step is   A  S   3  50  c  1   2  8   Generate   A  S   3 pairs  a i  b j  where each a i is different than all

count because they do not satisfy the minimum support requirement The number of tuples created by this step is   A  S   3  40 Shufe the output le This step just demonstrates that the operation of the algorithm is independent to the ordering of the tuples Estimate the implication count using algorithm NIPS/CI with a fringe size of four and also without a bounded fringe Perform one hundred such experiments and calculate the mean and the standard deviation of both estimations The total number of tuples for each experiment can be derived by adding the partial number of tuples created in each step For example for  A   10000 S  5000 and c  4 the average number of tuples for the corresponding experiment was 015 3  108  333 A minimum support of 50 tuples for this case corresponds to only 015  001 of the tuples demonstrating that in the implication count contribute even implications that hold for a very small number of tuples Figures 4,5 and 6 show the results for c  1  2  4 for varying cardinalities  A   The x-axis corresponds to the actual implication count of the dataset as that was imposed by the creation process The y-axis denotes the mean relative error as it is calculated by running one hundred experiments We used the following formula to estimate the mean relative error relative error   Actual S  Measured S  Actual S  Graphs Bounded Fringe express the experimental results for the case of a fringe with size F  4 while graphs Unbounded Fringe demonstrate the result for the case of an arbitrarily large fringe The error bars correspond to the statistical deviation of the mean error as that was computed by one hundred such experiments.The deviation is generally negligible which means that the error of the estimated S is always very close to the mean error We also observe that the difference between the estimation using a bounded fringe of size four and a unbounded one is negligible for a very wide range of implication counts and therefore a size of four for the fringe zone is sufcient to provide very accurate results for most applications 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Implication Count 0.05 0.06 0.07 0.08 0.09 0.1 Mean Error Bounded Fringe Unbounded

accurate estimates for distinct value queries and event reports This algorithm outperforms other estimators that are based on uniform sampling[8 9 e v e n when using much less sample space We also provide comparison with our Implication Lossy Counting ILC algorithm described in Section 5.1 which is based in the Lossy Counting algorithm introduced in For this series of experiments we used a real dataset of eight dimensions which was given to us by an OLAP company whose name we cannot disclose due to our agreement The cardinalities of the dimensions are presented in Table 3 The parameters of the algorithms are presented in Table 5 For NIPS/CI we used 64 concurrent bitmaps with a fringe size of four thus requiring memory enough to hold  2 4  1   64  K  1920 itemsets We expect that the averaging\([5 o v e r these man y bitmaps will result in an error less than 10 We used the exact same sample space for DS The bound parameter t for DS was set to  1920  50  following the suggestion in F o r ILC we used an approximation parameter   0  01 which increases the memory requirements of ILC relative to those of NIPS/CI or DS On the average ILC used more than twice the memory that NIPS/CI and DS used For example for the experiment in Figure 7\(B it used more than 8,000 entries We evaluate the results of the algorithms with respect to the number of tuples the cardinality of the participating dimensions and the implication conditions To simulate a real data stream scenario we tracked the conditional implication counts of A  B  E  F and the unconditional B  E using the aforementioned algorithms The rst workload corresponds to quite large compound cardinality while the second to very moderate cardinalities Table 4 presents the actual aggregates for various instances of the stream for   5 and  1  60 We believe that most workloads fall somewhere in the middle with respect to the complexity of the wanted implications and the size of the returned counts Figure 7\(A depicts the relative error as the stream evolves for workload A using the algorithms DS NIPS/CI and ILC for different implication parameters In Figure a we show the results for minimum support   5 and  1  60 or  1  80 The different  1 are encoded in the parentheses next to identication of the algorithm in the legend of the graph In Figure b we increased the minimum support to   50 We observe that the behavior of DS varies widely while NIPS/CI remains always below the expected 10 error DS actually keeps a sample of the distinct elements seen so far and tries to scale the implication count that holds for that sample to the whole set of distinct elements In most cases the data in the sample is not representative of the implication The situation for DS is exacerbated when the minimum support increases where quite a lot of samples do not participate in the count making the scaling even more errorprone Algorithm ILC in all cases returned very erroneous results although it used much more space than NIPS/CI and DS since it tries to store not the implication counts but the actual implicated itemsets In these workload the implicated itemsets overwhelm its available memory which is actually larger than the amount given to NIPS/CI and DS In gure 7\(B we present the results of the algorithms for workload B The situation is still in favor of NIPS/CI whose relative error remains always close to the expected 10 unlike DS who returns highly skewed errors even though the domain cardinalities are much smaller and therefore keeps in the sample space much more data As expected from the analysis the error guarantees of NIPS/CI are virtually unaffected by changes in the cardinalities or the number of tuples seen so far in the stream ILC returns very erroneous results although now the cardinalities and the implicated items are much smaller compared to those of workload A The reason is not only because it keeps too much information in memory i.e all the implicated itemsets while both NIPS/CI and DS only hold a mantissa for the count but also because the constraint    rel is broken as the number of tuples increases 7 Related Work There are unique challenges in query processing for the data stream model Most challenges are the result of the streams being potentially unbounded in size Therefore the amount of the storage required in order to get an exact size may also grow out of bounds Another equally important issue is the timely query response required although the volumes of data the need to be processed is continually augmented at a very high rate Essentially the amount of computation per data item received should not add a lot of latency to each item Otherwise any such algorithm wont be able to keep up with the data stream In many cases accessing secondary storage such as disks is not even an option In  there is a discussion of what queries can be answered e xactly using bounded memory and queries that must be approximated unless disk access is allowed Sketching techniques\([14 ha v e been introduced to build summaries of data in order to estimate the number F 0 of distinct elements in a dataset In three algorithms that      approximate the F 0 are described with various space and time requirements Distinct is dri v e n by hashing functions similar to those studied in 14 and provides highly accurate results for distinct value queries compared to those taken by uniform sampling by using only a fraction of their sample size In the algorithms Stick y Sampling and Lossy Counting are introduced that estimate frequency counts with application to association rules and iceberg cubes In a framework for performing set expression on continuously updated streams based on sketching techniques is presented In a general framework over multiple granularities is presented for both range-temporal and spatio-temporal aggregations In a framework for identifying hierarchical heavy hitters i.e hierarchical objects like network addresses whose prexes denes a hierarchy with a frequency above a given threshold is described The effect of impications between columns has been emphasized in the system that identies correlated pairs of columns and soft-dependencies and has been proved very useful in query optimization 8 Conclusions We have presented a generalized and parameterized framework that can accurately and efciently estimate implication counts and can be applied to many scenarios To the best of our knowledge this is the rst practical and truly scalable approach to the problem Proceedings of the 21st International

Figure 3a and 3b, is negative since CBA and PART achieved a higher classification rate against this particular dataset A comparison of the knowledge representation produced by our method, PART and CBA has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the set of rules derived. Figure 4 represents the classifiers generated form the hyperheuristic datasets. Analysis of the rules sets indicated that MMAC derives a few more rules than PART and CBA for the majority of the datasets. In particular, the proposed method produced more rules than PART and CBA on 8 and 7 datasets, respectively. A possible reason for extracting more rules is based on the recursive learning phase that MMAC employs to discover more hidden information that most of the associative classification techniques discard, since they only extract the highest confidence rule for each frequent item that survives MinConf Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 6. Conclusions A new approach for multi-class, and multi-label classification has been proposed that has many distinguishing features over traditional and associative classification methods in that it \(1 that contain rules with multiple labels, \(2 evaluation measures for evaluating accuracy rate, \(3 employs a new method of discovering the rules that require only one scan over the training data, \(4 introduces a ranking technique which prunes redundant rules, and ensures only high effective ones are used for classification, and \(5 discovery and rules generation in one phase to conserve less storage and runtime. Performance studies on 19 datasets from Weka data collection and 9 hyperheuristic scheduling runs indicated that our proposed approach is effective, consistent and has a higher classification rate than the-state-of-the-art decision tree rule \(PART and RIPPER algorithms. In further work, we anticipate extending the method to treat continuous data and creating a hyperheuristic approach to learn  on the fly   which low-level heuristic method is the most effective References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
