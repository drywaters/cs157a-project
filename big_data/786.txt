is a big challenge to design an effective scheduling algorithm for multimedia transmissions over a wireless channel that employs adaptive modulation and coding AMC On one hand the scheduling algorithm needs to schedule user trans\255 missions by taking advantages of the channel diversity so that the overall system performance 
Abstract-It 
can be improved On the other hand the algorithm also needs to maintain fairness among users and to provide QoS guarantee based on user requirements In this paper we propose a novel scheduling algorithm called QoS\255 based cross-layer scheduling algorithm QoS-CLS to address the aforementioned issues To maximize the system throughput the algorithm takes into consideration both the physical layer and data link layer information to schedule user transmissions Using the cross-layer information the scheduling problem is formulated into a Markov Decision Process MDP and the optimum decision policy based on the channel status traffic state and butter status of each traffic flow is pre-calculated by linear programming and 
stored in the system for scheduling in real-time Results show that QoS-CLS can greatly enhance the channel throughput compared to the opportunistic scheduling algorithm because of its cross-layer QoS consideration and the optimization method Moreover it can provide QoS guarantee and facilitate resource sharing among different traffic flows I

INTRODUCTION Adaptive modulation and coding AMC is widely used in today's wireless communication systems It 
in AMC-based systems can improve overall channel throughput by selecting the user with the best channel status to transmit such a strategy may result in unfairness and quality of service QoS degradation problems particularly for real-time traffic Hence there is a strong need to design a fair and efficient scheduling algorithm to support multimedia communications over AMC-based systems In recent years many scheduling algorithms have been proposed for AMC-based systems In the proportional fairness 1 and score-based 2 a weight is calculated for each user based on present or historical statistics of the channel quality and average throughput By doing so these algorithms seek to prevent any user from hogging the 
channel However these algorithms cannot provide a good service to real-time traffic because they do not consider the delay requirements of traffic flows In the modified proportional fairness 3 4 max carrier-to-interface ratio with early delay notification 5 and channel quality-based minimum throughput assurance 6 al\255 gorithms the delay requirements or current delays experienced by users are used to prioritize the traffic flows for scheduling purposes However they cannot precisely control the delay experienced by each packet Moreover they operate at the ex\255 pense of sacrifying system efficiency In 
7 the fundamental scheduling algorithm and the advanced scheduling algorithm AS A 
were proposed for non-realtime and realtime traffic re\255 spectively However the performance of ASA depends heavily on the effectiveness of a heuristic algorithm In 8 a weighted round-robin scheduling algorithm was proposed to distribute the average delay among different traffic flows by studying the queue dynamics Both 7 and 8 cannot provide precise QoS guarantee for realtime traffic flows In 9 the required QoS can be guaranteed However it must be used in conjunction with a very conservative admission control with which the system can satisfy the bandwidth requirement of all real-time traffic flows when all these users experience the worst channel status simultaneously Also it requires 
a large scheduling cycle which can be precisely shared proportionally among the traffic flows In this paper we propose a novel scheduling algorithm called QoS-based cross-layer scheduling QoS-CLS for serv\255 ing multimedia traffic flows in wireless networks with AMC Unlike other algorithms it is based on cross-layer considera\255 tions of QoS The modulation and coding pair we also call it mode in this paper is not selected based on the physical layer frame error ratio FER requirements only Instead it is selected to achieve the best frame loss ratio FLR or channel throughput using cross-layer information Here FLR is the total frame losses caused by frame drops at 
both the physical and data link layers Note that FLR is a key QoS parameter for the user application We present results to show that this cross layer consideration of QoS can greatly improve the channel throughput Another distinctive characteristic of QoS-CLS is that it can support QoS guarantee and maintain fairness while maximizing the channel throughput By analyz\255 ing the dynamics of the system we formulate the scheduling problem and the selection of AMC mode into a Markov Decision Process MDP with the aim of maximizing the channel throughput Then by transforming the MDP to a linear programming optimization problem we can add the required 


as l  J We assume that there are l  the transmission rate is d\(t E K W o  K and at most Qi frames can be transmitted in one TTL Without loss of generality we assume QoS constraints to guarantee the FLR of some specific traffic flows and/or to proportionally sharing the FLR among other traffic flows according to a fairness requirement To facilitate implementation the scheduling policy can be pre-calculated and applied later in real-time The remainder of the paper is organized as follows Section II presents the cross-layer consideration and the QoS provision method of QoS-CLS Section III introduces the system models used in this paper Section IV studies the basic dynamics of the system Section V illustrates the MOP model and the linear programming model for QoS-CLS Section VI presents the results and discussion Section VII concludes the paper II QUALITY OF SERVICE Multimedia traffic is usually delay sensitive In QoS-CLS a deadline-based buffering approach is used to serve the multimedia traffic Each multimedia data frame has a certain delivery deadline and the frame is dropped from the buffer if it cannot be sent when the specified deadline expires For other non delay sensitive traffic although the frames do not have any deadline they may also be dropped due to buffer overflow We define the fraction of frames dropped at the data link layer as the frame drop ratio FOR which is a key data link layer QoS measure In this paper we consider a system with data link retrans\255 mission capability In this case an error frame will always be returned to the buffer for retransmission if possible That means a frame is only dropped due to deadline expiration or buffer overflow In such system the total frame error or drop ratio experienced by upper layers which is defined as frame loss ratio FLR is effectively equivalent to FOR Note that if the FER of the physical channel becomes worse due to poor channel quality the FOR may also be increased because more retransmissions will effectively reduce the available bandwidth for normal transmissions thus increasing the chance of buffer overflow or deadline expiration On the other hand in a system without data link retransmission capability FLR is contributed by both FER and FDR Note that in such a system if the FER is getting worse because of the poor channel quality the FDR is not influenced but the total FLR is increased For multimedia traffic a QoS requirement can be specified by providing the desired FLR and maximum delay i.e the deadline In most AMC-based systems the physical layer QoS i.e FER and the data link layer QoS i.e FOR are handled separately Typically an AMC mode is chosen to keep the physical layer FER below the required threshold of the traffic flow Note that this is done without considering the FDR However this approach may not work effectively under certain situations For example if there are too many outstanding frames at the link layer it may be better to select the AMC mode with a higher transmission rate to clear the outstanding frames as quickly as possible Although the selection may cause the FER to increase the FDR may be greatly reduced to give a better overall system performance In QoS-CLR the AMC mode is not selected just to meet the FER threshold Instead it is decided by optimizing the total FLR of all traffic 2 flows while providing fairness As a result the overall channel throughput or system performance can be greatly enhanced Some other work also investigated ways to improve system performance by jointly considering FER and FDR In 10 and 11 the upper and lower signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio SINR bounds for each AMC mode were designed by studying the maximum retransmission time or the queue and channel dynamics of the system respectively However neither of these schemes make decisions based on the current buffer state Also they do not consider the scheduling problem In 12 a scheduling algorithm has been proposed for multi\255 code code division multiple access systems The current buffer status is utilized to determine the number of packets from each user to be transmitted in one TDMA frame so as to minimize an overall FLR However the decision depends only on the current buffer state and does not consider the traffic models or statistics Compared with the above algorithms QoS-CLS takes into account the dynamics of the channel state traffic state and buffer state of the system in order to implement an optimal decision policy Last but not least maintaining fairness is another important issue in a multi-user system QoS-CLS can operate based on different definitions of fairness First for some multimedia traffic which is not only delay sensitive but also FLR sensitive QoS-CLS can guarantee the FLR of such traffic flows below some preset thresholds Second for traffic flows without hard FLR guarantee requirements QoS-CLS adopts the propor\255 tional sharing of FLR which was also used in previous work 13 Note that 13 did not consider possible cross-layer optimization between FER and FOR III SYSTEM DESCRIPTION We consider the downlink scheduling in a wireless network employing AMC The system consists of a base station at the centralized cell site broadcasting to a number of mobile terminals in the cell Like in high speed downlink packet access HSDPA code division multiple access high data rate COMA-HOR or other third generation wireless networks employing AMC we assume that the downlink data channel is organized in fixed size transmission time intervals TIl with length R i possible modulation and coding pairs modes in the system For mode i E At the beginning of each TTl the system determines the traffic flow to be served and the AMC mode to be used for the TTL We also assume that an error-free feedback channel exists from each mobile terminal to the base station to convey the channel state information CSI and acknowledge successful transmissions To ensure the effective operation of the system we also consider that the system is provided with an appropriate admission control algorithm for admitting traffic flows and an effective traffic policing mechanism to shape the traffic flows We assume that there are J traffic flows in the system We also define the traffic flow scheduled for transmission in TTl t

dynamics and apply it in the QoS-CLS the Finite-State Markov Channel FSMC 17 model which has been widely used in today's research on wireless channels is employed in this paper Generally the channel

state of traffic flow where ti ti Also we define the average FER for level i frames or all the frames in the buffer whichever is less Among them those frames received with uncorrectable errors are returned to the buffer for retransmissions If a frame's expiration counter is 1 and it is not sent out or received correctly in the current TTl it is dropped from the buffer The expiration counters of all frames left in the buffers are decreased by 1 after the TTl Also some new frames may arrive to the buffers during the TTL In practice the buffer size is finite So we assume that all traffic flows are buffered separately and for traffic flow i at most TABLE I PARAMETERS FOR MODULATION AND CODING PAIRS IN AMC the channel quality can be described by a single parameter of received SNIR 200 for each TTL So the general Nakagami-m model which represents a large class of fading channels is used to model the channel 16 The received SNIR 200 of a traffic flow is a random variable with the density

is widely used to model different kinds of traffic such as video voice and best effort data In this paper we assume that traffic flow i in the current TTL Also from the I  R j has cPi,j,j the number

the buffering mechanism Figure 4 shows the throughput of all three schemes It is clear that QoS-CLR without FLR guarantee achieves the highest throughout because it optimizes the channel throughout without any constraints On the other hand QoS-CLS can achieve a throughput close to that of QoS\255 CLR without FLR guarantee and sharing It shows that to support the FLR guarantee the QoS-CLE only sacrifices a small amount of throughout The throughout of opportunistic scheduling is less than that of QoS-CLS by about 5 It is because the opportunistic scheduling scheme does not take into consideration the stringent delay requirements of real-time traffic Although for non real-time traffic the opportunistic scheduling scheme can achieve a very good channel efficiency it is not well suited for real-time traffic Last we evaluate the effectiveness of FLR sharing supported by QoS-CLR We still consider a system with two traffic flows as above However traffic flow 1 Sel Area Commun

for multimedia transmissions over wire\255 less channels with adaptive modulation and coding To satisfy user QoS requirements while maintaining fairness a cross\255 layer framework is used for scheduling user transmissions and selecting the appropriate AMC mode The scheduling problem is formulated into a MDP and solved by means of linear programming As a result the optimal scheduling policy can be pre-determined and stored in the system for scheduling in real-time Results show that QoS-CLS can achieve significant improvement in channel throughput as compared to the oppor\255 tunistic

What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.  It can be easily seen that in terms of memory technology for space, the selection is limited \226 especially so when it comes to non-volatile radiation hardened devices Part II 6  H IGH C APACITY S OLID S TATE R ECORDER  The impetus of this paper was the assignment to predict mass, power, volume, and cost for multi-terabit data recorders of the capacities shown in Table 3 with deliveries occurring in the year given [2   Table 3 - Data Recorder Capacity Requirements YEAR DATA CAPACITY 2010 2.88 Tb 2020 30 Tb 2030 130 Tb  This part of the paper presents a design of a 130 Tb NonVolatile data recorder which could be built for delivery in the year 2030, based on the information presented in Part I In developing the SSR design, technology selection was limited to the two technologies examined in detail in Part I Flash and NROM\nd a technology freeze date of 36 months in advance of delivery was assumed  SSR \226 Flash & NROM Based designs Table 4 - ITRS predicted device capacity \(Gb for three technologies Year 2015 2018 2021 2025 Technology CRAM 0.032 0.064 0.064 0.128 NROM 4 8 16 32 Flash 64 128 256 512  In this particular case, the year 2025 is selected as the freeze date and appropriate device capacity is used.  The ITRS is predicting that by the year 20 25, CRAM-based devices will have a capacity of 128 Mbit per die; NROM will have 32 Gb per die. Flash will be available at 512 Gb per die [9 Table  5 highlights the number of die necessary of three discussed technologies to achi eve a recorder of specified capacity in the timeframe given Table 5 - Minimum Device Count by Technology to achieve a Data Recorder of Specified Capacity in the Year shown.  \(Example, a 30 Tb recorder being designed in the year 2020 would require 468,750 CRAM devices or 1,875 NROM devices, or 118 Flash devices  Therefore, a 130 Tb data recorder designed using devices predicted available in the year 2030, would require the following number of devices \226 not including any additional devices used for Error Detection and Correction \(EDAC\ or sparing and word control 200  CRAM: > 1 million devices Year Recorder Capacity CRAM 4Mb NROM 1Gb Flash 16Gb 720,000 2,880 180 64Mb 16Gb 256Gb 468,750 1,875 118 128Mb 32Gb 512Gb 1.02E+06 4,063 254 Required Not Reqiured Required EDAC Technology / Device Capacity /Chip Count 2010 2020 2030 2.88 Tb 30 Tb 130 Tb 


 12  200  NROM: approx 4060 devices 200  Flash: approx 256 devices By examination, it can be easily seen that developing a high capacity data recorder as pr oposed using CRAM technology is impractical Error Detection and Correction Codes  All technologies are subject to lo ss of information, be they the loss of a single bit or the loss of an entire chip, the inclusion of Error Detection and Correction is an appropriate action by any system designer Just by using EDAC, there is an associated bit-penalty ranging from a few percentile to over 25 per cent   The exact selection of most-appropriat e Error Correction codes is highly dependent upon error phenomena not only for each  rt ain aspects of the exact part being considered as well as the environment to be encountered [2  25  F o r t h e reco rde r  de scri be d bel o w a Reed-Solomon code was selected.  It is important to note that this may not be the prime candidate, but was chosen for known characteristics Selection of a more appropri ate EDAC code [2 w oul d  most assuredly, bring about a reduction in recorder mass and power One final, important, distinction between the two prime technologies is required The NROM devices analyzed for this paper have built-in an incredibly powerful error detection and correction machine, capable of detecting four bits in error in a single word, and correcting three bits per word [10  W i t h th is m e th od t h e Bit Error Rate is calculated by the manufacturer to be less than 1.18E 19  errors/bit-day \226 equivalent to 3 unrecoverable bit errors every 550 years for the entire recorder; therefore, the package numbers presented here do not include extra devices required for EDAC other than that provided by the chip itself Table 6 - HC-SSR Basic Features 200  Redundant SpaceWire interfaces 200  Redundant Power Converters 200  Redundant Controllers/Supervisors 200  Multi-plane Non-volatile storage 200  Error detection and correction 200  Device isolation to the EDAC Word  Figure 18 - HC-SSR Conceptual Block Diagram

The recorder features cross-coupled SpaceWire interfaces as well as redundancy down to the memory plane Cross-coupled controllers w ith shared memory ensure operation without the need to re-build memory allocation tables should a fault occur Recorder Summary  Using conservative packaging techniques, two recorder designs were developed: one using Flash memory and the other using NROM.  A summary of their characteristics is provided in the tables below.  A more detailed discussion of design and implementation follows Board Design  Figure 19 - One side of 8Tb Memory Slice using NROM Technology The NROM-based solution is presented as Figure 19.  In the figure, nearly two hundred 2-Gbit NROM devices are installed on each face of the 9U card.  \(The whitespace is preserved in this example for passive components and design margin.\e time of this writing, the availability of chip-stacked NROM devices was uncertain and omitted from the trade space Design of a Flash-based memory card would be of similar ilk.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous
