In the example we imagine that a customer visiting the mall is engaged in several associations simultaneously The 223well-come\224 association with the mall may be activated occasionally throughout the visit according to the needs of customer or mall As an example the customer may need to find a toilet by assistance from the mall At the same time the customer may be engaged in associations with one or more shops as well as with friends and family also visiting the mall Individual associations support these engagements hut must be potentially active whenever needed Interleaved execution of the life cycles of such examples of associations ensure their coexistence and hence the service of the customer 5.6 Distributed and Centralized Sequencing Figure 18 Distributed and centralized sequencing As illustrated by Figure 18 left the sequencing rules for an association described so far are distributed at each role-the form is role-centric description.

two rooms being occupied at once, although compared to data outside the range of these graphics, the activity level is significantly higher between the relevant entrance events. The system thus reports visiting periods with relatively low confidences to reflect the level of uncertainty Several parameters within the visitor detection process can be changed, and by comparing data from further actual visits to detected visits, optimal values for each of our parameters can be reached So far however, too few actual visits have been identified with which to confidently determine adjustments that would increase accuracy in the majority of cases Aside from the activities already discussed, the recently extended sensor network has also provided the opportunity to infer further activities relating to food preparation and piped water usage, plus watching television and using the phone. However detailed validation information has only very recently become available, and the time-consuming examination and comparisons with sensor reported and inferred results continues along with development of their inference methods. However current observations indicate that phone usage is detected very accurately and television viewing is largely inferred correctly, although as these sensors record interaction with the devices, this is as expected Example Television Watching The major assumption made about watching television is that the client would be seemingly inactive for several minutes at a time, hence this is basically an adaptation from the inactivity detection Known Start Time Known End Time Inferred Start Time Inferred End Time 20/08/05, 17:15:33 17:23:40 20/08/05, 17:15:19 18:26:14 20/08/05, 17:24:58 18:26:18 20/08/05, 18:37:05 00:09:45  N/A N/A 20/08/05, 21:01:30 21:07:52  20/08/05, 21:01:45 21:08:42 20/08/05, 21:19:09 21:32:14  20/08/05, 21:14:20 21:32:03 20/08/05, 22:05:35 22:36:20  20/08/05, 22:08:12 22:33:19 The first watching period has had two separate periods inferred, as between these periods the client is very active presumably cleaning up after finishing the snack eaten during the first period The second short viewing period was not detected because the client was constantly active after a phone call and then left the room. The third period was detected very accurately, and the fourth period is only inaccurate in starting time because the client was reading a newspaper for five minutes whilst having the television on. The fifth inferred period is a slightly smaller than the actual period due to the high activity whilst the client settles down and later begins to leave the room Note that errors with determining television viewing occur because we have no knowledge as to whether or not the television is actually on nor can we tell if the client is actually looking at the television or just has it on in the background. We do have several methods for easily increasing the accuracy of these specific results, but more validation data needs to be examined before we can be justified in applying these methods to all the data CONCLUSIONS Telecare systems aim to carry out intelligent analyses of a persons wellbeing using data about their daily activities. This is a very challenging task for a number of reasons. First of all, the sensors were designed to be completely non-intrusive which excludes the use of any form of tagging for personal identification. This means that the decision reached by any analysis algorithm will always contain a degree of ambiguity in terms of the identity of the person performing an activity, and in terms of the number of people in the home at any one period of time The second issue is related to the fact that people tend to change their behaviour and perform unpredictable actions that cannot be learnt Combined with the type of sensors that can be used this means that the ability of the data analysis engine to make decisions has a significant error rate. For example, consider the bed sensors, which cannot distinguish between a person lying in bed from a heavy object placed on the bed. The fact is that no matter how many sensors are installed, the decision making process will always be associated with some uncertainty. This is why all the data is processed using the techniques of fuzzy systems 21 


which exploit the tolerance for imprecision and uncertainty The third factor is related to evidence collection for the purpose of learning and validation of the analysis results. In this project, simple diary style records are collected by occa sionally telephoning the client about their day over a period of several weeks, supplemented by a week of video footage where clients are filmed doing non-private activities in limited areas of their home. The problem with the diary records is that they introduce an element of intrusion that can become a nuisance for the clients after a period of time and leads to them not treating it seriously enough to record their activities correctly. As for the video evidence, cameras were not installed in bedrooms or bathrooms for privacy reasons and thus they provide an incomplete picture of the activities In spite of limited sensor information, we have shown that it is possible to answer the majority of questions regarding a persons behaviour and wellbeing. Periods of sleep and where the client leaves the home are easily monitored, allowing for effective normality modelling and long-term trend analyses of these periods Although many other important events such as preparing meals, preparing to go out, and hosting visitors have proved more difficult to accurately infer, the measures produced are still worthy of tracking over time. If for instance there is a decrease in the amount and confidence of visits detected, it is likely that visitor numbers have indeed dropped, and the rough data has thus served its desired purpose. Eliminating all uncertainties is clearly impossible with the sensors employed in this study, and it is likely that no matter what sensors are deployed in a fully non-invasive system, this problem will remain to a certain degree. The challenge therefore remains of how to extract the maximum amount of knowledge using a system that imposes a minimum level of intrusion REFERENCES 1 Website http://www.americantelecare.com 2 S. P.

1 client using UIR 100 clients using UIR 200 clients using UIR Figure 5. The percentage of reduced uplink requests scheme and the UIR scheme. Generally speaking, using our CMIP scheme, the percentage of reduced uplink requests increases as the cache size increases. After the cache size reaches 120, the percentage no longer changes. This can be explained as follows. As the cache size increases, more and more important data items having high access probability can be stored in the cache. When the cache size is still not large enough, the cache hit ratio will increase sharply when cache size increases. As a result, the rate of reduced uplink requests is higher than the arrival rate of new requests Thus, the percentage of reduced uplink requests has a trend of increasing. When the cache size is big enough to hold all the items within our prefetch sets, the rate of reduced uplink requests is no long signi?cant to the arrival rate of new requests. Hence, the percentage of reduced uplink requests no longer changes after reaching a certain cache size From Figure 5, we also notice that although the trend of the percentage of reduced uplink requests is increasing there are some ups and downs. For example, when the number of clients is 200, the percentage of reduced uplink requests reaches the peak when the cache size is about 50 As the cache size continues increasing, the percentage begins to decrease a little bit, and then it increases again. This can be explained as follows. As the cache size increases more queries can be served within the cache. So, the number of reduced uplink requests keeps increasing. Depending on the access patterns of the clients, the number of reduced uplink requests may increase at a rate higher or lower than the increase of the number of requests. If the rate is higher, the percentage of reduced uplink requests will increase. If the rate is lower, the percentage will decrease instead. Thus, there are some ups and downs in the percentage of reduced uplink requests, although the trend is increasing Figure 5 also shows that our CMIP scheme outperforms the UIR scheme with various cache sizes and various number of mobile clients. The percentage of reduced uplinks using the CMIP scheme is twice as much as that of usProceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE ing the UIR scheme. In term of percentage of reduced uplink request, even the worst case of the CMIP scheme is better than the best case of the UIR scheme. For instance the CMIP scheme has the worse performance when there is one mobile client and the percentage of reduced uplinks is about 6% \(7.5% at best achieves its best performance when there are 200 mobile clients with about 3% of reduced uplinks. This is because the CMIP scheme can better predict the future access of the clients and prefetch them in advance than the UIR scheme Hence, the CMIP scheme can reduce the uplink requests at a percentage much higher than the UIR scheme 3.2.3. The Percentage of Additional Traf?c. The percentage of additional traf?c is de?ned as the ratio of the number of prefetches from the broadcast channel to the number of requests. As we know, downloading a data item from the channel also consumes a lot of system resources such as the bandwidth and the power. So the prefetch scheme should not do aggressive prefetching; otherwise it will consume too much system resources. This is especially important in mobile environments, where the system resource is very limited One argument about this metric is that the percentage of additional traf?c depends on the number of requests that are quite application-dependent and it does not make much sense to compare on this metric. We argue that this met 


sense to compare on this metric. We argue that this metric, when combined with other metric, such as the cache hit ratio, can well describe a prefetch scheme  s ef?ciency and predictability. A good prefetch scheme should be able to improve the cache hit ratio without incurring too much additional traf?c \(or prefetches pares the two schemes in term of the percentage of additional traf?c Figure 6\(a more additional traf?c to the system. For example, the percentage of additional traf?c for UIR scheme is up to 20 when there are 200 clients. This is because the UIR scheme is an aggressive prefetch scheme. Whenever a data item within the cache has been updated and is broadcasted on the channel, the client will download it and update the cache But for the CMIP scheme, the percentage of additional traf?c to the system is negligible, as shown in Figure 6\(b example, the percentage is lower than 0.5% when cache size becomes larger than 100. Why the percentage of additional traf?c is so small is due to the characteristic of our CMIP scheme. Using the CMIP scheme, only those data items which are within our prefetch sets are prefetched The data items within prefetch sets are got from association rules with a high con?dence and support. So the set of data items to be prefetch is small and the number of prefetches is also small. This explains why the percentage of additional traf?c is negligible Figure 6\(c percentage of additional traf?c when there are 200 mobile clients. From 6\(c curs only a fraction of 20 of the percentage of additional traf?c incurred by the UIR scheme. By far, we can say that our CMIP scheme is much better than the UIR scheme and the NOPRE scheme in terms of increased cache hit ratio reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c 4. Related Work In the literature, prefetch technique is widely employed to reduce the access latency in WWW environments [17 16, 8, 12, 9]. [17] presents a predictive prefetching scheme for the World Wide Web in which the server tells the clients which ?les are likely to be requested by the user, and the clients decide whether to prefetch these ?les or not based on local considerations \(such as the contents of the local cache  posed. This scheme predicts the ?les  future access probabilities based on the access history and the network condition. The scheme allows the prefetching of a ?le only if the access probability of the ?le is greater than a function of the system bandwidth, delay and retrieval time. In [9], Cohen and Kaplan investigate three other types of prefetching in web: pre-resolving host-names \(pre-performing DNS lookup prefetching TCP connections prior to issuance of HTTP request sending a  dummy  HTTP HEAD request to Web servers  velops a new method for prefetching Web pages into the client cache. Clients send reference information to the Web server, which aggregates the reference information in nearreal-time and then disperses the aggregated information to all clients, piggybacked on GET responses. The information indicates how often hyperlink URLs embedded in pages have been previously accessed relative to the embedding page. Based on the knowledge about which hyperlinks are generally popular, clients initiate prefetching of the hyperlinks and their embedded images according to any algorithm they prefer Most of these work were not designed for mobile environments and did not consider the constraints of mobile environments. Recently, several prefetch schemes have been proposed as a client-side technique to reduce the access latency in mobile environments [1, 13, 6, 19]. In [1], a simple prefetching heuristic, called PT, computes the value of 


ple prefetching heuristic, called PT, computes the value of a page by taking the product of the probability \(P cessing of the page with the time \(T fore that page appears on the broadcast again. PT ?nds the page in the cache with the lowest pt value and replaces it with the current broadcast page if the latter has a higher pt value. However, this time-based prefetch scheme is expensive to implement since it computes the pt for each item in Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 0 5 10 15 20 0  50  100  150  200  250  300 Th e pe rc en ta ge o f a dd iti on al tr af fic Cache size 1 client using UIR 100 clients using UIR 200 clients using UIR 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 0  50  100  150  200  250  300 Th e pe rc en ta ge o f a dd iti on al tr af fic Cache size 1 client using CMIP 100 clients using CMIP 200 clients using CMIP a b 0 5 10 15

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
