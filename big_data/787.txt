Abstract-In 
order to accelerate imaging process and lower overall system cost many practical CT systems use single slice detectors and big-pitch helical scanning especially in next generation Baggage Scanning system In this paper we present a reconstruction strategy for this kind of systems We researched on the imaging qualities resulting from different scanning parameters especially the thickness of the detectors The experimental study is both 
on simulation data and experimental data We found out that reconstruction results from relatively thicker detectors are better than those from thinner detectors We also compared post-processing methods of single dimensional smoothing and multi-dimensional smoothing in improving the imaging quality for such resulting reconstructions from single\255 slice-detector helical CT SSDHCT Finally an implementation scheme of the reconstruction algorithm and post-processing using the latest GPU is presented We achieve a 10 times speedup and the performance meets the requirement for practical applications At last we produced a sample machine using this technique and get some real baggage

INTRODUCTION 
Single Slice Detector Helical scanning GPU parallel CT reconstruction 
is a wonderful memory to China and the whole world A lot of people devoted much in this event We should also know that the success of the Olympic not only relies on the effort of athletes volunteers and organizers but also on the sound and safe environment guaranteed by the advanced security system The baggage scanning is used widely 
in nowadays security inspection especially since the last 10 years But recognition can't be done automatically on the overlapped image from a DR inspecting system CT type baggage scanning system becomes a good option To lower system cost and make the device compact some of the resent baggage CTs use single slice detectors With the limited thickness of detector slice and requirement of high throughput the pitch of such a helical CT is usually big The targeted advantage is clear lower price fewer data storage shorter scanning time and lower radiation dose 4 However the projection data is seriously incomplete usually 1/20th 
255 1/40th of the complete data acquired by traditional helical CT systems Therefore different from the traditional systems Manuscript received November 10 2008 This work was supported grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China No 10575059 No 60772051 and No 60871084 Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University NCET the Key Faculty Supporting Program of Tsinghua University Department of Engineering Physics Tsinghua University Beijing China Key Laboratory of Particle

answered in this kind of system 1 While the pitch is fixed in order to get a better quality how do we decide the thickness of the detectors What processing methods will improve the image quality 2 How can we accelerate the reconstruction and post processing to meet real-time applications such as interactive visualization and some vision tasks This paper addresses on three main issues we worked on for the fast SSDHCT imaging Firstly we briefly illustrate a helical CT reconstruction algorithm using a look up table to get an approximate volumetric reconstruction secondly examination on different detector thickness and post\255 processing methods 
are illustrated at last all the operations are implemented using GPU and the method is tested on a real sample machine II EFFECT OF DETECTOR THICKNESS AND POST-PROCESSING To study the effect of detector thickness on image of reconstruction we did experiments on two choices of detector The results are shown in Fig.1 and Fig.2 In Fig the reconstruction is from a full helical scan with multi-slice detector The projection data are as many as 160M bytes Fig.2 is the reconstruction using single slice detector CT of thin and thick detector There are only 8M bytes data in projection which are only

be distinguished by the detector the structure can be seen clearly in the reconstruction without being disturbed by artifacts In the baggage scanning application our purpose is to discover the danger which is usually a scale region of a special material so the result may satisfy our requirement In order to make the result more recognizable a smoothing filter should be applied after reconstruction In our work we examined the effects of two kinds of filters a Z axis smooth kernel and a three dimension smooth kernel 1.04 1.03 1.02 Figure 5 profile at z=140 Fig.6 Pipeline of GPU-LUT Back Projection As we can see in Figure 3 4 and 5 the filtering result from three dimension smoothing is better than the result from smoothing along Z axis only After filtration the artifacts can be much reduced and give a much improved reconstruction After the LUTBP on GPU the result is stored in a 30\255 texutre 0 three dimensional image smoothing can also be directly implemented on the GPU right away and the result can be shown immediately through ray casting or other volume rendering method Thus all the data processing is completed within GPU We compared the performance on speed between a CPU and a GPU Obviously the GPU gains more than 10 times speed-up plane for the volumetric results corresponding to Figure 2\(a Figure 2\(b Figure 3\(a and Figure 3\(b b Fig.3 post processing reconstructions by smoothing a smooth on axis _  _ L P\(A\(z,B x,y,B A 255 2  Z arctan  X-Z Blue GPU In order to fit the GPU pipeline we use a lookup table in the back projection LUTBP  2 On a CPU the lookup table will faster the helical CT reconstruction to some extend but on a GPU it can be used to achieve a big amount of speed-up[5 Since the calculation of every pixel in every slice is independent in the LUTBP the computation can be easily paralleled We implement it on a GPU so that the processing will be executed in 128 cores at the same time The pipeline of GPU based LUTBP is shown in Fig.6 c d Fig.4 Central slice image on Right smooth three dimensionally 3331 dsin\(y+B  f\(x,Y,z   b+d*cos\(y+B 0.5 a U Red after smoothing III ACCELERATING THE RECONSTRUCTION ON Green result before

 National Identity Register part of scenarios If you choose to have an ID card, your biometric identification, along with information like your name, date and place of birth, current and all previous addresses and driving licence number and expiry date \(along with other relevant information\ would be stored in a centralized government database. This database would be held securely by the Government, and could be queried by all other government departments, the police, public service providers \(e.g. NHS\ and approved private sector organizations \(e.g. banks employers   When participants accessed the front page of the study \(which contained basic information and contact details about the researchers\ey were randomly directed to one of the three different scenarios. Thus each participant only responded to a single scenario  Following the scenario, participants were asked If this were the way in which ID cards were to be introduced, what would your attitude towards identity cards in the UK be and How certain are you about your attitude towards ID cards if this scenario were the one introduced using the same scales for the prescenario measures. A measure of attitude shift was calculated by subtracting the scenario attitude score from the pre-scenario attitude, such that a negative score meant a shift against ID cards, and a positive score, a shift in favor of ID cards. Participants were also asked In this scenario, to what extent would you consider yourself to have been forced to comply to receive an identity card This question was answered using a 7-point scale anchored at Not at all forced  and Very forced   On the final page of the study, participants completed a short measure to test their privacy attitudes eir tru s t in  the UK Gov e r n m e n t t h r ee  questions, see below\ and the perceived threat to their privacy of the ID Card proposals \(two questions, see below  3.3 Trust in the UK Government   Participants completed three questions The United Kingdom Government can be trusted  The United Kingdom Government is competent enough to create a secure Identity Card system and The United Kingdom Government is motivated by the desire to protect its citizen's best interests using a 4 point scale anchored at Strongly Agree  Somewhat Agree  Somewhat Disagree and Strongly Disagree No neutral option was provided to reduce satisficing These items cover three dimensions often associated with the measurement of trust: general trust competence and benevolence. The trust scale had an alpha of .82, showing acceptable internal reliability  3.4 Perceived Privacy Threat of ID Cards   Participants also completed two items designed to measure the perceived privacy threat of ID cards The introduction of Identity Cards in the UK is a threat to people's personal privacy and Data collected as part of the Identity Card system would be treated confidentially Reversed\sing the same 4-point Likert scale for Trust. The perceived privacy items had an alpha of .60, showing low but acceptable internal reliability for a two item scale  As would be expected, the privacy and trust scales were correlated \(r = .71, p<.001\onfirmatory factor analysis using principal axis factoring with a forced two factor solution and Oblimin rotation supported the creation of two scales  4. Results and Discussion   A manipulation check was conducted to see if the level of perceived compulsion differed across scenarios. There was a main effect of scenario on perceived compulsion F 2, 390\31.2 p 000 Post hoc Scheffe tests confirmed that the UKG implementation led to higher perceived compulsion scores \(Mean = 5.99\pared to the Lords  amendment version \(Mean = 4.56 p 001\d the LSE version \(Mean = 4.01 p 001\he Lords and LSE scenarios did not differ significantly in their level of perceived compulsion p 25  4.1 Politics and OU groups general attitudes   The initial attitudes of the politics and student groups differed significantly in both their attitudes towards ID Cards, the certainty with which they held those attitudes, their trust in the UK Government, the perceived privacy violation posed by ID Card proposals, and their general privacy concerns \(see Table 1  Participants in the politics groups were more antiID Cards, held these attitudes with greater certainty distrusted the government more, perceived ID cards as a greater threat to privacy, and had greater general privacy concerns. However, even amongst OU students, who on average were in favor of ID cards levels of distrust in the UK Government and the perceived privacy threat of ID cards were still relatively high Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5

Scenarios and attitude change   In the following analyses, the responses of the politics participants and the OU students are analyzed separately  The presentation of different implementation scenarios did not have a significant effect on attitude change F 2, 214\ 1.20 p 31\ or the certainty of the later attitude F 2, 213 p 82\ongst the student participants   The presentation of different implementation scenarios also did not have a significant effect on attitude change for the politics groups F 2,172\ = .97 p 38\ Interestingly, attitude change towards ID cards was positive when the LSE scenario was presented \(the only positive shift in any condition  However, the scenario presented did have an impact on the certainty of the later attitude F 2, 172 3.20 p 04\bers of the politics groups were less certain of their attitude when faced with the LSE approach \(Mean = 5.95, SD=1.83\, compared to the Lords amendment \(Mean = 6.46, SD=1.36\d the UK Government approach \(Mean = 6.62, SD=1.29  4.3. Trust in Government, privacy attitudes and ID Cards   As noted earlier, the two groups of participants had differing attitudes towards the Government, ID cards and general levels of privacy concern. A linear multiple regression was calculated in order to examine the impact of the perceived privacy threat of ID cards general privacy concerns and  levels of trust in the government on respondents post-scenario attitudes. A regression was first calculated to examine the impact of age, gender and source \(politics groups vs. students on post-scenario attitudes. Age and gender were not significant, but source did significantly predict postscenario attitudes  40, p<.001\. As such, the source of the participants \(political groups vs students\nd their pre-scenario attitudes were entered into the regression equatio n as control variables. The results of the analyses are shown in Table 2  Table 2: Multiple regression: Dependent variable: Post-scenario attitude toward ID Cards \(R 2 75, p<.000  Variable  t p Politics vs. Students 01 18 86 Pre-scenario attitudes 51 10.69 00 Pre-scenario attitude certainty 06 2.20 .03 Presented scenario 02 69 49 Perceived compulsion in scenario 14 -4.10 .00 Distrust in Government 11 2.67 01 Perceived privacy threat of ID cards 26 -5.65 .00 Mean Westin Score 01 32 75   As might be expected, participants attitudes towards Identity Cards, and the certainty with which they held those attitudes, predicted their attitudes postscenario. Interestingly, the actual scenario presented did not predict their attitudes post-scenario, whereas the perceived level of compulsion presented by the scenario did Finally, respondents level of distrust in the government, and the perceived privacy threat posed by Identity Cards also predicted post-scenario attitudes  The results of the regression also suggest that the level of political involvement of the respondent is not in itself important rather, it is the attitudes towards the UK Government \(UKG\d the privacy implications of ID Cards that explain the differences between the groups reported earlier  Once pre-scenario attitudes were taken into account, the next strongest predictor of attitudes Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


towards ID Cards was the perceived privacy threat of the ID Card proposals, followed by the perceived degree of compulsion involved in ID Cards. As reported earlier, the UKG approach was seen as involving the highest amount of compulsion, although given that scenario type was not significant, we should also assume an affective component to this evaluation alongside the content of the scenarios. Third, the level of distrust in the UKG also predicted post-scenario attitudes to ID Cards, such that higher levels of distrust led to more negative attitudes. Finally, the certainty with which pre-scenario attitudes were held also predicted post-scenario attitudes if pre-scenario attitudes were less certain, this led to more negative attitudes after the scenario was presented  The results of the regression strongly suggest that privacy concerns associated with ID Cards, distrust of Government and perceived compulsion of the implementation, significantly predict people s attitudes towards ID Cards. These results are in keeping with considerable research within the Human-Computer Interaction and e-commerce fields that have highlighted the importance of trust in people s response to privacy threats. That perceived compulsion was also a significant predictor, while scenario type was not, strongly suggests an affective element to control as best expressed by the LSE scenario  4.4: Privacy, Trust and Attitudes to ID Cards   The mediation of perceived privacy threat by trust on attitudes towards Identity Cards was tested using a series of regression equations     Figure 3: Privacy Trust mediation \(*** = p<.001   The direct effect \(standardized estimate perceived privacy threat on attitudes was -.78 \(p<.001 when tested alone, and -.61 \(p<.001\hen tested alongside distrust. This pattern of results suggests that the impact of perceived privacy is partially mediated by trus t th at a s t ron g direct ef f ect re m a i n s t h at  is not mediated \(see Figure 3  To investigate a possible moderator relationship between these variables, a multiplicative composite was created by multiplying perceived privacy threat with distrust e n bot h t h e i n depen d e n t a n d  dependent variables are continuous \(and a moderator relationship is suspected to be linear\mmon to create a moderator variable \(called a multiplicative composite\d then to enter it into a multiple regression alongside the predictor variable \(X\d the moderator \(Z e  m oderator v a riable i s  significant, this suggests that there the impact of X on Y is moderated by Z \(although there may still be direct effects between the predictor variable and the criterion variable\his regression equation predicted 65% of people s attitudes towards ID Cards, with the composite variable also adding significantly to the prediction \(see Figure 4 for Standardized estimates of effect sizes and the R 2     Figure 4: Privacy X Trust moderation p<.01, *** = p<.001   The moderation analyses show that while citizen s privacy concerns and trust have a direct impact on attitudes towards the implementation of Identity Cards in the UK, there is also an interaction between privacy and trust  To examine the nature of this interaction in more detail, the privacy and trust variables were median split into high and low trust and privacy concern, and a twoway, between-subjects ANOVA conducted. The interaction between privacy and trust was significant  F 1, 386\6.60 p 0.00\. The pattern of this interaction is illustrated in Figure 5  The interaction suggests that for those who considered Identity Cards to be a threat to their privacy, level of trust in the Government had little impact on their attitudes. However, for those who were more ambivalent about the privacy threat of ID Cards  Perceived privacy threat Distrust in Government R 2 51 Post-scenario ID Card attitudes R 2 64 61 24 71 Perceived privacy threat Distrust in Government Post-scenario Identity Card attitudes 59 53 65 Privacy X Distrust composite 96 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


the level of trust was critical in determining their attitudes. Specifically, in this group low levels of trust led to negative attitudes towards ID Cards, and high levels of trust led to more benign, positive attitudes   0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 High trust Low trust Level of trust in Government ID Card attitudes High Privacy threat Low Privacy threat  Figure 5: Privacy X Trust Interaction  5. General Discussion   According to the UK Information Commissioner the United Kingdom faces the prospect of sleepwalking into a surveillance society  ter m s  of e-government, citizen privacy concerns pose a substantial obstacle towards the implementation of data sharing, identity management schemes and verifiable authentication [7, 15, 38, 39  T h e resu lts of the  present study provide a number of important and novel insights into people s privacy concerns and their attitudes towards the implementation of Identity Cards in the UK. First, although the different methods of implementation did not differ significantly in terms of attitude change, they did have an impact on citizens  perceived compulsion. This suggests that issues of control and compulsion have an affective component as well as one as outlined in systems design. This is important since the affective component is likely to be influenced by people s sense of control and compulsion, rather than their actual level of control Successful e-government initiatives should seek to not only provide control to citizens, but should also make them feel in control  The relationship between the perceived privacy threat of ID cards and opposition to them was strong suggesting that e-government initiatives that collect data on citizens may encounter considerable opposition if the data collection is perceived as impinging on personal privacy. This was supported by both the regression analyses and the ANOVA. When there was a high perceived privacy threat, levels of trust did not moderate attitudes towards ID Cards. Only when the perceived privacy threat was felt less keenly by participants did trust impact on their attitudes towards ID Cards  This finding is important since we usually assume that privacy fundamentalists will generally oppose any e-government system that poses a privacy threat and the privacy unconcerned perhaps won t worry regardless e v e r privacy pragmatists are likely to judge a particular system in light of not only its costs and benefits, but also in relation to the potential data collector. The evidence in favour of moderation suggests that combining privacy threat with low levels of trust creates a particular impetus towards opposition something that may swing pragmatists towards opposition   5.1 Implications for e-government   As noted, once e-government systems are developed beyond information portals, there is an increased need for the collection of personal information, data sharing between departments and databases, and authentication of individuals and their entitlements. There are a number of methods available to develop e-government in a privacy friendly way e.g. through trusted third parties or identity management systems\. The results of the present research strongly suggest that the developers of egovernment ignore issues of privacy at their peril. In particular, trust would seem to be the keystone in terms of building e-government systems that request or reuse personal information. This trust can take the form of competence \(e.g. in the development of systems or the protection of personal information\, or in the integrity of the Government itself. However, the absence of trust is likely to render even privacyfriendly e-government initiatives unsuccessful  5.2 Implications for privacy and trust research   Privacy has been described as a concept in disarray  40 In part this is due to one of the strengths of the research area its multi-disciplinary nature but also because privacy can refer to so many different contexts and meanings 28 The research presented here strongly suggests that the interaction between privacy concern and trust is critical to understanding people s responses to a potential privacy threat Specifically, the creation and testing of the multiplicative composite provided strong evidence that the combination of low trust with privacy threat leads to a stronger reaction than would be expected by examining just privacy and trust independently  Theoretically, there are good reasons to assume that the combination of low trust with privacy threat poses a unique threat to peoples acceptance of a Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


technology. For inst des cribes a self boundary the boundary  around the person modified by the disclosure of personal information and a dyadic boundary that ensures the disclosers safety from leakage of information to uninvited third parties. The self boundary may be open or closed depending on such interpersonal factors as the level of trust in a disclosure target  In the present research, the combination of privacy concerns and low trust may have replicated a situation in which the self boundary is open \(i.e. information is recognized as at risk\he impermeability of the dyadic boundary is open to question \(i.e. information may be leaked to a third party or misused analysis suggests the possible benefits of applying insights from interpersonal interaction to the interactions between citizens and governments … if, as suggested by some, we are moving towards an era of personalized e-government then t h ere a r e clear  privacy implications [14, 45 ide t h e need to  consider issues of trust in terms of citizen-state interactions [11    5.3 Limitations and future research   In the present research, a single aspect  identification and authentication - of citizens relations with the state were studied. The case of ID Cards poses a number of issues in terms of generalizability that will need to be tested. First, the potential costs and benefits of ID cards in the UK are hotly contested, suggesting that not all respondents conceptions of the scenarios were similar. The importance of each individual s own interpretation was seen in the non-significance of the compulsion scenarios, and the importance of perceived compulsion, on attitudes towards ID Cards. Given that at the time of the research the legislation was being discussed in depth in the UK media, perhaps it is not surprising that people came to the study with preexisting attitudes that were stronger than the manipulated scenarios  6.
