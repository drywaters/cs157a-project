  Data Mining Application in Designin g Popular and Optimal Travel Packages   Bashar Al-Salim Industrial and Management Syst ems Engineering Department University of Nebraska- Lincoln Email: bashar@bigred.unl.edu   Abstract  We developed a strategy to design a travel package with the most popular and appropriate elements for the traveler; at the same time, this strategy minimizes the operation and processing costs of the travel agency. Association rules as a data mining technique is implemented to develop this model.  We rely on the available massive travel agency database to 
make essential decisions related to the optimality of designing the travel package. A heuristic algorithm is an approach used to solve the final model. An illustrative numerical example based on a made-up data set is also provided   1. Introduction  Travel agencies in todayís competitive market are on the spot to deliver the most suitable travel package promotion to custom ers. The suitable travel package assumes that it has the right, highly demanded elements flight tickets, hotel reservations, rental cars 
and entertainment event tickets. The discounted travel package, the long-established marketing tool to increase the market share, is becoming incapable of contending in the highly competitive travel environment. Hence new cutting-edge strategies in marketing and operations are coming into sight to accomplish the mission of satisfying customers, while at the same time making a reasonable profit.  In this paper, we present a strategy to design a travel package with the most popular and appropriate elements included in the package, while 
simultaneously minimizing operating and processing costs. Given that data mining refers to the process of the extraction of hidden predictive information from large databases, we deliver a strategy that implements a common data mining technique association rules  which will be discussed later in this paper.  We expect essential decisions could be made based on the massive travel agency database A standard travel package under investigation 
includes one or more of the following elements: flight reservations, a hotel reservation, car rental, and tickets to entertainment events.  There are two types of flight reservations: round-trip and one-way trip. There are three levels of hotels in which to make reservations first-class hotels \(4 or 5 star\econd-class hotels \(less than 4 star\d motels. Moreover, we assume that entertainment events include mainly the following five items: sporting event tickets, performing arts tickets museum tickets, cruise trips, and dining events.  These 
elements have the dependency characteristics existing among some or all of them, e.g. customer most likely requests a hotel for every night between arrival and departure of the flight. It is clear that we have too many possible combinations for designing a travel package An example of a possible design for a travel is having a travel package that includes a two-way flight ticket motel reservation, and dining event. This huge number of travel packages is hard to offer and to maintain from 
a profit point of view and/or administration point of view. Hence, we will develop, according to our knowledge, the first cutting-edge strategy that investigates the optimality of designing travel packages offered by travel agencies  2. Relevant works  Heung and Ch n v e st i g at ed t h e m o s t  important factors for selecting a travel agency that offers all-inclusive travel packages. Their study results showed that formal communication and pricing factors are 
significant in the travel agency selection process. In this paper, the pricing factor stimulated our objective function to be focused on operations and processing cost reduction. Consequently, that will increase the likelihood of the travel agency to be selected as a service provider  Agard and Kusiak trod u ced a m odel f o r  selection of subassemblies based on the analysis of prior 


orders received from the customers.  They implemented the data mining approach by using the association rules technique to extract the hidden relationship between the subassembly modules of wire harness automotive parts The research in this paper broadens the application from the manufacturing sector to the service sector by generalizing Agardís and Kusiakís approach and then applying the same scheme to the designing of the travel package problem  3. The Model  Our procedure for solving the problem mentioned above in the problem section consists of a two-stage analysis. The first stage is based on taking advantage of data mining teachings ñAssociation Rules to eliminate unfavorable travel packages. Finding the hidden relation in the travel agency database is an efficient way to find which travel package elements go together and which do not.  The Association Rules technique will reduce the number of travel package combinations. This is a necessary goal of a travel agency since it will focus the travel agencyís efforts and resources toward promoting fewer but more popular travel packages.  Then, the second stage of the analysis is an optimization model for minimizing operation and processing costs of the remaining travel packages.  The expectations of this analysis are a set of highlydemanded, profitable travel packages  3.1 Nomenclature  The following nomenclature will be used in this paper Indices i travel package index j element index, the values of j index are presented in Table 1 Table 1: Element index Parameters n: number of available travel packages m: number of available elements TPi : travel package i A i set-up cost for processing a travel package Pi L i losses in sale costs due to having travel package Pi T i Incremental advertising and promotion costs for travel package TP i  I ij indicator function for having the element j in the travel package TP i Mathematically   Otherwise TP package travel the in item an is j entry If I i ij  0 1  Decision variable i TP I indicator function for selecting or not selecting the travel package TP i Mathematically   chosen not is TP package travel if chosen is TP package travel If I i i TP i  0  1   3.2 Stage I Analysis  Association Rules is considered one of the most popular data mining techniques. It is a data mining technique where rules are extracted out of the database and then ordered based on the percentage of times they are correct and how often they apply.  It captures the relation among events in a database and it takes the form of: if event A \(called antecedent event\rred then event B \(called consequent event\will happen with a certain probability. Symbolically B A and it is read A implies B. The two main concepts that determine the outline of the association rules are: 1 Accuracy  accuracy refers to the probability that if the antecedent is true then the precedent will be true.  High accuracy means that this is a rule that is highly dependable. 2 Coverage Coverage refers to the number of records in the database that the rule applies to.  High coverage means that the rule can be used very often and also that it is less likely to be a spurious artifact of the sampling technique or idiosyncrasies of the database \(internet reference\ome literature, accuracy is called the confidence of the rule and coverage is called the support. A classic example of association rules is the analysis of convenience store data that showed customers often buy diapers and beer together Consequently, it is a brilliant idea to consider putting the two together in order to increase cross-selling   In this paper, the best set of travel packages TP i will be determined -without losing the procedure generality- based on a sample of synthetic data set in Table 2. We have records of 10 transactions from the travel agency database for one destination. In each  Round-Trip Flight One-Way Flight Cruise Trip First-Class  Hotel Second- Class  Hotel Motel Rental Car Sport Event Art Show Event Museum Event Dining  event J 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 


  Table 2: Synthetic data set  record, we use 1 whenever the element was reserved and 0 whenever the customer did not ask for the element  There is a large number of possible association rules that could be generated. Examples of some the association rules extracted from the database are AR1 If a round-trip flight was booked in one of the customer records, then a first-class hotel reservation was also made.  This happens with an accuracy =71% and a coverage = 50 AR2 If in one of the customer records a motel room is not reserved, then a museum ticket will not be bought This happens with an accuracy =87% and a coverage 70  AR3 If a round-trip flight is booked and a first-class hotel reservation is made, then a car will also be rented This happens with an accuracy =71% and a coverage 50 AR4 If a car is reserved, a dining event booked, and tickets for sporting and museum events bought, then a motel reservation would not be made.  This happens with an accuracy =100% and a coverage = 20  In order to make the analysis more efficient the following guidelines are suggested for selecting the most efficient association rules 1\ a significant association rule should have an accuracy percentage higher than 70% 2\ignificant association should have coverage percentage higher than 30% 3 Each association rule should have more than one element in the travel package; as a business rule, we assume that all single element items are possible travel packages   When the synthetic data set is used and the above guidelines are applied then the significant association rules obtained.  These rules are \(A Accuracy, C: Coverage  RA1  Round-Trip Flight and First Class Hotel [with A=71%,C= 50   RA3 Round-Trip Flight, Rental Car, and First Class Hotel with A=71%,C= 50  RA5 one-way Flight and Cruise Trip with A=75%,C 30  RA6 Sport Event and Dining Event with A=75%,C 30  RA7 Round-Trip Flight and Rental Car with A=71%,C 50  RA8 Rental Car and First Class Hotel with A=100%,C 50    After we determine the significant association rules, we added corresponding to these association rules a travel package that has elements as in the association rules. i.e since AR1 suggests that if a round-trip flight was booked, then a first-class hotel reservation was also made, then we design a travel package that has two elements a: round-trip flight and a first-class hotel reservation. This specific travel package is denoted by P 12 In the next section, a refinement for the resulted travel packages that are listed in Table 3 is implemented using the costs minimization model         Destination Record ID Round-Trip Flight One-Way Flight Cruise Trip First-Class  Hotel Second-Class  Hotel Motel Rental Car Sport Event Art Show Event Museum Event Dining Event 1111 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1112 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1113 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1114 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1115 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1116 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1117 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1118 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1119 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0     Miami 1120 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 


 Before we start the second stage of this analysis, it is worth to mention that other data mining techniques rather than association rules could be implemented in grouping the travel packages elements more efficiently.  An example for these techniques is data clustering where similar elements are grouped in one group. Two recommended data clustering are Kmeans approach for clustering binary data d l a rg e  items clustering of transactions [6   3.3 Stage II analysis  The optimization model is a minimization model of the total costs acquired by offering more than one element for each suggested travel package. There are many types of costs involved in the process of providing a travel package. Commonly, for singleelement reservation - perhaps just a flight ticket or just a hotel reservation - there is primarily a set-up cost to process this single reservation. Under the set-up cost category, one or more of the following activities may occur to justify the set-up costs: 1\ Web-based reservation requires order fees to maintain the web-site application process for each purchase that is placed. 2 Follow-up process requires human resources to review the application, contact the actual service providers to assure the availability of the service, and to make the final reservation. 3\ally, there are costs in keeping the travel agency records up-to-date following each transaction or reservation. In contrast, for a travel package that has more than one element, the same set-up cost activities mentioned above are still valid, but we expect that the cost will be lower. This is mainly due to the fact that most of the time it is cheaper to process an application that has reservations for two elements, than it is to process two separate applications for each type of reservation The second type of cost for this model is losses in sale costs, which is analogous to the holding inventory cost in the production system.  Offering a package that sells two reservations together without offering to customers the chance of making a reservation for a single event causes a loss in sale costs. This is due to the fact that some customers are not interested in buying a package as a whole, but rather are only interested in buying a single event. Hence, a loss in sale costs occurs when these types of customers shop among other travel agencies that are willing to offer the single element travel package.  According to the above rationale, it is clear that L i 0 for the single element travel package  Finally, there are incremental advertising and promoting costs. Marketing theories show that it is more likely that advertising for a group of items is more expensive than promoting a single item. A TV commercial and/or a newspaper ad for a group of items is lengthier and more expensive that it would be for a single itemís advertisement. This is due to the fact that the newspaper ad would require more space, thus increasing the fee for placement.  The same goes for a TV commercial which would require a longer block of time to showcase the products. The travel packages costs are summarized in Table 3. Moreover, the total cost is mathematically formulated as follows  Total cost for travel package i: C\(i i L i T i   The final binary integer constrained optimization model is symbolized as follows   Table 3: Travels packages with operating costs  Travel package element \(s Round-Trip Flight One-Way Flight Cruise Trip First-Class  Hotel Second-Class  Hotel Motel Rental Car Sport Event Art Show Event Museum Event Dining Event Round-Trip Flighta nd  First Class  Hotel Round-Trip Flight, Rental Car and First-Class  Hotel One-way Flight and Cruise Trip Sport event and Dining Event Round-Trip Flight and Rental Car Rental ar and First-Class Hotel TP i TP 1 TP 2 TP 3 TP 4 TP 5 TP 6 TP 7 TP 8 TP 9 TP 10 TP 11 TP 12 TP 13 TP 14 TP 15 TP 16 TP 17 TP i 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 2 2 2 2 A i 10 9 12 6 5 5 6 8 3 2 6 15 10 15 9 12 9 L i 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 6 3 2 4 3 T i 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 C\(i\ 12 11 14 8 7 7 8 10 5 4 8 26 19 21 14 19 15

If this is not the case, we do not worry by adding this element at the first place. The first constraint is to assure that this assumption is satisfied  4. The Model Solution  The above optimization problem is called set covering problem, and the heuristic solution Algorithm is available in o 2] u s ed th e s a m e  Algorithm to solve there subassembly optimization problem. The algorithm is as follows [7  Algorithm  Step 1 Set {TP i set of all resulted travel packages P i after the implementation of the association rules guidelines.  Also set the solution set    Step 2 check if {TP i   stop ,the solution set is the optimal solution, if {TP i   find a travel package index i , denoted i  that maximize  Ti L i Ai Tp i   where i TP is the number of elements in the tP i Then continue to step 3 Table 5: Heuristic algorithm procedure and output  Step 3 add TP i to the solution set. Eliminate from TP i all the travel packages TP i that have the elements of TP i then go to step 2 End In this section we will implement the above algorithm on the synthetic data set in table 2. The first step is concerned about initiation of the solution set, it is as follows  For Step 1 in the Algorithm, set {TP i TP 1 TP 2 TP 3  TP 4 TP 5 TP 6 TP 7 TP 8 TP 9 TP 10 TP 11 TP 12 TP 13  TP 14 TP 15 TP 16 TP 17 this is since there are 17 remaining travel packages after the implementation the association rules the first stage of the analysis. Then set the Set Solution  The rest of the iterations are summarized in Table 4. It took eight iterations to find the optimal solution. From iteration number 7, the optimal travel packages are: TP 10 Museum Event TP 9 Art Show Event}, TP 13 Round-Trip Flight rental car, First-Class Hotel}, TP 15 Sport event, dining event}, TP 6 Motel}, TP 5 Second-Class Hotel} and TP 14 One-way Flight, Cruise Trip    The heuristic algorithm approach could be tested for robustness by comparing the solution with other optimal or near optimal approaches. One possible approach is mathematical modeling programming language to construct a model solution.

5. Conclusion  A two-stage analysis has been used to develop an efficient procedure to optimize the process of designing a travel package.  The first stage consisted of the extraction of the association rules from among the travel package elements in the database. This action would help to eliminate the inappropriate travel packages. Then, the second stage consisted of a binary cost minimization, optimization problem to improve the design  The result of this model, although it is a cost based model, is the outline of a solid frame for pricing the services provided by travel agencies. The outputs anticipated from these outlines are: low cost operations popular travel packages, and state of the art techniques to contend in the competitive market .The same analysis scheme could be broadened to reflect other real-life cases. In conclusion, this investigation showed that data mining is a powerful tool to make a better marketing and operating decision   6.

As will become clear later both of these enhancements allow load on a link to be expressed as a continuous function which in turn simpliìes our worst-case analysis Neither enhancement alters the worst-case input signiìcantly First during an epoch at most one item occurrence per input stream can have non-integral weight Second any input with real-valued item frequencies can be transformed into an input with nearly integral frequencies that yields identical results by multiplying each frequency by a large number and dividing all answers produced by the same number For notational ease we transform the problem of setting  2  l  1 to that of setting  2   l  1  where for all 2  i  l  2   i   i   i 1 and  l  1   l  1  It is required that  i  0 for all 2  i  l  1  and that  l  1 i 2  i   1   i denotes the precision margin at level i  i.e the difference between the error tolerances at level i and level i 1  Let the vector     2   3   l  1  Let I denote the contents of all input streams S 1 S m during a single epoch Let I denote the set of all possible instances of I  Given an input I  a communication hierarchy T deìned by degree d and number of levels l  and a setting of the precision gradient   let w represent the maximum load on any link in the communication hierarchy w  I T    max k  links     load  k   Worst-case load W is deìned as W  T    max I I  w  I T    Given a communication hierarchy T  the objective is to set  such that the worst-case load W  T   is minimized We rst show that it is sufìcient to consider a speciìc subset of all instances of the general problem for worstcase analysis Then we nd precision gradient values  values that cause the worst-case load under any of these instances to be minimal There exists a subset I wc of the set of all input instances I such that for all instances I IäI wc  there exists an instance I  I wc such that for any T    w  I   T    w  I T    Hence I wc denotes the set of worst-case inputs  Instance I is a member of I wc if and only if it satisìes each of the following three properties P1 For any two input streams S i and S j  there is no item occurrence common to both S i and S j  P2  For any input stream S i  all items occurring in S i occur with equal frequency P3  For any two input streams S i and S j  both the number of item occurrences and the number of distinct items in S i and S j are equal Lemma 4 For xed T and   given any input instance I  it is possible to nd an input instance I  I wc such that w  I   T    w  I T    Proof Our proof of Lemma 4 is rather involved and is provided in  From Lemma 4 we know it is sufìcient to consider the set I wc for worst-case communication load Hence we can rewrite our expression for W  T   as W  T    max I I wc  w  I T    Property P3 of I wc implies that the total number of item occurrences at any leaf node is the same Let n denote this number   S i   n for all 1  i  m  Let tc  j  denote the total number of item occurrences arriving on streams monitored by at the leaf nodes of a subtree rooted at a node at level j  It is easy to see that tc  j  d  l  1  j   n  where l is the number of levels in the communication hierarchy and d is the fanout of all non-leaf nodes The next lemma shows that worst-case inputs induce a high degree of symmetry on the resulting synopses Lemma 5 For any input instance I I wc  the following two properties hold for the d j   j  1 synopses relayed by the d j levelj nodes to their parents 1 No item is present in more than one synopsis 2 The estimated frequency counts corresponding to any two items even if present in two different synopses have the same value Proof See  Due to the high degree of symmetry formalized in Lemma 5 the count for each item is eliminated due to being decremented and falling below zero at the same level of the communication hierarchy Let us call this level x  If all counts are dropped at the leaf level then x  l  1  If all counts are retained through the entire process and are sent to the root node R level 0  then x 0  Otherwise all counts are dropped at some intermediate level 1  x  l  2  The most heavily loaded link\(s are the ones leading to level x  To see why consider that no data is transmitted on subsequent links and previous links have lower load since data is spread more thinly in any communication hierarchy T  the number of links between levels decreases monotonically as data moves from leaves to the root When synopses are combined at nodes of level i using Algorithm 1 the frequency count estimate of each item is decremented by the quantity tc  i    i let Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE 


 1   1   l  1 i 2  i  Hence the true frequency count of any item occurring on some input stream must be C  l  1 j  x 1  tc  j    j    where  is a small quantity 3  The number of items present in each input stream is thus n  C 4  Since synopses for d l  1  x input streams are transmitted through a node at level x  the load on the most heavily loaded link\(s is L  x  d l  2  x  n C  Clearly the maximum value of L  x  is achieved when   0  The expression for L  x  can be simpliìed to L  x  1  l  1 j  x 1  j  d x  j 1  Now our expression for the worst-case load on any link can be reduced to W  T    max x 0  1 l  2  L  x   We desire to minimize W  T   subject to the constraints  2   l  1  0 and  l  1 j 2  j   1 It is easy to show that this minimum is achieved when L 0  L 1    L  l  2  Solving for  2   l  1  we obtain  i   1  d  1  l  2   d  1 d  2  i  l  2 and  l  1   1  d  l  2   d  1 d  Translating to error tolerances we set  i   1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d for all 2  i  l  1  This setting of  2  l  1 minimizes worst-case communication load on any link We term this strategy MinMaxLoad WC Under this strategy the maximum possible load on any link is L wc   l  2   d  1 d d   1 counts per epoch Lastly we note that MinMaxLoad WC remains the optimal precision gradient even if nodes of the same level can have different  values Informally since with worst-case inputs all incoming streams have identical characteristics maximum link load cannot be improved by using non-uniform  values for nodes at a given level we omit a formal proof for brevity 2.1.4 Good Precision Gradients for Non-Worst-Case Inputs Real data is unlikely to exhibit worst-case characteristics Consequently strategies that are optimal in the worst case may not always perform well in practice In terms of minimizing the maximum communication load on any link the worst-case inputs are ones in which the set of items occurring on each input stream are disjoint When this situation arises a gradual precision gradient is best to use as shown in Section 2.1.3 Using a gradual precision gradient some of the pruning of frequency 3 Recall that we allow the frequency of an item to be a real number 4 More precisely each stream contains  n C  items of weight 1 each and one item of weight  n C  n C   Note that each input stream contains at most one item with weight less than 1 as stipulated earlier counts is delayed until a better estimate of the overall distribution is available closer to the root thereby enabling more effective pruning In the opposite extreme when all input streams contain identical distributions of item occurrences there is no beneìt to delaying pruning and performing maximal pruning at the leaf nodes as in strategy SS2 is most effective at minimizing communication In fact it is easy to show that SS2 is the optimal strategy for minimizing the maximum load on any link when all input streams are comprised of identical distributions we omit a formal proof Note however that SS2 still incurs a high space requirement on the root node R since it sets  1    We posit that most real-world data falls somewhere between these two extremes To determine where exactly a data set lies with regard to the two extremes we estimate the commonality between input streams S 1 S m by inspecting an epoch worth of data from each stream We compute a commonality parameter   0  1 as   1 m   m i 1 G i L i  where G i and L i are deìned over stream S i as follows The quantity G i is deìned as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i and also at least   S  times in S  S 1  S 2  S m  where  S  denotes the number of item occurrences in S during the epoch of measurement The quantity L i is deìned as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i  Hence commonality parameter  measures the fraction of items frequent enough in one input stream to be included in a leaf-level synopsis by strategy SS 2 that are also at least as frequent globally in the union of all input streams A natural hybrid strategy is to use a linear combination of MinMaxLoad WC and SS2 weighted by   The strategy is as follows set  i 1       1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d        for 2  i   l  2  and  l  1 1       1  d  l  2   d  1 d         We term this hybrid strategy MinMaxLoad NWC for non-worstcase Commonality parameter  1 implies that locally frequent items are also globally frequent and SS2 modiìed to use  1   is a good choice Conversely  0 indicates that MinMaxLoad WC is a good choice For 0  1  a weighted mixture of the two strategies is best 2.1.5 Summary The precision gradient strategies we have introduced are summarized in Table 3 Sample precision gradients are illustrated in Figure 3 3

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
