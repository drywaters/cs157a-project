3090 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY VOL 63 NO 5 MAY 2017 larger-scale optimization problem in the case of a larger-scale network is terminated in the same total step size as in the case of a smaller-scale network which could result in a relatively conservative estimate for the optimal point By contrast the optimization algorithm could approach much closer to the optimal point within a nite number of iterations when it handles a smaller-scale optimization problem Actually it is clear that there is a trade-off between the choice of the amount of the agents deployed i.e the scale of the multi-agent network and the potential computing cost arising from complexity in the distributed optimization On one hand a minimum number of agents should be needed so as to ensure that their overall detection range could cover the whole surveillance area More agents added could improve the reliability of the distributed network On the other hand the network size is also increased by more agents  leading to more complexity of the network topology which would require much more effort to handle the corresponding distributed optimization problem Generally a distributed algorithm needs more computing communication resources e.g data buffer bandwidth to address a larger-scale model and more iterations to guarantee its convergence Thus there should be an optimal number of agents for deployment which could depend on not only the algorithm cost and performance in distributed computation but also the amount and distribution of surveillance regions noise level in observations and other comprehensive factors involved in a speciﬁed application context The issue is related to the optimal coverage control which aims at a solution that could attain a speciﬁed optim al objective at the meanwhile determining a minimum number of agents whose coverage could cover the target area This issue is out of scope of this paper it can be referred to many existing works such as  In the second situation see Fig.5b the increased noise level indicated by 015 max could result in a larger averaged absolute error of the overall network The noise in individual observations could also lead to the randomness of the gradient process in the equation 62 so that the actual estimation error of the network could not fully converge to zeros This fact could also be validated by the results in the rst situation as shown in Fig.5a That is the larger amount of agents does not guarantee a lower gradient noise process of the overall network Nevertheless from the results in Fig.5b it can be found that once the noises of individual observations under a certain level a good global information estimation of the overall network could be guaranteed regardless of the limitation of each individual agent’s detection and communi cation The results from the third situation in Fig.5c shows that increasing the amount of measurements denoted by the sample number sampleNum  at each individual observation could decrease the absolute error on average by the proposed method It is because a larger number of samples observed by each individual agent could make the individual estimation more approximate to the actual distribution of a subregion The r esult is in accordance with the law of large number  A ddi t i onal l y  c ompari ng t h e r es ul t s obtained by our proposed method with those of the consensusbased method the averaged absolute error converges to a lower level by our method Speciﬁcally even when our method       Fig 6 Evaluation of the proposed method at different T and T  is simulated at a higher noise level such as 015 max  0  5  1 see Fig.5b or adopts a smaller sample number such as sampleNum  50  200 see Fig.5c it outperforms the consensus-based method as well Finally to evaluate the inﬂuen ce of different observation amounts and iteration numbers on the performance of the multi-agent network we simulate our method at different T   100  400  700  and T   50  80  100   In addition in this situation we x sampleNum  100 and the other parameters 015 max and n are set to be 015 max  1  5and n  6 From the results shown in Fig.6 it can be found that more observations or more iterations tend to reduce the averaged absolute error of the whole network The main reason is that more observations implying more measurem ents could make each agent approach to the actual information state distributions of those subregions in its detection coverage and increasing iteration number could make individual estimation much closer to the ideal solution of the optimization model 19 Appropriate settings on them could be selected or tuned based on a speciﬁed application scenario of interest VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we have proposed an adaptive distributed fusion strategy for estimating global information over a cooperative multi-agent network We have modeled the information of interest associated with a global region being detected by the network from a probabilistic perspective in which probability is related to the accuracy of observed and estimated information We apply an information-theoretic measure i.e the Jensen-Shannon divergence to formulate two objective functions of any agent subject to linear equality and inequality constraints one of which is used in a localized estimation optimization model and the other in a fusion weight optimization model The adaptive fusio n strategy allows each agent to achieve its own optimal individual estimation on the global information of the entire region through minimizing the localized objective functions in a distributed and online manner We have also analyzed the mean-square-error convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm Finally the experimental results have been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its advantage over the conventional consensus protocol based algorithm In our future research we will extend the proposed method with consideration of
