Building Highly Available Cluster File System Based on Replication Liang Cao 1,2 Yu Wang 1,2 Jin Xiong 1  1 Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences 2 Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, China caoliang610@gmail.com, xj@ncic.ac.cn   Abstract In order to gain better cost-effectiveness, current large-scale storage systems are typically built up by thousands of individual components. As systems scale up, the probability of the failure of multiple components increases. And for largescale storage system, failures are normal rather than exception How to build file systems providing both high throughput and highly available service under such circumstances is a big challenge. We have designed and implemented HA-DCFS3, a highly available cluster file system prototype. It uses a scalable replication algorithm called Asynchronous Primary Copy Protocol \(APCP\. Unlike traditional Primary Copy Protocol that must synchronize updates to all replicas, APCP introduces an asynchronous approach where write operation is permitted to be synchronized to a subset of replicas. This flexible approach greatly improves the write performance Furthermore, HA-DCFS3 also introduces a fine-grained failure detection called “data path detection”, which is integrated into the fault-tolerant framework based on data replication. Hence, HA-DCFS3 can provide continuous service even when component failures occur. And finally, HA-DCFS3 adopts a two-level data recovery strategy that handles transient failures with reintegration and persistent failures with re-replication respectively to reduce the cost of data repair. Our performance results show that HA-DCFS3 can deliver high and scalable aggregate performance and provide highly available service at very low cost Keywords-performnace; data ava ilability; data replication primary copy; fault-tolerance I   I NTRODUCTION  In recent years, various data-intensive applications [1 are developed rapidly. In order to meet the applications’ ever increasing demands on data capacity with high I/O performance, many storage systems utilize advanced hardware and software technologies to provide efficient storage management and high-performance I/O service However, most systems do not pay equal attention to fault tolerance and high availability in their design. Unfortunately for large storage systems, failures of component are no longer the exception. Recent researches from CMU [2, 4  and Google [3 dic a te th at la rg es c a l e s t o r ag e s y s t em s  w ith  thousands of disks and complicated interconnections suffer from failures of all kinds of components severely. To make matters worse, the consequence of failures is always intolerable. These failures may not only prolong response time which declines the quality of services, but also result in breakdown of I/O service, and data loss in the worst case In this paper, we present a highly available cluster file system prototype called HA-DCFS3, which utilizes flexible replication to provide highly available service as well as high I/O performance. Comparing to traditional replication-based storage systems emphasizing on availability, our system values both performance and availability. Traditional replication-based storage systems use replication to improve availability. However, they sacrifice the performance to ensure strict replica consistency at the same time. HADCFS3 adopts an asynchronous replication algorithm Asynchronous Primary Copy Protocol \(APCP\, in which mutation operations are not required to be synchronized to all replicas as they do in the traditional approach. Since data is available as long as partial replicas are responsive, APCP greatly reduces operation costs of updating replicas without losing high availability. In addition to this novelty, HADCFS3 also introduces an automatic fine-grained failure detection mechanism called data path detection. In combination with data replication and automatic failure recovery, it is integrated into the fault-tolerant framework which can mask failures transparently. And finally, HADCFS3 adopts a two-level data recovery strategy that handles transient failures with reintegration and persistent failures with re-replication respectively to reduce the cost of data repair. Through these mechanisms, HA-DCFS3 greatly improves availability as well as I/O performance The rest of paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the related work in this area. Section III outlines the system overview of HA-DCFS3. Section IV describes the design and implementation of HA-DCFS3. Section V evaluates performance of the system. Section VI concludes the paper II  R ELATED WORK  Replication is a well-known solution used to improve system’s availability, especially in distributed storage systems.

one write all available copies protocol 9   F i rs t of all  re a d  and mutate operations are all directed to primary. Then the primary forwards each update to the backups while writing the update to its disk and waits for writes of all replicas to complete. Since mutation operation must be synchronized to all replicas, the latency increases proportionally with the number of replicas. Echo and Harp also utilize distribute view change 10 a l g o r i t h m t o to le r a te f a il u r e s  b y a d j u s t i n g  replica quorum configurations dynamically. Google File System adopts a variant of primary copy replication combining primary copy with pipeline technology to overlap data transfer over the network. However, this approach does not settle the performance flaw of primary copy replication radically, especially when system’s bottleneck of performance lies on disk I/O instead of network transmission Furthermore, Google File System uses centralized metadata server to detect failures of chunk server and trigger recovery procedure correspondingly, which brings in potential single failure point and bottleneck. A novelty of Ceph is that it introduces CRUSH [1 alg o ri th m to m a n a g e dat a p l a cem en t which improves system scalability by avoiding centralized metadata service. However, it also brings in complicated peering algorithm to support the placement strategy Another widely used replication protocol is quorumbased replication The instances of this kind protocol combine state machine theory and consensus algorithms [14  to tolerate Byzantine or fail-stop failures in distribute systems. Most of these systems such as OceanStore [15   a nd FAB [1 i l i ze t w o p h a s e co mm i t s for upda t i n g da t a  employ voting-based consensus algorithm among replicas to ensure linearizability and respond to failure or recovery Quorum-based  replication has seen little use in high-through systems, because of concerns about inefficiency, as reading data must involve multiple replicas Recently, lots of wide-area storage systems such as Cooperative File System  B a y o u  18 a n d  D y na m o 1 9 adopt replication to enhance availability. The design of these systems emphasizes on reliability and continuous data availability in untrusted environments. So performance and data consistency often give place to high availability, and they only provide weak consistency among replicas While sharing many of the same goals with previous local-area file systems, our design has been driven by technological environment of our own system Dawning 5000A, a large-scale cluster mainly for scientific computing So the main purpose of our work is to scale file system to meet the cluster’s storage needs on high performance, strict consistency, and high availability III  S YSTEM O VERVIEW  HA-DCFS3 is a cluster file system prototype designed for Dawning 5000A supercomputer. In this section, we give a brief introduction to its architecture and data placement strategy A  System Architecture HA-DCFS3 is an object-based non-symmetric cluster file system, typically consists of multiple metadata servers MDS\, multiple file servers called Object-based Storage Device \(OSD\nd lots of clients. Dozens of OSDs are organized into OSD group Figure 1 shows the architecture of HA-DCFS3. The MDSs maintain the file system’s metadata, mainly including the namespace, file attributes and data placement information The MDSs serve the metadata to the clients. Every MDS is replicated over a set of nodes which integrate a Paxos[13 based algorithm into metadata service like Ceph [11  T h e  OSDs maintain the actual data. The OSDs serve the actual file data to the clients. For gaining better availability and performance, files can be striped and replicated over multiple OSDs. The client communicates first with the MDSs to fetch necessary metadata such as placement information of files and then with the appropriate OSDs to perform the required read and write operation   OSD module MDS module Paxos state machine meta data client module file data configuration  Figure 1  Architecture of HA-DCFS3 B  Data Placement In HA-DCFS3, the data of each file can be striped into multiple objects, and each object is replicated over many OSDs. Figure 2 illustrates the data placement schema of HADCFS3. File f consists of four blocks and is distributed on two OSDs forming two objects object1 and object2 File f is stored in two replicas. The first replica is striped on OSD1 and OSD2 which belong to OSD group1 The second replica is striped on OSD3 and OSD4 which belong to OSD group2  The objectives to place replicas into different OSD groups are   Figure 2  File placement schema in HA-DCFS3 1 2  1 2 3 4 3 4  objec t 1 objec t 2 Group 1 Group 2 OSD 1 OSD 2 1  2 3  4 objec t 1 objec t 2 OSD 3 OSD 4

1\ To decrease the probability of simultaneous replica failures for the same object. When deploying the cluster, we could map an OSD group to a rack of physical nodes avoiding simultaneous failures of multiple replicas caused by single rack failure 2\To shorten the data reconstruction time. This placement schema spread replicas of objects which belong to one OSD to across over multiply physical nodes. When reconstructing the data of failed OSD, we can obtain those objects from numerous recovery sources to arise concurrent recovery I/O [22   Placement information of each file is stored with regular metadata information together. Besides, a two-level hierarchy hash table is used to quick index this information Through such a crossing-index technology with metadata path and hash, MDSs can not only quickly get the data placement information for any file, but also quickly find all files and objects on a failure OSD IV  D ESIGN AND I MPLEMENTATION  In this section, we describe the design and implementation of HA-DCFS3 and would not give the detailed design of the Paxos-based metadata service which is out of paper’s scope A  APCP Replication Mechanism We design an asynchronous primary copy replication protocol abbreviated as APCP, mainly optimizing the traditional primary copy replication to improve write performance. Figure 3 illustrates a scenario of APCP with three replicas. For an update operation client sends the update request to the primary firstly. Receiving an update request from a client the primary applies it to its local copy and then forwards the request to other backups  backup1 and backup2 asynchronously. Receiving a request from the primary the backup updates its local object as the primary  has done, then respond the primary indicating the success. If the primary have completed the local update and received responds from a subset of backups called configuration it replies to the client Users can specify the size of configuration  R c cording to their needs. Obviously APCP is a more efficient mechanism than the traditional primary copy like Ceph [11  In A P C P  th e p r im ary  j u st  waits for replies from a subset of backups  backup1 nstead of all backups  backup1 and backup2 as it does in the primary copy  Although APCP is a flexible asynchronous approach, it brings the following new problems 1\ For gaining more promising performance, we have to scarify data consistency What kind of data consistency mode we can guarantee with APCP Generally speaking, APCP offers moderate data consistency which is weaker than strong consistency such as one-copy serializability but stricter than eventual consistency When accessing file without interfering by failure, APCP could guarantee strong consistency even handling concurrent   client primary backup 1 backup 2 Update Ack Disk I/O Read  Figure 3  APCP of three replicas accesses to the same shared file from multiple clients, since all requests for the file are directly sent to the primary replica first, which serializes the requests on all backups in the same order. However, if primary replica and all latest backup  replicas fail, the system can not serve clients with the most recent data until some of them recover. In this case, the system may choose to suspend the service temporarily Otherwise in order to provide continuous service, we offer a compromising solution that allows system to serve the clients with stale data when necessary. In other words, we may have to scarify data consistency to improve system’s availability. In general, the moderate consistency guarantee that APCP could provide is sufficient to most of common HTC and internet applications but not for transactionoriented applications such as OLAP and OLTP applications 2 How to ensure replica consistency and provide correct file data to clients when some replicas \(the primary or backups\ fail Take the scenario above by example, if the primary failed at some time right after which it had replied to the client but before backup2 finished the update procedure how the replication-based system should respond to following read requests  Actually, we adopt a centralized view change algorithm  to solve this problem. Simply speaking, each individual object is replicated to obtain a group Normally, the group  consists of valid members of replicas, and the members are fixed since the object is created. If any member of the group  crashes or becomes inaccessible, the remaining members undergo a reorganization to form a new group The new group behaves as a single logical entity that provides the same service as the original group does. Details will be given in the next subsection Besides the advantage on performance and flexibility APCP can enhance availability by tolerating some failed or overloaded replicas, since APCP can still serve clients access requests even when some of replicas are inaccessible B  Fault-Tolerant Framework The fault-tolerant framework in HA-DCFS3 is composed of failure detection mechanism, service recovery mechanism and data recovery mechanism. This section explains how to provide highly available service with these mechanisms in HA-DCFS3 1  Failure Detection

Periodically failure detection is critical to ensure high availability. But traditional heartbeat-based failure detection can introduce prohibitively high performance cost with the increase of the scale of the storage system. We design a scalable failure detection mechanism called Data Path Detection. Unlike most traditional coarse-grained failure detection which is in the unit of node, our approach introduces a fine-grained fault detection mechanism which is in the unit of data path referring to the connection between the primary and backups An instance diagram of data path detection is as shown in Figure 4   OSD3 Fail Paxos-based MDSs Backup A Backup A OSD 5 OSD 3 Backup B Primary E Primary A OSD 1 Backup B Backup C OSD 7 Primary B OSD3 Fail Data Path Control Flow vi ew p:1,b:3,b:5 p:7,b:1,b:3 A B  Figure 4  Schema of Data Path Detection OSDs at both ends of data path \(e.g osd1 and osd5  storing the primary and backup replicas of object A  heartbeats to monitor each other. And it is unnecessary for OSDs without data path \(e.g osd3 and osd5 to do periodical detection task between each other. If any certain failures such as node corruption or network failures make an OSD unreachable, other OSDs sharing the data path with the failed one would ascertain this error by forming the failure report In context of Figure 4, both osd1 and osd7 will report the failure of osd3 since osd3 is current inaccessible Failure report will be organized into triple form like this_osd, remote_osd, list<object this_osd represents the reporter OSD remote_osd represents the failed OSD, and list<object contains all object replicas inaccessible in remote_osd caused by data path failure. As shown in Figure 4, the report from osd1 is osd1, osd3 backupA while report from osd7 is osd7, osd3 backupB After generating the report this_osd will send it to MDSs to trigger corresponding recovery procedure Since data path detection is built upon self-govern OSD groups, and each OSD just monitors other ones sharing data path. In our implementation, each file is stripe into multiple objects in the same way as illustrated in Figure 2, and then object replicas are distributed into different OSD groups Usually, each OSD at most has connections with just one OSD per OSD group, which could greatly reduce scale of connection graph. Furthermore, compared with distributed detection \(mutual-detect OSDs\ and centralized arbitration MDS recovery\ strategy, Data path detection strategy avoids the complexity of consensus algorithm used to reach agreement in distributed system [7 Hen c e  dat a  path  detection is highly scalable for large-scale cluster file systems 2  Service Recovery Upon received failure report from OSDs, MDSs enter into recovery procedure composed of service recovery and  data recovery discussed in §4.2.3\. First service recovery  should be invoked to tolerate current failures reported by OSDs to ensure continuity of service. And then MDSs are supposed to provide corresponding data  recovery to tolerate subsequent failures which might cause inaccessibility for all object replicas or worse data loss The core of service recovery mechanism is the centralized view change algorithm which is a failover protocol running on MDS when a failure or a recovery from failure occurs. The function of a view change is to reorganize a new group called a view of object replicas, in which failed nodes are excluded from the new view, or a recovered node is put back into the new view. A view structure is as follows  objectid_viewid  p: osdid, b: osdid…b: osdid  Each view is designated an identifier concatenating an objectid and an viewid The objectid identifies the object while the viewid identifies the current view of a particular object Viewid increases once view change takes place Objectid is composed of several fields such as inode number of the file it belongs to. One of objectid s field records how many times of modification each object experienced with incremental counter. One of the object replicas in a view is the primary of that view and the others are backups  Figure 5 illustrates the simplified process of view change algorithm. If MDS receives a failure report indicating that the primary failed at sometime, MDS will designate another OSD with correct content in the current view to take over the role of primary in the new view. And the failed one will be  MDS side algorithm  while GetFailReport HandleReport\(hlist list_for_each\(&obj, hlist if IsPrimary\(obj, view new_vew = ElectPrimary\(obj, view else new_view = RemoveFailBackup\(obj, view SendViewToPrimary    OSD side algorithm  while new_view = GetView view = GetLocalView UpdateLocalView\(new_view if IsPrimary\(obj, view RefuseExistReq\(obj TakeChargePrimary\(new_view SendAckToMDS  Figure 5  View change algorithm

removed from the new view. Similarly, when a backup replica fails, MDS will simply remove it from the new view In fact, the view change needs MDSs together with clients and OSDs to complete the whole procedure. Once modification of view is done, the new view should be atomically propagated to all OSDs. Unlike OSD-side’s pushing approach, all clients will pull the new view to local when needed 3  Two-Level Data Recovery Strategy The most wide-used data recovery strategy in distributed storage system is eager replication: if any replica becomes inaccessible, it is obliged to produce a new one immediately Since transient failures are common in large-scale systems 20  eag e r re p l i cat io n  w ill w a ste b a n d w i d t h b y  m a k i n g  unneeded replicas. This paper presents a two-level data recovery strategy to minimize the cost for transient failures The key idea of this recovery strategy is very simple Do not make new copies in response to transient failure This is achieved by distinguish between permanent failures and transient failures. For transient failures, our system does nothing but waits for the failed nodes back to the system, and reintegrates the object replicas stored on nodes, while for permanent failures our system re-replicates object replicas stored on failed nodes In current implementation, we use timeout to distinguish between permanent and transient failures. In order to evaluate the two-level recovery strategy, we adopt a model as below Before OSD fails, there is V byte object data stored in it During the failure, other replicas of failed object are still being accessed with B w bandwidth of write and B r bandwidth of read. The ratio of amount of data for read and write is R  Furthermore, we assume that the failed OSD can recovery from transient failure in short time T fter recovery of failure, we just reintegrate stale object data which has been modified during the failure. Through simple calculations, we can draw the amount of data need to be restored is     1     r w w r w w r B R B T B B R B T B B X   Table 1 lists the result from formula above with specific parameters according configuration of current mainstream cluster system [2 F r om th e res u lt of  Ta ble 1   we can draw the following conclusions: During the failure little portion of object data in OSDs is modified. Thus it is unnecessary to rebuild all object data immediately after OSD fails. With R increases, the effect of this approach becomes even more evident. In other words, the two-level data recovery strategy is more suitable for read-mostly systems TABLE I  T ABLE 1  C OST FOR TRANSIENT FAILURE  B w 60MB/s B r 70MB/s V 500GB T = 5 minutes R\(rd: wr\ 1 2 4 6 8 10 X \(GB 9.5 6.5 4 2.9 2.2 1.8 X/V 1.9 0.98 0.8 0.58 0.44 0.36  V  E VALUATION  All experiments were carried out in HA-DCFS3 configured with 1 MDS, 15 OSDs, and several clients. The MDS node running SUSE 10\(Linux-2.6.20\s two 2.2GHz dual-core AMD Opteron  processors, 2-Gbyte memory and one 146-Gbyte SCSI disk. OSDs and clients are all built on 15 virtual servers \(VMware server 1.05\ hosted by three physical nodes with eight 2.0GB Intel Xeon processors, 5GB memory, and five 146-GB SCSI disks for each. Each virtual server is configured with 1GB memory. All physical nodes are connected through Gigabit Ethernet, while virtual nodes are connected through VMnet Bridge to Host NIC In our experiments, IOzone benchmark [22  i s used t o  simulate the intensive I/O workloads. PostMark [23 is u s e d  to simulate heavy small-file access loads. Besides, we also use mpiBLAST  a ge ner a l ge n e seq u e n ce  a l i gnm e n t  application, to evaluate our methods for  real applications A  Scalability IOzone was used to compare APCP with traditional primary copy protocol on write performance. Each thread wrote 3GB data  Figure 6 shows the results of single-threaded and multithreaded write performance under different replication strategy. Each bar or curve represents a particular replication strategy. For example R 3 and R c 2 means the number of replicas is 3 and if two of replicas complete the updates the write operation can be returned. According to figure 6\(a with the increase of R under the same R c performance declines a little. On the contrary, with the increase in R c  under the same R performance decreases by about 20%~60%. Figure \(b\ shows that APCP scales linearly with number of threads increase. Furthermore, when the system tends to saturate, performance of APCP goes down more smoothly. The main reason is that APCP can tolerate some slow or overloaded replicas, whereas traditional primary copy is dependent on health of all replicas. In a word, APCP replication strategy makes significant improvement over traditional primary copy protocol, especially when number of replicas is even larger We do not give the read performance result of our replication protocol, since it should be as same as primary copy replication protocol. In fact, our work only concerns about the optimization for write performance of primary copy replication protocol which is the greatest potential weakness of protocol itself. For read operation under both above protocols, any available replica with latest content is selected to access as long as it can ensure sequential consistency for each replica. Thus, both replication protocols could deliver good read performance with linear growth scaling as number of replicas

Then we compare the result with normal circumstances. Figure 7 shows the experiment result based on R c 2 R 3\ replication strategy with 3GB size dataset Figure 7\(a\ gives the client-side trace when taking over services. The x-axis indicates the running time of IOzone process, while the y-axis indicates the number of pages written by client. From the figure we can see that the failure of one of the backups did not have any impose on the clientside process, since R c 2 which means if 2 replicas complete the update the write operation can be returned. But if the primary replica fails, a new primary should be elected Moreover, the pending requests on clients may need to be redirected to the new primary. All this processes result in applications suspended for a short period of time. Figure 7\(b evaluates exactly how much impact on performance with occurrence of failure under different detection interval. It shows that variation of the detection interval has nothing to do with performance, when one of backup replicas fails however, when primary fails, performance decreases by about 5%~30% as detection interval increases   a  b Figure 7  Take service when writing Rc=2, R=3 and size of dataset is 3GB. \(a\Client-side trace, \(b\ Write performance  If the replica providing read service fails, the client will be aware of such kind of failure through timeout of the read request and choose another valid replica to access. Thus replica failure has less impact on read performance than write performance. Furthermore, if failed replica is not the one providing read service, it has no impact on read operations at all even if the failed one is the primary C  Macrobenchmark and Application Our experiment platform for PostMark and mipBLAST is configured as: 1 MDS, 6 clients, and 6 OSDs. PostMark is configured to process 100 files with size range from 4096 bytes to 40960000 bytes, and 200 transactions on the files Each transaction is consists of several pairs of create/delete or read/write operations. The source database for formatting and analyzing in mpiBLAST is called month.est_others the size of which is 977454490 bytes. mpiBLAST separated it into 16 segments with size range from 8 bytes to 177613744 bytes Figure 8\(a\ shows that normally performance for read operation in PostMark varies slightly with different replication strategy, while performance for write operation and transaction decreases by about 50% as number of replicas increases to 3. When some OSD fails, it causes performance for read, write operation and transaction decreases by about 20%, 35% and 25% respectively. This implies that write operation is more sensitive to failure than

read operation, because clients can redirect read request to another replica immediately noticing the requested replica fails. Thus for read operations clients does not  has to wait for failure detection and service recovery.  Figure 8\(b\ shows the similar trend for different replication strategy and failure impact as PostMark. Furthermore, result of mipBLAST shows that when OSD fails, the more clients involving in processing, the worse performance becomes. There are two main reasons for this. Firstly, the more clients involving in processing, the more files are accessed, which trigger more service recovery procedures to ensure continuous service Secondly, mipBLAST running over multiply clients generates multiple threads to parallel access gene database Thus any failure of OSD will affect multiple instances of read/write operation at the same time which causes greater impact on performance eventually   a  b Figure 8  Performance of Postmark and mpiBlast with one replica, three replicas with Rc 2, and three replicas with occurrence of node failure. \(a Performance of PostMark,  \(b\mance of mpiBLAST VI  C ONCLUSION  In this paper we present a replication-based fault-tolerant mechanism for a large-scale cluster file system and its implementation in the prototype HA-DCFS3. This faulttolerant mechanism is primarily designed for high performance and high availability both under normal environment and in the presence of failures in the data path Our fault-tolerant mechanism uses an efficient and flexible replication algorithm called APCP, which optimizes existing primary copy protocol and improves performance for mutations by about 20%-60% without losing the ability of fault-tolerance. HA-DCFS3 also adopts an integrated faulttolerant framework, which transparently masks failures in data path and allows system to provide continuous service by fine-grained failure detection and a two-level data recovery strategy, which greatly reduces unnecessary data rereplication in the meantime of ensuring data availability A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work is supported in part by the National High-Tech Research and Development Program of China under grant No. 2006AA01A102 and grand No. 2009AA01Z139.

The FST algorithm must preserve the property of orthogonality between the different frequencies. Additionally, any noise present even after rectifica tion will be mitigated by the summation process. Thus for this  technique, mathematically, crosstalk from adjacent frequencies will be zero and the SO S time record length can be as short as one period of the lowest fre quency. However, the FST method only works if the octave harmonic relationship holds for all frequencies in the SOS including the sample frequency. This en sures that over a period of any frequency present in the SOS there will always be an even number of samples. The implementa tion of the rectification functions with discrete signals in a manner that preserves orthogonality between different frequencies is developed within this paper
