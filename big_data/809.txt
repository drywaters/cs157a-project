The Do seChip will complement the existing Crew Passive Dosimeters by providing real-time dosimetry and as an alarming monitor for solar particle events \(SPEs A prototype of the DoseChip was exposed to protons at three incident energies at the NASA space radiation laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory.  The prototype provides an unambiguous, proportional response for 200, 500, and 1000 MeV protons.

 1  I NTRODUCTION  NASA\222s Vision for Space Exploration strategy is primarily focused on establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon and then human flights to Mars and involves replacing the Space Shuttle with the much smaller Crew Exploration Vehicle \(CEV\y definition, such missions 1  1 978-1-4244-2622-5/09 25.00 \2512009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper#1276 Version 1, Updated 2008:10:31 will be of long duration \(months to years 
protection provided by the geomagnetic field in low-Earth orbit \(LEO\ fulfill this strategy, NASA will require improved instrumentation for space crew dosimetry. The Space Studies Board of the National Research Council recommends that real-time dose rate monitoring at an astronaut\222s location is necessary to ensure crew safety against potentially hazardous SPEs [1 At present, the NASA Space Radiation and Analysis Group SRAG\at Johnson Space Center uses a combination of thermoluminescence detector \(TLD\CR-39 plastic nuclear track detector \(PNTD to measure the total absorbed dose and dose equivalent recei ved by each crew member during missions aboard the International Space Station ISS The complexity of human space-flight requires reliable, fault-tolerant instrumentation 
capable of providing real-time dose readings during a mission, which is not feasible with existing TLD technology, especially during extravehicular activity EVA\e monitoring is important for LEO spacecraft and interplanetary sp ace flight to alert the crew when an SPE increases the pa rticle flux of the spacecraft environment This work describes a prototype active, lightweight, and compact Dosimeter-on-a-Chip \(DoseChip crew dosimetry comprised of a tissue-equivalent plastic scintillator coupled to a solid state photomultiplier \(SSPM being prototyped and tested for SPEs. The SSPM consists of an array of Geiger photodiodes \(GPDs\with supporting electronics built using complementary metal-oxide 
semiconductor \(CMOS\ructures. The ubiquitous nature of CMOS technology provides a standardized development platform, and the ability to integrate the supporting electronics into a miniature, lightweight, low-power design To be a useful dosimeter fo r space radiation environments the device must be sensitive to the expected radiation fields while providing a workable, deployable device with the hardware restrictions of sp ace flight.  The DoseChip will measure flux, fluence, dose rate, cumulative dose, and energy deposition spectra, as well as providing information on dose equivalent rate and cumulative dose equivalent 


  2 The DoseChip provides a tissue-equivalent response to the relevant energies and types of radiation encountered during LEO and interplanetary space-flight to the Moon or Mars The instrument will be sensitive to the dose rates and particle fluxes from ambient Galactic Cosmic Rays \(GCR and to enhanced rates of major SPEs.  The DoseChip will complement the existing Crew Passive Dosimeter \(CPD\by providing real-time dosimetry and as an alarming monitor for SPE Space Environment Space environments cover a wide range of particle fluxes Dosimeters used in these environments must quantify this wide range of fluxes. There are four significant sources of space radiation: 1 ic rays, 2 belts, 3\ar particle events \(solar flares and coronal mass ejections\ particle production within the mass of a spacecraft and its contents, and in the atmosphere for  Galactic cosm ic ray s \(GCR protons, 12% helium ions, 1% heavy ions from Li to U, and 2% electrons. The GCR spectrum peaks at 1 GeV The Earth\222s radiation belts consist of an inner proton belt with protons from 100 keV to > 400 MeV. An outer belt consists of electrons from 10s of keV to > 10 MeV.  SPE can be separated into two types of events: prompt and gradual Prom pt event s are dom i n at ed by  el ect rons with total fluences between 10 7 and 10 8 cm 2 that subtend a narrow angular width of 30 - 45\272.  Gradual events are dominated by protons, have to tal fluences that can exceed 10 9 cm 2 and can be spread over a wide angles from 60 to 180\272.  The flux from gradual SPE has an exponential growth that will peak in minutes to hours and could last for hours to as long as days C oncerni ng i n t e rpl a net a ry t r avel t h e Martian environment is predicted to have fluxes up to 2 particles cm 2 s 1    Existing Technology Although accurate measurement of radiation dose is a critical need in space flight a nd has been studied for many decades, existing methods have limitations. Existing instrumentation can be divided into passive and active devices.  The LiF TLD is the workhorse of space-based radiation monitoring. TLD measures total absorbed dose and cannot discriminate low and high linear energy transfer LET\Furthermor e, TLD records dose from highLET particles   10 keV 265 m\ with reduced efficiency. CR39 PNTD is used to measure LET spectrum, dose and dose equivalent from particles of LET H2O 10 keV 265 m. Data from the CR-39 PNTD is used to correct the dose from high-LET particles measured in TLD and is combined with dose measurements from TLD to yield total dose equivalent  Thi s com b i n at i on of passi ve det ect ors, referred t o  as t h e Crew Passive Dosimeter \(CPD\he advantage over the current generation of active detectors in being compact, of low mass, and requiring no external power so that a crew member can wear the dosimeter on his body without it interfering with his normal activities A limitation of the current CPD is the fact that it must be returned to a laboratory on the ground for processing and analysis. This means that dose information on a crewmember\222s radiation exposure during flight is not available until after the mission. In addition, neither TLD nor CR-39 PNTD can be switched on or off, meaning that they begin recording radiation exposure as soon as the astronaut leaves the ground and continue to record the exposure until the astronaut return s to the Earth. While this is not a significant issue for two week missions on the Space Shuttle, for long duration missions on the ISS, often lasting six months or more, and for longer duration exploration missions to the Moon and Mars, these detectors especially the CR-39 PNTD, can become saturated, leading to difficulties in chemical processing and readout The alternative is the use of ac tive detectors. At present, few active detectors are small enough to be routinely worn on the human body. One such detector system, the Liulin-4 Mobile Dosimetry Unit \(MDU\rrently being used aboard the Russian segment of the ISS [5 e Liu lin 4  MDU uses a small Si-diode to measure particle flux and energy deposition \(dose\ulin-4 MDU is batterypowered, about the size of a pack of cigarettes, and weighs 0.23 kg; therefore, it is still too large and bulky for routine use by a crewmember working inside a spacecraft or habitat. In addition to its size and mass, drawbacks of the Liulin-4 MDU include the fact that it is not tissue equivalent and the fact that it is insensitive to particles of LET H 2 O 40 keV 265 m, making it unable to measure the dose and dose equivalent from the hi gh LET component. For a Sidetector to be sensitive to higher LET particles, two detectors in a telescope arrangement or a much larger single Si detector would be needed In either case, the resulting dosimeter would become even more awkward to wear on the human body An alternative to the Liulin-4 MDU is to use a photodetector with a small form factor that can read out a tissue equivalent scintillator, providing a more direct measure of the human equivalent dose.  A high-gain, solidstate CMOS-compliant photodetector would provide the necessary basis for a compact, lightweight, radiationhardened, real-time dosimeter using tissue-equivalent plastic scintillation materials Proposed Solution A major issue in constructing a dosimeter is that the dose response must be similar to that of human tissue.  This has prompted the use of tissue-equivalent scintillation plastic Saint-Gobian BC-430\ch has an emission spectrum that matches well to the quantum efficiency spectrum of the SSPM.  Current schemes for r eading out such a material\227 such as PMT\222s, or PIN diodes and other unity-gain 


  3 diodes\227are inadequate in terms of sensitivity, immunity to magnetic fields, and power consumption.  An array of photodetectors that count the individual photons created by an ionizing event in the scintillation material provides a very high internal amplification of the signal, facilitating its discrimination of small scintillation signals from baseline noise, since the noise in each det ector is uncorrelated.  This innovative approach is known as the solid-state photomultiplier \(SSPM\ise of compact lightweight, low-power integrated detector chips that provide real-time dose information on astronauts or as area monitors To make tissue-equivalent scintillation materials useful for dosimetry, a better, compact, lightweight optical detector drives the development of CMOS solid-state photomultipliers \(SSPM imeter applications. An array of CMOS Geiger photodiode \(GPD\xels, which are avalanche photodiodes operated in Geiger mode, comprises the SSPM.  In Geiger mode, a single optical photon triggers the pixel to produce a digital Geiger pulse for each optical photon detected.  The array of GPD pixels is monolithically integrated to the readout, data storage, and transfer electronics High LET incident radiation Low LET incident radiation Few pixels fire Many pixels fire Tissue equivalent scintillator CMOS 221DoseChip\222 External interface  Figure 1 \226 Sample dosimeter-on-a-chip layout.  The simple dosimeter on a chip design consists of a GPD array, the supporting detector electronics, storage capacity, and an external interface.  A low LET event causes a few Geiger pixels to trigger, while a high LET event creates more photons in the scintillator, causing more pixels to trigger.  Individual pixels are operated in Geiger mode; the number of pixels triggered is proportional to the energy deposited in the scintillator Figure 1 illustrates the digital dosimeter concept using a detector-on-a-chip, which includes the monolithic SSPM and readout electronics, coupled to a scintillator. The scintillator, which sits atop the detector-on-a-chip in the figure, converts the radiation into a light pulse that uniformly illuminates the SSPM in the chip The CMOS chip will process the SSPM signal to provide a dose, and supporting electronics will be used to provide supply voltages, data interfaces, and displays to name a few  Significance of this work Both the scintillator and the SSPM affect the dynamic range and linear response of the dosimeter.  A non-linear response will affect the response function of the dosimeter.  This investigation studied the behavior of the SSPM and scintillator for protons and provided a dynamic range in terms of incident proton energies over which the dosimeter must provide unambiguous dosimetry measurements Plastic scintillators have a known non-linear response to charged particles  whi c h i s governed by B i rk\222s formula  2 1 212 002 212 eff n dxdELPDE efft enn  1 2 The number of trigger pixels n t is related to the number of effective pixels n eff which for our experiment is the total number of pixels in the device.  This is due to the fast decay times of the plastic scintillator, allowing for short integration times PDE is the photo-detection efficiency which is a product of the SSPM fill factor and single pixel detection efficiency. The term L\(dE/dx is the light output from the scintillator, which is a function of the linear energy loss provided by \(1 The number of triggered pixels is proportional to the energy loss in the plastic.  This energy loss is then used to determine the dose, but a response function is required to convert triggered pixels in to energy deposition.  This response function for protons will be determined through direct measurements with proton beams of known energy The dynamic range of the device for protons will then be modeled to provide a region for best operation  327 10 2 g/cm 2 MeV and C = 9.59 327 10 6 g 2 cm 4 MeV 2 The value of S was determined from 10-MeV protons and scaling the light yield to match the results shown in [10  Solid-state photomultipliers have a known non-linear behavior due to the number of pixels available for a given scintillation event [11 Th e m ean n u m b er o f  p i x els th at are triggered for a given light pulse from a fast scintillator is  002+\002 002  dx dE C dx dE kB dx dE S dx dL 1 From  t h e param e t e rs are det e rm i n ed t o be S = 9683 photons\267g/cm 2 MeV, kB = 1.29

The signal was sent into a preamplifier to drive the signal through approximately 200 feet of cable from the interaction region to the electronics room at the NAS A space radiation laboratory NSRL\ Brookhaven National Lab.  The shaping amplifier was set to a 20-ns shaping time for proper integration of the signal from the prototype dosimeter.  A test pulse through a 100-pF capacitor is used to convert the charge output from the SSPM \(d irectly proportional to the number of triggered pixels\nto ADC channels.  With an operating excess bias of 5 V and an average pixel capacitance of 226 fF, the charge output from a single pixel is 1.13 pC, and a 0.288 pC per ADC channel conversion was determined The photo-detection efficiency from \(2\s a product of the average fill factor, where the average of the fill factors provided in Table 1 is 44.5%, and the single pixel detection efficiency.  The single pixel detection efficiency is a product of the quantum efficiency and the Geiger probability.  The Geiger probability at 5 V is 28.2%.  The quantum efficiency is wavelength dependent, and the emission spectrum of BC-430 can be used to determine an effective QE.  The data in Figure 4 shows the emission spectrum of the BC-430 and the QE for the SSPM pixels The effective QE is the av erage QE weighted by the emission spectrum of the BC-430, which is determined to be 42.4 003 003  resistor.

The numbers above each peak are the number of triggered pixels The ADC channels are shown along the top axis The light yield from the plastic was calculated using \(1 model was created to simulate the light yield from these three proton energies.  The model used known LET values of protons in polyvinyl-toluene \(the base in BC-430 range of incident energies.  A simple model that transported protons through rough 0.1-mm slabs of polyvinyl-toluene was used to determine the light yields for 200, 500, and 1000 MeV protons.  The light intensity of BC-430 plastic scintillator is quoted to be roughly 73% of that of BC-400 and NE-102 plastic scintillator.  In addition, the light that is not incident on a pixel will be reflected back into the scintillator, as this inactive material is covered with aluminum by design.  This will increase the number of detected photons beyond the numbers determined from \(2 The three proton energy points were used to find the calibration constant to match the expected light yields to the number of detected photons, or pixels triggered.  Equation 2 then becomes  212 002\002 212 eff n dxdELAPDE efft enn  1 3 where A is the correction factor used to calibrate the response of the SSPM to the light yields.  The data was plotted as the number of triggered pixels measured versus the calculated light output from a NE-102 scintillator.  The A correction factor is the only fit parameter to the data, and the red line shown in Figure 6 is the fit from 0 to 1000 triggered pixels.  The value of A is 0.9, which is slightly larger than 0.73 expected from the quoted performance of BC-430 but is within the expected error.

The fit provides the value of the correction term A 4  D ISCUSSION  To help prepare the readout for the next generation prototype, we are interested in the simulating the expected response of the SSPM detector for protons with initial kinetic energies from 20 MeV to 10 GeV.  This response is based on the calibration standard developed in the previous sections.  The simulation presented here will use the newest SSPM design \(AE217 s not available for the NSRL beam tests. The scintillator will be 3 mm 327 3 mm 327  3 mm to match the face of the SSPM The chip that will be used for the dosimeter will be the AE217.  The chip consists of a uniform distribution of 2064, 50 mm 327 50 mm pixels in a 3 mm 327 3 mm silicon die The fill factor for this device is 61%.   The prototype quadrant 2 in the AE215 chip\his layout has shown superior performance over other layout designs for light pulses from gamma-induced events in scintillators and light sources such as LEDs and diode lasers In operating an SSPM, the device\222 s response is confined by a lower and upper limit on the number of pixels that are triggered. The lower limit is dominated by photon statistics where the intrinsic resolution is t n 1 and n t is the number of triggered pixels.  For this simulation, we  put a 10% limit on the resolution, which limits the minimum number of pixels to 100.  From \(3\he number of pixels that trigger follows a saturation curve that limits the number of pixels that can be triggered for a single proton event.  In order to minimize the nonlinearities described from \(3 customary to limit the response of the device to 85% of the available pixels, of 1754 pixels for the AE217 Assuming perfect readout electronics, the excess bias is the only variable that can be changed for device optimization The energy loss and light yields in 3 mm of BC-430 plastic for protons ranging from 20 MeV to 10 GeV are shown  


  6 The response of the AE217 die coupled to a BC-430 at four excess biases \(5, 2, 1, 0.5 V\s shown in Figure 7 024681012 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 Excess Bias 5 V 1 V 2 V 0.5 V  Number of Triggerred Pixels Energy Deposited \(MeV 20 MeV - 10 GeV Protons 3mm Plastic 100 pixels 1754 pixels  Figure 7 - Number of triggered pixels for incident protons of 20 MeV to 10 GeV.  The protons were transported through 3 mm of BC-430 plastic, yielding a scintillation response calibrated on the data from the NSRL measurements.  The plot shows the 100 and 1754 pixel limits, which provide the best spectral response for the SSPM.  The SSPM used in this simulation has the properties of the AE217.  The response is shown for four excess biases, and excess biases from 2 to 5 V will provide the above adequate spectral response The limits of 100 and 1754 pixels are shown as dashed blue lines. It is clear that a device operated between 2 to 5 V excess bias will provided the desired response for the most relevant incident protons of 20 MeV to 10 GeV.  Higher energy protons will provide similar energy deposition in the plastic compared to 10-GeV protons, which is easily covered by the device response.  For energies less than 20 MeV, the protons will stop in the plastic.  The number of triggered pixels will be less, since the light yield is less, for equivalent energy depositions for higher energy protons This behavior is outside the scope of a relevant instrument for space dosimetry 5  C ONCLUSION  The response function for proton dosimeter built using a SSPM and plastic scintillator is f easible for protons with an incident energy from 20 MeV to 10 GeV.  The proportional response of the detector can provide a direct calculation of the human equivalent dose for protons in a space environment A key point has been demonstrated in this paper for a compact, low-mass active dosimet er using tissue-equivalent plastic.  This has been achievable using a solid-state photomultiplier built using a st andard CMOS fabrication process.  The device will provide an additional level of radiation protection for astronauts against SPEs for LEO and interplanetary space flight A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  We would like to thank NASA for their funding, contract NNJ08JA55C, and the NASA Sp ace Radiation Laboratory NSRL\ Ruse k and Michael Sivertz, at Brookhaven National Laboratory, for their assistance with the proton beam measurements.

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

Analyzing covariance consistency is applicable to radar systems both in the field and in simulations.  The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
