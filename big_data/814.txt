functions for carry-chain optimization purposes Several alternative designs are then presented with the corresponding time performances and area consumption figures In order to compare the results the straight implementation of a decimal ripple-carry adder and the FPGA optimized base 
adder for the same range are implemented Results for big operands show that the decimal adder works faster than an equivalent binary implementation 
and furthermore the coding 
decoding processes are no more needed 
 
1 Introduction In a number of computer arithmetic applications decimal systems are preferred to the binary ones The reasons come not only from the complexity of coding  decoding interfaces but mostly from the lack of precision and clarity in the results Decimal arithmetic plays a key role in data processing environments such as commercial financial and Internet-based applications 1,2,10 Performances required by applications with intensive decimal arithmetic are not met 
by most of the conventional software based decimal arithmetic libraries 1 Hardware implementation embedded in recently commercialized general purpose processors 3,11 are gaining importance Furthermore 
seems to be the best choice until now Issues on hardware realization of decimal arithmetic 
BCD 
is used for decimal arithmetic algorithm implementations Although other coding systems may be of interest 
IEEE 
has recently published a new standard 754-2008 11 that supports the floating point representation for decimal numbers Presently Binary Coded Decimal 
BCD 
units appear 978-1-4244-3846-4/09/$25.00 2512009 IEEE to be widely open potential improvements are expected in what refers as well to algorithm concepts as to hardware design This paper resumes some new ideas about carry-chain type algorithms for adding 
12 with quite acceptable performances in terms of speed and hardware consumption Addition is used as a primitive operation for computing most arithmetic functions so that it deserves particular attention It is well known that

BCD 
in classical algorithms the execution time of any program or circuit is proportional to the number 
of digits of the operands In order to minimize the computation time several ideas have been proposed in the literature  4 Most of them consist in modifying the classical algorithm in such a way to minimize the computation time of each carry the time complexity may still be proportional to 
N 
N 
but the proportionality constant may be reduced Moreover it has to be pointed 
out that within the same range decimal addition involves shorter carry propagation process that for the straight binary code It will be shown in the practical implementations that adding 
will be greater if coding and decoding processes are not considered as of today the dramatic decreasing of hardware cost stimulates works on time savings Decimal carry-chain and ripple-carry adders have been implemented on Virtex 
digits can not only save coding interfaces but moreover provides time savings Hardware consumption for

It can be noticed from the graphics that the univariate SPC using only the current information is not very sensitive to the degradation. The MSPC methods provide better sensitivity Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 present the confusion matrix for each of the three methods considering all the flights for the 250 simulated instances. To measure the sensitivity of each method, the average run length from fault occurrence to fault indication was calculated.

Using the criteria of area under curve it can be noticed that Runger U2 consistently presents the best performance among the three One possibility to further improve the quality of any of these methods is to use debounce times such that more than one consecutive faulty value would be necessary to trigger a fault indication Table 1 - Comparison of the thresholds obtained with the parametric and the non-parametric methods Parametric Non-parametric SPC 0.86757 0.8804 Hotelling  s T2 9.2103 9.2789 Runger U2 6.6349 6.4636   0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 1.5 1 0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 Cycles Co m m an de d Cu rr en t A v er ag e Va lu e  Figure 8 - Degradation index evolution for one instance of the system - SPC method 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40

CONCLUSION This work presented data-driven statistical approaches to monitor the health state of aircraft flap and slat systems. The health monitoring methods were based on statistical process control concepts. The techniques were tested using data from the simulation of a flap system dynamic model Runger U2 statistics based on measurements of motor command current and operational conditions produced the best results from the considered set of techniques Future work may include the use of real aircraft data to test the presented methodologies. Another possibility is the development of prognostics algorithms using the same statistical features. This would require a better knowledge on the way the degradation evolves in the system for the failure mode under consideration REFERENCES 1] G. E. P. Box; J. S. Hunter and W. G.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
