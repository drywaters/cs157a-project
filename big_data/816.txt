Introduction In data encryption technique, the DES \(with 64bit data 
block\ is still one of utility now, the method with properties of fast operation, easy achieve hardware, can make digital seal, etc. But it keys management is complex. The RSA algorithm keys management is not complex as DES, but the calculation heavy. So if we can develop a new method with both excellent that will be useful. As we known, there are many different method to do data encryption, if we collect 
many method and make each a number as Method Encryption Key\(MEK\nd keep a Data Encryption Key\(DEK\hen get a two keys method with both excellence and improvement intensity of Encryption. This paper descript the algorithm, and show the new method utility. Fig.1 is new method principle   Fig.1 General Structure and New structure   The MEK can be used in many ways, for example, a bank 
can use the first 8 bit of total 64 bit as a base key, then the next 8 bit as zone key, then the next 8 bit as a branch key in the zone,\205 etc. For another example, one country can just use one MEK for some App, and in this App the MEK is the same and needn\222t know for each user, in this case, the user just use DEK as DES technique  II. Fundamentals The DES is a mature technique which is widely adopted. It 
first use a IP box to change the data order, we also adopt the order change method, and even we use the box as data encryption key \(DEK\. From this key we can use many different methods to bring different encryption codes, that is  from the DEK we can get MEK, different DEK or MEK can produce different result code. Like DES, we use multi-level encryption to the data as the result code. One level is as following chart

Encryption Key\. This transformation can be expressed as the following formula:    Y\(n\ = X\(m\                   \(1 X\(m\ is the original sequence, the Y\(n\ is the changed sequence and the relationship of n and m can be expressed by a one dimension array m = k+ \(n\,  n= 1,2,3,\205.N.  m = 1,2,3,\205.N       \(2 k+ \(n\ntains the order changing characteristics and acts as a encrypt box, and the following encrypt box indicates k+ \(n\ then  Y\(n\ = X\(k+\(n\\   n = 1,2,3,\205.N.                 \(3 forms the forward transform, and X\(n\ = Y\(k-\(n\\      n = 1,2,3,\205.N.               \(4 forms the backward transform. That is, forward transform is to move the value pointed by k+\(n in the original sequence to the item n in the new sequence, and backward transform is to move the value pointed by k-\(n\numbe r n. in the original sequence  For example, when N=8, every item of a simple X\(n\ is a number X\(n\ = \(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8  8,7,5,6,3,2,1,4\he forward transform Y\(1\ = X\(8\, Y\(2\ = X\(7\, Y\(3\ = X\(5\, Y\(4\ = X\(6 Y\(5\ = X\(3\, Y\(6\ = X\(2\, Y\(7\ = X\(1\, Y\(8\ = X\(4 then Y\(n\ = \(8,7,5,6,3,2,1,4  as the forward transform Y\(1\ = X\(8\, Y\(2\ = X\(7\, Y\(3\ = X\(5\, Y\(4\ = X\(6 Y\(5\ = X\(3\, Y\(6\ = X\(2\, Y\(7\ = X\(1\, Y\(8\ = X\(4 then Y\(n\ = \(8,7,5,6,3,2,1,4\s the backward transform X\(8\ = Y\(1\, X\(7\ = Y\(2\, X\(5\ = Y\(3\, X\(6\ = Y\(4 X\(3\ = Y\(5\, X\(2\ = Y\(6\, X\(1\ = Y\(7\, X\(4\ = Y\(8 then X\(n\ = \(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\. Obviously, order changing operation has the following characteristics 1  n = k-\(k  n\\   n = 1,2,3,\205.N.                  \(5 2\X\(n\ = Y\(k X\(k  n\  n = 1,2,3,\205.N.           \(6 3\Y\(n\ = X\(k Y\(k n\  n = 1,2,3,\205.N.            \(7 It should be notice that though in the above example every item of X\(n\ is a simple number, in fact there is no such restriction, each item could be a array, a character string or a certain data structure Actually, there are two methods to express the backward transform of the forward transform k\(m\, one is keeping the operation of forward transform but using the contrary encrypt box p\(m\ of encrypt box k+\(n\, which is called method of contra-encrypt box. The other is keeping the original encrypt box k+\(n\ut using contrary algorithm k-\(n\f the reverse address seeking, that is to get the seque nce number of the value k+\(n the position after transposition, wh ich is called contra-transform method For example, if X\(n\ = \(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\ the encrypt box of its forward transform is k  n\ = \(8,7,5,6,3,2,1,4\, then the result of forward transform is Y\(n\ \(8,7,5,6,3,2,1,4  To seek the backward transform of the above example using contra-encrypt box method k  n\ = \(8,7,5,6,3,2,1,4\ then p\(n 7,6,5,8,3,4,2,1\, and  X\(n\=\(Y\(p\(1\\,Y\(p\(2\\,Y\(p\(3\,\Y\(p\(4\\,Y\(p\(5\\,Y\(p\(6\\,Y\(p\(7\\,Y\(p\(8 Y\(7\,Y6\,Y\(5,\Y\(8\,Y\(3\,Y\(4\,Y\(2\,Y\(1 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8  to get backward transform of the above example using contra-transform method k n\ = \(8,7,5,6,3,2,1,4\, the contra-transform algorithm is X\(n\ = Y\(k n\ and k-\(n\ is the sequence number of value n in k+\(n X\(n\ = \(Y\(k 1 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 Order changing can also be expressed as a two dimensions number list or matrix. For example, in a 32 bit sequence, the order changing rule of encryption could be showed through a 4*8 array as the following order changing list\(which called DEK in the latter part of this paper 9  21  25  12  30  22  10  4 1  17   8  31  23  15  13  19 28  6  32   2  27  14   5  24 16  18  3   7  11  20  26  29 Fig. 3  DEK - Ordering Changing Array The above list shows that to put the information of No. 9 to the position of No.1, to put the information of No.21 to the position of No.2\205. Then when decoding, it just needs to move the information of No.1 to the position of No.9 an d to move the information of No. 2 to the position of No.21\205.to get back the original sequence. The characteristic of DEK is that every number will be appear and just appear once, its encrypt and decode is one to one correspondingly If one order changing can not get enough intensity, several times order changing encryption could be used, and then a integral encrypt is formed  2  Generate Method Encryption Key \(MEK The different MEK means different encryption method, so we need many different methods. We use Xor to encode the data, that need a 64 bit key, this key can be generated from DEK, and there are many different way to get this key. Some examples as following Let original sequence has 6 bit as  if the 6 bit MEK as  1684 


One way is called as odd even method, we define odd as 1 and even as 0, then we get the key as: 1 0 0 0 1 1 Second way is called as increase decrease method, we compare one digit with second one, if increase then define as 1 and decrease as 0, in this way we get the key as: 1 0 1 0 1 0 Third way is called as Add Odd Even method, we add one digit to the next, such as 3 add 6 get 9, then we get 9 8 6 5 6 8, the use odd even method, we get a new key: 1 0 0 1 0 0 This key can be shift to a new sequence, if we right shift the 100100 by one bit, we get 001001, if by 2 bit, we get 010010 The DEK can also be shifted to form a new DEK There are many ways to generates new key from DEK, all the keys make a key set, the MEK is choice one sub-set which may use some methods to mix a sequence. For Example, the following defines a 8 bit MEK, if we let MEK = 01101111, then means the method is odd even method with DEK shift 2 digits and self-encryption key shift 1 digit, and MEK shift 2 digits then the MEK make inverse  Fig. 5 some encryption method III. Detailed Application Method and Particular Techniques 1. From the DEK and MEK to get the data Xor key is important, it can not be omitted  The former discussion of many kind of encryption methods do not deal with the signal cell\222s characteristics. We use the data block that means the signal cell is a binary 0 or 1. In this case decoder can decode the encrypt box k\(n\ by inputting a set of particular constants. For example, send 10000000 as data Observing the output sequence, the content of encrypt box k\(n can be get from the rule of change of each number According to such situatio n, it needs to do encrypt transformation to carried information. For example, to do exclusive-OR algorithm with a certain cipherkey or to transform part of the information to some numbers that the decoder does not know so the decoder cannot crack the content of encrypt box from the changing of the numbers\222 position  2. The DEK can do every kind of combined operation and form new DEK. In addition, during different period different DEK can be used. This could increase the difficulty of decoding To encode the DEK itself will produce a new DEK for next level For example, k\(n\ {8,3,5,1,7,2,6,4 changes the order of k\(n\ and gets a new DEK j\(n\ k\(k\(n\ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 3. The detailed techniques of producing a DEK is as the following narration and a DEK with stronger randomicity could be gained. For instance, to form a encrypt box with N=64, the first order changing number k1 can be gained by the using of 0-1 uniformly distributed white noise generator, then also using the 0-1 uniformly distributed white noise generator to produce a new number and if this number is not equal to k1 it can be set as the second order changing number k2, continuing the former steps to get a new number which ranges from 1 to 64, and if it has not appeared sets it as k3\205till entirely done 4. The Management of DEK It can be concluded that every two transmit nodes have two different DEK, and along with the increase of the nodes large numbers of DEK are produced. When there are M nodes, it needs 2M more DEK to add the M+1 node. Though DEK can be used repeatedly in many places, its manage workload is very big. For mobile communication usage, the situation would be better because each base station only corresponds with the near base stations and the number of DEK will be largely decreased IV. Estimation of intensity of encryption For the commutation of a N items array, its order changing has N!-1 classes \(that is its complete arrange minus the original arrange When the N is increasing, the classes increase rapidly. If it needs to change, all digits change its order. The analysis is as the following Sets I N as the total classes that each digit of a N array changes its order, then I N n! \226 C n 1 n-1\ C n 2 n-2\ \226 C n 3 n-3\ \205.. + \(-1\k C n k n-k 205  1685  212 212 212  N k k k n k k N N 0         1    212 212  N k k N k N k n C I 0     1

For the class number counted by factorial, its encrypt intensity is quite strong  Above analysis have not consider the MEK function, The MEK will much more increase the intensity, that will studied in other paper   V. Comparison of DES and the new TKE 1  Both operate fast and is easy performed by hardware 2  Both have the property that when one bit in the data charged the encryption code will have many bits charged 3  Both can make data digital seal 4  The same algorithm can be used for encryption & decryption 5  The TKE can make digital signature, but the DES can not 6  The principle and method is transparence in TKE, but DES is not 7  The TKE data block has different length, but the DES just 64 bit 8  The TKE has strong encryption intensity, and the encryption method can be easy changed, but DES can not 9  The TKE need two keys, but DES only need one  VI. Further Research Items 1. As encryption method has too many, it needs standardization  2. The key management way need development future 3. The arithmetic of more layers order changing and data encryption remains to be studied detailed   VII. Conclusion This paper discusses the fundamental of two keys encryption  puts forward the basic encryption techniques based on add method key and discussed some problems in the actual application. Results of the pilot study illuminate that the TKE technique is practical since its high encrypt intensity, simple hardware implement, versatility encryption way, multi-length of data blocks, multi-usage in data safety and short running delay that could be adopted to enhance the security of information transmission  Acknowledgements This Paper was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(No. 9010623903  Reference 1  Wynne, DES Encryption, http://blog.21ic.com/more.asp?name qeewei&id =28454#,  2006-9-12 2  M e yer C a t e gor y  R F C 2 41 9 T h e PPP DE S E n c r y p t i on Prot oc ol  Version, http://www.cnpaf.net/Class/Rfcen/200502/3482.html 3  System Administration Guide: Security Services, Sun Microsystems   Z  W i n   an d R  A  Sc h olt z  U l t r a 226  w i d e ba nd w i d t h ti m e h opp in g  spread-spectrum impulse radio for wireless multiple-access communication IEEE Trans.

group has a centroid of signal strength that was a center point of signal pattern in the group. Second, a fine search is performed within the group to match the query point with the closet data. With this method, the separate layers of data can reduce the computation time in searching process, because it can eliminate irrelevant data in other groups. A cluster which 263 has the most similar signal pattern is selected as the proposed reference points Figure 4 shows the two proposed techniques of database clustering based on the fast nearest neighbor algorithm: the area-based clustering and the centroid of signal strength-based clustering. For the first method, the test route or the test area was divided into n cells. Each cell has its individual centroid which was the center of signal strength pattern in the cell Each category of reference points in both techniques is the proposed reference points. It has one representative used for formerly search to find the most nearest area of a test point For centroid of signal strength-based clustering, the signal strength pattern of the entire reference points was divided into n clusters. Conceptually, the reference points which have the similar signal strength pattern were assigned to be the same group. Due to signal strength of a mobile phone at a point is transmitted from several base stations, a signal data in a point was collected in n dimensions matrix. For this clustering algorithm, we used the k-means algorithm to cluster n signal data based on attributes into k partitions, k&lt;n. This algorithm also automatically finds the center of the cluster. In each cluster, the centroid of signal strength was used to be a representative of the cluster. For a test point, its signal strength pattern was compared with a representative of each cluster. A cluster which provided the most similar signal strength matching was utilized to be a proposed reference group Afterwards, the difference of signal strength pattern between a test point and every single member in a proposed reference group was performed by the full search in order to obtain the first and the second nearest points. These two nearest points will be used to interpolate the test point  s position by using the localization algorithm which is mention in the positioning algorithm section C. Positioning Algorithm According to the previous research paper, we selected the best positioning algorithm called mobile phone positioning by using linear interpolation of position from signal strength method [2]. This algorithm is described as follows  1  2  For a test point P, its signal strength pattern was compared with the signal strength pattern of the representatives in each clustered database. The most similar signal strength matching was deployed as the proposed cluster. To interpolate the location of point P, its signal strength pattern was compared with the signal strength pattern of all members in the cluster by using the conventional full search. This is to obtain the real two nearest reference points, A and B  For the position P, which is the position we wanted to locate. Parameter  lat  and  lon  represent the position of P in the term of latitude and longitude respectively. The subscriber A and B are the first and the second nearest referent points The constant ? is equal to 100 as a bias value EuPA and EuPB are Euclidean distances of signal strength between a test point and the reference points. The constant  PAEu?? indicates that more similar of the signal strength pattern higher weighting value. A high weighting value between a test point, P, and a reference point implies that the estimated position is located nearby that reference point III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 


III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS We collected data in the database by carrying out the probe system in a car, and drove along real roads in Bangkok Thailand. The speed of a test car was in a range of 40-60 km/hr. Signal strengths and the positions of the mobile probe were collected in pairs and recorded into a laptop. The average distance between points to be measured is down to 6-11 meters approximately. The entire database was passed through the noise reduction procedure and clustered into groups Figure 5 shows the examples of the data points on the test route           Figure 5. The proposed reference points after performing the fast nearest neighbor application For the test route, we selected a short routes that have both straight paths and curve paths. This is to be certain that our noise reduction algorithm was able to deal with several characteristics of the route path A. The Results of Positioning a Mobile Phone In order to estimate the position of a mobile phone, we drove the car with a sensor system along a test route to collect the signal strength pattern. Signal-position pairs of 766 test points were collected as a test set. The database which was eliminated the noisy data was used as a real database for performing the mobile positioning. The positioning results are shown in table 1. The results shown in table 1 do not involve the database clustering mentioned Errors in location were practically occurred from a GPS receiver.  Occasionally, the error points happened more than thousands meters away from the real positions. This greatly affected the error of positioning without noise reduction Sometimes, the errors were as high as kilometers. As the results shown in table 1, the errors in measurement provide inaccurate positioning result 264 However, the implementation of noise reduction improved the positioning results. In the table 2, the database was both incorporated with noise reduction and database clustering. In the clustering process, the database was clustered into 9, 16 25, 36 and 49 groups. The results in table 2 show that the computation time 68% decrease after the implementation of the database clustering. On the other hand, errors in positioning increase because test points are sometimes associated with the wrong cluster before implementing fine search According to the reversed outcome of two features, we needed to consider the performance of the positioning by weighing these two features with different ratios. The performance of the positioning I and II are presented in table 3 and 4 TABLE I.

According to the performances that were based on these two features computation time and positioning accuracy, we compared various percentages of each features with each other For accurate positioning applications, we recommend that the size of clustering which high accuracies in positioning are needed. The performance of such systems needs to be relied on high percentage of the error in positioning. On the other hand, high percentage of computation time is desired for the applications that need short time in calculation or applications that have low computational power. Mobile phone positioning is one of these. In our experiment, we emphasized more on the reduction of computation time. The results show that our test route with 12.8 kilometer long was appropriate with 49 database clusters. As seen in the data in table 2, the results of the different number of clusters provided no effect to the positioning errors. Therefore, higher number of database clusters was appropriate B. The Results of Road Traffic Estimation In order to estimate the traffic status, we use the velocity of a mobile phone in a car to indicate road congestion. The easiest way to obtain car speed is by determining the travel distance divided by travel time \(space mean speed the estimated position from the  previous point was used to calculate the speed of the car. In this study, we made an experiment on a local road of 12.8 kilometer long. The estimated velocities calculated by the space mean speed method were compared with the reference velocities obtained from the GPS receiver. Figure 6 shows the comparison of the real speeds of a car and the estimated speeds    Figure 6. The velocity estimation The results in the figure 6 show that the line of the estimated velocity is able to track reference trajectory According the estimated velocity of entire route, we interpreted the traffic status as fluent with an average error 11 km/hr 0 20 40 60

CONCLUSTION This paper presented road traffic estimation by using the speed of a mobile phone in moving car to represent the traffic status. The mobile phone positioning was implemented by signal matching with the collected database. Since a large database size was desired, we built a new sensor system to automatically collect mobile phone information. A sensor system and the positioning algorithm are tested along a real road. According to the fact that our database is sizeable, a noise reduction technique was applied database implementation. Moreover, a fast nearest neighbor algorithm was also combined in reference point searching to reduce the computation time. The positioning results show that a mobile phone is able to employ as a traffic probe. The positioning technique is performed by using signal strength matching. The implementation of positioning algorithm combined with a proposed noise reduction and a fast nearest neighbor application has efficiency to estimate the traffic congestion ACKNOWLEDGMENT The work described in this paper was supported by Thailand Graduate Institute of Science and Technology TGIST Technology Development Agency \(NSTDA Electronics and Computer Technology Center \(NECTEC Thailand  REFERENCES 1] C.

of end-to-end operational process considerations to provide emergency medical care as seen through the eyes and experience of a patient. The top level of this diagram represents a linear work flow of a patient from emergency notification \(e.g., ACN, 911 phone call provision, and arrival and definitive care provision at an emergency department and/or trauma center Based on findings, emergency responder processes may be viewed as dynamic or sequential. But the sequential representation is meant to take into account the patient experience, an important system design characteristic as described by Schooley and Horan [18 2. As shown in the second level \(from the top Figure 5, a multi-organizational view of the system architecture is an essential consideration for the ICTIN concept. As described throughout this paper and illustrated in Figure 6, many organizations are involved in emergency response activities, from emergency notification through care provision. Many other practitioners and organizations are involved in Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 crash analysis, public health research, patient outcome research, and other analyses. Therefore, the architecture needs to accommodate the information and data needs of a wide variety of organizations including authorized access to information, while maintaining the privacy and security of patient information. Fortunately, the technology exists to enable these software quality attributes.  How to implement such attributes in a complex large-scale environment is a challenge yet to be resolved 3. Dynamic information sharing considerations are represented on the third and fourth levels of Figure 5 From this analysis, and prior research, a number of information types, or taxonomies, are captured analyzed, and distributed across EMS organizational actors and hardware and software systems. The view represented here is one that would allow for information to be fully utilized by authorized emergency responders \(and information systems downstream? points of an emergency response episode. For example, rather than waiting for a paramedic to click the ?submit report? button of an electronic patient care record, patient information would be dynamically \(and incrementally physicians at a receiving ED or trauma center. To enable such open systems, web services and related information architecture standards would need to be implemented across organizations and information systems so that both ?push? and ?pull? functionality could exist for any and all authorized users 4. End-to-end performance reporting capabilities across organizations and information systems are also enabled through such an architecture. The ability to pull any number of data elements not  Figure 5. Information Coordination across the Emergency Response Process  only benefits real-time clinical decision making, but would also allow for the creation of customized reports for real-time monitoring \(e.g., dashboards retrospective research and analysis. The idea here is that performance analysis becomes a system design consideration at the outset, as opposed to taking the traditional approach of constructing performance reports after the system has been built. As shown in Figure 6, reporting and analytics would be a key component of the ICTIN 5. Additional enterprise architecture characteristics 


5. Additional enterprise architecture characteristics are illustrated in Figure 6. Though alluded to in the above discussion, these include a. Security/Privacy: A standard suite of network software, and data security measures would be implemented to ensure safe transport of patient information in accordance with State and National privacy guidelines and laws Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 b. Patient tracking system: In order to accurately identify data from one system to another, there must be a common data identifier that could associate data with a patient, including vehicle, incident, medical information, care provision, receiving hospital medications administered, dispatched emergency resources, time of phone call, etc. The data would all be linked back to the patient for real-time and retrospective analysis. A patient tracking system would facilitate this core function of the ICTIN c. Directory and Access Services: This would be one or several secure databases that include a listing of all authorized organizations and individuals allowed to access ICTIN information. Individuals would register,,be approved by the managing organization, and then allowed access to certain information based on the information access policies prescribed by the managing body. The directory is controlled by a managing entity to be determined by the network stakeholders  5.1. Directions for Subsequent Phases  While there exists a need for an integrated crash trauma information network \(CTIN a paucity of guidance, literature, and directions on how to achieve such a complex system implementation.  As confirmed by the local and state focus group discussions in Minnesota, further exploration into the potential and feasibility of developing an integrated crash trauma information network would provide an innovative advancement from both a research and practice perspective. More specific recommendations for taking a phased and incremental research approach to move the concept forward are discussed below In our phased approach, several methods are being employed.  A first task would be to validate the Minnesota case studies by conducting a comparative case study review in another state. Findings from a cross-case comparison would be used to outline the parameters for an initial prototype of the integrated crash information system. The prototype would be a simplified ?sample? system to provide a ?proof of concept? and illustrate how crash information could be shared from the moment of impact, through emergency dispatch and response, and then into the emergency room and health treatment services. A key component of this prototype will be the integration of data around the patient. Our straw man system CrashHelp series of interviews and focus groups with significant stakeholders in the process, including departments of transportation, public safety, 911, emergency services, and healthcare. Small data sets from crash EMS, health information systems would be collected and used to develop and populate the prototype to demonstrate its utility for safety decision support and planning purposes.  Feedback analysis from policymakers, planners, public health, EMS, safety engineers, emergency planners and citizens will focus on operational, organizational, and policy 


on operational, organizational, and policy deployment challenges surrounding an enhanced EMS system, including possible benefits from its utilization  Figure 6. Organizations and Integrated Crash Trauma Information Network Services  6. Expected Benefits &amp; Conclusion  The Trauma network would organize the information around the patient, providing a user/consumer centric approach to information design and use. In doing so, the trauma network would extend current EMS systems to include a greater range of information, including information that has been requested by emergency room physicians but often not available. This information is expected to improve not only the timeliness, but also the quality of the emergency response and improve patient care An end-to-end trauma network would allow for more holistic data analysis that can be both visualized and conducted in real-time. Just as private sector operations have achieved benefits through integrated customer systems \(e.g., CRM apply to the victim of a trauma. In this case, the issue is not just better customer service but fundamental issues of life and death  8.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
