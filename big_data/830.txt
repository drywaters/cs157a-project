Saleh School of Physics, Universiti Sains Malaysia 11800 Penang, Malaysia 604-6533888, Fax: +604-6579150 hslim@usm.my, mjafri@usm.my khirudd@usm.my, wongcj@uism.my, nasirun@usm.my  Abstract 227In this study, we propose a new cost effective approach to retrieve Aerosol Optical Thickness \(AOT\data in the visible spectrum by using sky transmittance measurements measured by a handheld spectroradiometer 
The transmittance values were measured in spectral region from 350 nm to 1050 nm at the earth\222s surface. The well known Beer-Lambert law was used in this study to retrieve AOT values from the measured transmittance value. The concentrations of particulate matter of less than 2.5 micron PM2.5\easured simultaneously with the measurements of the transmittance data. The station locations of the PM2.5 measurements were detemined using a handheld GPS. Three interpolation techniques, namely Kriging Interpolation, Inverse Distance Interpolation and Natural Neighbour Interpolation, were used for mapping the PM2.5 concentration in this 
study. The accuracies of the three interpolation techniques were determined in this study in order to select the most suitable technique for mapping the air pollution concentration over Penang Island Malaysia. The results of the an alysis indicated that the AOT values were linearly correlated with the PM2.5 readings AOT and PM10 maps were genera ted using an interpolation technique \(Kriging\based on the measured data. Basically both PM2.5 and AOT maps agree reasonably well over Penang Island, Malaysia. The highest PM2.5 concentrations were found in densely populated and industrialized areas

IEEEAC paper #1365, Version 3, Updated November 2008 1  I NTRODUCTION  Environmental pollution becomes more and more serious due to continues growth of industrial development all around the world. In order to ensure this situation is under control, Malaysia\222s government has established a network throughout Malaysia to monitor the environmental situation Air pollution is one of the most important environmental problems, and is concentrated mostly in cities when large populations live. The objective of air quality monitoring is to estimate pollutant \(total suspended particulates TSP 
concentrations [1 In this study, we present a method for air quality mapping from ground-based measurements. The concentrations of particulate matter of size less than 2.5 micron \(PM2.5\collected simultaneously with the atmospheric transmittance measurements. Our purpose is to generate AOT and PM2.5 ma ps over USM campus, Penang Island, Malaysia. The well known Beer-Lambert law was used in this study to retrieve AOT values from the measured transmittance values. The objective of this study was to evaluate the strong correlation between the measured PM2.5 and AOT values retrieved from atmospheric transmmitance 
measurements 2 STUDY AREA  The study area is the Penang Island, Malaysia within latitudes of 5 o 12\222 N to 5 o 30\222 N and longitudes 100 o 09\222 E to 100 o 26\222 E \(Figure 1\ng PM10 measurements were collected at several selected locations    


  2  Figure 1-The location of the study area 3  I NTERPOLATION TECHNIQUE  Interpolation is the procedure of predicting the value of an attribute at unsampled sites from measurements made at a location within the same area or region. Interpolation is necessary when the data we have does not cover the domain of interest completely There is no one simple method for interpolation To correlate data, sampling methods, targets of interpolation, we have several methods: Exact and inexact interpolation, global and local interpolation, deterministic and geostatistic interpolation Air pollution dispersion is a local phenomenon and we prefer that the model s hows real measurements in sample points. In this regard we use an exact and local method of interpolation. Therefore inverse distance and Kriging interpolation is used for modeling between the monitoring stations When data are abundant, most interpolation techniques give similar results. When data are sparse however, the assumption made about the underlying variation that has been sampled and the choice of method and its parameters can be critical if one is to avoid misleading results  3.1 INVERSE DISTANCE WEIGHT INTERPOLATION  The assumption of this method is that the value of an attribute at some unvisited point is a distance-weighted average of data points occurring within a neighborhood or window surrounding the unvisited point. This model computes these form  3.2 KRIGING INTERPOLATION  Geostatistical methods of interpolation, popularly known as Kriging, attempt to optimize interpolation by dividing spatial variation into three components: deterministic variation, spatial autocorrelation, and uncorrelated noise Kriging fulfils the aims of finding better ways to estimate interpolation weights and of providing information about errors. This model computes these form We calculate weights with two constraints. Sum of all weight should be one and estimation variance should be at least. Kriging is an unbiased with minimum variance estimator. Error estimation in kriging interpolation related to distribution of sampling point    3.3  NATURAL NEIGHBOUR INTERPOLATION  Natural neighbor is as simple to use as Nearest Neighbor and provides more precise results; however, is only available for two-dimensional interpolations. Natural neighbor requires that a grid be defined. Once the grid has been defined, select Natural Neighbor from the combo box in the Geo tab of the Control Panel. Natural Neighbor interpolation is a weighted moving average technique that uses geometric relationships in order to choose and weigh nearby points 4 DATA ANALYSIS AND RESULTS  A handheld spectroradiometer was used to collect the sky transmittance data over USM campus. The PM2.5 measurements were collected simultaneously during the acquisition of sky transmittance measurements on 20/3/2007 from 56 stations in the USM campus. The AOT was calculated based on the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law The AOT is related to the transmission by the expression  s u d eT 002  u s cosines 004  004 is the zenith angle AOT  The AOT values were obtained after performing the sequence of the following calculations 200  First, we measured the total solar irradiance. This was done by measuring the radiance reflected from a Spectralon panel placed perpendicular to the direction of the Sun. The measured radiance was converted into irradi ance by multiplying by and then divided by the reflectance value of the Spectralon panel to obtain the total solar irradiance values 002 transmittance for direct irradiance at wavelength 002 003 002 212     1  where T d

This was done by first exporting the FieldSpec HH spectrum to a text file importing the text file into MS Excel and then performing the calculations in Excel. Th en the AOT values were computed using Equation \(1 The relationship between AOT and PM2.5 was investigated in this study and we found that there was a linear relationship between PM2.5 and AOT. With the present data set, the R and RMS values were 0.8670 and 3.2587 212 d   3 265 g/m 3      D  2  The day angle 200  Third, we computed the di rect solar irradiance by subtracting the diffuse irradiance from the measured total solar irradiance 200  Fourth, we computed the top-of-atmosphere \(TOA solar irradiance values corresponding to the wavelengths of the spectra measured by the FieldSpec HH. In this study, Wehrli 1985 AM0 Spectrum was chosen to calculate the TOA spectra and interpolate it to the FieldSpec HH wavelengths, multiplying by cosine of solar angle and then correcting for the exact Earth-Sun distance factor, D, given by Spencer, 1971 as  005 in radians is represented by  365/\1\(2 265 g/m 3 respectively as indicated in Figure 2. Several studies also found this linear relationshi W a ng and Christopher \(2003\so found the linear relationship between AOT and PM2.5 in their study. Finally, PM2.5 and AOT map over USM campus was created using Kriging interpolation technique \(Figure 3 From the PM2.5 map, we can see that the high concentration of the PM2.5 va lues was located near a bus station. This was due to the presence of a construction site near the bus station, so the PM2.5 level was expected to be highly associated by the construction activities. In this study, high air pollution concentrations were recorded at several locations such as, \(1\e construction site near the stadium, USM and Desa Kembara -Indah, so we expected that the PM10 level to be high during working time, \(2\he USM bus stop near the Desa Kembara -Indah, so we also expected that the PM10 levels to be high during busy times in the morning and evening and 3 recorded high PM10 levels due to emissions from vehicles   Figure 2-Extract of a map of PM2.5 265 g/m3  Figure 3-A linear correlation between AOT and PM2.5 265 g/m3\ues  Unit  200  Second, we measured the diffuse irradiance. This step was performed using the same Spectralon panel maintained in the same orientation as in step 1. The panel was shaded from direct sunlight using a disk of black painted cardboard mounted on a rod. The size of the disk and distance to the panel should be such that the shadow of the disk on the panel is just sufficient to fully shade the area viewed by the FieldSpec HH. As in step 1, we measured the reflected radiance. Again, the measured radiance is converted to irradiance by multiplying by and then dividing by the reflectance value of the Sp ectralon panel to obtain the diffuse irradiance values 


  4    Figure 4-Extract of a map of AOT Ground truth data were divided into two groups half of the numbers of air quality samples were randomly selected for interpolation analysis to generate the air quality maps and the other half for accuracy analysis using the three different interpolation techniques, Kriging Interpolation Inverse Distance Interpolation and Natural Neighbour Interpolation. The air quality values created by the interpolation techniques were then compared to the ground truth data and their accuracies R and RMS values noted. Kriging interpolation technique produced the highest accuracy based on the high R value and low RMS value The results of accuracy analysis produced in this study are shown in Table 1   Table 1-R and RMS values of the three different interpolation techniques  Accuracies R RMS Kriging Interpolation 0.8594  2.5659  Inverse Distance Interpolation 0.5214  6.1329  Natural Neighbour Interpolation 0.3691 8.2625 5 CONCLUSION  This study indicated that the feasibility of PM2.5 retrieval technique by using a handheld spectroradiometer. The proposed technique can be used for the determination of the PM2.5 values from the spectrora diometer with a reasonable accuracy. The technique is a cheaper alternative to obtaining remotely sensed data for air pollution studies 6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This project was carried out using the USM short term grants and Science Fund.

peak-to-mean ratio when compared to movie sequences The reason for this is that rapid movement of a lot of small objects increase the amount of data necessary to encode a sequence The background in the video scenes plays a significant role in shaping the size of the video frames For this reason videos of similar content type e.g movies cartoons sporting events will have highly different statistical distributions of the frame sizes The size of the I-frames P-frames and B-frames highly depend on the amount of movement which exists in the video sequence e.g panning zooming background movement etc While I-frames encode each frame independently their sizes tend to be larger but they are less susceptible to movement than Pand B-frames Pand Bframes since they use the information from other frames in order to encode data tend to be more susceptible to movement Particularly for video sequences where there are a lot of small moving objects Pand B-frames may be of the same size as I-frames MPEG video encoding for NASA specific mission streams In this section we provide an analysis of some NASA mission specific video streams which have been obtained from the public domain archives Using this analysis we provide a tool which synthesizes video traffic that can be imported into a network simulator such as the SCaN simulator Video analysis In developing a good video traffic synthesization tool we need to determine what is the dynamic pattern of video traffic which we are interested in modeling From the literature on dynamic of video traffic 8 we have identified that frame size distributions can generally be modeled well by a gamma distribution For this analysis we have gathered a large set of different NASA specific videos We are presenting 7 particular videos which we have analyzed The set of videos are as follows Table 1 Video clips analyzed Video Video Content number 1 Space Walk I dark background 2 Space Walk II dark background 3 Astronaut working in the dark 4 Astronaut moving inside ISS and looking out the window 5 Astronaut working in a lab I 6 Astronaut working in a lab II 7 Astronaut giving a teleconference The above videos have been encoded into MPEG version 4 format The encoding has the following characteristics  The coding has been done in the CIF format at 352x288 resolution  The quantizer q value we have chosen is 1 80  The video is encoded at 25 frames a second  The encoding is performed with a fixed GOP IBBPBBPBBPBB The videos have been encoded using the ffmpeg video ripping tool   We have used the MP4Box to put mpeg4 codec frames into mp4 multiplexed stream We have input the multiplexed streams into mp4trace program in order to transmit the stream to the network and collect the traffic trace The output of the traffic trace was received in the following form 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 H B B p B B p B B p B B H 13898 2145 2299 3866 2027 2301 4001 1988 2079 3956 2178 1943 13842 14 3 3 4 2 3 4 2 3 4 3 2 14 0 522 0 522 0 522 0 642 0 642 0 642 0.761 0.761 0.761 0.881 0.881 0.881 1.001 The first column of the data set represents the frame number The second column represents the frame type where H  I Frame P  P frame and B  B frame The third column represents the size of the frame in bytes The fourth column represents the q value of the compression The fifth column represents the time stem For analyzing the statistical distributions of the frame sizes using these data sets we have developed three different Matlab scripts called Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer and Frame Distribution Fitting Tool We will present the features of each one of the tools separately Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer The quick distribution analyzer uses the trace of the data sets in order to provide a quick sketch of the distribution for each one of the frame types The program works as follows First it separates all the data based on the type of frames For each one of the frame types it then determines the range of the frame sizes i.e what is the smallest and largest frame size of that type After this step the program divides the frame range in a set of equal subintervals and it determines the number of 7 


frames that fall in each one of the subintervals Finally the program uses the number of frames in each subinterval to plot an approximation of the pdf We note that the number of intervals in range of frame types will correspond to the number of points of the pdf approximation This means that if the number of intervals is small then the plot of the approximate pdf will have a small number of points generating some difficulty in trying to determine an approximate pdf for that frame type On the other hand if the number of frames is too large then there is a very good chance that most of the intervals will have a very small number of frames that fall inside of them resulting in a very choppy plot for the pdf approximation Determining a good number of intervals for each type of frames depends in the number of the frames of that type being analyzed Another problem with such an approach is that by changing the number of intervals for the frame type being analyzed in the case in which the number of frames of that type is small the pdf plot generated can change significantly This is due to the fact that a large number of frames may fall on one side of the boundary of such an interval In the case in which one changes the number of intervals these frames will now fall inside a different interval There are some benefits however for using this Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer First of all it provides a very quick plot which is a rough approximation of the frame size distribution Although the approximations generated by the Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer are better the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer generates plots order of magnitude faster Also the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer provides statistics to the user for each type of frames such as mean and variance of frame sizes minimum and maximum frame size Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer In the previous subsection we presented a program which generates a quick and rough approximation of the frame size distribution given the input data from the video traces The problem with that analyzer was that the distribution generated by the program is highly dependent on the quantization level of the ranges of the frame sizes and is generally not a smooth function due to the limited number of frames in the data sets scenario each one of the frames analyzed should be assumed not to have a size which is deterministic but rather comes from a distribution which is centered on that frame size One such distribution generally used for this type of filtration is a Gaussian normal distribution The benefits of using such a filtration are as follows  The distribution generation will not need to use a quantization technique so the program will not suffer from the quantization issue  The frame size distribution generated using such a filtration method will smooth out some of the noise due to the limited number of data points  We have seen that gamma distributions tend to be a good approximation for frame size distribution of each type Since gamma distribution is a smooth function by filtering some of the statistical noise using a filtration it will enable us to better determine the parameters for the gamma distribution which best approximate video for specific mission scenarios Frame Distribution Fitting Tool This tool is used in conjunction with the Gaussian Filtration Frame Analyzer in order to approximate by a gamma distribution the pdf of the frame sizes for all three types of frames Using this tool the user is able to adjust the two parameters describing the gamma distributions particularly the mean and the K-value which directly influences the variance of the distribution In particular a larger scale will make the distribution taller and narrower For all the data sets the mean of the gamma approximation was taken to be equal to the mean of the true data The K-value was adjusted accordingly in order to best fit the approximation to the true data Analyzed data In this section we present statistical data for the various scenarios proposed This data was gathered using the tools described in the previous sections In Table 2 we provide for each scenario analyzed the mean and the variance of the frame sizes of the I P and B frames We also provide the K-value for the gamma distribution which is centered and the data mean and best approximates the statistical data We plot the approximate gamma distributions for the various types of frames for each one of this scenarios in Figure 3 In this section we present a program which does not suffer from the quantization issue of the Quick Frame Distribution Analyzer Also this program filters out some of the statistical noise which is due to the limited data sets We motivate the intuition for this filtration as follows While making a video of a certain mission scenario a small change in the footage i.e the introduction of a small object in the picture may cause a small change in the encoded frame sizes For this reason while trying to derive a generic distribution to characterize a particular type of video 8

Figure 5 Statistically multiplexed traffic We note that in this case we would be able to utilize some of the free channel space for other types of transmissions which may be more delay tolerant see Figure 6 For example in this figure the bottom blue transmission can be thought to be a file which is packetized and needs to be transmitted down from the spacecraft We consider this file to be delay tolerant i.e the data is not needed right away down on the ground and it has a lower priority then the other traffics needed to be transmitted The delay tolerant packets will be transmitted only when the channel is not being fully utilized as to fill in the gaps available in the channel bandwidth This technique will delay the arrival of the delay tolerant traffic but will enable us to more fully utilize our channel bandwidth m T]T m Figure 6 Telemetry traffic along with delay tolerant traffic being sent via a channel We note in above scenario that although the delay tolerant traffic was transmitted at time 0 none of it was able to be transmitted until time 1 Also we note that the final delay tolerant traffic packet was transmitted 9 time instances later then it was received For this reason a buffering scheme must be devised such that all the delay tolerant traffic may be buffered until enough bandwidth for transmission exists Since no specific data was available on the dynamics of the various telemetry type traffics we developed a generic telemetry model which is formed by two types of traffic one constant bit rate which represents the sensory information which is constantly being transmitted down to the ground and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents file download and periodic data updates We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to telemetry constant bit rate  peak of intermittent transmission We will also assume that the intermittent transmission file transfer will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new files are ready to be transferred Using the above model we created a Matlab based tool for synthesizing traffic for simulation purposes The traffic generated by this tool is output to a file in a format which can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 5 COMMAND TRAFFIC MODEL The model for the command will be similar in spirit to the model which we have proposed for telemetry We see the data transmitted for command to be formed by two different types of transmission One constant bit rate which represents calls to various preloaded spacecraft subroutines and an intermittent transmission similar to the on/off type of traffic used to model the voice activity in the audio/voice transmission section which represents subroutine uploads to the spacecraft We assume that there will be a maximum bandwidth which may be allocated to command and we also assume that the intermittent transmission subroutine upload will transmit at the maximal possible rate when new subroutines are ready to be transferred Using this model we have developed a Matlab based traffic synthesizing tool The traffic provided by this tool can be used by network simulation tools such as the SCaN simulator 6 CONCLUSIONS This work has resulted in the development of a suite of traffic models that captures the fundamental types that will be in the space communications environment and in particular These models provide the capability to investigate the new IP-based communications functions and resulting performance that are required by the human exploration missions of NASA's Constellation Program and the Space Communications and Navigation SCaN network's ability to support them Four prototypical traffic models have been developed from which any number of streams may be generated 1 audio/voice 2 real-time motion imager live video 3 telemetry including both regular periodic data as well as intermittent file downloads and 4 command including periodic data as well as intermittent subroutine uploads The voice traffic model stochastically parameterizes calls talk times and talk spurts Multiple audio analysis tools were developed to assist in the derivation of parameters from data samples taken from relevant space missions Using these tools parameters of probability distributions were fit to data taken from Shuttle/ISS archives 12     n 


The characterization of motion imagery video traffic involved the stochastic characterization of I P B-frames of MPEG-4 sequences Several Matlab tools were developed to support video analyses wherein ISS and Shuttle specific mission video sequences were used to derive parameters for the associated model A general stochastic model was derived for data telemetry enabling broad parametric applicability ranging among constant bit stream periodic or bursty patterns This same general model through proper selection of parameters may also be used to model command data flow traffic Matlab programs were developed to enable each of the traffic types above to be synthesized and saved into a file for use by SCaN simulation for performance analyses Example flows were generated for a LEO case and an Ascent case and results illustrated using the SCaN Simulator These analyses show the need for such traffic models to determine packet loss including speech intelligibility and latency arising from both statistical multiplexing and potential use of DiffServ prioritization techniques when peak offered loads may undergo transient overload conditions 7 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration REFERENCES 1 Esther Jennings and David Heckman Architecture Modeling and Performance Characterization of Space Communications and Navigation SCaN Network using MACHETE submitted to 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings March 1-8 2008 2 Michael Hammer and James Champy Reengineering the Corporation New York Harper Business 1993 3 G Edward Bryan Not All Programmers Are Created Equal 1994 IEEE Aerospace Applications Conference Proceedings February 5-12 1994 4 Voice Activity Detection Using Generalized Gamma Distribution in Advances in Artificial Intelligence part of the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science Volume 3955 2006 5 Athina Markopoulou Fouad Tobagi and Mansour Karam Assessment of VoIP quality over Internet backbones In Proceedings of INFOCOM 2002 6 John Daigle and Joseph Langford Models for Analysis of Packet Voice Communications Systems IEEE JSAC SAC-4 6 1986 7 Harold Stem and Kim-Kwok Wong Modeling the on-off patterns in conversational speech including short silence gaps and the effects of interaction between speaking parties Vehicular Technology Conference 1994 8 0 Rose Statistical Properties of MPEG video traffic and their impact on traffic modeling in ATM systems Institute of Computer Science Report 101 University of Wurzburg 1995 BIOGRAPHY Tudor Stoenescu received a BS in Electrical Engineering  and an MS in Mathematics from North Dakota State University in 1999 and a MSE and PhD in  Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from University of Michigan in 2001 and 2004 respectively After receiving his PhD Dr Stoenescu accepted a Postdoctoral Scholar position in Information Science and Technology at California Institute of Technology In 2006 Dr Stoenescu joined the Telecommunications Architecture Group at Jet Propulsion Laboratory Dr Stoenescu's current research interests lie 13
