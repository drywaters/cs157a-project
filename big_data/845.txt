 djuric monica  ece.sunysb.edu Abstract\227 In the literature there are claims stating that particle 336 lters cannot be used for high dimensional systems because their random measures degenerate to single particles While this may be true for standard implementations of particle 336 ltering it may not be true for alternative implementations In this paper we build on our previous work for tracking multiple targets with multiple particle 
336 lters where each particle 336 lter tracks its own target We avoid the collapse of traditional particle 336 ltering by considering an interconnected network of such particle 336 lters where each of them works on a relatively low dimensional space We assume that our interest is in 336 nding the marginal posterior distributions of the state vectors describing the different targets and not in the joint posterior of all the targets We test the method on the problem of multiple target tracking based on sensor data which represent a superposition of contributions of all the targets in the 336 eld The computer simulations demonstrate the performance of the newly proposed method and compare it with other implementations of particle 336 ltering

ltering were established about 336 fty years ago with methods for estimating the mean squared extension of a self-avoiding random walk on lattice spaces  14 One of the 336 rst applications of the methodology was on the simulation of chain polymers The popularity of particle 336 lters PFs in the last 336 fteen years was triggered by  where the sampling-importance resampling 336 lter was presented and applied to tracking problems The timing of w as perfect because it came during a period when computing power started to become widely available Ever since the amount of work on particle 336 ltering has proliferated 978-1-4244-2622-5/09/$25.00 c

 represents observations from time instant one to time instant 
t where 
t is a positive integer To that end particle 336 ltering uses random grids which are composed of nodes usually referred to as particles with assigned weights the latter being interpreted as probability masses The particles and the weights form discrete random measures which are basically probability mass functions In the generation of particles each particle has a 223parent,\224 and the parent its own parent and so on Such sequence of particles is called a particle stream  and it represents one possible evolution of the state with time PFs use many such streams and their weights to approximate the evolution of state distributions with time The traditional approach in particle 336 ltering consists of using a single 
336 lter for computing approximations of complete joint distributions of interest As pointed out the approximations are based on discrete representations of these distributions by samples from the space of unknowns and weights associated to the samples The method relies on Bayes\222 theory and comprises three steps 1 generation of particles samples from the space of unknowns 2 computation of particle weights and 3 resampling The last step does not have to be implemented at every time instant but it is essential for accurate performance One driving force for the advancement of particle 336 ltering is the ever increasing range of its applications In theory PFs can be applied to any state space model where the likelihood and the prior are computable up to proportionality constants The accuracy of the method depends on how well 
we generate the particles and how many particles we use to represent the random measure Particle 336 ltering methods are computationally very intensive but they allow for signi 336 cant parallelization of their operation In it has been stated that PFs in general do not a v oid the curse of dimensionality In other words when the dimension of the state space increases it is expected that the number of necessary particles for good performance of the PFs grows rapidly Indeed their computational complexity is a function of the dimension of the state space as is their accuracy The latter however is true for any 336 ltering algorithm From estimation theory for example it is well known that the Cram 264 er1 


t v A  may be different which would correspond to a scenario of a sensor 336 eld with different types of sensors The objective is to track the targets with multiple PFs i.e with as many PFs as there are targets 3 M ULTIPLE PARTICLE FILTERING Previous work In we proposed and analyzed solutions for impro v ed particle 336 ltering for high dimensional systems by using a set of interconnected PFs operating on subspaces that partition the complete state space There the underlying idea is to decompose the state space into separate subspaces of lower dimensionality that form a partition of the original space The interest is in 336 nding the marginal posterior distributions of the state vectors that span these subspaces More speci 336 cally in we apply t his i dea on t he problem of tracking multiple targets moving in a sensor 336 eld as described in the previous section There the state equation is given by 1 and the observation equation by k  003 Rao bounds of the unknown parameters is a nondecreasing function of the dimension of the model In the multiple target problem too one can expect that with larger number of targets the PFs have to work with higher dimensional spaces As a result the PFs would need many more particles to preserve their accuracy In this paper we propose an approach to particle 336 ltering that would require much less particles than the number of particles needed by a standard PF SPF However we note that our objective here is to track marginalized 336 ltering distributions rather than to track complete joint 336 ltering distributions of the states of all the targets We also stress that in spirit the idea is the same as the one used in Rao-Blackwellization We extend our previous work for tracking multiple targets with multiple PFs and in general the w ay we address complex systems W e use a set of interconnected PFs operating on subspaces that form a partition of the complete state space In essence the algorithm is designed by employing one PF per target The building blocks are based on ideas from Here we propose an ef 336 cient strategy that copes with the problem of tracking simultaneously several targets The sensors report their measurements to a fusion center FC which implements the sequential tracking The paper is organized as follows First we formulate the problem in Section 2 In Section 3 we describe some of our initial results on this topic and then we present the proposed method Simulation results that demonstrate the method\222s performance are shown in Section 4 The paper ends with Section 5 with concluding remarks about the proposed approach 2 P ROBLEM F ORMULATION In a sensor 336 eld of 212 th target in the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and 212 th target measured at a reference distance 212 the target at time 212 th 336 lter which tracks the 212 th target does not need information from other 336 lters in order to generate its own particles at time instant n d  3 where 1 R x

Thus every PF proceeds with particle generation in the usual way 3 Communication of predictive information The observation equation suggests that the computation of the particle weights would require information about the states of the other targets in the system To that end the PFs exchange information which is the predicted locations of the targets they track In other words based on the weights from time instant  t  the PFs compute the predicted location of their target and broadcast it to the remaining PFs 4 Update of the associated weights Given the latest sensor measurements and the predicted locations of the other targets the PFs calculate the new weights of their particles and normalize them 5 Estimation and Resampling The PFs compute the desired estimates and perform

the generation of new particles Proposed approach Our interest is primarily in tracking targets based on sensor measurements representing a superposition of contributions from all the targets in the sensor 336 eld As an example we use sensors that measure signal power emitted by the targets where the model of received signal power is given by 1 212 th target at time instant 212 th target will be greater than a prede 336 ned threshold 212 th target For example if there are two targets in a 336 eld of 10 sensors the outcome 212 th target and where 212 th particle 336 lter From the problem

k,t 025 k,t k,t is some stochastic process with known distribution Again we could estimate k,t in the usual way and instead of the true value in the computations that follow we would use its predicted value need to use its data for estimating the location of that target So an important part of the algorithm is the classi 336 cation of the sensors into groups where each group contains the sensors that should sense the target at a particular time instant If there are 005 S S S 212 S S S S S 006 212 t for the weight update of the  y y y y x 212 x 212 x 212   v x x x x k,t k,t  the FC can predict

are the indexes of the sensors that should sense the k,t  Then based on this location the FC can predict where in the sensor 336 eld the received signal power due to the k,t k,t k,t 212 k,s t k,t k,s

assign the sensors to the various sets r x 212 L is some small prede 336 ned number A second alternative is to simply select the closest sensors four for example to a predicted location of the target and then use the measurements of these sensors for obtaining the 336 ltering distribution of the PF If we employ as importance distributions the priors of the states the update of the weights is carried out according to 002 002    where  since we do not have their forms In we resorted t o t he use of  3     005 t t Y Y l l l    s s 002 k   1 1 1 1 1 are the data used for computation of the

Fig 5 Prediction Accuracy 2D for the Neighborhood Communication over Gigabit Ethernet Fig 6 Prediction Accuracy 3D for the Neighborhood Communication over In\002niBand in the history 002le The goal of this section is not to fully evaluate the new algorithms and their runtime behavior but to determine the potential bene\002t of historic learning in case of a correct prediction Fig 8 shows the results obtained for 32 processes test case on the same cluster as described in the previous subsection using the Gigabit Ethernet interconnect The results indicate that the attribute based selection logic outperforms the brute force search approach due to its ability to exclude some of the badly performing versions early in the selection procedure However the performance of the application in this scenario could be further improved by using the historic learning capability within ADCL which skips testing under-performing implementations mocking the PredictFromClosest algorithm Fig 7 Prediction Accuracy 3D for the Neighborhood Communication over Gigabit Ethernet Fig 8 Performance Comparison of an Application utilizing the Brute Force Search the Attribute Based Search and Historic Learning V R ELATED W ORK Among the numerical libraries incorporating adaptive techniques are ATLAS 15 and FFTW 16 A TLAS abstracts the BLAS interfaces and provides several implementations for each function During an extensive con\002gure step ATLAS determines the best performing implementation on a speci\002c platform with a speci\002c compiler Furthermore based on additional information such as cache sizes ATLAS determines optimal internal parameters such as the blocking factor for blocked algorithms However ATLAS does not perform any runtime optimizations Star-MPI incorporates runtim e optimization of collective operations similarly to ADCL Unlike ADCL Star-MPI has only a single runtime decision logic namely a brute force search whereas one of the main research focuses of ADCL is

to develop alternative runtime decision algorithms in order to speed up the runtime decision logic The FFTW library optimizes Fast Fourier Transform FFT operations To compute an FFT the user has to invoke 002rst a planner specifying a problem which has to be solved The planner measures the actual runtime of many different implementations and selects the fastest one In case many transforms of the same size are executed in an application this plan delivers the optimal performance for all subsequent FFTs Since the planner can be time consuming FFTW also provides a mode of operation where the planner comes up quickly with a good estimate which might however not necessarily be the optimal one The decision process is initiated just once by the user Thus FFTW makes the runtime optimization upfront in the planner step which does not perform any useful work On the other hand ADCL integrated the runtime selection logic into the regular execution of the applications This is especially important since the ADCL approach enables the library to restart the runtime selection logic in case signi\002cant deviations from the original performance e.g due to changing network conditions have been observed FFTW has  to a limited extent  also the notion of historic learning namely with a feature called Wisdom  The user can export experiences gathered in previous runs into a 002le and reload it at subsequent executions However the wisdom concept in FFTW lacks any notion of related problems i.e wisdom information can only be reused for exactly the same problem size that was used to generate it Furthermore the wisdom functionality also does not include any mechanism which helps to recognize outdated or invalid wisdom e.g if the platform used for collecting the wisdom is signi\002cantly different than the platform used while reloading the wisdom VI C ONCLUSION This paper presents a new set of algorithms which have been designed in order to reduce the time spent in the runtime decision procedure of the Abstract Data and Communication Library ADCL by incorporating historic knowledge from previous executions The algorithms use the notion of an acceptable performance window  which is de\002ned as the relative performance penalty an application is willing to accept compared to the fastest possible version for the sake of a faster decision procedure Furthermore the algorithms establish the notion of a maximum distance for each entry in the history 002le The maximum distance provides a measure which indicates when the winner function of a particular entry will lead to an acceptable decision for other entries Using these mechanisms we de\002ned two alternative algorithms for recommending a version to a new unknown problem size one algorithm uses the recommendation of the closest problem found in case the distance between the new problem and the closest problem is below the maximum distance de\002ned for the closest problem the second algorithm introduces a weighted vote among all entries in the history 002le whose distance to the new problem size is below their maximum distance The algorithms presented also contain an automatic measure for indicating when to dismiss recommendations based on historic knowledge This safety net is based on comparing the predicted performance vs the real performance of the recommended code version We evaluated both algorithms for three different function sets using two different network interconnects The results indicate a reasonable rate of good recommendations by both algorithms the weighted vote algorithm outperforming usually the one based on the closest problem size Our future work includes an extended analysis of the new algorithms for other communication patterns such as circular shift operations or broadcast operations Of special importance is the evaluation of the new algorithms within the context of adaptive HPC applications In a long term we also plan to include further

A filter lag or so-called cluster tracking can easily result in a 5% or greater offset and degraded consistency.  After 300 seconds the curves peak up because the target is appr oaching a low-elevation beampoint limit.  This occurs anytime a target is tracked into the edge of the radar\222s field of re gard and can lead to radar-toradar handover difficulty         300 300 80  s D 2 k,1 k y    s D 2 k,1 k y   100 150 200 250 10 1                    10 5 1 0  Figure 8 - Consistency versus distance from beam center Monopulse Mismatch The next set of curves plotted in Figure 9 show the sensitivity of detection-primitive consistency to a mismatch in the monopulse slope.  All of these curves were generated using a linear monopulse response derived from the slope of the true monopulse response at beam center.  The slope of the 80% curve is 0.8 times th e beam-center slope; the 90 curve is 0.9 times the beam-center slope; and so on for 100%, 110% and 120%.  Again, the order of curves in the graph is the same as the legend order A steep slope tends to expand y I 222s uncertainty while a gentle slope tends to compress it.  An expanded uncertainty leads to a smaller consistency while a compressed uncertainty leads to a larger consistency.  This behavior can be observed in the family of curves in Figure 9.  Curves for the steeper slopes are on the botto m while curves for more gentle slopes are on top.  The notable feature of this set of curves is that the sensitivity to a mismatch in the monopulse slope is not very significant       100 150 200 250 10 1                    90 100 110 120  Figure 9 - Consistency versus monopulse mismatch Range-Bias Error The complex nature of the monopulse radar models presents ample opportunity to introduce errors in the software implementation.  One such e rror introduced in a \275 rangecell-width bias in the detection-primitive range which in turn resulted in a significant degradation to 2 9 k D The fact that 2 9 k D is measured in different coordinates compared to the bias made it difficult to determine which value or algorithm was to blame.  Examining the intermediate consistency values led directly to the error source A comparison between biased 2 1 k D  2 2 k D and 2 3 k D values and unbiased 2 2 k D values is shown in Figure 10.  The unbiased 2 2 k D is the bottom-most curve and the biased 2 3 k D is the top-most curve with a value around 80.  This large value for 2 3 k D indicates that there is a lot more uncertainty in the range measur ements compared to what is predicted by the range varian ce.  Since the range-variance calculation is easy to confirm, the problem must be in the algorithms that model or manipulate range A notable feature of Figure 10 is the sensitivity of the centroiding algorithm to range bias in the detection primitives.  The range bias is ba rely noticeable in the biased 2 1 k D and 2 2 k D curves.  Of course, if the unbiased 2 2 k D  curve existed as a baseline it would be relatively easy to spot the error

As previously promised, the effects and corrections for atmospheric refr action and sensor bias have been disabled so that 2 8 k D can be analyzed using a sliding window.  Of course the full analysis would include these effects and 2 8 k D at each time step would be collected and averaged over many trials Plots of the effect of changing process noise in a nearlyconstant-velocity filter are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13 for Cartesian position and velocity respectively.  In both figures, the plotted values have been divided by 3 so that the desired value is always 1.  Increasing the process noise up to a point should increase the updated uncertainty and reduce 2 8 k D values.  Except near th e end of the trajectory when the measurements are off of beam center, the curves in Figure 12 and Figure 13 appear inconclusive for this expected trend If 2 8 k D values are way out of range there are additional intermediate filter values that can be examined.

The primary challenge in both arenas comes down to properly accounting for the true target states that contribute to detections, detection primitives measurements, and state estimates For a fielded radar syst em, achieving covariance consistency is usually a s econdary consideration behind achieving and maintaining track s.  Indeed, until recently radar specifications did not even include requirements for covariance consistency.  Recent covariance consistency requirements stem from the fact that the use of radar systems in sensor netting applications is on the rise Currently the combined e ffects of off-beam-center measurements, atmospheric correction, bias correction clustering and centrioding, data association, and filtering on state covariance consistency throughout a target\222s trajectory are not well known.  This is particularly true for radars using wideband waveforms and multiple hypotheses or multiple frame trackers.  Numerical results presented here indicate that algorithms early in the radar signal processing chain can significantly degrad e covariance consistency and that some errors are better tolerated than others For a simulated target in a modeled system, truth relative to some global reference is known. However, transforming truth through different refere nce frames and accounting for changes that occur during various radar processing algorithms is not as simple as it appears.  The techniques in this paper help expose this hidden complexity and provide a framework for discussing and expanding the future development of covariance consistency techniques.  Such future developments include issues related to mapping truth through the convolution operation typically used to simulate wideband signal processing and the fast Fourier transforms typically used in pulse-Doppler processing.  Sophisticated tracking algorithms that carry multiple hypotheses, associate across multiple frames, or weight the association of multiple targets within a single frame pose significant challenges in properly associating truth with state estimates.  Additional work, including an investigation of track-to-truth assignment, is needed before covariance consistency techniques can be applied to these algorithms Another area that needs furthe r analysis is the use of a sliding window to approximate the covariance behavior expected during a set of Monte-Carlo trials.  Various timedependent variables such as the target\222s range and orientation, the transmit waveform, the radar\222s antenna patterns toward the target, missed detections, and false alarms could easily viol ate the assumption that measurement conditions are nearly stationary over the time of the window.  It is importa nt to understand the conditions when this assumption is violated Finally, the examples presented here included a relatively benign arrangement of targets.  Further analysis in dense target environments with the related increase in merged detections, merged measurements, and impure tracks is needed.  Further analysis for targets traveling over different trajectories is also needed Even so, the techniques presented here can be extended to many of these analyses R EFERENCES  1  S. Blackman and R.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
