 Knowledge and Attitude, the Two Major Barriers to ICT Adoption in LDC are the Opposite Side of a Coin; An Empirical Evidence from Bangladesh  Ahmed Imran Australian National University  ahmed.imran@anu.edu.au    Abstract   Information Communication Technology \(ICT adoption in the least developed countries \(LDC\ suffers from complex socio- cultural problems, where lack of knowledge and attitude towards ICT are  the major stumbling blocks for ICT adoption in the public sector of Bangladesh. This empirical study was carried out 
through a quantitative survey across 352 government and non-government participants to investigate interrelationship between these two factors. The result shows strong correlation amongst them, which further suggests that ICT skill, one of the components of ICT knowledge is potentially a strong driver to change the typical attitude and mindset towards ICT in the context of LDC. The findings have important implications in practice as well as research, which are expected to contribute in future direction of research and also in the effort to solve the complex puzzle of ICT adoption in developing country context Keywords: ICT, IT knowledge, attitude, mindset, LDC 
  1. Introduction  Information communication technology \(ICT\ adoption in the public sector of the least developed countries LDC\suffers from a complex and interconnected set of barriers at the international, national and organization level under unique socio-cultural environment and contex R e s e arch ers in t h is area have yet to come up with a complete explanation of the phenomenon to theorize the issue. Nevertheless the issue has attracted significant attention recently because of its huge potential impact in practice, where 
two thirds of world population live d al s o i n  research where less than 2% information systems papers published in top journals   Whatever complexity it has, understanding of this problem and in depth study has become essential, as the need for ICT adoption has reached a critical juncture and is becoming an important agenda for these countries to survive in this modern economy.  With the decreasing price of infrastructure and growing number of applications, opportunities are available to shape the direction of ICT diffusion and use in developing 
countries, which has huge potential to address many of its deep rooted problems such as efficiency transparency and productivit practice, it w a s found that such technological potential is often thwarted by managerial attitude and reluctance for adoption, who often mistakenly perceives it as a threat to their status and power along with fear of having less knowledge and grip on this. [10, 26, 45  Sa und e r s 4 1   reinforced in her editorial of MISQ special issue As IS \(Information Systems\ researchers, we should seek to understand all barriers that form the dark side of IS 
and ICTs, and actively seek solutions to these barriers  p.V  A prior qualitative study by the author using nominal group technique \(NGT elu cidated th e k e y  f a ctors for adoption of ICT in the public sector of Bangladesh 23 Lack of knowledge and attitude were identified as the most influential inhibitors for ICT adoption in the public sector which also cover a range of sub factors. All other factors are either unique \(such as socio economic condition, infrastructure\or the particular context or highly dependent \(such as 
planning and strategy, vision, leadership, citizen demand\ these two major factors. These factors appeared to be interdependent with each other in a complex socio dynamic environment, which comprises different stakeholders from various professions government and non-government\ such a clear understanding with some quantitative measures of these two factors and their sub factors were felt necessary in order to gather deeper insights of the issues. Attewell and Rule [6 o adv o cate t h at it  makes sense to do fieldwork first by saying,  "Getting 
close to the phenomenon - gathering insights or discoveries about causal links, motivations, reasons why things happened - should precede verification by more objective techniques, such as surveys p.314 Accordingly, this survey was designed to examine the knowledge base, perceptions, and practices associated with the ICT use in Bangladesh, which was also useful Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE

In this study the relationship between these two major factors, attitude and knowledge, and their components amongst different categories of stakeholders, government and non-government are examined on the dependable variable, attitude  The paper is structured as follows. The following section under the background draws some theoretical framework, prior work and the research context. The third section enumerates the development of the concepts, instruments and hypothesis. The fourth section discusses the methodology, followed by the result in section five. The last section concludes the paper   2. Background  2.1 Theoretical framework  As most IS diffusion theories have been developed and tested in the context of developed countries, there is little research in the context of LD However, a number of theories advance our understanding of the phenomenon from a broad perspective. According to Rogers us ion a n d  Innovation theory, one of the most significant elements of diffusion is knowledge about the availability and potentiality of a new technology But Rogers found that people do not evaluate an innovation always based on scientific studies of implications; rather they depend on a subjective evaluation of what has been conveyed to them through social channels and what an individual perceives as advantageous. This implies that the importance of social awareness of the innovation as a component of knowledge. In Rogers Innovation Decision Process theory, knowledge is shown as the first step for potential adopters, which means they must learn about the innovation followed by persuasion of the value of the innovation. So a knowledge based society could be instrumental in creating a positive attitude towards any innovations in ICT. Attewell [5 also developed a theoretical framework for examining the diffusion of complex technologies in organizations where knowledge and technical know how found to be important barriers to diffusion. According to Attewell firms delay adoption of complex technology until they obtain sufficient technical knowledge to implement and operate it successfully.  A number of studies have previously emphasized the need for education or knowledge deployment as a precondition of successful diffusion in developing country contexts [24, 32, 3638, 49   Scott s [43 in sti t u t io n a l th eo ry a l so  h a s a  w i d e  dimension which was found useful to advance our understanding of the use of ICT in the complex environment of developing countries. Institutional theory provides a means of handling the complexity of the interactions between people, organizations and other entities, which helps in explaining how people really make choices about an innovation. According to this theory, institutions are made up of formal constraints \(e.g., rules, laws, constitutions\nd informal constraints \(e.g., norms of behaviour conventions and self-imposed codes of conduct\which are also called institutional pressures [16 No rm ati v e  pressures come from the similar attitudes and approaches of professional groups, ongoing practices and socializations. This theory opposes the technocentric assumption about technology shaping human cognition and behaviour, rather it emphasize human development itself in order to embrace appropriate technology. Wils cept u al i z e s a n d de f i n e s ICT as a scarce and desirable resource that groups and individuals contend for in order to consume or control for their own purposes. Individuals and groups who believe they will be disadvantaged will tend initially to block and oppose its diffusion, partly through ignorance of its full effects but also through an evaluation that their personal and professional status will be compromised. So it appears, individual cognition influence users attitude toward an ICT innovation which is essential to achieve good outcome for an organization. Organizations usually vary in their members attitudes toward new technology, which can range from supportive to resistant and from proactive to reactive. As such, an organization needs to understand and develop tactics that will foster favourable attitudes among its members before adopting the innovation [20   2.2  Prior work   An in-depth qualitative study earlier identified eleven important barriers in the context of Bangladesh where knowledge was overwhelmingly found as the principal barrier followed by attitude and mindset of people and decision makers towards ICT e v e r, t h e  correlation between knowledge and attitudes has been the source of controversy in research on the public understanding of science i t h div e r s e an d  contradictory results, although most have been carried out in medical scien Ev ans an d Du ra n t 17] in  their study over British respondents, found that the internal consistency of attitudes towards science is Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


 poor, and that the links between attitudes towards science in general and attitudes towards specific areas of scientific research are weak. Allum et al reviewed the evidence on the relationship between public attitudes and public knowledge about science across 40 countries using a meta-analytic approach and found small positive correlation between general attitudes towards science and general knowledge of scientific facts and processes. This general relationship varies little across cultures but more substantially between different domains of science and technology They suggested a focus on understanding the mechanisms that underlie the association that exists between knowledge and attitudes about science Particularly in IS such empirical investigations are not prevalent. More investigations in different contexts are needed to understand and contest this debate  Previously published surveys on related areas [13, 15 22, 27, 35 o u n d little si m i l a rit y  w i t h th e t h e m e an d  context of the current study. Because of the huge digital divide and the differences in the ICT infrastructure and IS maturity between developed and least developed countries, many of the construct definitions  and items for developed countries need modification to suit the social setting in which practice occurs 19, p.40 R o s e a n d S t rau b 40] als o  opine that Future IT studies in LDCs therefore could be greatly enhanced by instruments construction which did everything possible to reduce culturally dependent biases p.45  2.3 Research context: Bangladesh  Bangladesh is an example of a typical LDC lagging in ICT adoption in its organizations. Despite some initiatives, such as the formation of an ICT Task Force with the Prime Minister as the chair person, and the formulation of The National Information and Communication Technology Policy 2002 [30 l y a  few ministries and government agencies have attained limited eGovernment capability and adopted ICT in their work processes. A study of 45 government ministries, divisions and departments by the Bangladesh Enterprise Institute \(BEI\ revealed a lack of serious resolve and drive in their implementation of ICT in Bangladesh [45     ICT is not only a technical artifact, it is closely embedded in a much wider societal contex However, in Bangladesh ICT is still seen in terms of a hardware and software industry. Its wider application within the national economy is missing  The bureaucracy in today s Bangladesh displays a number of traits of the British colonial period, which was imposed from the top in the Indian sub-continent to establish a centralized and strong executive administration based on the paternalistic traditions of Indian society. The most distinct feature of this tradition is hierarchy that structures the nature of interactions with common citizens. Cost and benefit analysis to achieve the best possible outcome is considered as a foreign tradition, where following the established norms are usually given more importance rather than achieving result Creativ it y a n d  innovation are difficult to flourish in such an environment.  A decision maker, therefore, usually does not search to find new ways of solving societal problems: neither he encourages subordinates to nurture innovative ideas A  w eak an d in adequ a te  education system, especially in Information System IS\d Information Technology \(IT\ failing to produce the required suitable workforce for the country. The institutional resources are not promoting such knowledge, where many senior echelons of the government or ministries do not have the general aptitude for developing computer based business processes ph i l o s oph i cal sh i f t i s t hus f e l t  necessary to integrate the technology with systemic social structures w h ic h  w i ll ps y c h o log i call y change the attitude towards this new innovation of ICT  3. Instrument and hypothesis development   Survey instruments and hypotheses were developed based on the themes that emerged from an  earlier study h ile th e i n s t r u men ts ta k e i n to accou n t t h e  established theoretical literature [12, 29, 46 o re emphasis is given to the local context and environment; their background, culture, language practice, status, time and relationship, based on researcher s personal experience and interaction with the community and environment under study Researcher is a native Bangladeshi with long working experience in the ICT sector of Bangladesh\wever to acquire the best scenario prevailing on the ground, a balance was sought between the prior theoretical construct and its relevancy and application to the local context, through an iterative process of review and expert opinion. Details of the constructs and instruments are appended in Appendix A    Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


 3.1 Definition of concept  IT Knowledge for this study refers to specialized knowledge possessed by individuals: how well they understand fundamental IT concepts, how well informed they are about IT in their organization 9 p.320 ccordin g to Daven port an d Pru s ak 14 there are two dimensions to tacit knowledge, one is the technical dimension \(procedural\which includes education base and IT skill and the other one is the cognitive dimension, which implies awareness and perceptions about IT. So the knowledge construct for this survey has three sub-constructs.  First, IT education, which in this case refers to their level of IT orientation and interaction along with their formal education in the past. Second, IT skill refers to the individual level of technical and practical knowledge and skill on ICT. It  is a combination of users experience with computers, the training they obtained and overall computer skills  w h ere t h e us e of computer technology depends on the technology itself and the level of skill or expertise of the individual using a s t l y a w are n e s s an d cogn iza n ce abou t  ICT  refers to a user s knowledge about the capabilities of a technology, its features, potential use and cost and benefits e ch n o logy cogn iza n ce is a  critical prerequisite for creating the knowledge related to an IT innovation.  It is more of  how well they understand fundamental IT concepts and its use in their organization [9    Another important concept is users attitude. Fishbein and Ajzen i n e  a ttitu de a s   a learned predisposition to respond in a consistently favourable or unfavourable manner with respect to a given object where according to American Heritage dictionary mindset is a fixed mental attitude or disposition that predetermines a person's responses to and interpretations of situations The typical mindset especially amongst the decision makers and government officials, who are yet to be tuned into the modern ICT environment and work process, are holding back ICT adoption in the public sectors  Based on the \(Obscured s t u d y   th i s cate g or y  includes sub categories like motivation, resistance to change, not ready to accept new ideas, fear of unknown and fear of loosing job. Some of the constructs for this study to measure individual attitude towards ICT are taken from the studies prescribed by Ahuja & Thatcher  reg a rds to Personal Innovativeness with IT  and Intent to Explore IT 3 gi ve n a t a p p e nd i x  A     3.2 Hypothesis  The following hypotheses are advanced for exploration from this study  H People with more knowledge of IT will have a more positive attitude towards IT Since this IT knowledge comprises of three components, further investigation were carried out to see which component has more effect on attitude. So the additional hypotheses are H1 People with IT education background have more positive attitude H2 People with more IT skills have more positive attitude H3 People with more IT awareness have more positive attitude  These hypotheses were tested amongst both the government and non-government \(citizen\ categories to investigate whether these two groups differ in their attitude.

Method  4.1 Questionnaire design and measurement  The questionnaire was designed based on the prior work con s u ltat i on  w i t h so m e related literatu re  2, 9, 21, 22, 28, 33, 39 T h e qu es t i onn aire w a s prepared in English as the target audiences of the survey understand basic English. The instruments selected finally had gone through internal consistency and reliability tests, which are reported in the following section. To test the hypothesis attitude towards ICT  was measured as a dependent variable consisting of 11 items.  The participants were asked whether they agree to the statements about personal innovativeness intention to explore and motivation for IT. Each item in the construct consist of a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1= strongly disagree to 5= strongly agree IT education, IT skill and IT awareness, the three components of IT knowledge construct were measured separately using 2, 16 and 5 items respectively.  As a 5-point Likert scale is used in this circumstances also Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


 but with a slightly different connotation relating with the statements ranging from 1=None to 5=high on case to case basis. Although there were additional items for each category, only those items were considered for measurements which were able to capture and explain the variable to their maximum  4.2 Pre-testing  A series of pre-tests were conducted on Bangladeshi origin ICT and non-ICT professionals and public servants working in Australia, as the research was developed in an Australian education institution. Pretesting helped to reveal unanticipated problems with question wording, instructions to skip questions etc Experts within the faculty were consulted to determine if any critical measures had been omitted from the survey instrument.  Pre test results were not included in the analysis, as the survey questions were modified based on the observations followed by several round of review and also because of the different and current contextual and geographical locations of the participants  4.3 Participants and data collection procedure  The survey was targeted towards the educated \(of various professions\ who have some understanding and influence in the decision making process in a least developed country like Bangladesh. In general, they are important stakeholders both from receiving and delivery point of view for initial adoption of ICT in the public sector of Bangladesh, because it is always the educated and upper class of society who spearhead any innovation like ICT [39   T h e va st  ma j o r i t y o f  t h e  population, who are mostly illiterate with almost nil or very minimum perception about ICT, are excluded from this survey in the belief that they would ultimately follow the trend the educated and decision makers set for them. This is mostly applicable during the initial phase of adoption of an innovation h e  survey participants represent a wide range of individuals, including government officials, politicians IT professionals, private sector officials, students and general citizens. As mentioned before the survey was primarily targeted towards government officers, which made it difficult to have more in number. However with the help of senior ex colleagues of the researcher and a few influential representatives of the government office \(who were motivated and willing to help\251 completed survey forms were collected from government servants with additional 101 completed forms from various professions of non-government categories. Overall, a total of 352 questionnaires were collected between August 2007 Jan 2008, with a response rate 44% \(=352/800\. Diversity was achieved through the participation of trainee government officers \(of various levels\ in Bangladesh Public Administration Training Centre \(BPATC Savar, Dhaka, who usually come from all over the country. Non government categories are mainly included to compare and also to reflect the overall standard of ICT readiness amongst the educated of the country  The survey questionnaire was disseminated only in the paper version because of the low accessibility to computer and cultural habit of the participants in the context.   Survey procedures were designed to assist in maximizing the response rates. Many of the survey forms were filled instantly sitting face to face and some were handed over to them to be filled in later. Some had to be pursued, but some were not returned back within the time frame of the researchers stay in the field of study  5. Result  Data were analyzed using SPSS which identified specific variables, missing value considerations and formatting needs. Frequencies and their associated percentages were calculated for both individual variables as well as for variables that were derived from combinations of other variables \(such as Knlavg Attavg\he simple summary statistics such as the differences between percentages of a particular group and reference group is used to illustrate the analysis. In order to examine correlation amongst the variables on proposed hypotheses a linear regression was carried out first on overall samples and then on split files based on gov and non-gov category  5.1 Participants demographics  Out of total 352 survey participants, 251 \(71%\ere government officials or public servants.

In a preliminary analysis, the correlation between ICT knowledge and IT attitude was measured through bi-variate correlation. The Pearsonês correlation coefficient for these two variables is 0.324 with p <0.001. This is further verified and explored with a multiple regression model taking the component of knowledge variables and other quantitative variables to see which components have more influence on knowledge than other.

Conclusion  The results of this research leave little doubt that attitude toward ICT is highly dependent on the knowledge that an individual possesses. Therefore overall it seems that effective and planned knowledge deployment can help people a nd the decision makers to adjust their cognitive perception about the system and implementation, which coul d prevent resistance to change. Institutional pressures including coercive pressures ul d al s o be e x ert ed by gove rnme nt s i n  the form of activities of knowledge deployment  But more important contribution of the paper lies in extracting the IT skill as the key element within the knowledge domain which found to be playing the most significant role in forming positive attitude towards ICT. It was interesting to note that ICT education background was found not significant in influencing the attitude as oppose to IT skill. It appears that confidence built through ICT skill and practice significantly contributes to changing individualês attitude towards ICT.  The findings provide some important implications both for research and practice IT skill is instrumental in improving attitude towards ICT, which supports Attewellês [5 d in g s an d  strategy to lower the knowledge barrier on end user According to Attewell, supply side institutions can play an important role to innov ate not only in their own Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


 design of products, but especially in the development of novel institutional mechanisms for reducing this learning burden upon end users. In practice, it is hoped the result will lead to improvement of devices to address attitude problems and will be important in formulating the future strategies in this area The study also shows that attitude and knowledge varies across gov and non-gov categories, where nongov categories are found to be more knowledgeable than their government cou nterparts. Awareness about the innovation is also found to be influential in forming attitude amongst the gov officials   The study is expected to have some contribution in our quest for investigating this complex and new area Future research could provide furt her insight on type of skill which contributes more than others to change attitude on different groups  This study has some limitations. The context of the study is relatively new in Information Systems discipline, and thus the instruments used are not well established. The terms used in the survey might have slightly different interpretations in that context Although the potential differe nces were minimized by several rounds of review process and pre-testing different interpretations of some of the terms still might exist, which may fail to capture the inherent meaning. Moreover the vary ing interpretations on level of skill on five point Likert scale may not capture the accurate level of their èI T skillê homogenously Additional objective measure ment was not undertaken which could compare or validate the results. Finally the study did not include vari ables like socio-economic condition, culture, politics and some more variables which were assumed to be similar in context.  Future studies are planned to include and test some of these variables and their effects  References    A d a m M. a n d C U r q uha rt IT Ca pa c ity Buil di ng  in Developing Countries: A Model of Maldivian Tourism Sector.

Discussion and conclusion  6.1. Discussion of findings  The secondary data analyses in this study were able to demonstrate the cause-effect relationship between the institutional environment and e-commerce adoption.  Specifically speaking, the legal and policy environment did exert a substantial positive impact on e-commerce adoption around the world at the early stage of e-commerce \(the worldwide average score of e-commerce was only 5.51 out of 10 in the EIU 2003 sample government financial support of e-commerce and related infrastructure projects, effectiveness of legal framework, and laws covering e-commerce, together they fostered consumers and businesses in many countries to engage in e-commerce in 2003.  This finding proved the institutional perspective about the critical role of government policy and legal environment in driving e-commerce adoption Four years later, in 2007, the global average score of e-commerce improved from 5.51 to 6.37, at a rate of 16%.  As e-commerce became more prevalent in the world, supportive government policy still provided a powerful explanation for variations in e-commerce adoption around the world.  On the other hand, the impact of legal environment was reduced.  A possible explanation from the perspective of institutionalism is that a predictive and effective legal environment was important to reduce the institutional uncertainty and ensure the trust and confidence in e-commerce activities, especially during the initial stage of ecommerce development.  A good legal system is a safeguard for online commercial transactions Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal 


Nevertheless, the encouraging influence of legal environment would be diminished as people understand e-commerce better and e-commerce becomes a common practice in the society  6.2. Policy implication  An effective research project is not only used to explain and predict social phenomena, but also to help humans master them to achieve social objectives through yielding useful policy recommendations [60 All sound policy prescriptions should rely on a solid theory base, valid data analysis, and rational discussion.  In reality, however, policymakers generally lack adequate scientific evidence and knowledge for making crucial decisions on ecommerce development.  The application of institutional theory in e-commerce adoption and its empirical findings in this study have a clear relevance to policy makers.  If we understand better at the theoretical level how those institutional factors would produce an outcome of e-commerce adoption, we then have the basis for a conditional prediction in the real world on how e-commerce will develop in a certain environment.  It will help policy makers to formulate appropriate policies to accelerate e-commerce adoption Experience has taught us that it is important to build a friendly climate for technology innovation and diffusion.  The effects of the legal and policy environments will depend to a significant extent on how policy-makers and other stakeholders will act and influence.  According to this study, this is particularly vital at the starting stage of e-commerce.  The advancement in e-commerce adoption at Phase I 2003 environment and government policy.  In particular proactive government policies were the prime mover of e-commerce in many developing countries, and it is still a driving force of e-commerce diffusion today The fosterage of government policy is summarized as follows.  First, government policies that encourage investment in IT adoption, particularly the financial incentives, are stimulating to e-commerce development.  Second, government efforts to promote an open and free trade environment, including deregulating telecom markets, improving IT infrastructure, and conducting e-procurement itself will encourage e-commerce adoption and diffusion Third, government?s assurance on recognizing econtracts and providing legitimate legal frameworks will facilitate e-commerce activities.  Fourth government?s educational and training program will foster ?e-literacy? and greater awareness of ecommerce among businesses.  Last, cooperation between government and private sector is a key to ecommerce On the other hand, this study also shows that the lack of adequate legal framework might be a concern for engaging in e-commerce at first, but that the lack thereof would not deter the society from further ecommerce diffusion. Thus, after an initial push on ecommerce adoption, legislations should not interfere directly in private investments in e-commerce until there is a clear sign of market uncertainty and disturbance Finally, as Kofi Annan, the former SecretaryGeneral of UN, indicated, ?if all countries are to be benefited [from e-commerce], ? more needs to be Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 done to ? create an enabling environment, nationally

reliability analysis requires the capability to simultaneously process multiple failure behaviors with very different qualitative and quantitative properties. The term qualitative refers to the fault types, such as benign, symmetric asymmetric, or the transmissive and omissive Unfortunately, traditional reliability analysis cannot handle the above requirements. To achieve the flexibilities and capabilities to simultaneously quantify several types of failure behaviors required by hybrid fault models, and still to be capable of incorporating complex time-dependent failure rate represented with survival analysis models, Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a game theory model to integrate dynamic hybrid fault models and reliability models \(represented with survival functions  Box 4.1 and 4.2 briefly describe the concepts involved in two aspects of dynamic hybrid fault \(DHF Detailed contents are referred to Ma &amp; Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a 11

Specifically, time and covariate dependent survivor functions or hazard functions are utilized. In the following, I use the oral message version of the Byzantine general problem Lamport 1982 extension. The constraint of Byzantine general problem under oral message assumption \(Table 1 be replaced with the following model in the dynamic version 1 3 tmtN Further assuming that the survivor function of generals is S\(t|z    ztStNtN    ztStmtm m where N\(t t treacherous generals \(traitors S\(t|z t|z survivor functions for the total number of generals and 


survivor functions for the total number of generals and traitors, respectively.  z is the vector of covariates, and the conditional survivor functions can adopt parametric or semi-parametric covariate models such as Cox models. Obviously, the hybrid models now are not only time-dependent, but also covariate dependent.  The covariates can be any factors that affect the failures of generals. The above scheme conveniently transforms traditional hybrid fault models and their corresponding mathematical constraints for reaching agreement, into time and covariate dependent  The above models use Byzantine general problem with oral messages as an example, and the other constraints to reach agreement in hybrid fault models can be extended in the same manner.  In addition, the above models adopted discrete form, or difference equations Continuous model or differential equation can be adopted. Models similar to population dynamics can be utilized \(Ma and Bechinski 2008 field that studies the change of population numbers from generation to generation. The concept of population usually refers to animal, plant or human population Hallam &amp; Levin. 1986, Kingsland 1995, Kot 2001 Lande &amp; Engen, 2003 mathematical models such as expressed with survival analysis, populations of animals, Byzantine generals, or wireless sensor nodes, are essentially the same Therefore, the models in population dynamics theory can be used to replace above models to represent more complex systems. The population dynamics approach is particular convenient for the utilization of evolutionary game modeling, which is necessary for addressing the second aspect of the dynamic hybrid fault models Box 4.2. Reliability Aspect of Dynamic Hybrid Fault Models: Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games The solution to the first aspect \(Box 4.1 not sufficient to apply the DHF models to reliability or survivability analysis.  Ma and Krings \(2008e, Ma 2008a introduced evolutionary game theory \(EGT the second aspect of the problem  reliability aspect of dynamic hybrid fault models. With the Byzantine general problem as an example and they term the approach Byzantine Generals Playing Evolutionary Games  Basic Concepts in EGT  In EGT, game players are population individuals, game payoffs are the fitness of individuals, and strategies are evolved dynamically.  Similar to the Nash equilibrium in traditional game theory evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS both internal mutation and external perturbation.  The ESS can be mapped to the sustainable or survivable strategies. When mapping to the Byzantine general problem, players are the generals, and fitness or payoff of a game is mapped to reliability \(survivability sub-population of players, which can be represented with the hazard function or survival function introduced in the previous section.  The sub-populations can refer to groups of generals \(such as loyal general group or treacherous general group behaviors of generals, such as malicious vs. benign symmetric vs. asymmetric  Basic Mathematical Models for EGT  In literature mathematical models for evolutionary games can be as simple as simple algebraic equations or as complex as differential equation systems. For example, the so termed replicator dynamics model is actually the adaptation of population dynamics modeling for describing evolutionary games. Replicator dynamics describes evolution of the frequencies of strategies in a population. In evolutionary 


game theory, replicator dynamics is described with differential equations. For example, if a population consists of n types nEEE ,...,, 21 with frequencies 21 nxxx . The fitness xfi of iE will be a function of the population structure, or the vector 21 nxxxx Following the basic tenet of Darwinism, one may define the success as the difference between the fitness xfi of iE  and the average fitness   xfxxf ii of the population. The simplest replicator model can be defined as   xfxfxdtdx iii for .,...,2,1 ni =  The population nStx ?   where nS is a simplex, which is the space for population composition, is similar to mixed strategies in traditional games \(Hofbauer amp; Sigmund 1998, Vincent &amp; Brown 2005, Nowak 2006  12                                                  Box 4.3 included some additional comments on DHF models.

Finally, the dynamic hybrid fault models, when utilized to describe the survival of players in EGT, enhance the EGT's flexibility and power in modeling the survival and behaviors of the game players which should also be applicable to other problem domains where EGT is applicable  5. OPERATIONAL LEVEL MODELING AND DECISION-MAKING  5.1. Highlights of the Tactical and Strategic Levels  Let's first summarize what are obtainable at both tactical and strategic levels. The results at both tactical and strategic levels are precisely obtainable either via analytic or simulation optimization. With the term precisely, we mean that there is no need to assign subjective probabilities to UUUR events. This is possible because we try to assess the consequences of UUUR events \(tactical level ESS strategies \(strategic level time prediction of survivability. The following is a list of specific points. I use an assumed Wireless Sensor Network WSN  i of UUUR events: \(a actions which can be treated as censored events; \(b Cont' of Box 4.2 It can be shown that the replicator differential equations are equivalent to the classical population dynamics models such as Logistic differential equation and LotkaVolterra equation \(e.g., Kot 2001 Logistic equation, or the limited per capital growth rate is similar to the change rate of the fitness  xfxfi which can be represented with the hazard function or survivor functions introduced in the previous section on survival analysis.  This essentially connects the previous survival analysis modeling for lifetime and reliability with the EGT modeling. However, EGT provides additional modeling power beyond population dynamics or survival analysis approaches introduced in the previous section. The introduction of evolutionary theory makes the games played by a population evolvable. In other words, each player \(individual 


other words, each player \(individual agent and players interact with each other to evolve an optimized system Box 4.3. Additional Comments on DHF Models  The above introduced EGT models are very general given they are the system of ordinary differential equations. Furthermore, the choice of fitness function f\(x complexity to the differential equation system.  The system can easily be turned into system of nonlinear differential equations. The analytical solution to the models may be unobtainable when nonlinear differential equations are involved and simulation and/or numerical computation are often required  In the EGT modeling, Byzantine generals are the game players, and hybrid fault models are conveniently expressed as the strategies of players; the players may have different failure or communication behaviors Furthermore, players can be further divided into groups or subpopulations to formulate more complex network organizations. In the EGT modeling, reliability can be represented as the payoff \(fitness, the native term in EGT of the game. Because reliability function can be replaced by survivor function, survival analysis is seamlessly integrated into the EGT modeling. That is, let Byzantine generals play evolutionary games and their fitness reliability function  The evolutionary stable strategy \(ESS counterpart of Nash equilibrium in traditional games ESS corresponds to sustainable strategies, which are resistant to both internal mutations \(such as turning into treason generals or nodes such as security compromises represent survivable strategies and survivability in survivability analysis. Therefore, dynamic hybrid fault models, after the extension with EGT modeling, can be used to study both reliability and survivability 13 risks such as competing risks which can be described with CRA; \(c captured with the shard frailty.  We believe that these UUUR events are sufficiently general to capture the major factors/events in reliability, security and survivability whose occurrence probabilities are hard or impossible to obtain  Instead of trying to obtain the probabilities for these events which are infeasible in most occasions, we focus on analyzing the consequences of the events.  With survival analysis, it is possible to analyze the effects of these types of events on survivor functions. In addition, spatial frailty modeling can be utilized to capture the heterogeneity of risks in space, or the spatial distribution of risks \(Ma 2008a d UUUR events introduced previously. These approaches and models that deal with the effects of UUUR events form the core of tactical level modeling  To take advantage of the tactical level modeling approaches it is obviously necessary to stick to the survivor functions or hazard functions models. In other words, survival analysis can deal with UUUR events and offer every features reliability function provides, but reliability function cannot deal with UUUR events although survivor function and reliability function have the exactly same mathematical definition. This is the junction that survival analysis plays critical role in survivability analysis at tactical level. However, we 


recognize that it is infeasible to get a simple metric for survivability similar to reliability with tactical level modeling alone. Actually, up to this point, we are still vague for the measurement of survivability or a metric for survivability. We have not answered the question: what is our metric for survivability? We think that a precise or rigorous definition of survivability at tactical level is not feasible, due to the same reason we cited previously  the inability to determine the probabilities of UUUR events However, we consider it is very helpful to define a work definition for survivability at the tactical level  We therefore define the survivability at tactical level as a metric, Su\(t t function or reliability function with UUUR events considered. In the framework of three-layer survivability analysis, this metric is what we mean with the term survivability. The "metric" per se is not the focus of the three-layer survivability analysis. It is not very informative without the supports from the next two levels  strategic and operational models.  However, it is obvious that this metric sets a foundation to incorporate UUUR effects in the modeling at the next two levels  Due to the inadequacy of tactical level modeling, we proposed the next level approach  strategic level modeling for survivability. As expected, the tactical level is one foundation of strategic level modeling ii objectives: \(a affect survivability which survival analysis alone is not adequate to deal with; \(b survivability at tactical level is necessary but not sufficient for modeling survivability, we need to define what is meant with the term survivability at strategic level  With regard to \(a behaviors or modes which have very different consequences. These failure behaviors can be captured with hybrid fault models. However, the existing hybrid fault models in fault tolerance field are not adequate for applying to survivability analysis. There are two issues involved: one is the lack of real time notion in the constraints for hybrid fault models \(e.g., N&gt;3m+1 for Byzantine Generals problem synthesize the models after the real-time notions are introduced. The solution we proposed for the first issue is the dynamic hybrid fault models, which integrate survivor functions with traditional hybrid fault models. The solution we proposed for the second issue is the introduction of EGT modeling  With regard to \(b modeling our problem at strategic level, EGT modeling is essentially a powerful optimization algorithm.  One of the most important results from EGT modeling is the so-called evolutionary stable strategies \(ESS We map the ESS in EGT to survivable strategies in survivability analysis.   Therefore, at the strategic level, our work definition for survivability refers to the survivable strategies or sustainable strategies in the native term of EGT, which can be quantified with ESS  In addition to integrating dynamic hybrid fault models another advantage for introducing EGT modeling at strategic level is the flexibility for incorporating other node behaviors \(such as cooperative vs. non-cooperative those behaviors specified in standard hybrid fault models, as well as anthropocentric factors such as costs constraints  Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level 


Without UUUR events, both tactical and strategic level models default to regular reliability models. This implies that, in the absence of UUUR events, reliable strategies are sustainable or survivable.  This also implies that three-layer survivability analysis defaults to reliability analysis however, the three-layer approach does offer some significant advantages over traditional reliability analysis, as discussed in previous sections. Nevertheless, when UUUR events exist, reliable strategies and survivable strategies are different. This necessitates the next operational level modeling  5.2. Operational Level Modeling and Decision-Making  When UUUR events are involved, we cannot make real time predictions of survivability at tactical and strategic levels This implies that the implementations of survivable 14 strategies need additional measures that we develop in this section.  Box 5.1 explains the ideas involved with possibly the simplest example  Figure 4 is a diagram showing a simplified relationship between action threshold survivability \(TS survivability \(ES view since both TS and ES are multidimensional and dynamic in practice. Therefore, the sole purpose of the diagram is to illustrate the major concepts discussed above The blue curve is the survivability when survivable strategies specified by ESS are implemented at some point before time s.  The system is then guaranteed to hold survivability above ES. In contrary, if no ESS implemented before time s, then the system quickly falls below to the survivable level at around 40 time units  T i m e 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 0 1 0 0 Su rv iv ab ili ty M et ric S u t 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 E S S  i s  I m p lm e n t e d N o  E S S  is  I m p lm e n t e d ts E S T S  Figure 4.

The previous sections discussed the major building blocks for the new life-system inspired PHM architecture. This section first identifies a few minor aspects that have not been discussed explicitly but are necessary for the implementation of the architecture, and then we summarize the major building blocks in a diagram  6.1. Missing Components and Links  Optimization Objectives  Lifetime, reliability, fault tolerance, and survivability, especially the latter two, are application dependent. Generally, the optimization of reliability and survivability are consistent; in that maximization of reliability also implies maximization of survivability. However, when application detail is considered, optimization of lifetime is not necessarily consistent with the optimization of reliability. Consider the case of the monitoring sensor network as an example. The network reliability is also dependent on connectivity coverage, etc, besides network lifetime. What may be further complicated is the time factor. All of the network metrics are time-dependent. A paradoxical situation between lifetime and reliability could be that nodes never 'sleep                                                   


          Box 5.1 Operational Level Modeling  Assuming that the ESS solution for a monitoring sensor network can be expressed with the following simple algebraic conditions: survivability metric at tactical level SU = 0.7, Router-Nodes in the WSN &gt; 10%, Selfish Nodes &lt; 40%. Even with this extremely simplified scenario, the ESS strategies cannot be implemented because we do not know when the actions should be taken to warrant a sustainable system.  These conditions lack a correlation with real time  The inability to implement ESS is rooted in our inability to assign definite probabilities to UUUR events, which implies that we cannot predict when something sufficiently bad will jeopardize the system survivability What we need at the operational level is a scheme to ensure ESS strategy is in place in advance  The fundamental idea we use to implement the ESS strategy is to hedge against the UUUR events. The similar idea has been used in financial engineering and also in integrated pest management in entomology. This can be implemented with the following scheme  Let us define a pair of survivability metrics: one is the expected survivability \(ES threshold survivability or simply threshold survivability \(TS ES is equivalent to the survivability metric at tactical level. ES corresponds to ESS at strategic level, but they are not equivalent since ESS is strategy and ES is survivability. TS is the survivability metric value \(at tactical level and TS can be obtained from strategic level models. For example, TS = SU\(s t condition for the implementation of ESS. In other words, the implementation of strategies that ensures TS at time s will guarantee the future ES level at time t.  To make the implementation more reliable and convenient multiple dynamic TSs can be computed at time s1, s2 sk, with si &lt; t for all i.  These TS at times s1, s2, ..., sk should be monitored by some evaluation systems  Unlike tactical and strategic levels, the operational level modeling is approximate. The term "approximate means that we cannot predict the real time survivability or we do not know the exact time an action should be taken. Instead, the action is triggered when the monitored survivability metric SU\(r survivability \(TS scheme of TS and ES, we ensure the ES by taking preventative actions \(prescribed by ESS and triggered by the TS consequences of UUUR events  Figure 4 is a diagram showing the above concepts and the decision-making process involved 15 This wakefulness \(never 'sleep short period but at the expense of network lifetime. Of course, when the network is running out of lifetime, network reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that 


reliability ultimately crashes. This example reminds us that multi-objective optimization should be the norm rather than exception  Constraints and Extensions  Many application specific factors and constraints are ignored in this article. For example, we mentioned about spatial heterogeneity of environment, but never present a mathematical description The spatial heterogeneity can be modeled with the so-called spatial frailty in multivariate survival analysis \(Ma 2008a  Evolutionary Algorithm  Evolutionary game modeling when implemented in simulation, can be conveniently implemented with an algorithm similar to Genetic Algorithms \(GA ESS in the evolutionary game model with simulation is very similar to GA. Dynamic populations, in which population size varies from generation to generation \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008f of node failures. Another issue to be addressed is the synchronous vs. asynchronous updating when topology is considered in the simulation. This update scheme can have profound influences on the results of the simulation. Results from cellular automata computing should be very useful for getting insights on the update issue  6.2. Summary and Perspective  To recapture the major points of the article, let us revisit Figure 3, which summarizes the principal modules of the proposed life-system inspired PHM architecture. The main inspiration from life systems is the notion of individuals and their assemblage, the population. Population is an emergent entity at the next level and it has emergent properties which we are often more concerned with. Survival analysis, which has become a de facto standard in biomedicine, is particularly suitable for modeling population, although it is equally appropriate at individual level. Therefore, survival analysis \(including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis comprehensively in the context of PHM in a series of four papers presented at IEEE AeroSpace 2008 \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008a, b, c, &amp; d proposed architecture. Survival analysis constitutes the major mathematical tools for analyzing lifetime and reliability, and also forms the tactical level of the three-layer survivability analysis  Besides lifetime and reliability, two other major modules in Figure 3 are fault tolerance and survivability. To integrate fault tolerance into the PHM system, Dynamic Hybrid Fault DHF 2008e, Ma 2008a make real-time prediction of reliability more realistic and make real-time prediction of fault tolerance level possible DHF models also unite lifetime, reliability and fault tolerance under a unified modeling framework that consists of survival analysis and evolutionary game theory modeling  DHG models also form the partial foundation, or strategic level, for the three-layer survivability analysis. At the strategic level, the Evolutionary Stable Strategies \(ESS which is mapped to survivable or sustainable strategies, can be obtained from the evolutionary game theory based DHF models. When there is not any UUUR event involved reliability and survivability are consistent, and reliable strategies are survivable. In this case, the strategic level modeling up to this point is sufficient for the whole PHM system modeling, and there is no need for the next level  operational level modeling  When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the 


When there are UUUR events in a PHM system, the inability to determine the occurrence probabilities of UUUR events makes the operational level modeling necessary Then the principle of hedging must be utilized to deal with the "hanging" uncertainty from UUUR events. In this case reliability strategies are not necessarily survivable strategies At the operational level modeling, a duo of survivability metrics, expected survivability \(ES survivability \(TS the survivable strategies \(ESS level are promptly implemented based on the decisionmaking rules specified with the duo of survivability metrics then the PHM system should be able to endure the consequences of potentially catastrophic UUUR events. Of course, to endure such catastrophic events, the cost may be prohibitively high, but the PHM system will, at least, warn decision-makers for the potentially huge costs.  It might be cheap to just let it fail  Figure 3 also shows several other modules, such as security safety, application systems \(such as Automatic Logistics CBM+, RCM, Life cycle cost management, Real-time warning and alert systems architectures, but we do not discuss in this paper. Generally the new architecture should be fully compatible with existing ones in incorporating these additional modules. One point we stressed is that PHM system can be an ideal place to enforce security policies. Enforcing security policies can be mandatory for PHM systems that demand high security and safety such as weapon systems or nuclear plant facilities.  This is because maintenance, even without human-initiated security breaches, can break the security policies if the maintenance is not planned and performed properly  In perspective, although I did not discuss software issues in this paper, the introduced approaches and models should provide sufficient tools for modeling software reliability and survivability with some additional extension. Given the critical importance of software to modern PHM systems, we present the following discussion on the potential extension to software domain. Specifically, two points should be noted: \(1 architecture to software should be a metric which can 16 replace the time notion in software reliability; I suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(e.g., Li and Vitanyi 1997 be a promising candidate \(Ma 2008a change is because software does not wear and calendar time for software reliability usually does not make much sense 2 software reliability modeling.  Extending to general survivability analysis is not a problem either. In this article I implicitly assume that reliability and survivability are positively correlated, or reliability is the foundation of survivability. This positive correlation does not have to be the case. A simplified example that illustrates this point is the 'limit order' in online stock trading, in which limit order can be used in either direction: that stock price is rising or falling.  The solution to allow negative or uncorrelated relationships between reliability and survivability are very straightforward, and the solutions are already identified in previous discussions. Specifically, multiple G-functions and multi-stage G-functions by Vincent and Brown \(2005 very feasible solution, because lifetime, reliability and survivability may simply be represented with multiple Gfunctions. Another potential solution is the accommodation of the potential conflicts between reliability and survivability with multi-objective GA algorithms, which I previously suggested to be used as updating algorithms in the optimization of evolutionary games  


 The integration of dynamic hybrid fault models with evolutionary game modeling allows one to incorporate more realistic and detailed failure \(or survival individual players in an evolutionary game. This is because dynamic hybrid fault models are supported by survival analysis modeling, e.g., time and covariate dependent hazard or survivor functions for individual players. If necessary, more complex survival analysis modeling including competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis, can be introduced.  Therefore, any field to which evolutionary game theory is applicable may benefit from the increased flexibility in modeling individual players.  Two particularly interesting fields are system biology and ecological modeling.  In the former field, dynamic hybrid fault models may find important applications in the study of biological networks \(such as gene, molecular, and cell networks 2008g conjecture that explains the redundancy in the universal genetic code with Byzantine general algorithm. In addition they conducted a comparative analysis of bio-robustness with engineering fault tolerance, for example, the strong similarity between network survivability and ecological stability \(Ma &amp; Krings 2008g survivability analysis can be applied for the study of survivals or extinctions of biological species under global climate changes \(Ma 2008b  In this paper, I have to ignore much of the details related to the implementation issues to present the overall architecture and major approaches clearly and concisely. To deal with the potential devils in the implementation details, a well funded research and development team is necessary to take advantages of the ideas presented here. On the positive side I do see the great potential to build an enterprise PHM software product if there is sufficient resource to complete the implementation. Given the enormous complexity associated with the PHM practice in modern engineering fields, it is nearly impossible to realize or even demonstrate the benefits of the architecture without the software implementation. The critical importance of PHM to mission critical engineering fields such as aerospace engineering, in turn, dictates the great value of such kind software product  6.3. Beyond PHM  Finally, I would like to raise two questions that may be interested in by researchers and engineers beyond PHM community. The first question is: what can PHM offer to other engineering disciplines? The second question is: what kinds of engineering fields benefit most from PHM? Here, I use the term PHM with the definition proposed by IEEE which is quoted in the introduction section of the paper  As to the first question, I suggest software engineering and survivability analysis are two fields where PHM can play significant roles. With software engineering, I refer to applying PHM principles and approaches for dealing with software reliability, quality assurance, and even software process management, rather than building PHM software mentioned in the previous subsection. For survivability analysis, borrowing the procedures and practices of PHM should be particularly helpful for expanding its role beyond its originating domain \(network systems that control critical national infrastructures is a strong advocate for the expansion of survivability analysis to PHM. Therefore, the interaction between PHM and survivability analysis should be bidirectional. Indeed, I see the close relationships between PHM, software engineering, and survivability as well-justified because they all share some critical issues including reliability survivability, security, and dependability  


 The answer to the second question is much more elusive and I cannot present a full answer without comparative analysis of several engineering fields where PHM has been actively practiced. Of course, it is obvious that fields which demand mission critical reliability and dependability also demand better PHM solutions. One additional observation I would like to make is that PHM seems to play more crucial roles for engineering practices that depend on the systematic records of 'historical' data, such as reliability data in airplane engine manufacturing, rather than on the information from ad hoc events.  This may explain the critical importance of PHM in aerospace engineering particularly in commercial airplane design and manufacturing.  For example, comparing the tasks to design and build a space shuttle vs. to design and manufacture commercial jumbo jets, PHM should be more critical in the latter task  17    Figure 2.
