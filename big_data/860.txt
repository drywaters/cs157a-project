With active C.G. control system, aircraft may deviate from its known dynamics due to the C.G. offset, thus bringing new problems to the existing flight control system. A new design 
approach of the attitude control system of aircraft with C.G variations is proposed in this paper First of all, a 6-DoF flight dynamics model of aircraft with C.G. variations is built. Taking the effects of the C.G. shift into consideration, equations of motion expressed in the body-fixed reference frame are derived using the Newton\222s second law. The resulting model can accurately reflect the effects of C.G. offset Based on the above model, an attitude controller is designed to provide consistent performance under varying C.G locations. This controller consists of four modules, expected attitude characteristic module inverse dynamics module actuator allocation module and in-flight C.G. identification module  1 2 
 In the expected attitude characteristic module, a secondorder linear characteristic equation of dynamics of those Euler angles is expected b ecause it is the moment that dominates the aircraft\222s rotation and directly determines the second-order derivatives of the Euler angles. In the inverse dynamics module, both the dynamical equations of rotation and in-flight estimation of C.G. position are used to derive the moment command from Euler angular acceleration command. In the actuator allocation module, the deflection commands of the actuators are determined according to the identified control derivatives to achieve the required moments. In the last module, the estimation of C.G. location can be obtained by adaptive weighted data fusion based on optimal weight distribution principle 
Simulations are carried out under various possible conditions of C.G. offset to validate the proposed design method. The results demonstrate good control performance and effectiveness of this approach  1  1 978-1-4244-2622-5/09 25.00 \2512009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1118, Versi on 6, Updated Dec.15, 2008 T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION  1  2  M ODELLING OF

Due to the interaction 
of the C.G. and the aerodynamic center, the aircraft may deviate from its known dynamics, thus bringing new problems to the existing flight control system. The conventional gain-scheduli ng method requires huge design workload, and the development process can be expensive and often results in aircraft specific implementations [6 Hence new design approaches of the flight control system of aircraft with C.G. variations are strongly demanded Over the past several years, inverse dynami  8 has been widely used in flight control.

Figure 7 shows the actuator deflection obtaine d from the proposed method  Figure 6 \226Attitude response with a C.G. shift forward in the pitch axis  C.G. shift aft in the pitch axis Similarly, at the third second, the C.G. is shifted aft from the reference location O, and the displacements are assumed as 0.5 x m 002=\002 The command values are set as above Figure 8 shows the attitude response obtained from the inverse dynamics without i n-flight C.G. compensation approach and the proposed method. Figure 9 shows the actuator deflection As can be seen in Figure 6 and Figure 8, with a C.G. offset from the reference location, control performance of the approach without in-flight C.G. compensation is not satisfied, and the cross coupling in three axes is enhanced due to the C.G. offset  Figure 7 \226The actuator deflection  Figure 8 \226Attitude Response with a C.G. shift aft in the pitch axis  Figure 9 \226The actuator deflection 002=\212  0 yz 002  0 yz 


 10 However, the method proposed in this paper is able to improve the tracking performance. In roll, yaw and pitch axes, the attitude commands of aircraft have rapid and precise responses. Besides, usi ng in-flight C.G. estimation the approach can be seen to quickly adapt to the changing dynamics of the aircraft, a nd the coupling influence among three axes is effectively restrained In conclusion, the proposed de sign method in this paper could provide consistent pe rformance under varying C.G locations. Furthermore, compared with the conventional gain-scheduling method which requires huge design workload, this approach would effectively reduce the design complexity and make the design process clear and easy to implement 5  C ONCLUSION  This paper focuses on mode ling and attitude control of aircraft with C.G. variations First, a 6-DoF flight dynamics model of aircraft with C.G. vari ations is derived in order to account for the effect of the C.G. offset. After that, a synthesis approach based on i n-flight estimation of C.G position and inverse dynami cs is proposed to provide consistent performance under va rying C.G. locations. The simulation results demons trate good control performance and effectiveness of this approach A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This research work is supported by the China Aviation Science Fund program \221Integrate d Vehicle Management System Concept and Architecture Research for Advanced Aircraft\222 \(No.20060718001 R EFERENCES  1] AGARD, \223Integrated Vehi cle Management Systems,\224 North Atlantic Treaty Organization REPORT 343, 1996  Watson M  D. and Johnson S.B 223A Theory of Vehicle Management Systems,\224 2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings, March 3-10, 2007   A.Hay r e and T.Dull, \223The ATF YF-23 Vehicle Management System,\224 Ae rospace Design Conference Irvine, CA, 1992  B.Hill and R.W a tts, \223Suit Study\227The Im pact of VMS in Subsystem Integration,\224 Ae rospace Design Conference Irvine, CA, 1992  Huber B  223C enter of Gravity C ontrol on Airbus Aircraft Fuel, Range and Loading,\224 The 47th Annual Conference  of the Society of Allied Weight Engineers, Plymouth Michigan, May 23-25, 1988   Nhan Nguy en etc, \223Dy n am ics and Adaptive C ontrol for Stability Recovery of Damage d Asymmetric Aircraft,\224 AIAA Guidance, Navigation a nd Control Conference and Exhibit, Keystone, Colorado, 2006   Ostroff A J and B acon B J, \223Force and M o m e nt Approach for Achievable Dynamics Using Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion,\224 AIAA Guidance Navigation and Control Conference and Exhibit, Portland, OR, 1999  Liu Jiarun and Shen Gongz hang, \223Attitude Control Based on Inverse Dynamics and Online Parameter Identification,\224 Journal of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics 31\(2  Wu Sentang and Fei Yuhua Flight Control System Beijing: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics Press, 2005  R obert C  Nelson and Gu Junxiao\(translator Stability and Automatic C ontrol, Beijing: National Defense Industry Press, 2008   B a rton J.B acon and Irene M  Gregory 223General Equations of Motion for a Damaged Asymmetric Aircraft,\224 AIAA Atmosphe ric Flight Mechanics Conference and Exhibit, Hilton Head, Carolina, 2007  o she Idan, Gil Iosilevskii and Sergey Nazarov 223InFlight Weight and Balance Identification Using Neural Networks,\224 AIAA Guidance Navigation and Control Conference and Exhibit, Austin, Texas, 2003  Li Yuany u an and Zhang Lifeng, \223Application of Adaptive Weighted Fusion Algorithm of Multi-sensor Data,\224 Automation & Instrumentation 2, 10-13, 2008  Aircraft Design M a nual Beijing: Aviation Industry Press, 2005  M a them atics M a nual, B e iji ng: Higher Education Press 2002 B IOGRAPHY  Jing Zhang is a PhD student in the Department of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
