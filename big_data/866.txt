Prime contractors for these weapon systems propose design concepts at the preliminar y and critical design reviews which eventually form the cultural foundation for all future operations and maintenance.  Finally, these concepts are flowed-down into the design documents, subsystem specifications, and the operational flight program software The level of diagnostics information recorded is dramatically different amongst the various aircraft along with their presentation format Furthermore, some aircraft programs never procured ground stations to process their diagnostics data since they elected not to include it in their maintenance concept.  This inconsistent application of 
integrated diagnostics across aircraft weapon systems generates unique software and hardware processing systems 1  1 223U.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright.\224  For U.S Government employees only 2 IEEEAC paper#1056 Version 3, Updated 2008:10:28 to view the diagnostics information.  Therefore, application of systems engineering processe s is necessary to identify the requirements to provide the data needed for fleet operations maintenance, engineering, logistics, and manufacturing The concept of an Automated Maintenance Environment AME\s continuous integration and automation of operational, maintenance, and logistical processes and technical data to improve aircraft readiness and reduce sustainment costs for the wa r fighter community.  AME involves an integrated product serving the needs of Organizational level \(O-level Intermediate Level \(I-level and Depot level \(D-level\aintainers.  It also supports engineering and logistics efforts for fleet support teams program offices, and original equipment manufacturers One innovative approach to implementation of an AME is the Comprehensive Automated Maintenance Environment Optimized \(CAMEO\.  CAMEO is an open source development effort, led by the V-22 program but involving collaboration with several other programs including E-2D VH-71, and H-1.  One of the great advantages of an open source product is that existi ng capabilities are easily adapted to another program\222s needs without having to repeat all the development activities or pay to license capabilities originally funded by the govern 
ment.  In addition, any new features developed by any of the collaborating platforms can be easily integrated into AME for all other platforms, if it is of benefit, thus greatly leveraging development efforts for all.

  2 2  U SER R EQUIREMENTS  Typically, BIT and AME are thought of as functions supporting maintenance of the airc raft.  In reality, there are several users of BIT and AME data besides maintainers and aircrew.  For example, engineering requires detailed information to perform root cause analysis of failure modes Manufacturing uses the same information to assemble troubleshoot, and sell-off high quality aircraft Understanding the needs of the various users and how the information will be employed by them forms the basis of the AME concept so requirements can be properly defined during the program's concept refinement phase of acquistion  Fleet Operations At the squadron level, diagnostics and AME need to provide the capability to conduc t missions safely, identify non-mission capable systems, record data for post-flight debrief, and finally support mishap investigations.  Also they must align with the naval aviation maintenance program promulgated by Commander Naval Air Forces Instruction \(COMNAVAIRFORINST\Finally, the equipment must be deployable for short term detachments and long term deployments Aircrew 227During pre-flight checks, aircrew will run a thorough diagnostic check on critical systems to ensure they function properly for safe flight.  During the mission diagnostics will alert the aircrew to critical failure modes via Warning, Caution, and Advisory \(WCA\ndications on the cockpit displays.  Therefor e, they can reconfigure the equipment to successfully complete their mission.   During post-flight debrief, data recorded during the mission is discussed in maintenance control and work orders are generated to document discrepa ncies for correction before the next mission  Scheduling 227When determining which aircraft to assign to a mission, AME needs to identify which aircraft have fully mission capable subsystems needed to accomplish the particular mission.  Additionally, subsystems needed for operations in adverse weather or night operations all have to be fully functional.  For long mission durations, AME needs to identify if the aircraft is properly serviced to maximum levels to ensure the mission can be accomplished without stopping en route unexpectedly  Safety 227Integrated diagnostics needs to provide sufficient data to support mishap investigations for identification of causal factors.  To prevent mi shaps, hazardous events that occur during flight can be identified, and poor operational procedures and aircrew judgmen t can be improved.  Several excellent initiatives are being implemented via the Military Flight Operations Quality Assurance \(MFOQA which can be found at http://www.navair.navy.mil PMA209/teams/flightOps/mfoqa.asp Maintenance As discussed in  t h e V-22 Osprey  program  surveyed its maintainers and determined that AME needed to support the maintenance shops with the following functions 1  Maintenance control: debrief aircrew and generate work orders 2  Maintenance shops: troubleshooting, servicing, and inspections 3  Quality assurance: BIT trending and Vibration Structural Life and Engine Diagnostic \(VSLED\ysis Aircrew debrief 227Indications that occurred during the mission are redisplayed in maintenance control for review and discussion with the aircrew  Generate work orders 227Observed anomalies along with the AME data are documented into the Naval Aviation Logistics Command Management Information System Optimized Organization Maintenance Activity NALCOMIS-OOMA\define the failed functions are also included on the work order to assist repairs at the intermediate and depot levels of maintenance  Troubleshooting 227A link between the BIT codes on the work orders to the Interac tive Electronic Technical Manual IETM\troubleshooting procedures is required so the maintainer has a starting point to begin troubleshooting.  In addition, the cockpit management system onboard the aircraft provides the func tionality to run a thorough diagnostic check on the system; e.g., Initiated BIT \(IBIT Maintenance BIT \(MBIT Repair verification 227IBIT or MBIT is run onboard the aircraft after the repair to en sure the failure mode has been corrected Servicing 227Low fluid levels and gas pressures are identified in order to service to the proper level Inspections 227Overstress conditions are identified in order to perform a visual inspection for damage Trending 227All indications from the aircraft can be summed over a period of several flights and compared with other aircraft to identify whether a failed condition exists.  In addition, consumption rates of fluid levels are needed to identify systems demonstrating exceptionally high usage Reset intervals 227A capability to reset diagnostics data is necessary as components ar e removed and replaced, and data on the new component is uploaded into the ground station.  In addition, scheduled oil servicing periods will 


  3 need to be reset after the old oil is drained and replaced with new lubricant.  Furthermore, an erase function is needed to clear stale diagnostics data from previous missions and maintenance ground events Upload software constants 227A method to upload software constants that are peculiar to individual components, such as engines, will be required I-Level maintenance 227Collating detailed diagnostics data from the aircraft with repair data at I-level maintenance will allow the maintainer to repair the component quicker improving turnaround times Engineering Various engineering disc iplines utilize diagnostics information to assist with integration of equipment, evaluate failure modes during fleet operations, determine component life usage, and finally assess performance requirements such as reliability and maintainability metrics.  Special consideration has to be given to what type of data is displayed to the aircrew and maintainers to ensure it supports their mission needs; status information that could be useful sometime in the service life of the aircraft should be linked to special engineering reports vice WCAs and failure indications Integration 227While integrating equipment onto the aircraft engineers will need access to failure data especially communication faults to ensure the equipment is correctly functioning once it is installed Root cause analysis 227During fleet operations, engineers will need diagnostics information to assist with root cause analysis of failure modes.  As discussed in reference   detailed diagnostics information will be needed to correct BIT false alarm indications.  Software configuration information is important in order to track corrective action effectiveness and to determine if new failure modes were introduced Life usage 227As discussed in t h e V-22 Structural Appraisal of Fatigue Effects \(SAFE\program\222s primary objective is to maintain safety of flight by preventing the aircraft from ex ceeding structural fatigue life limits.  At the same time, the SAFE program maximizes the economic benefit by obtaining th e most service out of each aircraft and its components.  Vibration data is collected onboard the V-22 using the VSLED system, and fatigue life expended is calculated by the SAFE team Reliability and mainta inability evaluation 227Data from the diagnostics equipment is scored by engineers then performance calculations are dete rmined and compared with the operational and specification requirements Logistics In order to maintain high readiness levels, diagnostics information is used by the maintainers, logisticians, and supply support personnel.  In order to troubleshoot and repair the aircraft, maintainers will need to be able to interpret the indications and use the maintenance procedures to repair work orders.  Logisticians can compare the diagnostics information with the repair tasks to improve troubleshooting procedures.  Finally, supply support personnel are provided detailed failure information to send back with the component for better repair turnaround time at the intermediate and depot repair facilities Performance Based Logistics \(PBL 227By trending repair and diagnostics information, logisticians can coordinate failure modes with engineering to identify and implement corrective actions.  Close tracking of equipment by part number and serial number will help supply support identify poorly repaired components Configuration management 227The maintenance department in the squadron will need to track the software configuration of the aircraft Manufacturing In order to deliver high-qua lity aircraft, the diagnostics information is used to determine whether the aircraft has been properly assembled.  Just like O-level maintenance factory employees also use the diagnostics information to troubleshoot and repair the aircraft.  Furthermore, engineers examine the reports to ascertain correct integration of the equipment Synopsis Understanding how the various groups will use the aircraft\222s data helps determine the right combination of BIT sensors, and recording devices on-board the aircraft.  Since naval aircraft maintenance has to follow COMNAVAIRFORINST 4790.2, it is important that the diagnostics data and the AME architecture augment O-level I-level, and D-level maintenance operations 3  H EALTH AND U SAGE D ATA  Health and usage data comes in a variety of types such as internal BIT within the equipment, multiplex bus communication protocol, status information, and vibration levels.  Each aircraft program identifies its unique data requirements and implements them based on their needs and reporting requirements.  As discussed in  recommendations from the AIR-6.8.4 Industry Data Exchange Working Group found that there is great benefit in the development of a common aircraft health and usage data standard.  The minimum diagnostics data set was listed in whi c h was al so defi ned by t h e AIR 6.8.4 Industry Data Exchange Working Group.  These health and 


  4 usage data elements are disc ussed further in the following paragraphs System BIT As defined in MIL-HDBK-2084, BIT is the self test hardware and software which is internal to a unit to test the unit.  MIL-HDBK-2165 further expands this definition stating its an integral capability of the mission system or equipment which provides an automated test capability to detect, diagnose, or isolate failures Internal Weapons Replaceable Assembly \(WRA\ test data 227 Multiple BIT tests are performed within the WRA to identify failed functions.  Depending on the firmware or software reporting mechanization, these individual tests can be reported failed or just a single fail message is transmitted externally.  Sometimes these failure messages identify whether a critical or non-critical function has failed.  Each BIT test has an assigned threshold and filtering algorithm that requires it to be exceeded before the failure message is reported Multiplex bus communication 227Failure to communicate across a multiplex bus can be reported as failures by the bus controller.  These indications are typically identified as dual bus failures or single bus failures  Fluid levels Servicing fluid levels on aircraft are performed more often than repairs.   Therefore, trending the oil servicing levels over time or flight-hours is one method of measuring the health of the component.  Excessive fluid consumption is reason to remove the component since it is considered failed in accordance with prescribed maintenance procedures Accurate sensors are needed to measure the fluid level in gearboxes and oil reservoirs Status information Status information is simply categorized as discrete data that identifies the current stat e of equipment operation.  For example, alerting the aircrew that a door is open in the cabin compartment would be considered status information Fluid pressures and flow rates 227Instead of imbedding electrical/electronic circuitry, pr essure values and flow rates are monitored to verify correct system operation Therefore, the risk of shorts and sparks in the fuel system are eliminated improving aircraft safety Temperature 227Temperature values from gearboxes hydraulic systems, engines and other equipment need to be monitored, and over temperature conditions need to be recorded along with the maximum values Transmission debris 227Presence and size of metallic debris is required to determine whether the gearbox is safe to perform flight operations Fuel quantity 227Knowing the amount of fuel onboard the aircraft is critical to flight safety and mission duration Being able to identify changing fuel levels and flow rates into and out of each tank is crucial for troubleshooting fuel system gripes Ammunition and stores 227The number of rounds and the number and type of ordnance remaining will help improve the turnaround time between missions Aircraft state 227In order to adequately interpret the data, the mission timeline needs to be identified.  Aircraft state data would include conditions like engine start and shutdown weight-off-wheels a nd weight-on-wheels and electrical generators on-line or off-line.  Furthermore, mode changes of the subsystems would be recorded to support root cause analysis by engineers Platform Dynamics 227In-flight parameters such as acceleration, velocity, roll-ra te, turn-rate, altitude, and outside air temperature are some of the data elements.  Of key importance is to identify the aircraft maneuvering conditions when failure or overstress conditions occur Configuration Data Typically, the software versions loaded into the subsystems are recorded each flight. A dditional configuration data would include elapsed maintenance time, component part number and serial number, a nd firmware version Vibration Monitoring Vibration levels of engines, transmissions, rotor systems drive shafts, and blowers are monitored, and over exceedance conditions are alerted to the aircrew and maintainers.  Trending these vibration levels over time can identify adverse trends and maintenance actions must be performed before a safety of flight incident occurs Rotor Track and Balance \(RTB On rotary wing aircraft, th e RTB system collects the vibration data in the selected flight conditions.  The system then computes the necessary adjustments of pitch rod length, weights, and tabs to keep the rotor vibration and track within acceptable levels Engine Performance Tracking engine operating performance is critical to flight safety.  For example, the minimum engine performance must be 95 percent otherwise the engine requires maintenance such as washing or removal and replacement 


  5 Typically, each engine\222s perfo rmance level is plotted over time to display the trend Power assurance checks 227While in flight, the aircrew need to ascertain the engines\222 performance levels before conducting missions requiring high performance Synopsis Many of these data elements are required by military specifications and handbooks resulting from years of lessons learned to prevent future mishaps.  As technology advances large amounts of data can be reported at extremely high rates plus stored for playback.  Human engineering now becomes important so as not to display an overwhelming amount of data to the aircrew and maintainers.  Some data elem ents need to be presented on the aircraft while others are processed and displayed on the ground station.  Interpretation of all this health and usage data becomes a critical aspect of the on-board aircraft systems and off-board AME architect 4  I NTERPRETING H EALTH AND U SAGE D ATA  Numerous types of health and usage data were presented and discussed in the previous section.  These data elements need to be categorized and displayed to support mission accomplishment by the aircrew, quick repair times by maintainers at all levels of maintenance, and in-depth engineering investigations and analyses by engineers.  Too much information being displayed can overwhelm the aircrew and distract them fro m their mission.  Plus, false alarm indications can flood the system causing poor maintenance practices.   Furthermore, a capability is needed to display and control system operation on-board the aircraft and process and display the aircraft\222s information off-board on a maintenance ground station Diagnostics On-Board Aircraft The Central Integrated Checkout \(CIC\System is a concept where BIT plus all electronic monitoring on the aircraft is coordinated to provide optimized electronic fault detection and fault isolation capability.  The cockpit management system provides the ability to status the operational condition of the aircraft systems and to select and control specialized BIT routines through a series of menus \(or control layers\ed on the multi-function displays Failure and status information are presented to the aircrew and maintainers in the English language.  CIC functions are controlled by the advanced mission computers through the operational flight program Fault management 227Failure and status information are reported by the subsystems to the aircraft mission computer and processed for reporting and recording Cockpit reporting 227Menus are provided on the cockpit displays to view the overall status of aircraft, and the operator can select each subsys tem viewing the status of individual WRAs.  A menu listing the indications by chronological order from present to past is needed to communicate problems to the squadron during the mission and troubleshooting after the mission.  During flight, failure and status messages are displayed as WCA indications which have emergency procedur es associated with them To assist the aircrew with mission accomplishment, failures should be identified as mi ssion critical or non-critical  Fault recording 227All the data elements discussed in section three are recorded onto a removable media and taken into maintenance control for processing on the ground station A reset function is necessary to clear the data from previous ground operations and flights BIT test control 227Menus are provided on the cockpit displays to identify the status of the equipment and to command IBIT on the equipment.  Results from IBIT are returned and displayed to the operator.  BIT tests that would interfere with safe flight will be disabled Maintenance Ground Station After the diagnostics data from the aircraft has been processed by the ground station, these data elements need to be categorized and displayed to support fleet operations Reports, graphs, and trending tools are necessary functions in order to organize these data elements into a user-friendly manner for accurate interpreta tion.  As described in reference C A M E O provi des a com p rehensi v e t ool set  for maintaining the V-22 Osprey. It is a joint-service product being fielded for Navy, Marine, and Air Force operational units. If other services or agencies, such as the Army or Coast Guard, become interested in utilizing its common capabilities, the system can be easily adapted to these other services needs.  Figure 2 shows the CAMEO architecture and the capabilities it provides.  A more detailed discussion of these capabilities and others are provided in the following subparagraphs Reports 227Separating the AME data into unique reports will help the operators interpret the indications easier Exporting these data in a format compatible with Microsoft Office products and databa ses will assist reporting requirements and engineering analyses 1  Separate reports for WCA failure, servicing, and exceedance indications need to be provided.  In addition these indications must be displayed showing when they set during the mission timeline 2  Highlight known false alarms in a manner easily viewable from true failure indications

Display detailed subsystem reports that identify the failed function along with mode changes and aircraft dynamics 4 List software a nd hardware configurations on-board the aircraft Work orders 227Detailed fault data from the WRA should be annotated to assist all maintenance levels with repairing the equipment.  CAMEO provides a direct link from the failure indication to the IETM troubleshooting procedures Graphs 227Performance levels of engines and dynamic components will need to be displayed as trend lines over time.  Color coding using operational risk management criterion should be implemented showing green for normal operation, yellow for approaching maximum limits, and red for exceeding limits Playback 227Display the subsystem and components on a menu and show its operation and fa ilure indications to assist with troubleshooting and diagnosis of failure symptoms For complicated fuel systems these data need to be recorded periodically for pl ayback on the maintenance ground station in order to properly troubleshoot the system Consumption trending 227A menu should be provided that displays the oil levels on the squadron's aircraft for the past 10 flights including engines and gearboxes.  Furthermore oil consumption trending should be automated using the values recorded from the oil level sensors onboard aircraft Maximum consumption values must be identified in IETM BIT trending 227Display number of occurrences that indications set across squadron's aircraft to compare failure indications and identify failure conditions. In addition, list the job order numbers assigned to these indications for analysis in NALCOMIS-OOMA I-Level Smart Test Program Set \(TPS Smart TPS is an information tool that provides analysis of test and maintenance data at I-level maintenance.  Its purpose is to make intelligent recommendations that reduce diagnostic test times and improve fault isolation.  By analyzing aircraft diagnostics data and historical maintenance records, the diagnostic test time can be reduced by selecting the most efficien t entry point that detects the failure.  In addition, a suggested corrective action for the failure mode is also identified.  Smart TPS reduces repair times on-station thereby lowering operational costs.

By combining AME and Smart TPS data, the maintainer is guided toward performing the most  likely troubleshooting and repair actions Synopsis Straightforward interpretation of diagnostics information on-board the aircraft and in AM E off-board the aircraft is key to providing exceptional sustainment throughout the life cycle. Numerous data types and large file sizes necessitate sophisticated computer processing along with well planned categorization of the diagnostic s data.  Interfaces between the aircraft and AME at Olevel, I-level, and D-level maintenance becomes complicat ed especially considering the information technologies linking them together.  Finally the failure modes observed need to be aligned with the diagnostics data to guide maintainers to the correct repairs quicker thus improving aircraft readiness and reducing life cycle costs 5  P ERFORMANCE M ETRICS  Finally, qualitative and quantitative performance metrics are established to measure how well the AME is achieving its requirements.  Typically, just three metrics define the entire performance requirements for BIT as discussed in the following paragraphs from  Fault Detection Fault detection or Probability of Correct Detection \(P CD  confirmed hardware failure asso ciated with a recorded BIT indication.  Typically, a threshold of 95 percent and an objective of 99 percent are assigned.  Fault detection is defined as the total number of BIT detected failures divided by the total number of BIT detectable failures then multiplied by 100 to express the quotient as a percent 


  8 Fault Isolation Fault isolation or Probability of Correct Fault Isolation P CFI dication of a detected failure that identifies the correct faulty WRA either directly or through the use of prescribed maintenance procedures.  A threshold of 95 percent and an objective of 99 percent are also assigned Fault isolation is defined as the total number of failures correctly isolated to one WRA divided by the total number of BIT detected failures then multiplied by 100 to express the quotient as a percent Mean Flight Hours Between False Alarms \(MFHBFA MFHBFA is defined as the total number of flight hours divided by the total number of false BIT indications.  A threshold value of 15 hours and an objective value of 20 hours would typically be assigned.  From  false alarms are failure indi cations that indicate a failed WRA, but no hardware failure is confirmed. They also include the following conditions 1  Intermittent indications that are determined to not require maintenance because of a lack of spare replacement units or because of other mission requirements 2  Indications that clear when the fault logs are reset or are re-initialized 3  Indications that cannot be confirmed by organizational maintenance personnel \(cannot duplicate 4  When the suspected faulty WRA is found to perform satisfactorily at higher levels of maintenance \(Retest-OK Rotor Track and Balance Typically, the track and balance requirement would be no more than two adjustment sets for main rotor and tail rotor track to be within limits 95 percent of the time Synopsis Three BIT metrics and a rotor track and balance requirement can not suffici ently define the entire diagnostics and AME performance.  Prime contractors for naval weapon systems will not be able to adequately price the AME architecture identified in this paper unless more thorough requirements are defined.  Therefore, a systems of systems approach is necessary to define the on-board diagnostics data for use by all user groups and how it is processed and displayed off-board in AME 6  C ONCLUSIONS  How each user group makes use of diagnostics data to fulfill their roles and responsibilities was thoroughly discussed.  Engineering, logistics along with aircrew and maintainers need information to support an aircraft weapon system throughout its life cycle.  Standardizing health and usage data across aircraft plat forms allows common tools to process the data for each group's needs eliminating stovepipe systems for each ai rcraft type.  CAMEO was initiated with the intention of being cross-services compatible. Mission need statements and capability development documents should identify the entire AME architecture and functions to meet the life cycle requirements of the weapon system.  Finally, a system of systems engineering approach will need to ensure these requirements are implemented into the hardware and software solutions onboard the aircraft and off-board in the ground station, and verifiable metrics are established  R EFERENCES  1] Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 2005 Aerospace Conference, Paper No. 1086, Transforming A Maintenance Ground Station  2] Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 2004 Aerospace Conference, Paper No. 1438, Root Cause Analysis of BIT False Alarms   Maley, S., Lofberg G and Lasiter M.,\223Overview of the Comprehensive Automated Maintenance Environment Optimized \(CAMEO\System 224, American Helicopter Society 64th  Annual Forum, Montreal, Canada, April 29 \226 May 1, 2008  AIR 6.8.4 Indust ry Dat a Exchange W o rki ng Group Outbrief, of 14 Jun 2006 5 Data Defin itio n Fo rm at File For Aircraft Fault & Usage Data Processing, AIR-6.8.4 Industry Data Exchange Working Group, of 14 Jun 2006  and Electronics Engineers 2003 Aerospace Conference, Paper No. 1434, Common Built-InTest Evaluation Criteria  Acknowledgements A special thanks to the diagnostics professionals within PMA-275, Bell-Boeing, Rolls-Royce, and Raytheon who contributed to establishing CAMEO.

port based spacecraft health monitoring and fault diagnosis As a part of our future work we plan to investigate a systematic procedure to generate the CDM parameters possibly by utilizing information on component fault statistics i.e histograms of faults representing the in\003uences of the faults in a node on its child node as well as by exploiting the structural properties of our model Extension of the proposed CDM to a dynamic Bayesian network-based CDM will also be an interesting research that may be pursued A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is supported in part by a Strategic Projects Grant from Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada NSERC R EFERENCES  D L Iv erson 223System Health Monitoring for Space Mission Operations,\224 in Proc 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference  Big Sky Montana USA March 2008 pp 1\2268  J K urien and M D R-Moreno 223Cost and Bene\002ts of Model-based Diagnosis,\224 in Proc 2008 IEEE Aerospace Conference  Big Sky Montana USA March 2008 pp 1\22614  A Barua and K Khorasani 223Intelligent Model based Hierarchical Fault Diagnosis for Satellite Formations,\224 in Proc 2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics SMC 2007  Montreal Canada October 2007  227\227 223Multi-Le v el Fault Diagnosis in Satellite F or mations using Fuzzy Rule-Based Reasoning,\224 in Accepted 2nd International Symposium on Systems and Control in Aeronautics and Astronauticss ISSCAA 2008  Shenzhen China December 2008  A Barua P  Sinha and K Khorasan i 223A Diagn ostic Tree Approach for Fault Cause Identi\002cation in the Attitude Control Subsystem of Satellites,\224 Accepted for Publication in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems  2008  A Joshi V  Ga vriloiu A Barua A Garab edian P Sinha and K Khorasani 223Intelligent and Learningbased Approaches for Health Monitoring and Fault Diagnosis of RADARSAT-1 Attitude Control System,\224 in Proc 2007 IEEE International Conference on Systems Man and Cybernetics SMC 2007  Montreal Canada October 2007  J P earl Probabilistic Reasoning in Intelligent Systems Networks of Plausible Inference  San Monteo CA USA Morgan Kaufmann 1988  F  V  Jensen and T  D Nielsen Bayesian Networks and Decision Graphs  2nd ed NY USA Springer 2007  R Ganguli 223 Application of Fuzzy Logic for Fa ult Isolation of Jet Engines,\224 Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power  vol 125 No 3 pp 617\226623 July 2003  W  W ang 223 An Inte lligent System for Ma chinery C ondition Monitoring,\224 IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems  vol 16 No 1 pp 110\226122 February 2008  T  Y airi Y  Kato and K Hori 223Fault Detection by Mining Association Rules from House-keeping Data,\224 in Proc International Symposium on Arti\002cial Intelligence Robotics and Automation in Space  2001  M A Sw artw out 223BEAM T echnology for Autonomous Self-Analysis,\224 in IEEE Aerospace Conference  Big Sky MT March 2001 pp 2989\2263001  R Gessne r  B K osters A He\003er  R Eilen ber ger  J Hartmann and M Schmidt 223Hierarchical FDIR Concepts in S/C Systems,\224 in Proc 8th International Conference on Space Operations SpaceOps2004  Montreal Canada May 2004  J K orbicz J M K oscien y  Z K o w alczuk and W Cholewa Eds Fault Diagnosis Models Arti\002cial Intelligence Applications  Germany Springer 2004  H A T alebi and R P a tel 223A Neural Netw orkBased Fault Detection Scheme for Satellite Attitude Control Systems,\224 in Proc 2005 IEEE International Conference on Control Applications CCA-2005  Toronto Canada August 2005 pp 1293\2261298  N T udoroiu and K Khorasani 223Satellite Fault D iagnosis using a Bank of Interactive Kalman Filters,\224 IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems  vol 43 No 4 pp 1334\2261350 October 2007  I A Al-Zyo ud and K Khorasani 223Neural Ne tw orkbased Actuator Fault Diagnosis for Attitude Control Subsystem of an Unmanned Space Vehicle,\224 in Proc IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks IJCNN-2006  Vancouver Canada July 2006  Z Q Li L Ma and K Khorasani 223 A Dynamic Neural Network-based Reaction Wheel Fault Diagnosis for Satellites,\224 in Proc IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks IJCNN-2006  Vancouver Canada July 2006  A V aldes and K Khorasani 223Dynamic Neural Network-based Pulsed Plasma Thruster PPT Fault Detection and Isolation for the Attitude Control System of a Satellite,\224 in 2008 International Joint Conference on Neural Networks IJCNN 2008  Hong Kong June 2008  R Isermann 223Model-based Fault Detection and Diagnosis\226Status and Applications,\224 Annual Reviews in Control  vol 29 pp 71\22685 2005  G J W ells R E Zee and C J Damaren 223Hardware Emulation Strategies for Concurrent Microsatellite Hardware and Software Development,\224 Canadian Aeronautics and Space Journal  vol 48 No 1 pp 87\22695 12

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous
