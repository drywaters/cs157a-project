traf\002c tickets They could still be able to move from one place to the other whilst in the due process of making transactions Mobile systems and applications could be used to enhance the forms of existing applications Mobile telecommunication applications involve using a mobile phone to carry out user transactions This means instead of of\002cer visiting the police station in order to deliver traf\002c ticket and so transfer traf\002c tickets from police station to the traf\002c police data center each of\002cer can simple do it with his mobile device Mobile police telecommunication is being seen as a new wave and dimension of making traf\002c control  Mobile police telecommunication is found to be convenient and ef\002cient The major retreats of mobile communications appear from the hardware platform or the type of devices it targets The characteristics and features of the client devices it employs have a negative impact on it As we know the cellular network was 002rst designed for voice communication purposes Further developments within the network cellular network made it possible to send or transmit data as well Cell phones have small screen displays and that might be irritating to someone who has the experience of the desktop environment Another issue that can be seen as a disadvantage to police telecommunication is the limitation in bandwidth 8 The GSM technology has the data rate of 9.3 Kbps and the current 3-G technology offers a data rate goes up to 2 Mbps  Mobile de vices use batteries as their form of power supply Normally  po wer for a cell phone battery lasts up to 2-3 days depending on how new the battery is It then gives the owner the burden of having to remember to recharge it every now and then Mobile de vices do not ha v e enough processing power and the de v eloper has to be careful about loading an application that requires too much processing Also mobile devices do not have enough storage space Mobile appliances are quite vulnerable to theft loss and corruptibility Security solutions for mobile appliances must therefore provide for security under these challenging scenarios T elecommunication targets mobile appliances which use a public transmission medium for wireless communication which implies that the physical signal is easily accessible to eavesdroppers and hackers In this paper a secure protocol for police mobile devices has been proposed which tries to address both security issues and convenience while taking into account the limitations of power supply processing and storage space also attend to the mobile environment in developing countries II B ACKGROUND A Security Threats When the GSM is used as a bearer for mobile applications which need high security e.g payment shopping police telecommunication or mobile betting there is a possibility that an attacker might capture the message context which includes user privacy or amend the message causing a fraudulent transaction In this section we summarize the threats identi\002ed in that occur within a mobile environment 1 Message Disclosure  With no protection on con\002dentiality and integrity messages could be intercepted and snooped during transmission and the user privacy is at stake Although messages are encrypted when it is sent across the air the encryption algorithm chosen for message encryption must be the network-speci\002c algorithms such as A5 for GSM These algorithms have been susceptible to cryptanalysis et al demonstrated that the secret key of A5 could be cracked in minutes 2 Spoo\002ng  Message spoo\002ng is a very feasible threat because an attacker can manage to inject message into the messaging network with a spoofed originator IDs An attacker can spoof a legitimate ME by sending a message from the internet with the correct headers The ME Mobile Equipment isn't able to detect that it comes from the internet and a transaction will be conducted according to the attacker If an attack er kno ws the authenticating information of a user he could consist in impersonating the genuine user to conduct a transaction with a legitimate AS Application Server The authenticating information of the user can be eavesdropped easily as mentioned in previous section

Figure 1 Architecture of Police Secure Telecommunication Network 3 Replay of Messages  The possibility exists that an attacker arranges for authentication request and/or authentication response messages to be replayed Though an attack on the reply of an authentication request message does not seem obvious replaying an authentication response could be a more serious vulnerability If such a replay is possible it can be used to impersonate a legitimate user and hence authenticate a false transaction Please note that this attack will not work if there exists an authentication request number anti-replay mechanisms that must be included in the response  B Related Works Similar to wired public networks such as the Internet there are four basic security requirements for the mobile networks authentication con\002dentiality integrity and non-repudiation Authentication prevents unauthorized user from accessing services Con\002dentiality protects sensitive data against eavesdropping Integrity protects sensitive data from tampering and modi\002cation Non-repudiation prevents forgery in network services To protect remote resources numerous remote authentication schemes are proposed Among them password-based remote authentication is one of the most commonly used authentication techniques due to its simplicity and effectiveness But it is relatively easy to masquerade as a legitimate user to send fake messages to the server or to access the sensitive resources For services such as e-commerce online banking government portal corporate Intranet access and etc strong authentications are required The public-key technology is widely used in strong authentication and some protocols optimized for mobile communication were proposed in 27 and 9 Due to the low cost the portability and the cryptographic capacity smart cards as an auxiliary computing device have been widely adopted in remote authentication schemes       The most common smart card is the SIM card used in mobile phones and it has been used for remote authentication in the wireless environment         A generic authentication system for Internet services using the regular SIM card was proposed in 4 It provides a strong authentication mechanism for a 002xed Internet computer based upon the GSM authentication infrastructure Torres et al mainly discussed ways of using smart card for application authentication over the wired network However the properties of the wireless network are different from that of the wired network and the authentication and communication schemes used in the wired network cannot be applied into the wireless network directly Using a symmetric algorithm and a shared secret password that is used for generating an encryption key is another method The encryption and authentication of the message are based on the shared secret such as a password Furthermore it provides the integrity of messages by using Message Authentication Codes MAC In this method all the secret keys stored in the memory of the mobile device exposes such security issues as the keys could be infected by viruses or be

maliciously replaced Similar work has been done by where the authors focus on designing a protocol SMSSec which would make minimal use of computing resources The SMSSec can be used to secure SMS communication between a WMA client and a server using end-to-end encryption However this mechanism is also implemented in the memory of a mobile device and faces the same threats as those mentioned before An enhancement implementation with Public Key Infrastructure for strong mobile authentication was also proposed in  In that article the mobile user s pri v ate k e ys are stored in the memory of this tamper resistant card Public-key cryptography algorithms are used for decryption and digital signature operations on the SIM card as well as for encryption and signature veri\002cation operations on the mobile phone The problem is that the public-key algorithms in use today are computationintensive and it may be too expensive or too slow for the mobile application for each message exchange A system which uses dedicated smart card for mobile authentication is described in But the phone in the system must have an additional smart card slot where the PKI application implemented as the SAT SIM Application Toolkit application used for authentication is located in a dedicated java card III P ROPOSED P ROTOCOL To design a protocol we have two main steps First we have to determine the Transmitted Data Value that the protocol supports and next we have to select the encryption algorithm regard to mobile resource limitations such as power and memory A Transmitted Data Value The security mechanism in the protocol should 002t the required security levels This is partly determined by the transmitted data In our approach we have considered the following one category so all of police Data is important and need to guarantee con\002dentiality of exchanges and privacy and non repudiation for all parties involved B Encryption Algorithms and key management Three methods exist for data protection by encryption algorithms using Asymmetric in security protocols using symmetric in security protocols or Merging two method of symmetric and asymmetric Composition of two or more method together creates a stronger protection but impose more cost to resource in addition to the cryptanalytical strength an encryption algorithm used in cell phones PDAs or any other battery operated device should be able to handle their resource limitations so this method seem to unusable for mobile device In comparison between Symmetric algorithms and asymmetric algorithms the cryptanalytical strength symmetric algorithms are superior to the asymmetric algorithms with regard to equal Key long ho we v er K e y distrib uting is a major problem in symmetric algorithms F or solv e this problem some methods introduced that to have emphasis to change key periodically and Key distributing techniques for instance divided key methods submission key to trusted neighbor and so on As reported in 39 13 symmetric algorithms has the low power consumption cost than Asymmetric algorithms in symmetric algorithms cost power consumption measurement unite is Micro Joule whereas measurement unite in Asymmetric algorithms is Milli Joule IV P ROTOCOL A RCHITECTURE The aim of our paper is to develop a protocol which provides an end-to-end secure communication between the Traf\002c Police Data Center TPDC and its mobile of\002cer Mention to III.B the symmetric algorithms are superior to the asymmetric algorithms both cryptanalytical strength and resources consumption cost Other than communication spoken face to face out of possibility of listening it is probably safe to say that no communication is guaranteed secure in this sense K e y tra nsmission on netw ork have major risk a method for reduce risk is Key changing periodically whatever period time was shorter risk will be fewer and so if Key change

Figure 2 Transaction Flow for Of\002cer Telecommunication with regard to exclusive data that only know user and server have more security In this protocol offender driving license is exclusive data between of\002cer and Traf\002c Police Data Center because Traf\002c Police Data Center has license information in database and of\002cer accesses to offender driving license physically in venue also driving license information is changing for each offender Figure 2 illustrates the message 003ow and in follow are transactions steps Step 1 For starting the secure protocol the of\002cer should send offender driving license data to TPDC for con\002rm license transmitted data are including some data of offender driving license and not all its data and so of\002cer ID These data are encrypted by a symmetric algorithm with usage of 002rst Key that it is issued to of\002cer by TPDC A good chosen for symmetric algorithm can be AES due to mobile resource considerations Step 2 TPDC is decrypting transmitted data and after of\002cer authentication assign a new temporary ID for this of\002cer session Daily_session_ID to minimize the ability to link and available time and 002nally it is sending a response to the of\002cer for license con\002rmation to pre-registered of\002cer mobile number This con\002rmation message consists of license con\002rmation Daily_session_ID date and time session availability Step 3 this message is received by the of\002cer mobile set and SIM asks the of\002cer 002rst Key for decryption After decrypting the message SIM displays the receiving data on the handset display the of\002cer start to rule enforcement and traf\002c ticket Data entry and then send out ticket herewith the random number and transaction ID Then SIM encrypts the message with AES and sends them back to the TPDC Step 4 TPDC is registering traf\002c ticket to driver history data base and will terminate the transaction by sending an acknowledgement to of\002cer Step 5 in this stage TPDC server and of\002cer SIM are generating new Key with usage of 002rst Key and any predetermined data between offender license data that it didn't sent and not utilized in license con\002rmation processing for instance this data can be determined 002rst name of offender driving license or barcode Hence after TPDC issued acknowledge to of\002cer set New Key will be generate with regard to old Key and any predetermine offender data POD in TPDC and of\002cer set and utilize for next transaction New_Key   Old_Key POD}fAES Consequently it provides the transaction security high level since Key is changing in short time periodically and each traf\002c ticket get renew key and so Key is changing regard to exclusive data that only know of\002cer and TPDC also this data changing for each offender A Key Distribution In the proposed protocol when the of\002cer goes to register in TPDC a new SIM card that contains all the required software and keys a main police

identity name and First Key Personal is issued for him/her V S ECURITY A NALYSIS OF THE C OMMUNICATION P ROTOCOL 1 In proposed protocol Key is changing after each transaction termination also every New Key is stronger of previous Key because if we assume 002rst Key has M states and POD has N states second Key will be N 002 M states and third Key will be M 002 N 002 N and so on Also Key availability time is limited to each traf\002c ticket registration time so have gotten enough time of attacker 2 The replay attack is prevented because the freshness of the messages can be veri\002ed through the nonce In the authentication phase a side effect of the diversi\002cation Key is used as a nonce 3 Even if the First Key is compromised the known key attack still fails because the attacker also has to know the POD to compute the new session key However the attacker cannot get the primary key from either a mobile client or the TPDC and so licenses have diversi\002cation information related to owner license 4 The protocol can also defense against the Man in-the-Middle attack because the offender is hidden between many inde\002nite offenders and so POD is hidden between some data that don't exist on network so attacker cannot generated New valid Key In other word for each offender has unique Key and It is impossible for attackers to 002nd a legitimate Key 5 A masqueraded server trying to cheat the legal user is infeasible because it has no way to get the POD of the TPDC to compute a valid Key VI S IMULATION AND R ESULTS The proposed protocol simulated as a pilot version In this paper the NowSMS1 gateway 2008 was used as the gateway and it has throughput of 200 messages per second and higher A PC is used as TPDC server and gateway Messages were sent out through a Wavecom Integra modem M2106 to real a GSM network A common mobile handset with java support capability was receiving the messages We chose the SIM Card R5 as a certi\002ed and more public SIM This is a java card that supports Open Platform 2.0.1 and Java Card 2.1.1 We used the GemXplore Developer suite v3.1 that is a plugin for Borland JBuilder X to develop the SIM Toolkit applets AES algorithm has been implemented as a library on SIM and so 128-bit secret key is stored in PIN protected 002les on SIM This SIM can run this cryptographic operation more than 125 times per second We perform experimental operations 30 times and 002nd all the transaction time excluding the interaction time of the of\002cer to enter the security keys traf\002c ticket data and push the send button takes around 11 seconds Almost all of this time is GSM delay time and can be improved by using SMPP connection and hardware in TPDC with more improved ef\002ciency This protocol don't have computation-intensive operations online it communicate in a reasonable period without lost security The communication phase only needs symmetric cryptographic operations that are computationally cheap VII C ONCLUSIONS In order to transmit sensitive messages over the public cellular network we present an endto-end secure communication solution based on symmetric-key The secure framework can help TPDC to establish a trusty and secure mobile communication channel between the TPDC and a ME The encrypted messages can only be deciphered at the TPDC's premises or in the ME The proposed protocol not only satis\002es the convenience and ease of use that is generally required for mobile users but also it provides the transaction security high level so that this protocol has special regard to security factors and prepare short time period for changing Key any transaction have any Key Key don't distribute on network and so on This protocol are improving transaction time and security level and it is clear that the framework can be extended to the other mobile information

As shown in Figure 2, we have achieved a significant improvement yielding an improvement factor for the compressed document structure between 3.5 and 7  6  Evaluation of compression and decompression times  Figure 3 summarizes our evaluation results on the data throughput of the compression techniques. gzip yields the highest throughput reaching rates of up to 12000 bytes/ms, XMill is the second fastest followed by Bzip2 and finally followed by the queryable compressors DTDSub, BSBC and KST signature   0 1000 2000 3000 4000 XM H C1C2DBD1D2 Throughput \(byte/ms gzip Bzip2 DTDSub BSBC XMill KST + DAG  Figure 3.

6.3. Evaluation of query performance on compressed data  In order to evaluate the query performance on compressed data, we have compared the query evaluation on KST signature with two other approaches. On the one hand, we have compared it with JAXP, the standard XPath evaluator contained in Java 1.5 in order to compare the overall query performance. On the other hand, we have compared it with our generic query evaluation engine working on uncompressed SAX events and using the same elementary navigation operations first-child and nextsibling and the same framework on top to evaluate queries, in order to evaluate the effect of compression on the query evaluation time Our test data set was generated by the XML generator of the XML Benchmark XMark [14 u s i n g a  scaling factor of 0.001 \(116 kB\p to 0.128 \(14.5 MB On our dataset, we have evaluated queries of the XPath benchmark XPathMark-A h e tes t qu erie s  can be seen in Table 2  Table 2. XPathMark-A queries used for the evaluation of query performance ID Query Q1 /site/closed_auctions/closed_auction annotation/description/text/keyword Q2 /site/closed_auctions/closed_auction//keyword Q3 /site/closed_auctions/closed_auction annotation/description/text/keyword  da te  Q4 /site/closed_auctions/closed_auction descendant::keywo da t e  Q5 /site/people/person profile/gender and profile/age  n a m e  Q6 site/people/person[phone or homepage na m e Q7 site/people/person[address and \(phone or homepage and \(creditcard or profile  n a m e    D128 0 2000 4000 6000 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 ms Uncompressed JAXP KST signature  Figure 7. Query evaluation times for document D128  Figure 7 shows the test results of all queries for the largest document with scaling factor 0.128 and a size of 14.5 MB. Except for the queries Q2 and Q4, KST signature performs better than JAXP and performs comparable to our generic query evaluation engine working on the uncompressed XML data. KST signature needs a longer evaluation time than the other approaches for the queries Q2 and Q4, as the descendant-axis location step in these queries requires that the whole sub-tree under the current context node has to be searched and thus partially decompressed. As KST signature was designed for optimal compression an index for descendants has not been included  Q2 0 2000 4000 6000 050100150 ms KST signature JAXP Uncompressed Figure 8. Query evaluation times for query Q2  Figures 8 and 9 show the scaling of queries Q2 where KST signature performs worse than the other two evaluators\d Q7 \(where KST signature performs best of all three evaluators\ can be seen in both figures, KST signature s query evaluation time scales linearly depending on the size of the uncompressed XML document. Therefore, it can be used for extremely large documents as well  Q7 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 scaling factor ms KST signature JAXP Uncompressed  Figure 9.

7. Summary and conclusions  We have presented a technique for lossless data reduction of huge XML files and XML data streams Our data reduction technique combines KST signature compression with structure sharing known from DAGs in the following way We introduce the concept of explicit XML nodes that can be used as pointer origin and still allow for unique decompression and fast query evaluation Furthermore, we encode pointer destinations by SAX event numbers of previous XML nodes We have integrated the concept of pointer to substructures with the KST signature that can be generated by parsing the XML document with an attribute grammar that uses the DTD. A special feature of the compression and the attribute grammar rule is that the same DTD rule set can be used for decompressing the KST signature. Query processing avoids full decompression and uses partial decompression on demand, e.g. for answer sub-tree generation We have reduced query processing to a set of elementary navigation operations, consisting of firstchild, next-sibling, parent and label, and we have developed fast query evaluation on top of these elementary operations. To support following pointers and backward navigation, we keep the child path from the root to the current context node on further information on a stack. This supports efficient query evaluation on our compressed data format KST signature without the requirement of expensive decompression Finally, we have conducted extensive performance evaluations that show that our approach not only results in reasonable query evaluation times, but also outperforms the compression ratios of all the other compression techniques, including even nonqueryable compression techniques like gzip, XMill and BZip2 Altogether, our approach reduces huge XML data structures or XML data streams to a significantly smaller KST signature. It combines a scalable and significant size reduction of verbose XML structures with a comparably fast query processing technique Therefore, the use of KST signature is a significant step towards XML data reduction and the management of huge XML files and streams 8.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
