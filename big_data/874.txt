checking and trend analysis on large amount of telemetry data utilizing software tools The need for ef\002cient utilization of telemetry data by employing machine learning and rule-based reasoning has been pointed out in the literature  in order to enhance diagnostic performan ce and assist the less-experienced personnel in performing monitoring and diagnosis tasks Current spacecraft diagnosis practices do not scale well for future multi-platform space missions due to the presence of larger amount of telemetry data and an increasing need to make the long-duration missions cost-effective by limiting the size of the operations team Furthermore the effectiveness of spacecraft autonomy an ideal solution to this problem is yet to be fully demonstrated and due to the existence of perceived risks it is often desired that the expert human operators be involved in the spacecraft operations and 
diagnosis processes To address the above problems and requirements in this research we develop a systematic and transparent fault diagnosis methodology within the hierarchical fault diagnosis concepts and framework we introduced in 3 for multiplatform space systems The decomposition is driven by the need from project management perspective for supporting the development of the components/subsystems of the overall system by a number of teams and performing integration at the end In this framework we decompose a multi-platform space system hierarchically into multiple levels We consider a multi-platform system as a set of interacting components where components at different levels correspond to formation system sub-system etc depending on the location of the component in the hierarchy At a particular component in the proposed hierarchy we in 
vestigate fault diagnosis of an individual component utilizing fuzzy rule-based diagnosis in order to handle the uncertainty among diagnostic signals and faults We construct fault signature models for fuzzy rule-based reasoning by extracting useful features from data by utilizing our earlier experiences on both synthetic and actual telemetry data 5 F or hier archical fault diagnosis we develop Component Dependency Models CDM based on probabilistic reasoning i.e structured Bayesian Networks BN 7 models in order to take the uncertainties in component interactions into account The structure of our CDM is determined from the knowledge of component and/or fault dependencies Diag1 


nostic evidences introduced to the CDM are fault mode observations in different components in the form of fuzzy rule activations We demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy utilizing synthetic data generated from a leader-follower formation control model consisting of high 002delity attitude actuator model as well as electrical power subsystem model Related Work Diagnostic expert systems that utilize rule-based reasoning have been extensively used for fault diagnosis in various applications For example in the authors sho wed the effectiveness of a fuzzy logic-based fault isolation scheme on jet engines utilizing typical gas path parameters The author in proposed an e xtended neuro fuzzy scheme for online machinery condition monitoring and applied it on an experimental setup of a gearbox driven by a d.c motor in order to to classify different gear conditions The authors in  proposed a rule-based diagnosis method for spacecraft that applies two different data mining techniques namely time-series pattern clustering and association rule mining to spacecraft telemetry data As mentioned above the need for ef\002cient utilization of spacecraft telemetry data by employing machine learning and rule-based reasoning has been identi\002ed in the literature recently The author in has pointed ou t that when the system or the application domain is very large and complex an entirely rule-based representation and associated inference leads to a large and inef\002cient knowledge base causing a poor quality in diagnosis The author in has reported a method of data analysis intended for autonomous real-time fault detection and characterization in spacecraft utilizing both rulebases and causal system model without providing much details on how the models are developed and integrated The schemes in appear to be suitable for f ault diagnosis of a small set of actuators that are operated in isolation However there is no information available on how to utilize or employ such scheme systematically in the presence of a number of interacting components or subsystems A hierarchical Fault Detection Isolation and Recovery FDIR concept for a single satellite system was presented in in order to streamline and manage FDIR designs of multiple design teams across large number of spacecraft subsystems during different project phases However the paper presents the concept mainly from the FDIR task management perspective without providing details on systematic development of frameworks and methodologies In this work we present a novel hierarchical fault diagnosis framework and methodology which allows systematic fuzzy rule-based reasoning across large number of spacecraft components or subsystems Note that at an individual component we utilize fuzzy rule-based reasoning because of its well-known ability for accommodating uncertainties in fault symptoms and transparency in reasoning process The general idea is to decompose a complex system hierarchically into simpler modules and utilize rule-bases that are built for each module and connected via a Bayesian network model representing module dependencies A generic hierarchical fault diagnosis approach similar to the work in this paper is available in  ho we v er  the properties of their hi erarchical structure are much restrictive for application to complex systems with multiple interactive subsystems and furthermore the structure does not take uncertainty related to component interactions dependencies into account In unmanned space vehicles and satellites usually most of the anomalies correspond to the hardware/subsystem component faults i.e the faults in sensors and actuators Consequently a number of research have been related to the fault diagnosis of such components 5 6 Ho we v er  these w ork do not provide details on how the methodologies can be applied in the presence of large number of interactive components and subsystems Furthermore design and implementation of model-based fault diagnosis methods 16 onboard for large number of subsystems and their components may be cost-prohibitive even if suf\002ciently accurate mathematical models are available On the other hand with the advancements of space systems hardware/software emulation tools it is possible to determine f ault m anifestations utilizing synthetic data in cases where actual telemetry representing faults are not available and utilize the observations of such manifestations in diagnostic rules Our framework is 003exible to accommodate other fault diagnosis methodologies 5 6 16 as long as the y are co st-ef fecti v e The organization of the remaining parts of this paper is as follows in Section 2 we develop a Bayesian network-based CDM that represents our proposed hierarchical framework for multi-platform space systems fault diagnosis In Section 3 we brie\003y discuss our proposed fuzzy rule-based fault diagnosis methodology for diagnosing faults at different components in the hierarchy Fault diagnosis results are presented in Section 4 Finally conclusions are stated in Section 5 2 B AYESIAN N ETWORK B ASED H IERARCHICAL F AULT D IAGNOSIS Our proposed fault diagnosis framework aims to perform diagnostic reasoning in complex systems such as a 223formation 003ying system\224 by decomposing its complex structure hierarchically into simpler components The decomposition is driven by the need from project management perspective for supporting the development of the components/subsystems of the overall system by a number of teams and performing integration at the end The idea was introduced in one of our earlier work 3 Though our proposed frame w ork is generic in nature and includes various spacecraft subsystems in this paper we con\002ne our discussion mostly within the Attitude Control Subsystem ACS and Electrical Power Subsystem EPS Furthermore we assume the availability of some fault detection mechanisms at each level in the hierarchy and discuss the proposed framework mostly from fault diagnosis or isolation perspective 2 


Bayesian Network Structure  We represent our proposed hierarchical decomposition with a novel Bayesian networkbased Component Dependency Model CDM as shown in Figure 1 The entire system under consideration is represented with a single node at the highest level that consists of sub-components located at the lower levels We denote the p th component at level l in the hierarchy as C l p  For example if we consider a 4 level decomposition of a multiplatform space system for l  1  C 1 p would correspond to the p th sensor or actuator subsystem component whereas for l  4  C 4 1 would correspond to the 223satellite formation\224 For the intermediate levels i.e l  2 and l  3  a component C 1 p would correspond to the p th subsystem and system respectively In subsequent paragraphs we investigate a general case of L level hierarchical decomposition Let the set Figur e 1  Bayesian network representation of proposed hierarchical decomposition of all components located in two levels namely l 1 and l 2  be denoted as C l 1 p and C l 2 q  respectively where p  1  2   P l 1  q  1  2   Q l 2  l 1  l 2 2 f 1  2   L g  and L is the total number of levels of the hierarchy Therefore when l 1  l 2  l  two different components located at the same level l are represented as C l p and C l q  assuming P l  Q l as shown in Figure 1 For any C l p  the sets of components that are parents children neighbors and family of C l p as represented in Figure 1 are denote by pa  C l p   ch  C l p   nb  C l p   pa  C l p   ch  C l p   and f a  C l p   pa  C l p   C l p  respectively First we de\002ne a 223levell fault\224 as follows De\002nition 2.1 Levell Fault A fault occurring in a system hierarchically decomposed into L levels is said to be a 223levell fault\224  l  1  2   L  and denoted as fault f l k if and only if its manifestations are only observable in the fault signatures that belong to level l and in higher levels for the fault severity level\(s under consideration The rationale behind De\002nition 2.1 is as follows even if a fault is originated in a subsystem component the fault is assumed to have different levels of manifestations in the hierarchical framework i.e for diagnosis at different levels fault symptoms/manifestations are required to be available For example consider the speci\002c fault 223increase in friction\224 in the pitch reaction wheel subsystem component At subsystem component level one of its manifestations would be 223high current drawn by the wheel motor\224 In the attitude control subsystem ACS level one of its manifestations would be 223deviation from expected pitch angle\224 System level manifestations can be described in terms of the deviations from some relative subsystem speci\002cations Finally at the formation level the manifestations can be 223deviation from expected relative attitude with respect to other satellites\224 Therefore in this case there is a need for identifying the faults differently at different levels in the hierarchy based on the 223level of abstraction\224 at a particular level and the manifestation of a fault at that particular level Component Health States  Given a component C l p and its parents pa  C l p   f C l 000 1 1   C l 000 1 m   C l 000 1 M g  we represent the possible health states X l p of C l p as X l p  f x 0   x m   x M g  where x 0 corresponds to the state 223healthy C l p 224 and x m corresponds to the state 223component C l 000 1 m fault in C l p 224 If pa  C l p     we represent the possible health states X l p of C l p as X l p  f x 0   x k   x K g  where x k corresponds to the levell fault f l k that originates at C l p  Now in general it is possible that some fault manifestations in C l p correspond to the faults that originate at a lower level l 2 and the remaining fault manifestations in C l p correspond to the levell fault that originates at C l p itself In such cases we represent the component C l p with two sub-components  1  independent sub-component of C l p  denoted as D  C l p   and  2  dependent sub-component of C l p  denoted as U  C l p   Note that pa  D  C l p    and pa  U  C l p  6    Therefore the possible states of D  C l p  are f x 0   x k   x K g and the possible states of U  C l p  are f x 0   x m   x M g  It is important to note that even though we represent C l p with two different nodes the possible states X l 1 q of a child node C l 1 q  where C l 1 q 2 ch  C l p   remains unchanged i.e the state 223component C l p fault in C l 1 q 224 will correspond to both D  C l p  and U  C l p   Furthermore it follows from De\002nition 2.1 that the signature of a levell fault is not possible to observe at lower levels and the origin of a levell fault is in one of the 223independent sub-components\224 D  C l p   We introduce evidences of health states at different nodes of our proposed CDM We obtain such evidences by utilizing fuzzy rule-based diagnosis at different nodes of our proposed CDM To perform such diagnosis with each component C l p  we associate diagnostic signals fault manifestations and fault signature models that are denoted as S l p  M l p  and F SM l p  respectively Evidence vectors corresponding to the health states of a component C l p are obtained through component-level fault diagnosis that are discussed in detail in Section 3 It is important to note that fuzzy rule activation values are not considered as probabilities since they are fundamentally different from each other Model Parameters  Parameters of our proposed Bayesian 3 


network-based CDM are the conditional probabilities speci\002ed in the form of Conditional Probability Tables CPT Therefore the dependency of a component C l p on its parents pa  C l p  is speci\002ed at the node C l p  The probabilities may either be learned from data or must be speci\002ed by an human expert It is important to note that the CPTs in our CDM quanti\002es the in\003uences that the faults in a component have from the faults in its parent component\(s At two different levels different diagnostic signals are used to generate fault evidences as discussed in Section 3 The sensitivities of the diagnostic signals to faults may not always be the same and the diagnosis performed at a particular component is subjected to false and missed alarms Consequently uncertainties exist in how the faults in one component are related to that in another It is well-known that the CPT that is speci\002ed at C l p has a number of parameters conditional probabilities that is exponential in the number of parents pa  C l p   i.e one must specify P  X l p j pa  X l p  for each con\002guration of the parents Clearly when suf\002cient amount of data are available CPTs can be speci\002ed by investigating component fault statistics However it is usually quite dif\002cult to 002nd data that is representative of all the parent con\002guration and even if such data is available number of cases for each con\002guration are likely to be too small To overcome this problem we specify the CPTs at each node as follows Case-1  When the number of con\002gurations are 223manageable\224 we divide the con\002gurations into R partitions 031 1   031 r   031 R so that the number of distributions to be speci\002ed i.e R  can be reduced Let C l p be a node with 2 parents namely C l 000 1 1 and C l 000 1 2  Consequently according to the above mentioned health state assignments X l p  f x 0  x 1  x 2 g  where x 0 corresponds to the state 223healthy C l p 224 x 1 corresponds to the state 223component C l 000 1 1 fault in C l p 224 and x 2 corresponds to the state 223component C l 000 1 2 fault in C l p 224 Now if C l 000 1 1 has m states f x 1  0  x 1  1   x 1 m 000 1 g and C l 000 1 2 has n states f x 2  0  x 2  1   x 2 n 000 1 g  we need to specify mn distributions in the CPT of C l p  However note that irrespective of the number of states each child of C l p has each of them can be assumed to have binary states f H F g  This means that the faulty states f x 1  1   x 1 m 000 1 g and f x 2  1   x 2 n 000 1 g of the children of C l p can be grouped together while the number of states of C l p remaining the same as before For the 2 nodes above with m  4 and n  3  we need to specify 2 2 distributions instead of 12 distributions Therefore in general we always need to specify R  2 N distributions for N children nodes Case-2  When the number of con\002gurations are 223large\224 we make independence assumptions Figure 2 illustrates a wellknown procedure to make independence assumptions explicit in a BN model Our main objective here is to discuss how such assumptions are justi\002ed in our case As shown in Figure 2\(a the node C l p has M children nodes Intermediate a b Figur e 2  Incorporation of Noisy-OR distributions in the CDM nodes 223 C l p  C l 000 1 1 224  223 C l p  C l 000 1 M 224 are introduced where the m th node represents 223 C l p health with in\003uence of C l 000 1 m 224 Finally at C l p  we specify 223noisy-OR\224 distrib utions that require only M parameters to be speci\002ed The independence assumption of the parents of C l p can be justi\002ed for a wellknown leader-follower LF satellite formation as follows If l  L  C L p represents the 224formation component\224 and diagnosis is performed at C L p refer to Section 3 by extracting useful features from the relative state measurements of the satellites by assuming that the leader is fault free Under the assumption of a fault free leader only the faults in the follower satellite will manifest in the C L p  With a non-simultaneous fault assumption the faults in the individual follower satellites can be considered independent from each other Next we consider the case l  2 where C 2 p corresponds to a subsystem as mentioned above for a 4-level decomposition and pa  C 2 p  corresponds to the actuators and/or sensors located at level1  If the health of the components in pa  C 2 p  are monitored frequently faults in individual components can be identi\002ed much ahead in time before they manifest in other components refer to Section 3 Therefore in such cases with the assumption of single fault no simultaneous faults the faults in the components pa  C 2 p  can be considered independent from each other Similar independence assumptions can be made at other levels when non-simultaneous faults are considered Utilizing the procedures that are stated above the CPTs are speci\002ed by investigating the fault statistics at each node and by determining distributions that justify the in\003uence of faults at that node on a child node 3 F UZZY R EASONING B ASED C OMPONENT F AULT D IAGNOSIS As mentioned in Section 2 we obtain the evidences that are introduced to the nodes of our CDM by utilizing fuzzy rulebased diagnosis at different nodes of the CDM To perform such diagnosis with each component C l p  we associate diagnostic signals fault manifestations and fault signature models that are denoted as S l p  M l p  and F SM l p  respectively In this research we utilize features extracted from the process states and/or variables as diagnostic signals 4 


Diagnosis of Faults in Independent Subcomponents The fault diagnosis methodology described below is intended for a single component C l p that has no dependency i.e pa  C l p     with relatively small or manageable number of diagnostic signals Therefore in this case the component can be considered as D  C l p  227 the dependent subcomponent of C l p as mentioned in Section 2 Furthermore the assumption of single fault no simultaneous faults is made which is reasonable if the component/subsystem is monitored frequently The problem of multiple faults will be addressed in subsequent sections Let F l p be a 002nite set of K faults under consideration associated with a component C l p at level l  F l p  f f k  k  1   K g  Also let S l p  f S l p;j  j  1   J g be a 002nite collection of J sets of diagnostic signals Each S l p;j is obtained by extracting N features from the J process states and/or variables measured or calculated under consideration V l  f v l j  j  1   J g  Therefore each S l p;j  where S l p;j  f s l p;j;n  n  1   N g  represents a set of N extracted features from each v l j  Furthermore each diagnostic signal s l p;j;n 2 S l p can have a set of M possible values  M valued fuzzy quantization of a feature represented by the set 026 s l p;j;n  f 026 1  026 2   026 M g  Note that the number of elements in 026 s l p;j;n associated with each s j need not necessarily be the same Each possible value corresponds to a fuzzy set that is characterized by a Membership Function MF namely 026 m  s l p;j;n  2 0  1  The fault manifestations associated with the component C l p  denoted as M l p  consist of all the 026  s l p;j;n  corresponding to the set of all diagnostic signals S l p  Let  1  M l p;j be the set of all possible manifestations 026  s l p;j;n  associated with a given diagnostic signal s l j  and  2  M l j;k 2 M l p;j is the manifestation set in terms of a j th diagnostic signal s l p;j;n  associated with the fault f l k 2 F l p in order to avoid clumsiness in notation we have omitted the subscript p in M l j;k and have made it implicit in the remaining part of this section Given a particular fault f l k 2 F l p  only some speci\002c features of selected s l p;j s are of interest for identifying the fault Let S l j;k 2 S l p;j be the set of such features of interest corresponding to the fault f l k  Therefore M l j;k consists of the 223values\224 in 026 s l p;j;n  of such features  S l j;k  in the presence of f l k  A mapping S l p 002 F l p  M l p is de\002ned which assigns each pair h s l p;j;n  f l k i a subset of the values M l j;k 032 M l p;j  A fault signature matrix F SM  C l p  similar to the Fault Information System FIS in is construct ed The k th column of F SM  C l i  is called the signature of the fault f l k which in general represents a complex signature that may consist of multiple elementary signatures Relations between faults and symptoms are expressed in the form of if-then rule sets R l p;K within which the rule r l p;k is represented as If  s l p 1 n 2 M l 1 k  and  s l p 2 n 2 M l 2 k   and  s l p;J;n 2 M l J;k  then  f l k  1 where ds l p;j;n 2 S l j;k  Complex premise ful\002llment factor is determined as follows 026  s l p;j;n 2 M l j;k   026 1  s l p;j;n  b 026 2  s l p;j;n  b  b 026 M  s l p;j;n  2 for M valued evaluation of a s l p;j;n  where 026 m  s l p;j;n  2 M l j;k  The symbol b represents fuzzy sum operator for example s norm operator such as MAX or drastic sum The activation level for the rule corresponding to the k th fault is given by 026  f l k   026  s l p 1 n 2 M l 1 k  n  026  s l p;j;n 2 M l j;k  n  n 026  s l p;J;n 2 M l J;k  3 where the symbol n represents fuzzy conjunction operator for example t norm operator such as MIN or PROD 14 Note that in addition to the rules associated with different faults one or more rules corresponding to healthy conditions are possible to be included in the FSM and activation level of the healthy rule denoted as 026  f l 0   can be computed The use of a pre-de\002ned rule activation threshold can be avoided by utilizing an 223aggregation\224 operation to combine the results of all the rule activations in the FSM For example if the wellknown 223max\224 operator is used for aggregation health state corresponding to the rule with maximum activation level can be considered as the identi\002ed health state of component C l p as follows X l id;p  fh f l k  026  f l k  i  026  f l k   max 002 026  f l 0    026  f l K  003 g 4 Now by using the identi\002ed health state X l id;p of C l p  a  K  1  evidence that corresponds to the possible health states X l p is generated For example if f l k 2 X l id;p  the evidence vector e will have a 1 in the  k  1  position since f l 0 represents fault-free condition and 0 s as the remaining elements of e  Finally note that for two identical components C l p and C l q at a same levell  the sets of possible faults F l p and F l q  and the diagnostic signals S l p 2 C l p and S l q 2 C l q will be similar Therefore the FSMs of the two components can be constructed by following similar procedures Conditions for fault identi\002ability are similar to that are available in our earlier work Diagnosis of Faults in Dependent Subcomponents We consider fault diagnosis in a single component C l p that has dependency i.e pa  C l p  6    Recall that the possible health states of C l p  in this case are X l q  f x 0   x p   x M g  where x 0 corresponds to the state 223healthy C l p 224 and x m corresponds to the state 223component C l 000 1 m fault in C l p 224 If pa  C l p  5 


consists of components with low degree of interaction or coupling a set of rules corresponding to the possible health states of C l p can be synthesized following the procedure presented above for independent subcomponents In such case diagnostic signals corresponding to the relative behavior of the pa  C l p  are not available or useful The key difference with the independent subcomponents is that here for a dependent subcomponent the diagnostic signals are obtained from the components in pa  C l p  so that a faulty component at level l 000 1 can be identi\002ed Components at the same level with higher degree of interactions require special attention In such case availability of precise relative state measurements can provide a valuable set of diagnostic signals A particular case of our interest is the highest level L the 223formation\224 level where the component consists of individual satellites and diagnostic signals are the features extracted from the relative measurements for example relative attitude measurements Since the faults that occur in spacecraft are mostly related to the subsystem components we consider a general problem of fault diagnosis where the origins of faults f l k are at some low level l but have manifestations denoted as M L j;k  at the highest level L  Let f C L 000 1 p  p  1   P g denote a set of P components without loss of generality we use the subscript p instead of m  whose coupling and interactions are characterized by the well-known Leader-Follower LF or master-slave control architecture where p  1 corresponds to the single leader in the set We assume that P 025 3 and for P  3  follower components can obtain relative state measurements with respect to each other Furthermore let S L  f S L j  j  1   J g be a 002nite collection of J sets of diagnostic signals at level L where each S L j is obtained by extracting N features from each of the J relative state measurements and s L j 2 S L pq corresponds to a measurement of C L p with respect to C l q  Furthermore let the manifestation of a fault occurring at C l p in terms of s L j 2 S L pq be denoted by M L pq;p  Manifestations corresponding to a healthy condition is represented as M L pq 0  It can be shown that if the diagnostic signals at level L correspond only to the relative state information the faulty component C L 1  where C L 1 is the leader component acting as a 223reference point\224 cannot be identi\002ed at levelL  However though the faults that originate in the leader component are not identi\002able at levelL by utilizing only relative state information they can be identi\002ed either at lower levels according to De\002nition2.1 or by a human supervisor can be considered as a supervisory dignoser at level L  1  at ground station by checking if the leader conforms to pre-determined speci\002cations We propose the following fuzzy inference rule for identifying the faulty follower component in the formation by utilizing diagnostic signals corresponding to level L  If  s L j   s L j 2 S L p 1 2 M L p 1 p  and  s L j   s L j 2 S L pp 003 2 M L pp 003 p  and  s L j   s L j 2 S L p 003 1 2 M L p 1  0  then C L 000 1 p 5 where p 6  1 and p 003 corresponds to a single follower component that is an active neighbor to C L 000 1 p  By 223active neighbor to C L 000 1 p 224 we mean a follower component with respect to which the state measurements of C L 000 1 p are available Note that since the rule in 5 utilizes diagnostic signals that correspond only to the relative states diagnostic signals representing multiple relative states are utilized in order to restrict undesired rule activations that would lead to persistent false and/or missed fault identi\002cation alarms presence of detection mechanism is assumed The activation level of the rule in 5 is computed as that in 3 and an evidence vector corresponding to the states of C L p can be constructed by following the procedure mentioned above for independent subcomponents Conditions for fault identi\002ability are similar to that are available in our earlier work It should be mentioned here that this rule-based reasoning is applicable to any component whose sub-components interactions are characterized within a leader-follower LF or master-slave control architecture at a given level l  It may be worthwhile to repeat here that as mentioned in Section 2 in this work fuzzy rule activation values are not considered as probabilities since they are fundamentally different from each other 4 F AULT D IAGNOSIS R ESULTS In this section we demonstrate the fault diagnosis methodology that was presented in Sections 2 and 3 by utilizing synthetic data Note that utilization of synthetic formation 003ying system data has been necessary due to the unavailability of actual telemetry data from multi-platform space missions which are still mostly in planning and design stages We 002rst provide a brief description of our data generation model before presenting the fault diagnosis results Formation Flying Mission and System Description For synthetic fault data generation 002rst we have implemented the attitude and power subsystems models of a Planetary Environment Orbit PEO formation 003ying system with 5 identical small satellites  150 kg  in a Leader-Follower LF con\002guration as shown in Figure 3 A Sun-synchronous Lower Earth Orbit LEO with 550 km altitude orbital period 95 min approx was selected as the leader's Keplerian orbit Followers were assumed to follow fuel-optimal trajectories around the leader 24 In the subsequent paragraphs we discuss the two subsystems namely Attitude Control Subsystem ACS and Electrical Power Subsystem EPS that we have implemented for generating synthetic data to demonstrate our fault diagnosis approach Attitude Control Subsystem  The main purpose of an Attitude Control Subsystem ACS which is commonly considered as momentum management system is to orientate the main structure/body of a satellite at desired angle\(s within required accuracy that is set by the payload communication devices etc mounted on the main structure of the satellite At6 


titude of a satellite can be represented in different ways with sets of variables such as Euler angles direction cosine matrix DCM Euler parameters also called quaternion  etc Euler angles consist of three successive rotation angles  036 022   around the x y z axes of satellite's body frame To avoid the well-known shortcoming of Euler angles for large rotations in this work we have utilized quaternion representation 26 to implement the attitude dynamics of eac h s atellite However for control and especially for diagnosis purposes it is reasonable to utilize Euler angles The reason for utilizing Euler angles representation is that it provides easy visualization of the rotations and orientation of the satellite and hence the ground support personnel responsible for fault diagnosis are more comfortable dealing with Euler angles Furthermore attitude control performance speci\002cations are usually available in terms of error in the Euler angles We assume a Figur e 3  Formation of 002ve satellites 002xed formation con\002guration i.e the followers are required to maintain the same attitude as that of the leader relative to the inertial frame For control and especially for diagnosis purposes it is reasonable to utilize Euler angles Since the spacecraft attitude dynamics utilized is speci\002ed in terms of the quaternion in the 223inertial frame\224 for each satellite we have implemented PID controllers with 006 5 V limit or saturation for the control signal for each axis based on 223errors in terms of the Euler angles\224 by performing quaternion to Euler angle transformation The functional diagram for the implemented model of the ACS of an individual satellite is shown in Figure 4 in which the 223ACP\224 consists of the PID controllers corresponding to the three axes of the satellite's body frame and the 223Reaction Wheel Assembly\224 consists of the corresponding set of three actuators used for maintaining the required attitude or orientation of the 223Satellite Body\224 For synthetic data generation we have also incorporated a high 002delity mathematical model of the Ithaco Type-A reaction wheel RW that is available in  wh ich consists Figur e 4  Functional diagram of the ACS Figur e 5  A simpli\002ed schematic diagram of a reaction wheel adopted from depicting the locations of f ault injections under the assumed ACS fault scenarios Figur e 6  Functional diagram of the EPS adopted from 30 depicting the l ocations of f ault injections under the assumed EPS fault scenarios of detailed mathematical representation of a reaction wheel containing relationships for representing motor driver torque control mechanism motor disturbances such as cogging and ripple torques Coulomb and viscous frictions torque noise that results due to lubricant dynamics the 223EMF torque limiting\224 phenomenon at high speeds safety mechanism for limiting speed and torque bias discontinuity as shown in Figure 5 Finally worst-case environmental disturbances such as magnetic torque gravity-gradient torque atmospheric drag and solar radiation pressure corresponding to the selected orbit have been applied in the attitude model Electrical Power Subsystem  We have incorporated a simpli\002ed satellite Electrical Power Subsystem EPS model with our ACS model of each satellite We have modi\002ed the EPS model which is a v ailable in 31 and is de v el oped in the Virtual Test Bed VTB environment 30 to i ncorporate fault injection capabilities and to ensure the supply of desired bus voltage to the ACS reaction wheels A functional diagram of the EPS model of an individual satellite is shown in Figure 6 which consists of a solar array illumination model solar array model the controller or simpli\002ed Power Distribution and Control Unit PDCU a battery model and a voltage regulator that delivers regulated bus voltage to the load i.e in our case the reaction wheels It is important to mention here that in our numerical simulations of ACSs we have input the pre-generated EPS bus voltage data that corresponds to the orbital characteristics altitude inclination eclipse pe7 


Figure 7  A 4 level Bayesian network-based component dependency model CDM for hierarchical fault diagnosis riod etc of the satellites Therefore the interaction between the ACS and EPS is of leader-follower type in the sense that any fault in EPS may manifest in ACS but the converse is not true Such simulation setup is justi\002ed by the fact that the target ACS fault severities do not lead to large deviations in satellite attitude that may affect the Sun pointing of the solar arrays and hence the performance of the EPS Fault Models  Within the ACS two types of intermittent faults are considered injected at the subsystem component reaction wheel level  a  reaction wheel current fault decrease in motor gain and  b  friction fault increase in viscous friction Each fault is injected with 3 three severity levels gradually increasing from the lowest to the maximum severity and then gradually decreasing before a complete fault removal The fault injection locations are shown in Figure 5 Within the EPS two types of faults are considered at the subsystem level  a  intermittent bus voltage drop due to the voltage regulator malfunctioning and  b  intermittent bus voltage drop due to anomaly in the battery Each fault is injected by introducing undesired resistances at the battery output and voltage regulator output respectively fault injection locations are shown in Figure 6 with 3 three severity levels gradually increasing from the lowest to the maximum severity and then gradually decreasing before a complete fault removal Note that though we are considering component level faults within the ACS we assume the faults corresponding to the EPS are at subsystem level due to the lack of detailed understanding of the EPS components within the EPS Consequently the EPS fault diagnosis is performed only up to the subsystem level Results We have implemented a 4 level Bayesian network-based Component Dependency Model CDM for the formation 003ight of 5 satellites described above refer to Figure 3 using the open source BN tool available at W e ha v e used an inference engine that incorporates the junction-tree algorithm  which is a well-kno wn g eneric Bayesian inference algorithm Figure 7 shows the implemented CDM where 223Sat-1\224  223Sat-5\224 represent the 002ve satellites in the formation and 223RW-X\224 223RW-Y\224 and 223RW-Z\224 represent the reaction wheels RW in X  Y  and Z directions respectively First we assign the states of the components C l p with pa  C l p    by following the procedure speci\002ed in Section 2 Each of the 15 RWs denoted as C 1 i  where i  1   15 at level1 identi\002ed as 223subsystem component level\224 is assigned the following 3 health states X 1 i  f Healthy f rictionf ault currentf ault g the fault models were discussed above Each of the 5 electrical power subsystem EPS nodes denoted as C 2 i  where i  2  4  6  8  10 at level2 identi\002ed as 223subsystem level\224 is assigned the following 2 health states X 2 i  f Healthy rerulatorf ault batteryf ault g the fault models were discussed above We assume that at the beginning of operation the system is healthy and initialize X 1 i  f 0  9  0  05  0  05 g  where i  1   15  and X 2 i  f 0  8  0  1  0  1 g  where i  2  4  6  8  10  that represent the above assumption We assign the states of the components with pa  C l p  6   by following the procedure speci\002ed in Section 2 Each of the 5 attitude control subsystems ACS nodes denoted as C 2 i  where i  1  3  5  7  9 at level2 is assigned the following 4 health states X 2 i  f Healthy RW:Xf ault RW:Y f ault RW:Zf ault g  Each of the system level level3  nodes or satellites is assigned the following 3 health states X 3 i  f Healthy ACSf ault EP Sf ault g  In the case of the formation component  C 4 1  note that j pa  C 4 1  j  5 and each parent has 3 states which would lead to a large  3 5  number of parent con\002gurations Consequently 002rst we have implemented 5 intermediate nodes between the levels 3 and 4 not shown in Figure 7 to avoid clumsiness one may refer to Figure 2\(b which we denote as 223 C 4 1  C 3 i 224 where i  1   5  We assign each of the 223 C 4 1  C 3 i 224 nodes 2 states f Healthy Sat:if ault g  Finally 8 


we assign the formation component  C 4 1  2 health states X 4 1  f Healthy F aulty g and implement a noisy-OR distribution as discussed in Section 2 at C 4 1  In the nodes with pa  C l p  6    we specify CPTs by following the procedure speci\002ed in Section 2 At this stage we utilize our subjective judgements that are based on the observations of rule activations across the hierarchy as well as false and missed alarm rates of our component fault diagnosis Next in order to generate health state evidences that are to be introduced at different nodes of our CDM we have performed fuzzy rule-based component fault diagnosis refer to Section 3 for the following components of Figure 7 the 15 RWs  C 1 1   C 1 15  the 002ve EPSs  C 2 2  C 2 4  C 2 6  C 2 8  C 2 10  and the formation component  C 4 1  Note that the health state evidences corresponding to the formation component are introduced at the intermediate nodes as mentioned above For component fault diagnosis in the RWs  C 1 1   C 1 15  we have obtained the diagnostic signals by extracting features from the following reaction wheel RW measurements a motor current b torque command voltage and c wheel speed Based on our earlier experience with an actual attitude control subsystem telemetry data we ha v e e xtracted simple features that include over an invocation window of 512 seconds approx 11 invokes per orbit mean  standard deviation  minimum value  peak value  energy  and the 002rst 5 components of the Fast Fourier Transform FFT energy spectrum  Out of all the features it was found that it is possible to obtain manifestations for the current fault as well as the friction fault within a target severity range with the following three diagnostic signals mean of motor current  mean of torque command voltage with M  13 valued fuzzy quantization and the 002rst component of the FFT of the wheel speed with M  7 valued fuzzy quantization Finally rules corresponding to the healthy RW condition as well as to the two faults under consideration are determined as in 2 which are not discussed here in detail The rule activations in each invoke are computed using 3 and the well-known max operator is used to 223aggregate\224 the rule activations results in order to generate a 002nal diagnostic decision Figure 8 shows rule activations corresponding to Sat3 Z-axis reaction wheel under friction fault injected between t  7500 sec and t  9480 sec where 026  f 1 1  and 026  f 1 2  represent rule activations levels for the friction fault  f 1 1  and the current fault  f 1 2  respectively and 026  H  represents rule activation corresponding to a healthy RW condition To demonstrate component fault diagnosis in the EPSs  C 2 2  C 2 4  C 2 6  C 2 8  C 2 10  we have obtained the diagnostic signals by extracting features from the following EPS measurements a bus voltage b regulator output current and c battery current We have extracted simple features that include over the above-mentioned invocation window of 512 seconds mean  standard deviation  minimum value  and the one component of the Fast Fourier Transform FFT energy spectrum  Rules corresponding to the healthy EPS condition as Figure 8  Rule activations in the Z-axis RW of Sat-3 under friction fault well as to the two faults under consideration are determined as in 2 by utilizing the above features As in the case of RWs the rule activations in each invoke are computed for EPSs using 3 and the well-known max operator is used to 223aggregate\224 the rule activations results in order to generate a 002nal diagnostic decision Figure 9 shows rule activations Figure 9  Rule activations the EPS of Sat-5 under battery fault corresponding to Sat5 EPS under the battery fault injected between t  6500 sec and t  6860 sec where 026  f 2 1  and 026  f 2 2  represent rule activations levels for the voltage regulator fault  f 2 1  and the battery fault  f 2 2  respectively and 026  H  represents rule activation corresponding to a healthy EPS condition For component fault diagnosis of the formation  C 4 1  mean of relative attitude measurements over an invocation window are utilized as diagnostic signals and the rule in 5 are implemented for each follower satellite based on the formation con\002guration shown in Figure 3 where an arrow from Satj to Sati indicates that attitude measurements of Sati are available with respect to Satj  Consequently the active neighbors 9 


as mentioned in Section 3 of the followers Sat2  Sat3  Sat4  and Sat5 are Sat3  Sat4  Sat5  and Sat2  respectively For simplicity fuzzy MIN and MAX operators are used as t norm operator  n  and s norm operator  b  respectively in both subsystem component-level and formation-level To Figur e 10  Sat-3 rule activations demonstrate our proposed approach we show the Sat3 rule activation when the above-mentioned friction fault was injected in the Z-axis reaction wheel between t  7500 sec and t  9480 sec Figure 10 shows rule activations in the intermediate node 223 C 4 1  C 3 3 224 mentioned above where 026  C 4 1  C 3 3  and 026  H  represent rule activations corresponding to a faulty and a healthy condition of Sat3  To investigate the validity of the follower satellites independence assumptions that are made in Section 2 one can compute rule activations in one follower satellite in the presence of a fault in another follower satellite For example the rule activations corresponding to a healthy satellite Sat4 is computed in the presence of the above-mentioned friction fault in Sat3 s Z-axis reaction wheel Figure 11 shows the rule actiFigur e 11  Sat-4 rule activations under the presence of a fault in Sat-3 vations in the intermediate node 223 C 4 1  C 3 4 224 mentioned above It is observed in Figure 11 that the independence assumption is supported by the higher activation level 026  H  of the rule corresponding to healthy condition of Sat4  Now we present some sample hierarchical fault diagnosis results that are obtained by using our CDM First we introduce a fault evidence X 1 9  f 0  1  0 g friction fault at Sat3 RW-Z Figure 12 shows probability distributions or 223belief distributions\224 over the health states of Sat-3 ACS denoted as P X 2 5  at different points in time The X axis corresponds to the time in Figure 8 It is observed that during the time of 223friction fault\224 in RW-Z the probability corresponding to 223RW-Z Fault\224 increases Figure 13 shows the probability disFigure 12  P X 2 5  of Sat-3 ACS at different points in time when an evidence of fault is introduced at subsystem component level tributions over the health states of Sat3 ACS under fault free condition as well as under the injected friction fault at Sat3 RW-Z which represents the existence of a fault in the RW-Z Figure 14 shows the probability distributions over the health states of Sat3 under fault free condition as well as under the injected friction fault at Sat3 RW-Z The distributions justify the existence of a fault in the ACS Next we introduce a fault evidence X 2 10  f 0  0  1 g battery fault at Sat5 EPS Figure 15 shows the probability distributions over the health states of Sat5 under fault free condition as well as under the injected battery fault at Sat5 EPS The distributions justify the existence of a fault in the EPS Figure 16 shows the probability distributions over the health states of the intermediate node 223 C 4 1  C 3 5 224 as mentioned above under fault free condition as well as under the injected battery fault at Sat5 EPS The distributions justify the existence of a fault in Sat5  a fault b fault Figure 13  P X 2 5  of Sat-3 ACS when an evidence of fault is introduced at subsystem component level 10

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

As the absorption is greatly affected by the molecular structure of the material, citations should al so indicate the material as a subscript to the term 223rad\224, as in rad Si indicating Silicon equivalency.  For the purposes of this paper, radiation equivalency always assumes Silicon For completeness, it should be noted that System International replaced the \223rad\224 with the unit Gr ay \(Gy\nd having an equivalency of 100 rads = 1 Gy [27 How e v e r   the use of rads, kilorads, megarads remains in the industry vernacular and is used in this document Moore\222s Law Named after Fairchild Semiconductor technologist Gordon Moore, Moore\222s law was derived from empirical data which shows that the dimensions of basic memory cells will shrink by approximately 50% of the previous value every 30 to 36 months.
