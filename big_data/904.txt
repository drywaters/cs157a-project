INTRODUCTION In August 2005, the Juno project started the formulation phase of the mission to define the functional requirements for spacecraft system, payload system, and mission system These requirements were derived from the project-level requirements system team are responsible for developing a robust and  1 978-1-4244-2622-5/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1290, Version 4, Updated 2008:12:19 capable flight system that can perform the science objectives. The mission system team is responsible for developing a ground-based operation system that can navigate the flight system safely to the Jupiter, uplink the commands, and downlink the telemetry data. In August 2008, after the Juno project successfully completed the formulation phase, NASA authorized Juno to proceed to the implementation phase. During the implementation phase the subsystems will be developed, integrated, and tested The testing will be performed against the functional requirements defined during the formulation phase Throughout the formulation phase \(2005  2008 mission simulation team delivered a wide range of mission simulation products in support of mission system reviews science operation workshops, and preliminary design reviews.

MISSION OVERVIEW The Juno science is divided into four themes, origin, interior structure, atmosphere, and polar magnetosphere. Each theme area has specific science objectives and measurement requirements. The  origin  theme is to understand global abundances of oxygen and nitrogen via microwave observation of water and ammonia. The  interior structure   theme is to study origins of the magnetic field, core mass and nature of deep convection via high resolution gravitational and magnetic-fields measurements. The  atmosphere  theme is to investigate the penetration depth of belts, zones, the Great Red Spot, and other atmospheric features via sounding of pressure, clouds, winds, and temperature. Finally the  polar magnetosphere  theme is to explore electrodynamic coupling of Jupiter and its satellites via measuring in-situ plasma, fields, waves, and radio emissions [2 Using a spinning, solar-powered spacecraft shown in Figure 1, Juno would map the gravity, magnetic fields, and atmospheric composition of Jupiter from a unique polar orbit. Juno would carry precise high-sensitivity radiometers magnetometers, and gravity-science systems. 30 of Juno  s 33 orbits of 11-day duration would sample Jupiter  s full range of latitudes and longitudes. From its polar perspective, Juno would combine in-situ and remote sensing observations to explore the polar magnetosphere and determine what drives Jupiter  s remarkable auroras. The scientific payload would include a dual-frequency gravity/radio science system, a six-wavelength microwave radiometer for atmospheric sounding and composition, a dual-technique magnetometer, two plasma and energetic particle detectors, a radio/plasma-wave experiment, and an 


particle detectors, a radio/plasma-wave experiment, and an ultraviolet imager/spectrometer The operation phase of the Juno project would last more than six years, from August 2011 to October 2017. The operation is divided into six critical mission phases, launch Earth flyby \(including gravity assist maneuvers approach, orbit insertion, science observation, and de-orbit For each mission phase, engineering challenges, science opportunities, and operation risks are addressed. During the science phase, the mission planning for the 33 orbits are organized with two types of activity templates; a microwave radiometer science and a gravity science. Each activity template is designed to optimize the end-to-end operation scenarios of the corresponding science type with respect to the science opportunities, flight system capabilities, and resource constraints. The major differences between the above two templates are spacecraft pointing, active instruments, and deep space network \(DSN science planning and instrument operation teams would use the microwave radiometer template for the orbits 3, and 5 through 8 and the gravity science template for the orbits 4 and 9 through 32. The orbits 1, 2, and 33 are currently reserved for additional science and may be operated with either template Each activity template is designed to minimize the interorbit impacts in terms of storage resources and downlink bandwidth. During nominal operations, the science data volume would use as much as 75 percent of the storage capacity, and 100 percent of the acquired data would be downlinked. The downlink rate and duration of deep space network \(DSN accommodate as much as 10-percent retransmission. Within each orbit, the 11-day duration is divided into multiple segments surrounding the perijove science period  3 hours around the perijove respect to the science payload system for data acquisition and spacecraft system operations for data and resource management. Mission planning of these activity templates requires complex analyses of the geometric relationships between the natural world \(Sun, Earth, and stars flight system, the dynamic link between the flight system and the ground system, and the tightly coupled dependencies among the subsystem resources   Figure 1.  Proposed Juno Spacecraft \(New Frontiers Program  3 3. MSVN- FRAMEWORK The MSVN-framework is organized to ensure both mission adaptation and technology evolution as shown in Figure 2 The technology evolution focuses on tracking of the information technology advances in software and hardware The software technology advances in operating system programming language, and application tools and the hardware technology advances in multi-core processor graphics processors, and storage systems are continuously infused to improve the MSVN-framework capabilities. The mission adaptation focuses on establishing a virtual mission operation that can support entire project lifecycle phase from formulation to operation, accurately representing the mission information at each lifecycle phase [3-6 MSVN-framework enables rapid mission adaptation and evolutionary project tracking via mission information modeling, virtual prototyping, and virtual operation integrating the state-of-the art information technology. The mission information modeling process tracks the projectsystem properties of a mission with respect to flight system target system \(science virtual mission operation throughout the project lifecycle 


virtual mission operation throughout the project lifecycle The virtual prototyping process transforms the mission information models into project system models that are capable of executing commands and propagating the system states. The virtual operation process translates mission operation scenarios into command sequences, executes them on the virtual flight system, and graphically presents the operation state for interactive real-time monitoring   Figure 2 MSVN Process for Mission Interface  The MSVN-framework performs the virtual mission operation with three engines, a sequence engine, a state engine, and a graphics engine as shown in Figure 3. The sequence engine and the state engine perform mission simulation in two temporal resolutions, and they transform an operation scenario into a list of subsystem states. The graphics engine translates the subsystem states into graphical states and renders them for multiple view points  During the initialization step, a sequence engine transforms the operation scenarios into event-based subsystem states employing the flight system models and the target system models. During the real-time simulation loop, a frame timer activates the state engine every 100 ms. At each time step the state engine finds the corresponding subsystem events and simulates the state progression according to the user specified subsystem state. Within the same time step, the progressed subsystem states are graphically rendered for user  s viewing  The sequence engine manages the observation scenarios by parsing the activity sequences, dispatching them to subsystem models, and collecting the subsystem states. The resulting subsystem states are referred to as subsystem events in Figure 3 to indicate that the states correspond to the commanded events.  The operation scenarios and the subsystem events can be conceptually mapped to the command sequences and the telemetry streams during the operation phase. Adaptation of the sequence engine to a specific mission is achieved by integrating the flight-system models and the target-system models via a set of predefined property descriptors of the respective systems  4   Figure 3 MSVN-Framework Simulation and Visualization Process   The state engine progresses the simulation clock by one simulation time step per 100 ms. The simulation time step may be configured during the initialization step ranging from 1 second to 1 hour per time step.  For each simulation time step, the subsystem state is propagated linearly interpolating between the previous event sate to the next event state. The subsystem state propagation must be applied to all subsystems whose states are to be monitored  The graphics engine composes a list of transformations for the graphical objects translating the state of the corresponding physical objects. The physical objects refer to the stars, the Sun, the Earth, Jupiter, and the spacecraft Each physical object is graphically represented by developing a polygonal mesh for the shape and a  shader   for the texture. The graphics processor unit \(GPU the graphical objects traversing the transformation list and dynamically forms a scene graph with respect to the viewer defined by the selected channel  


 The MSVN operation flow starts with a simulation configuration setup, which allows a user to set the simulation rate, graphical preferences, and various application-specific optional parameters.  After setting up the simulation configuration, a user specifies the orbit number and initializes the system for the event-based subsystem-state generation. A user may set the start time within the simulation time range if the default start time is not desirable. The real time simulation loop starts when the start button is clicked and runs continuously until it is interrupted by the user or it reaches the end of the simulation time range. The user may interrupt the simulation loop by clicking either the stop button or the pause button.  The stop button allows a user to restart the simulation, access the setup menu, or reset the orbit number while the pause button allows the user to resume the simulation. Figure 4 illustrates the simulation control flow and the corresponding user interface design of MSVN  The user interface employs four types of interaction mechanisms, texts, text boxes, menus, and buttons. The texts are used to inform the users about the reference event time, the channel title, the relative simulation time, and the selected channel number. The text boxes are used to allow users to specify the orbit number, the start time, and the channel number. The menus are used to provide users detailed configuration setup options and information types The buttons are used for interactive initialization, real-time simulation-loop control, and viewing-channel selection  The MSVN-framework allows three operation modes, a master mode, a slave mode, and a stand-alone mode.  In the master and slave mode operations, the simulation rate is synchronized with the wall clock so that the frame rate number of simulation frames within the second among the slave nodes does not impact the global synchronization. In the stand-alone mode, the simulation clock is coupled with the frame rate instead of the wall clock so that the simulation can be progressed in a regular interval regardless of the computational load of the simulation  5  Figure 4 MSVN Simulation Process Control 4. JUNO MISSION SIMULATION MSVN-Juno refers to a suite of Juno mission simulation systems developed utilizing the MSVN-framework Currently, there are six simulation systems, Earth flyby Jupiter flyby, Web, Complete orbit, Payload, and Magnetic field, as shown in Figure 5. MSVN-Juno integrates a wide range of models that represent the Juno mission with respect to the engineering process and the science return via the mission modeling-interface process described in Section 3 The science models address the natural phenomena to be observed while the engineering models address the mechanisms with which to observe. Figure 3 illustrates the mission information modeling process of MSVN-Juno that integrates engineering design products and the target system phenomena of the Juno mission  The engineering models specify the performance and operation properties of the spacecraft, payload system, and mission systems that enable virtual prototyping of the project system. The science models provide target-system phenomena for virtual operation of the critical mission phases. For mission- and navigation-design product simulation, the geometric and dynamic properties of the target system are virtually prototyped. For science observation planning, the measurement-related phenomena 


models are integrated, surface clouds \(MWR, JunoCAM JIRAM UVS Fluxgate Magenetometer [FGM Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument [JEDI ASC Table 1 summarizes the MSVN-Juno simulation systems with respect to the simulation coverage, mission design flight system, and target system  During the three-year-long formulation phase, the engineering models allowed flexible tracking of the functional requirements for the corresponding systems.  The science models allowed gradual integration of relevant phenomena required for addressing operation risks and science impacts. Example simulations included orbit insertion orbit geometry and the magnetic field intensity ASC field-of-view obscuration, UVS field-of-view orientation and magnetic field line, Jovian satellite observation opportunities for JIRAM, and science orbit geometry and radiation dose 6    Figure 5 MSVN-Juno Simulation Products   Table 1 MSVN-Juno Simulation Features   7  The virtual operation involves command-sequence dispatch command execution, state propagation, and state visualization.  Each subsystem is controlled by a set of commands and its state is monitored by a set of modes.  The modes are used to infer the resource usage in terms of power, storage, bandwidth, etc. A pseudo-command dictionary was defined for the subsystems including propulsion, attitude control, payload, power, telecom, and command and data handler. A command sequence specifies initial state, a list of time-ordered activities, and an exit state  During the formulation phase, four operation scenarios were composed, Earth flyby, JOI, microwave radiometer science and gravity science. Figure 5 illustrates the relationship between an operation sequence and the subsystem activities The XML source listing describes the hierarchical organization of the operation sequence, which is composed of a system-level default clock definitions and subsystem activities. The attitude control system \(ACS shown in the figure describes the four areas of the subsystem-activity specification, subsystem-level variable definition, initial state, timeline, and final state   The system-level clock definitions simplify synchronization among the subsystem activities by allowing the subsystem timelines to be expressed relative to reference epochs. In addition, they allow orbit-independent operation-sequence template composition.  For example, the microwave radiometer \(MWR applied to all MWR orbits \(3, 5  7 epoch  Perijove  in the system description, and applying  Perijove  as the reference epoch for all subsystem activity timelines. Similarly the gravity-science operation sequence template was applied to all gravity-science orbits \(4, 8  32  The subsystem-level variable definitions simplify the activity timeline composition by allowing high-level control expressions and automated tracking of the time-dependent 


expressions and automated tracking of the time-dependent states. For example, a variable specification   OffSun = X-axis, 15 deg   defines a pointing direction of the ACS as a function of the sun direction and 15 deg offset with respect to the X-axis coordinate of the spacecraft.  And a timeline statement   Perijove-1hr Point OffSun   indicates that spacecraft will be commanded to point at the direction one hour prior to the Perijove. The specific sun direction and the command time are dynamically resolved based on the trajectory of each orbit    Figure 6 Operation Sequence Organization   8 5. INFUSION CHALLENGES During the three-year-long formulation phase of the Juno project, the MSVN capabilities have evolved significantly in all three areas, model-information integration, virtual prototyping, and virtual operation. The evolution path was guided by two main principles: responsiveness and effectiveness in meeting the project needs. The responsiveness addresses timely delivery of the high-quality simulation products by forecasting the project needs in advance. The effectiveness addresses non-intrusive tracking of the project system progress by streamlining the interfaces to the design products and operation plans [7  The timely delivery of the MSVN-Juno capabilities has provided the entire project teams a common vision of the mission, significantly narrowing the communication gap between the scientists and engineers. The interface mechanisms provided by the MSVN-framework enabled the implementation of MSVN-Juno without requiring any special-purpose products from the project teams, thus incurring no additional cost to them. Though the responsiveness and effectiveness made it possible to successfully introduce the MSVN-Juno simulations, there are still numerous challenges to overcome to properly infuse the MSVN technology in flight projects  The main challenges in infusing the MSVN technology during the formulation phase arose from the limited views on simulation and visualization approaches.  MSVN-Juno introduces a paradigm shift where operation concepts can be explored to drive the flight system design. For example the end-to-end data flow simulation allows operation scenario exploration employing a generic C&amp;DH system model that can concurrently track C&amp;DH design. The endto-end data flow simulation can be used to explore C&amp;DH design options, which implies the traditional interface between operation engineers and design engineers may have to be revised. Consequently, such a paradigm shift generated a concern among some project teams  Additional challenges came from the disruptive nature of the MSVN technology that blurs the established work breakdown structure boundaries and line organization charters. The MSVN-Juno integrates all aspects of the project system in a non-traditional manner and develops multi-disciplinary simulation products.  Current project work breakdown structure at JPL is tightly coupled with the discipline-centric line organizations. Consequently, it does not have an adequate provision for infusing non-traditional multi-disciplinary technologies. In order to minimize the potential conflict with the existing organizational charters the MSVN-Juno application was limited to long-term planning applications  


  6. FUTURE WORK Within the limited application areas, the MSVN-Juno simulation products were very effective in facilitating a shared vision among the project teams and communicating the vision to various review teams during numerous reviews including the confirmation review at NASA HQ. The successful delivery was possible thanks to the vision and leadership of the project management  The MSVN-Juno will continuously evolve to support the mission and science planning activities during the next three years of the implementation phase. During the implementation phase, MSVN capabilities will be enhanced to support science planning and the uplink process. The mission information modeling will be able to capture the calibrated performance profile of the subsystems. The virtual prototyping will be able to simulate the operationbehavior variation reflecting the uncertainty distribution of the expected performance. The virtual operation will be able to explore the sensitivity of the performance uncertainties with respect to mission operation and science return   7. REFERENCES 1] Lee, M. Weidner, R.

Securities Administrators, and the ?Directory of Directors? from the Financial Post. In a few cases, it was impossible to retrieve the information, as the companies were not public  What? The data set on the adoption of enterprise system was collected and analyzed in a previous study 52]. The collection was originally created by consulting the CI Technology online database, made available by Harte-Hank. This database contains information about 750,000 firms worldwide. We restricted the list of vendors to SAP, Oracle and Peoplesoft. These vendors alone had a total share of 61.37% on the automotive market [53  When? To be able to pinpoint the missing data about the choice of the system, and, more importantly, when it was adopted, PR Newswire was again consulted Queries were launch using a yearly matrix with all companies versus all vendors. Major Internet search engines and the vendor?s official Web site has been called upon to fill the gap. After a post-validation by Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 systems? vendors, 32 of the 50 firms from the previous study were identified as having adopted at least one system from these vendors [52 After collecting the data about the conduits of information, entries were filtered by year of release The second step was to produce a matrix of all companies over the period of time from 1995 to 2004 according to the method used by Valente [14]. The matrices indicate whether a link exists \(1 0 However, the list of companies changes every year This is mainly due to mergers and acquisitions, for example, Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler AG decided to merge in 1998 [54]. Even though the entities prior to the merger/acquisition were not active in the subsequent years, they were kept for analysis purposes only. Furthermore, a new node representing the new entity was created. If one of the merged companies was doing business with a given supplier, the link in the matrix between them was kept active until the merge Later, if evidence showed that the relationship continued with the acquiring company, the relationship was established with the new company?s line in the matrix. This exercise was repeated for all technologies selected for this research. When more than one system had been adopted, only the first acquisition was kept on record SPSS 14.0 was used for both descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Logistic regression seemed to be a good choice for data analysis since our dependent variable is binary. Moreover, the fact that logistic regression focuses on the marginal contribution of the independent variable regarding the probability of adoption, it showed more benefits compared with linear regression [55  6. Results and discussion  The network population is composed of the top fifty-four \(54 and 2004. Two mergers occurred during this interval Daimler Benz AG merged with Chrysler Corp to become DaimlerChrysler AG in 1998, and Arvin Industries merged with Meritor Automotive in 2000 The technology PeopleSoft is excluded from this discussion as its exposure variable was never significant over the period studied The same data as in [52] were used in this study with regards to adoption \(what and when 


study, it was shown that SAP technology was a dominant technology across the industry between 1997 and 2005 Figure 1 presents the adopter frequency for each year, from 1995 to 2004. As can be seen, it does not follow a normal distribution as we would expect [15 We observe a slow rate of adoption at the earlier adoption stage, followed by mass adoption in 19981999, representing the majority of firms that felt the pressure to be compliant with the Y2K bug [56-57 After the Y2K hype, the market for enterprise system was soured [58]. This would explain the lack of investment in the population investigated in this study in the 2000-2001 interval [58]. It was not until 2002 that IT investments experienced a slight increase, and then in 2003, when a more substantial contribution was made [59]. Based on this evidence, we redefined the adopter categories to account for the Y2K problem. In the interval under study, we identified four adopter categories \(Table 1 1 2 Rush/Early Majority, \(3 4 collaboration   Figure 1. Enterprise system annual adoption in the automotive industry 1995-2004  Table 1. Proposed categories of adoption Periods Description Early adopters \(Pre-1998 Enterprise systems were not a common tool Firms that adopted these systems had a competitive advantage over their competitors Y2K Rush/Early Majority \(1998-2000 Many firms adopted to be compatible with the Y2K bug. Many of them would have probably adopted a few years otherwise Dotcom bust/Late majority \(2000-2002 Loss of faith in technology, as the drop in the stock price showed [60 B2B Internet-based exchange \(&gt;2002 Availability of applications to use the exchange power of Internet. Firms want to provide more self-service to customers through Web-based applications  We also tested the propositions made by analyzing the data available using hierarchical logistic regression to estimate the association between the probability of adoption of an enterprise system and the exposure to the technology, whether it is direct \(network exposure or indirect \(industry exposure hierarchical logistic regression, variables were 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 N um be r o f a do pt er s Enterprise system annual adoption 1995-2004 


Enterprise system annual adoption 1995-2004 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 computed in blocks, with the company being compared with different sources of influence Considering the small number of observations and the exploratory nature of this study, the adoption over time tends to reproduce the context of adoption every year. This approach was designed in a way to predict or re-predict whether adoption would occur year after year, depending on the properties of the nodes However, we do not consider the decision of adoption year after year as being a realistic model, since adopters will not think about the decision of adoption every year. This fact is a limitation in the analysis. We took great care in analyzing data accordingly The standardized betas of SAP network exposure were significant at p &lt; 0.05 for the whole period, with the exception of 1995, 2001 and 2002. For the year 2001, it was significant at p &lt; 0.10. Standardized betas for Oracle network exposure were only significant twice at p &lt; 0.10 \(1996 and 1998 industry exposure, SAP shows significance for the whole period, except for 1995 and 1998. For five years the significance was p &lt; 0.05 \(1996, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2004 0.10 \(1997, 2002 and 2003 were significant at p &lt; 0.05 for three years \(1996 1999, and 2000 2002 and 2004. In turn, sales were significant at only three times during the period studied. The significance levels were p &lt; 0.05 only for 1996, and p &lt; 0.10 for 1995 and 1998   Figure 2. Variance evolution of the enterprise system?s adoption over time  Figure 2 shows the variance \(R-square model by block comparison. This view of the results confirms the importance of industry exposure for 19951996 and later in 1999-2003. This figure also shows the significant input in the model from the sales variable, at its two higher points, in 1996 and 1998 The presence of these results is in line with the fact that, during these years, the large firms in the automotive sector where very active in the implementation of new systems, as they prepared themselves for Y2K Overall, the results suggest that business partners were an important source of influence during the decision-making process of adoption and the continuity of adoption of an enterprise system before 2000. As the number of adopters increased, the influence from the industry became strong enough to sustain the diffusion of the technology, and, eventually, to become an industry standard. The results of this research show a partial contribution of both types of exposure at the different phases in the diffusion process  7. Conclusion  As the results suggest, proposition P1 is partially accepted for the dominant technology only, namely SAP. As Figure 5 shows, network exposure to SAP is almost always highly significant over the period studied. On the other hand, Oracle was not able to maintain a good score For the second proposition \(P2 industry exposure to enterprise system adopters positively influences the probability of adoption of the innovation for both technologies. Influence was 


innovation for both technologies. Influence was observed for both technologies, even though it could not reach the same level of importance as with SAP network exposure The third \(P3 since the results show that the strength of network exposure appears to vary along the adoption cycle, but its presence is more important at the earlier stages The fourth proposition \(P4 by the strength of exposure and appears to vary along the adoption cycle, mostly contributing at the end of the period studied These results suggest a mix of influences from both exposures \(direct and indirect Valente?s demonstration of threshold and critical mass enterprise system adoption is very well rooted in the network diffusion of innovation. The contribution of network exposure and industry exposure differs based on the time in the product life cycle and the category of firms looking to acquire a system. As the results show network exposure was more important at the earlier stage, and then resurfaces at the later stage One limitation of this investigation is the low number of firms included. Having a small population reduces the power over statistics. Conversely, having a larger population would have been impossible with the means used to collect data and do the analysis within an adequate timeframe. Consequently, this model cannot predict the adoption of a particular technology Instead it predicts the adoption \(or not 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 R sq ua re Network exposure Industry Exposure Sales Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 Having a small number of observations regarding adoption is part of the limitation of this study  8.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
