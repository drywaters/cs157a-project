INTRODUCTION  Recently many of the potential WSN applications such as target tracking, process control and source localization have fostered the development of Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks \(WMSNs of image data gathered by camera nodes in WMSNs is very large. They need to be compressed before transmission. JPEG2000 [1] is the state-of-the-art image compression standard which has many attractive features. However, it hardware implementation is of high computational complexity and needs much memory To satisfy the low-power and high image quality requirements of WMSNs, the paper studies the lowpower JPEG2000 realization on DSP-based camera node. The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II introduces JPEG2000 Coding flow. A highquality and low-complexity fast algorithm for Discrete Wavelet Transform \(DWT Then an improved EBC algorithm suited for DSP parallel implementation is proposed in section IV Section V gives the experiment and simulation results We conclude the paper in section VI  II.

JPEG2000 coding flow  The availability of DSP endows camera nodes in WSNs with adequate processing power and memory size for image compression. The VelociTI architecture of the  C6000 platform of devices make it a reality to use advanced VLIW to achieve high performance through increased instruction-level parall-elism [2]. At the same time, the camera nodes are limited in energy memory and computational power. Because CDF9/7 and EBC processes are both of high computational complexity, the hardware realization of JPEG2000 is high energy-consuming. Therefore, JPEG2000 needs to be improved when using it on DSP-based camera nodes  III.  FAST ALGORITHM FOR DWT  The existing fixed-point CDF9/7 implementation methods [3][4] can solve the problem of computation 2009 International Conference on Networks Security, Wireless Communications and Trusted  Computing 978-0-7695-3610-1/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE DOI 10.1109/NSWCTC.2009.205 300 complexity and storage. However, the quality of reconstructed image is degraded because the approximation degrees to the coefficients are not the best. To solve this problem, we use the fixed-point implementation method of LS9/7, which adopts the post-scaling method, to improve the performance of JPEG2000 The comparison of the CDF9/7 and the LS9/7 lifting coefficients is shown in table 1. The lifting coefficients of CDF9/7 are a group of irrational numbers. The former four coefficients of LS9/7 are rational numbers Therefore, the LS9/7 is simpler for hardware implementation than the CDF9/7  Table 1. Comparison of the CDF9/7 and the LS9/7 lifting coefficients CDF9/7 LS9/7 1.586134342 -3/2 0.052980118 -1/16 0.882911075 4/5 0.443506852 15/32 1.149604399 5/24   A. Shift-add operation of? , ? and  The LS9/7 lifting coefficients ? , ?  and ? can be transformed to the addition or subtraction of two integral power of 2, as shown below 10 225.1 4216/1 51 2232/15 For the hardware implementation, multiplying a number X by the coefficients ? , ?  and ? can be implemented by shift-add operation. For example, the multiplication of X  and ? can be operated by shift and add as   gt;&gt;?&gt;&gt;= XXX  B. Shift-multiply operation of  


 The optimal approximation to the LS9/7 lifting coefficient ? by shift-add operation is        75.022 75.021 5/4 21 2  The error is 0.5. If we want to eliminate the error more shift-add operations should be done. It will impose a significant extra computational burden. In order to solve the conflict of approximation dgree and computation consumption, we use shift-multiply operation to realize the approximation to The optimal shift-multiply operation methods and the approximation errors are shown in table 2. It can be seen that when shift operation is 4, the approximation error produced by the shift-multiply operation is the quarter of the error produced by the shift-add operation When shift operation is 16, the approximation error can be ignored  Table 2.

Shift-multiply operation of ?  based on the postscaling method  The LS9/7 lifting coefficient ?  is an irrational number. The direct fixed-point implementation method will result in a large approximation error. Therefore we use a group of zoom factors instead of ?  based on the post-scaling method [5]. In the ordinary lifting approach of DWT, the analysis consists of 4 lifting steps and 2 zoom steps. If we use the post-scaling method, the analysis can only consist of lifting steps Zoom steps will be done in the subbands after the analysis. The zoom factors used in each subband are different. For a L -level DWT, the zoom factors [ ]S i 0 3 1i L S[0]=1/?2 ?S[1]=1 ;S[2]=1?S[3]= ?2 for\(i=4?i&lt;=3  L?i+=3

They can be calculated by the shift-multiply operation which is shown in table 3  Table 3.

IMPROVED EBC FRAMEWORK  Embedded Block Coding \(EBC the most computationally intensive part which comprises more than 50% of the computational complexity of JPEG2000 [6]. The existing framework is shown in figure 2\(a in the framework and the many conditional operations in the program, DSP software pipeline can not be established. To solve this problem, we propose an improved EBC framework for parallel execution as shown in figure 2\(b  Code-block coding passes scanning arithmetic coding Bit plane scanning Stripe scanning Column scanning Coefficients scanning a b Code-block coding Passes scanning MQ coder Column scanning SC  Figure 2.

Comparison of the existing framework of MQ coder and the modified one  All the \(CX/D performing the three coding passes on the bit plane should be stored before putting them in the AC. The memory requirement in DSP can be calculated as 64*64*15 60C Kbyte where 64*64  is the sample size of the code-block, 15 is the bit plane number of the code-block  B. Bit-plane scanning unrolling  For the purpose to establish the DSP pipeline, the bit plane scanning is unrolled into column-based scanning pattern, as shown in figure 4 Stripe 1 Stripe 16   Figure 4. Column-based scanning pattern  C. Sign coding separation  After unrolling, the DSP pipeline still can not be established because the sign coding \(SC Significance Propagation Pass \(SPP CP  If  SIG:0 1 SC  code  where SIG is the significant state, SC\(code program for SC It is obvious that the SC is only called when the bit becomes significant. It means that each sample in the code-block needed to be SC once. Therefore, we can separate the SC from the scanning process and do it before scanning. The \(CX/D SC are stored in the memory. Then the process is simplified 302 


If  SIG:0 1 Read   The DSP pipeline of the scanning implementation can be established  V.  EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  Firstly, digital hardware for 4-level DWT has been implemented on an TI TMS320C6416T device clocked at 600M. A 1024  1024 remote sensing image with 8 bits per pixel is used Table 4 gives the computation complexity compareson. We can see that the proposed method results in the smallest and fastest hardware. Compared with the two fixed-point implementation methods of CDF9/7, the computation complexity of the proposed method has been decreased by 34% and 28.3  Table 4.

 By the optimizations, the DSP software pipeline of the EBC algorithm can be established. Table 5 shows the performance improvement by using the proposed EBC framework. The execution time of the proposed method is eight-time faster the original one  VI.  CONCLUSIONS  To satisfy the low-power and high image quality requirements of WMSNs, the paper studies the lowpower JPEG2000 realization on DSP-based camera node. Fixed-point LS9/7 wavelet is used instead of CDF9/7 wavelet to decrease the complexity of computation. EBC is improved for high efficient DSP parallel processing. Experiments results show that the improved JPEG2000 leads to a great reduction in implementation time, and hence saves energy consump-tion of camera nodes   ACKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported by the National Science Foundation of PR China \(Grant No. 60872151   REFERENCES  1] Rabbani M, Joshi R  An Overview of the JPEG2000 Still Image Compression Standard  Signal Processing: Image Communication 2002\(17  2] TMS320C64x Technical Overview, Texas Instruments, 2001  3] G.G.

Hence, each approximation space, even at the lowest resolution will contain functions that have at least one nondierentiable ?corner?. This may not be desirable Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 especially if the points of interest in the original signal happen to fall on these corners at every resolution \(for example, at the midpoint of the data set basis \(i.e., has no corners A scaling vector was developed by the author in 6] that has approximation order 4, and generates a space that contains the spline space S13\(Z is, the space of piecewise cubic polynomials that are both continuous and dierentiable at the integer knots.

Pattern Matching The premise behind using wavelets for pattern matching is that the wavelet decomposition for the pattern for which you are searching and for the pattern added to data sampled from a polynomial of degree less than the approximation order of your scaling vector will be equal. For example, the wavelet decompositions for both data sets shown in Figure 16 will be identical when using either of the bases discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. It is necessary that the pattern not be in the lowest-resolution approximation space, so that it will not have a wavelet decomposition with only 0 coecients. This problem is rare, but if it occurs, it is remedied by either continuing the decomposition to an even lowerresolution space, or by using a dierent scaling vector of lower approximation order In most cases, the pattern will not be overlaid upon perfectly polynomial data, and so, the wavelet decompositions will not match exactly. However, if the pattern is prominent enough in the signal so that the root mean square error \(UPVH new decomposition {gl} when compared to the decomposition {gl } of the original pattern, as dened Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 by UPVH vuuuut QX l=1 gl  gl Q 


is suciently small, then the pattern will still be detected Figure 16: Pattern data \(top data obscured by cubic polynomial data bottom When using a single scaling function and wavelet are used in applications, each successively smoother approximation of the data stretches the support of the basis functions, eectively drawing more data from outside the region where the pattern actually occurs. By using the scaling vectors and multiwavelets mentioned in Section 2, we are able to analyze data on a bounded region, and ignore data outside of that region 3.1 When to Use Wavelets Wavelet decompositions can be used to nd patterns in any type of data, but there are no advantages to using them for exact pattern matching. For example, if searching for the word ?the? in a text le or in packet data, we have to search for the exact ASCII values 116, 104, and 101 in succession Changing those values, even by a constant amount changes the word. Also, to apply the wavelet bases mentioned in Section 2, we need 2q + 1 data values for some integer q A 1 for the DGM and the approximation-order-4 basis, and 2q+2 data values for some integer q A 1 for the basis in Section 2.3 so we would have to pad the target pattern with spaces. This type of search can be conducted much more eciently using other search methods, such as Bloom lters, etc However, for quantitative data like packet trac dependent upon time, multiwavelets have the potential to spot patterns that are not immediately noticable to the human eye, such as in the bottom graph of Figure 16. The following section gives an example of how multiwavelets can be used to detect a ?low and slow? pattern caused by data exltration 3.2 Trac Analysis Example Suppose that we have a corrupted computer and we are aware through previous experience that this particular piece of malevolent code tends to sneak? data out under the ?TCP? protocol in the following pattern a single packet of size 256 bytes, followed approximately 1 second later by another packet of size 512 bytes one second later, four packets of size 256 bytes are sent with a quarter second gap between 


the packets, and one quarter-second later, three packets of size 512 bytes are sent, followed one-quarter second later by one packet of size 256 bytes The accumulated bytes sent with respect to time in seconds are shown in Figure 17 Total Bytes Seconds Figure 17: Accumulated bytes for the example pattern The packets described above have been inserted into a set of network trac packet collected from the author?s laptop over roughly 4 minutes of usage starting at w = 240 seconds. The total accumulated outgoing bytes are illustrated in Figure 18. To apply the basis looking for this specic pattern, we Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 accumulate the bytes on quarter-second intervals and generate a wavelet decomposition for a sliding 4-second window, which is compared to the original pattern?s decomposition with the UPVH. The UPVH for the dierent starting times are shown in Figure 19. Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time Total Bytes Seconds Figure 18: Accumulated outgoing bytes of a sample usage period plus the packets in our pattern UPVH Seconds Figure 19: UPVH values \(less than 50 blocks of data with digerent starting times Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time In fairness, this method of nding patterns has many of the same weaknesses found in other signature-matching approaches. The pattern has to be known ahead of time, which means that this detection scheme would still be vulnerable to rst-time attacks. Also, a completely innocuous data ow occurring with very similiar timing and quantities as our pattern will still cause a low UPVH value, possibly causing a false-positive alert. We do claim 


however, that we have a greater capacity for nding patterns in quantiable amounts that are obscured by standard network trac. Also, we can adjust the sensitivity of the search without changing the signature for which we are searching, by adjusting the threshold of the UPVH?s for which an alert is issued. Thus, statistical techniques and adaptive learning can be used to help develop optimal threshold levels for a particular pattern 4. Conclusion Wavelet analysis holds an as-of-yet untapped potential for analyzing usage patterns in network trac ows, due to their ability to lter out data up to a given approximation order. Neither simple character searches nor Fourier analysis has this capability. Also, while Fourier analysis generally gives only frequency information within an analysis window, wavelet analysis gives some amount of both frequency information and the location of that frequency activity. The additional information comes at no additional computational costs, since the bases are generally applied by convolving matrix lters over the data \(repeated matrix multiplication over sliding blocks of data tiwavelet bases introduced in this document should prove to be particularly useful in pattern-matching applications, due to their short support \(that is, non-zero only over a small interval the inclusion of splines in the approximation spaces instead of just polynomials, and the ability to use them on time series with left and right boundaries The author is currently working with computer scientists at the CyberDefense Lab \(CDL at Western Kentucky University to develop software that will utilize these bases in network security, intrusion-detection, and data-extrusion applications. Once developed, we will study the eectiveness of this type of analysis in detecting malicious behavior as compared to the more commonly used techniques, with the hope of improving detection capabilities while maintaining a low false-positive rate. The software will initially be tested in the CDL?s sandbox while running attacks from its attack library with various background usage scripts being implemented, but will eventually move to less controlled network environments Acknowledments: This work supported in part by the NACMAST consortium under contract

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
