We argue that a firm?s decision to choose and adopt an enterprise system is influenced by its network peers both by direct and indirect network exposure.  Our results suggest that network exposure and industry exposure differ based on the time and the category of firms looking to acquire a system.  Network exposure seems to be more important at the earlier stage, and then resurfaces at the later stage of enterprise system life cycle  1. Introduction  Enterprise systems are comprehensive packaged software solutions that replace functional legacy systems and enable companies to integrate their complete range of business processes and functions [1 These applications have the capability to facilitate process integration by allowing firms and organizations to tap into so-called best practices. Research suggests that firms that adopt enterprise systems show higher performance metrics and gain an edge over nonadopters [2-3]. Although the implementation is both difficult and costly, adopters tend, for instance, to generate more revenue per unit of input, as they manage inventories and accounts receivable more aggressively [4 Over the last decade, value chains have been streamlined through the use of enterprise systems [5 Pressure from several sources, ranging from the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States to operational cost reduction [5], has encouraged enterprises to migrate to consolidated systems. The intensive adoption of enterprise systems is supported by a survey that suggests that the current level of adoption of such applications in Fortune 500 companies is around 80 6]. Yet, this penetration appears to vary from one industrial sector to another. For instance, among the Fortune 500 companies, SAP dominates the chemical and high-tech sectors with 100% market penetration but has only 40% in retail [7 Previous studies have shown that the adoption of enterprise systems is driven by the relative advantages of the system over the previous situation [8]. Among other things, the main benefits of enterprise systems 


other things, the main benefits of enterprise systems are related to the integration of different business functions and supply chain partners, the best practices embedded in the software and the possibility of adopting the system in modules [8-10]. Yet, certain winner takes all? phenomena suggest that some kind of network effect exists in the adoption of these systems [11, 12]. This brings us to investigate why firms in the same industry are inclined to adopt the same software application In this paper, we argue that a firm?s decision to choose and adopt an enterprise system is influenced by its network peers. For instance, Webster [13] provides evidence that Ford pressured its vendors to adopt a technology compatible with its own, if they wanted to continue their business relationship This remainder of this paper is structured as follows. We first review the main drivers of enterprise system adoption. The third section describes the classical adoption models before turning to the literature on diffusion of innovations in networks. In the fourth section, we propose a research model based on Valente [14]. The fifth section presents the methodology used to collect the data for our longitudinal network design. In the sixth section, we present our results in details followed by a discussion of our findings. Finally, the conclusion presents the limitations on this research and makes suggestions for future research  2. Drivers of enterprise system adoption  Rogers [15] identified five adoption attributes that have an effect on the rate of adoption, namely, the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00  2009 IEEE relative advantage, compatibility, complexity trialability and observability.  However, this model focusses only on the system itself and not on network externalities. Taken together, these drivers can lead to high network externalities. For instance, Gallaugher &amp Wang [16] showed that the application of Rogers theory and the recognition of network externalities were useful when trying to identify the effect of pricing on web servers. Many other researchers have relied on the same body of literature to support their hypotheses 17-19]. Externalities represent utility that a user derives from consumption of the good, which increases with the number of other agents consuming the good 20-21]. In these models, the value comes from the system itself and from network externalities  Relative advantage. Relative advantage is crucial to an innovation?s being perceived as a better choice than its predecessor. We can relate this attribute to perceived usefulness, as set out in the Technology acceptance model \(TAM  Enterprise systems provide many direct and indirect benefits to adopting organizations [10, 22-27]: the integration of processes across functions and divisions the package of applications, the modularity of these systems, and the best practices embedded in them  Compatibility. Compatibility highlights the need to be consistent with existing values, past experiences, and the needs of potential adopters [28]. Transposed to enterprise systems, the easier it is for the system to fit in with existing systems and available processes, the more likely the potential adopter is to adopt the enterprise system. The use of best practices is one enabler of compatibility [8, 29]. Another basis of 


enabler of compatibility [8, 29]. Another basis of compatibility is the integration among business partners throughout a supply chain. This openness enables economies of scale and quicker responses to market trends [13].  Enterprise systems rely on economies of scale and lead to network externalities, as any other consumer product would [19-20]. Being able to benefit from the experience of the best firms on the market, gives an advantage to firms that embrace them The more firms adopt these processes, the more compatible partners, in terms of processes, are available  Complexity. Complexity is the degree to which an innovation is perceived as relatively difficult to understand and use [28]. Enterprise system implementations are complex and adverse results can impact the financial health of the whole enterprise [30 One element that contributes to reducing uncertainty and complexity is the availability of knowledgeable employees involved in the implementation of an enterprise system [8]. The enterprise system market offers resources to adopters, which add value to a given system. The more resources are available, the smaller the chance of encountering a shortage of developers and consultants. As every enterprise wants a smooth implementation, and later a seamless maintenance period, it may tend to favour a solution that offers a broad community of qualified resources which leads to network externalities  Triability. Rogers [15] referred to ?trialability? as the ability to try an innovation before you adopt it However, being able to try these systems before buying them is nearly impossible. To be able to make the right choice, a firm must understand the acquisition process including its needs and what the future system can offer. Furthermore, the potential purchaser has to observe what has been done in their own sector and others, to get a better sense of whether the system could fulfil their requirements or not [31-32  Observability. For Rogers [28], observability is the degree to which the results of an innovation are visible to others. Observability of enterprise systems requires a number of successful implementations large enough to give the buying firm confidence that a given system is the best suited for its needs. In other words, the more a system can be observed, the more potential customers it will retain, which suggests that observability leads to network externalities  2.1 Enterprise systems and network externalities  Network externalities can be classified into two relationship categories: direct and indirect [20]. In other words, the firm adopting a package solution can gain direct benefits from using the same package as its partners for data exchange. The firm can also gain indirect benefits from the fact that the best players in its sector also use that system, encouraging the system?s vendor to embed their own best practices into the system, and from the probability that that system will stay around longer, since important players have chosen it.  For instance, in the late 1990s, one vendor SAP, succeeded in building a concentration of adopters in particular industries, with an average adoption rate of 73% [7  3. Enterprise system diffusion in networks 


networks  In the next section, we summarize the classical models that serve as paradigms in the evolution of the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 theory of diffusion of innovations. The following section introduces the concept of diffusion in a network context  3.1 Classical models  Rogers [15] first introduced the diffusion effect as the cumulative increasing degree of influence upon an individual to adopt or reject an innovation, resulting from the activation of peer networks related to an innovation in a social system. This model uses three dimensions to study the diffusion process: social system, communication and time. Once an innovation is recognized as such, it follows a series of steps until it overthrows the current industry standard: knowledge persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. The persuasion stage plays an important role in the diffusion of innovation and will be discussed later Rogers [15] showed with an S-curve model that an innovation followed a pattern starting slowly, followed by a fast growing adoption to finish at a slow pace of market penetration, as new technologies emerge. The diffusion of innovation theory, also known as the ?bellshaped? framework, introduced a new dimension which was the innovativeness. Rogers [15] defined the innovativeness as the speed an innovation is being adopted in a social system, in comparison with other members of that social system.  The adopters in this framework are categorized using five categories: \(1 innovators, \(2 3 4 late majority, and \(5 The Bass model is one of the most popular quantitative models from the body of knowledge on diffusion of innovations [33]. Bass assumes that potential adopters of an innovation are influenced by two means of communication: mass media and word of mouth; and that there are two categories of adopters imitators? and ?innovators.? The basic premise is that part of the adoption influence depends on imitation or learning? and part does not [34]. In this model innovators are described as individuals who decide to adopt an innovation independently of the decisions of other individuals in a social system, whereas, imitators are influenced in the timing of adoption by the decisions of other members of the social system The diffusion of innovations model shows some weakness when trying to measure external sources of influence on technology adoption. In his review of 18 years of empirical studies, Fichman [35] concluded that one of the major limitations on classical diffusion studies is the implicit assumption that individuals are adopting innovations for their own independent use rather than being part of a larger community of interdependent users. As another limitation, Light and Papazafeiropoulou [8] agreed with Rogers that not all innovations are the same and there are some elements of the innovation itself that the potential users will perceive as important \(or not adopt or reject the innovation. Kling and Iacono [36 criticize the overtly rational account of technological diffusion for ignoring the contribution of other actors in the process of promoting computerization  3.2 Network diffusion of innovations  


 Early research on network diffusion of innovations has identified social networks as an important factor to consider [37]. The use of sociometry [38] is useful in understanding how an innovation flows within the community and how certain network structural variables influence the diffusion process [14]. Two variables are used when using sociometric techniques threshold and critical mass. The notion of threshold represents the proportion of individual adoptions in a group needed for an innovation to be considered for adoption by other adopters [14]. Critical mass is the minimum number of individuals needed to spread the innovation to the rest of the social system [14]. Once that number of actors have adopted, a sufficient number of actors in the network are exposed to adopters that many individual thresholds are reached and a chain reaction of adoptions occurs [38 As the classical model of diffusion seems to be limited for products that has network externalities 8,35-36], we rely on network diffusion of innovations to explain the mechanism of propagation and the influences on the decision process leading to the adoption of an industry?s standard. This point of view is part of a more general shift toward a more relational contextual and systemic understanding [39  3.3 Network analysis approach  The concept of network is rooted in graph theory 39]. A network is the pattern of relationships, ideas decisions or support that exists among members of a social system [14] while network analysis is used to analyze the pattern of interpersonal communication in a social system by determining who talks to whom 14]. Two approaches exist to study how relationships influence the diffusion of innovations through the members of a given network, namely, the relational and the structural approach. The relational approach considers the focal actor?s adoption in light of the behaviour of those to which it is directly connected Thus, for a given actor, direct contact with an influential leader might greatly influence its choice of system [14, 40]. Structural network models acknowledge that the overall structure of the network Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 as well as a given actor?s position in it, influence that actor?s behaviour and subsequent performance. For example, a given actor may adopt an innovation because of its prior adoption by a highly central and visible actor, even though the two actors may have no direct contact with each other [41  4. The proposed model  This research uses an extended version of Valente?s model [42] that takes into account both the direct and indirect network externalities of enterprise system adoption. His model can be explained in terms of three main concepts: sociodemographic variables, personal network exposure and the infection Sociodemographic variables may relate to sex, age education or any information that can differentiate actors from one another [14]. Personal exposure is defined by Valente [14] as ?the degree an individual is exposed to an innovation through his or her personal network.? The decision to adopt is often influenced by other actors but especially by how many of them are connected to the subject [14]. This phenomenon is called connectedness. Connectedness measures how much the subject is exposed to an innovation through 


its network In many of his studies, Valente used the concept of personal network exposure? as part of the equation to model adoption decisions [14]. In this paper, the equivalent concept is network exposure. Network exposure is a fashionable term for organizational forms characterized by repeated direct exchanges among firms that rely on trusted social and economic relationship to share exclusive information due to the nature of their business. This mutual trust has often a profit motive, but more importantly, aims to reduce costs by better coordination among all supply chain partners [39 Sociodemographic variables in a corporate context are represented by the firm?s own characteristics. In this paper, the selected variable is the firm?s annual revenue. The point is to differentiate subjects by using sales as a size variable Two types of network effects or externalities \(direct and indirect corresponding types of network exposure [43]. In the context of enterprise system, exposure means the proportion of companies in the network that have already adopted a given system or may be in a position to provide information as a convincing argument to make a given individual adopt [14 The research model used \(1 on the premise that firms are part of a complex web of interconnected business ties that directly or indirectly connect the firm to their partners [43]. That model is corroborated by Valente?s approach of network diffusion of innovation, which was inspired by Rogers?s work. Using the same definitions as above we have   1   2  3  where ? is the social network matrix, ?ij is the set of companies linked to company i, and ?ij indicates whether companies i and j are in the same industry sector The direct relationship ties are assessed by the network exposure \(2 community are represented by the industry exposure 3 in a business relationship with a particular company that has already adopted an enterprise system. As for indirect exposure to the network, the definition is simply the exposure of a company to all the enterprises in its industry sector that have already adopted a system  Network Exposure. For the adoption of innovation to spread, the decision of the company needs to be communicated among the members of an industrial network or a group of business partners. These links between members can be represented by a director on multiple boards, a supply-chain relationship, a research and development project, being part of a corporate holding or participation in some kind of industrial group.  As mentioned by Davis [44], a firm that has on its board a director who is also on another board can be greatly influenced to make a decision to adopt the innovation. As adopting an enterprise system is a strategic decision, the board of directors would be interested in receiving information and may tend to imitate other company board decisions due to high 


imitate other company board decisions due to high costs, high risks and the many aspects to consider. In a similar manner, supply chain offers the possibility of closer relationships between suppliers and customers as firms need to coordinate their supply chain [45]. Aiken and Hage [46] also argue that firms that are pushed into joint activities in research and development, do it because they need resources, including money, skills and manpower. This conduit posits that two or more companies share resources on a project for developing a product or an idea together. Being interdependent in that project, they tend to communicate more with each other.  According to Westphal [47], external conProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 formity pressure from a parent company may also influence subsidiaries to adopt or reject a technology Teo et al. [48] observed that technology vendors should target the parent corporation and its subsidiaries simultaneously, because they are likely to adopt at the same time in order to maintain a pattern of consistent and compatible relationships. Finally, professional and trade associations can also influence adoption of an innovation [49]. Being part of a professional association provides the opportunity to make contact among members of a given industry. It can lead to more serious business relationships later If these channels of information exchange are as important as stated by these different studies, being in a relationship with a firm that has already adopted the innovation should bring in benefits. This leads to the following proposition  P1: Network exposure to enterprise system adopters positively influences the probability of adoption of the innovation  Indirect network exposure. In social science, this concept has received major attention by many authors 15, 42, 50]. When a sufficient number of individuals adopt the innovation, interpersonal networks become activated and spread subjective evaluations on this innovation. At that point, diffusion accelerates like an uncontrolled infectious epidemic, and is often impossible to stop [15]. This group of actors constitute the critical mass required to reach the threshold point from where the innovation will take off and spread all over the social system For a system to become standard practice, firms that adopted must generate benefits from using the innovation. Network externalities are a utility that a company gains from adopting a given system [20 Markus [51] suggests that technologies, like information systems, are strongly subjected to network externalities. If critical mass is achieved, the innovation is likely to be universally adopted, and later becomes an industry standard; if not, it will be dropped In this paper, we use the industry exposure as the means to assess this indirect effect. Unlike network exposure, nodes do not need to be tied directly to each other. The fact that nodes are in the same industrial sector is sufficient for those nodes to be exposed to an innovation, and thus be influenced to adopt the same system as the others Network externalities and industry exposure are two interdependent sources of influence on adoption Enterprise systems are a type of innovation showing great benefits derived from network externalities. The more firms adopt a given system, the more the other firms in the industry will gain benefits from implementing the same system. Whether it is for the 


implementing the same system. Whether it is for the best practices embedded [10] or the large number of qualified resources in that system available on the market [24], every time a new firm adopts that system the benefits to already have adopted or potentially adopt that system increase As stated earlier, Rogers [15] describes ?early adopters? as being well informed and respected because they espouse the innovation presumably after a judicious decision-making process. They are always on the lookout to achieve a revolutionary enhancement of performance by adopting a new technology \(high riskhigh reward influential companies in their industry Members of the ?early majority? have a large informal network. They are not looking for a revolutionary breakthrough, but more for an evolutionary path. They prefer to move when their group moves as a herd of sheep would do. When someone from the herd picks a vendor, they all pick the same The ?late majority? members are more sceptical about technology, and ask for a bullet-proof solution at the lowest price. When they feel they do not have the choice anymore, they eventually adopt the technology just to stay even with the competition The ?laggards? do not believe that technology can give them a competitive edge over their competitors and thus prefer the status quo. They may only adopt a technology in an isolated situation, when they do not have the choice or when they are forced to. Based on these findings, we make this next proposition  P2: Industry exposure to enterprise system adopters positively influences the probability of adoption of the innovation  Exposure versus diffusion stages. Reaching the critical mass is more likely to be achieved when high centrality individuals are early adopters. On the contrary, this is less likely to occur if these central actors are late adopters or if low centrality actors adopt early. Since central actors can positively influence the transmission of information as transmission ?hubs?, it is easier for them to diffuse the information rapidly to their partners. According to Valente [14], a group is large enough to sustain the adoption decision of a given system that occurs early in the diffusion process when about 10% to 20% of the population has adopted that system, as the industry will then pay close attention to this innovation. This is when the innovation ends up on conference agenda or in success stories through different media Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 We argue that this may be explained by the fact that both network and industry exposure may contribute to the adoption process at different times in the innovation life cycle. Network exposure requires direct contact between partners in order for the information to flow. As Rogers [15] argues, information about an innovation flows through contacts at the early stage of its life cycle. Once the innovation has been adopted by a sufficient number of users, the industry ?followers adopt the innovation en masse as the perceived risk is lower. These observations lead to the last two propositions  P3: Network exposure influence will be stronger in the earlier stages of the diffusion process P4: Industry exposure influence will be stronger in the later stages of the diffusion process 


later stages of the diffusion process  5. Methodology  To test the propositions made, we used the social network analysis approach, as several authors have applied in the past [42]. DeNooy e al. [38] define social network analysis? as a method to detect and interpret the patterns in a social network. It studies a network of entities, paired based on the varied nature and the dynamic effect they have on each other Social influence can be tested using the network analysis method only if the period covered by data collection is long enough to see the effect of the network on the adoption [14]. Consequently, we opted for a longitudinal data collection; we collected data on nodes \(who how what and time of adoption \(when to 2004 for the fifty-four \(54 the North-American automotive industry. The choice of this time interval was motivated by the fact that the decision to adopt an enterprise system can often take many years [30]. The North-American automotive sector was a strategic choice because of the large amount of data available for all conduits. To collect the necessary data, two sources were mainly used, for the accuracy of their data or for the volume of potential evidence. The first source was the Securities and Exchange Commission \(SEC repository \(EDGAR public firms under study for the time interval of interest. The second source is PR Newswire, available through Thomson-Dialog. This source was mainly used to find evidence of ties between the firms selected. We used the API provided by Thomson to automate the data extraction process. This data source was also used to find evidence of system adoption  Who? The automotive sector was chosen for its maturity and its business network structure. Given the maturity of firms and the domination by the same companies for decades, data collection was made easier since all these companies have been public from many years. The list of companies was constructed by first identifying the nine 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification \(SIC industry sub-sectors. From all the companies in these sectors, only the fifty \(50 revenues were kept, for each year of the data collection, for a total of fifty-four \(54 of interest.  The Standard &amp; Poor's Compustat database was used to retrieve the name of the firms and their revenues  How? The classification of ties required five rounds of sampling and reading press releases, extracted from PR Newswire, following a meticulous method called inter-rater reliability? [52]. After each of the five rounds, readers compared their work, and any discrepancies in the definition of the relationship type were resolved immediately by strengthening the definition or the readers? perception of the definition The major trends were then identified and press releases classified under the new categories. The final categories chosen were the supply chain, research and development \(R&amp;D Interlocking data were collected in a previous study 52]. Originally, the data set was collected from various sources of information: the 10-K or DEF 14A forms available in EDGAR, equivalent information from SEDAR, the data repository of the Canadian Securities Administrators, and the ?Directory of 


Securities Administrators, and the ?Directory of Directors? from the Financial Post. In a few cases, it was impossible to retrieve the information, as the companies were not public  What? The data set on the adoption of enterprise system was collected and analyzed in a previous study 52]. The collection was originally created by consulting the CI Technology online database, made available by Harte-Hank. This database contains information about 750,000 firms worldwide. We restricted the list of vendors to SAP, Oracle and Peoplesoft. These vendors alone had a total share of 61.37% on the automotive market [53  When? To be able to pinpoint the missing data about the choice of the system, and, more importantly, when it was adopted, PR Newswire was again consulted Queries were launch using a yearly matrix with all companies versus all vendors. Major Internet search engines and the vendor?s official Web site has been called upon to fill the gap. After a post-validation by Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 systems? vendors, 32 of the 50 firms from the previous study were identified as having adopted at least one system from these vendors [52 After collecting the data about the conduits of information, entries were filtered by year of release The second step was to produce a matrix of all companies over the period of time from 1995 to 2004 according to the method used by Valente [14]. The matrices indicate whether a link exists \(1 0 However, the list of companies changes every year This is mainly due to mergers and acquisitions, for example, Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler AG decided to merge in 1998 [54]. Even though the entities prior to the merger/acquisition were not active in the subsequent years, they were kept for analysis purposes only. Furthermore, a new node representing the new entity was created. If one of the merged companies was doing business with a given supplier, the link in the matrix between them was kept active until the merge Later, if evidence showed that the relationship continued with the acquiring company, the relationship was established with the new company?s line in the matrix. This exercise was repeated for all technologies selected for this research. When more than one system had been adopted, only the first acquisition was kept on record SPSS 14.0 was used for both descriptive statistics and logistic regression. Logistic regression seemed to be a good choice for data analysis since our dependent variable is binary. Moreover, the fact that logistic regression focuses on the marginal contribution of the independent variable regarding the probability of adoption, it showed more benefits compared with linear regression [55  6. Results and discussion  The network population is composed of the top fifty-four \(54 and 2004. Two mergers occurred during this interval Daimler Benz AG merged with Chrysler Corp to become DaimlerChrysler AG in 1998, and Arvin Industries merged with Meritor Automotive in 2000 The technology PeopleSoft is excluded from this discussion as its exposure variable was never significant over the period studied The same data as in [52] were used in this study with regards to adoption \(what and when 


study, it was shown that SAP technology was a dominant technology across the industry between 1997 and 2005 Figure 1 presents the adopter frequency for each year, from 1995 to 2004. As can be seen, it does not follow a normal distribution as we would expect [15 We observe a slow rate of adoption at the earlier adoption stage, followed by mass adoption in 19981999, representing the majority of firms that felt the pressure to be compliant with the Y2K bug [56-57 After the Y2K hype, the market for enterprise system was soured [58]. This would explain the lack of investment in the population investigated in this study in the 2000-2001 interval [58]. It was not until 2002 that IT investments experienced a slight increase, and then in 2003, when a more substantial contribution was made [59]. Based on this evidence, we redefined the adopter categories to account for the Y2K problem. In the interval under study, we identified four adopter categories \(Table 1 1 2 Rush/Early Majority, \(3 4 collaboration   Figure 1.

Enterprise system annual adoption 1995-2004 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 computed in blocks, with the company being compared with different sources of influence Considering the small number of observations and the exploratory nature of this study, the adoption over time tends to reproduce the context of adoption every year. This approach was designed in a way to predict or re-predict whether adoption would occur year after year, depending on the properties of the nodes However, we do not consider the decision of adoption year after year as being a realistic model, since adopters will not think about the decision of adoption every year. This fact is a limitation in the analysis. We took great care in analyzing data accordingly The standardized betas of SAP network exposure were significant at p &lt; 0.05 for the whole period, with the exception of 1995, 2001 and 2002. For the year 2001, it was significant at p &lt; 0.10. Standardized betas for Oracle network exposure were only significant twice at p &lt; 0.10 \(1996 and 1998 industry exposure, SAP shows significance for the whole period, except for 1995 and 1998.

In turn, sales were significant at only three times during the period studied. The significance levels were p &lt; 0.05 only for 1996, and p &lt; 0.10 for 1995 and 1998   Figure 2. Variance evolution of the enterprise system?s adoption over time  Figure 2 shows the variance \(R-square model by block comparison. This view of the results confirms the importance of industry exposure for 19951996 and later in 1999-2003. This figure also shows the significant input in the model from the sales variable, at its two higher points, in 1996 and 1998 The presence of these results is in line with the fact that, during these years, the large firms in the automotive sector where very active in the implementation of new systems, as they prepared themselves for Y2K Overall, the results suggest that business partners were an important source of influence during the decision-making process of adoption and the continuity of adoption of an enterprise system before 2000. As the number of adopters increased, the influence from the industry became strong enough to sustain the diffusion of the technology, and, eventually, to become an industry standard. The results of this research show a partial contribution of both types of exposure at the different phases in the diffusion process  7. Conclusion  As the results suggest, proposition P1 is partially accepted for the dominant technology only, namely SAP. As Figure 5 shows, network exposure to SAP is almost always highly significant over the period studied. On the other hand, Oracle was not able to maintain a good score For the second proposition \(P2 industry exposure to enterprise system adopters positively influences the probability of adoption of the innovation for both technologies. Influence was 


innovation for both technologies. Influence was observed for both technologies, even though it could not reach the same level of importance as with SAP network exposure The third \(P3 since the results show that the strength of network exposure appears to vary along the adoption cycle, but its presence is more important at the earlier stages The fourth proposition \(P4 by the strength of exposure and appears to vary along the adoption cycle, mostly contributing at the end of the period studied These results suggest a mix of influences from both exposures \(direct and indirect Valente?s demonstration of threshold and critical mass enterprise system adoption is very well rooted in the network diffusion of innovation. The contribution of network exposure and industry exposure differs based on the time in the product life cycle and the category of firms looking to acquire a system. As the results show network exposure was more important at the earlier stage, and then resurfaces at the later stage One limitation of this investigation is the low number of firms included. Having a small population reduces the power over statistics. Conversely, having a larger population would have been impossible with the means used to collect data and do the analysis within an adequate timeframe. Consequently, this model cannot predict the adoption of a particular technology Instead it predicts the adoption \(or not 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 R sq ua re Network exposure Industry Exposure Sales Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 Having a small number of observations regarding adoption is part of the limitation of this study  8.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
