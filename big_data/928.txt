The availability of ground-based 4D trajectories leads to new possibilities allowing early conflict detection and efficient conflict avoidance. Nevertheless efficient conflict detection becomes a big challenge when dealing with large amounts of detailed trajectories in a global environment This paper proposes a new representation of 4D trajectories facilitating a high performance conflict detection algorithm. The proposed algorithm subdivides the initial envelope of all trajectories in smaller 4D tiles until each tile contains only one trajectory. If that is not possible before reaching a predefined minimum tile size, a conflict is detected Since the algorithm  s runtime is only marginally influenced by the scenario  s complexity, this technique is particularly efficient for large scale scenarios Introduction In order to meet the anticipated future demand for air travel both SESAR and NextGen propose trajectory based operations as one of the key elements [1, 2]. Instead of clearance based control, an aircraft is supposed to follow negotiated 4D trajectories \(latitude, longitude, altitude and time The 4D trajectory is the basis for planning and executing all flight operations. Being able to predict highly precise trajectories for a large amount of aircraft types, a long term planning promises various advantages like gain in capacity, efficiency and environmental sustainability Nevertheless, long term planning puts new demands on assuring conflict freeness of all participating trajectories. Even more, following today  s trend of globalizing the world  s air transport and increasing the planning horizon new technologies are necessary to deal with the new situation This paper proposes a new method of handling large amounts of 4D trajectories that allows very efficient conflict detection even for large scale scenarios Earlier papers already described the process of subdividing airspace to allow efficient conflict detection and avoidance. Koeners described an approach on how to subdivide airspace in three dimensions \(latitude, longitude and time effort in conflict solution [3]. Since the subdivision is static his solution is only reasonable for limited areas e.g., the terminal maneuvering area of an airport The basic idea of the algorithm proposed in this paper is to limit conflict detection runs on closely located trajectories regarding 2D distance, altitude separation and time of day Therefore, the convex envelope containing all trajectories is divided into 4D tiles. The division is done using a tree structure. The root node of this tree represents a 4D tile containing all trajectories, e.g the whole world with all altitudes up to 100,000 feet for an entire day. The tree is extended only if two trajectories are member of the same tile. Since every division is done in all four dimensions, a node may 


division is done in all four dimensions, a node may have up to 16 children. More basic trees are shown in Figure 1. The binary tree is used for 1D-, the quad tree for 2D- and the octree for 3D-subdivision Consequently, having a 4D context, subdivision can be carried out using a hexadecimal tree. This tree structure is not in common use but proves to be an adequate way for partitioning 4D airspace. Since some readers might not be used to exercise recursive subdivisions of 4D spaces this paper provides extensive diagrams and explanations of the basic techniques  3.B.5-2  gt Binary Tree Quad Tree Octree Undivided 1st division 2nd division  Figure 1. Overview of Common Tree Data Structures The subdivision process is carried out until the constraints of separation meet the minimal tile size Assuming the global world being the root tile, a typical depth of the tree is around 15 Starting point for the described algorithm is an empty root node with specified dimensions. This root node is the only element that can be accessed from the outside. Due to the 4 dimensions, the geometric shape of every tile is a 4D-hypercube, also named tesseract \(Figure 2 a tesseract  Figure 2. 2D-Visualization of a Tesseract  Figure 3. 16 Subdivisions of a Tesseract The two basic methods for changing the tree are to add and to delete trajectories Filling the Tree Adding a trajectory to the tree does not necessarily change the structure. A tile is subdivided only if it contains more than one trajectory. Thus registration of a flight from southern to northern America in a so far empty root node would not extend the tree. Adding a second inner-Australian flight would generate all children of the root tile influenced by the two trajectories. Since none of the sub-tiles is influenced by more than one aircraft, the tree is conflict free again. See Figure 4 for an example of how the tree may look like Root Tile: The World X in [-180., 180.], Y in [-90., 90 Z in [0, 100000], T in [0, 86400 Lower North-America, morning X in [-180., 0], Y in [0, 90 Z in [0, 50000], T in [0, 43200 Lower North-America, afternoon X in [-180., 0], Y in [0, 90 Z in [0, 50000], T in [43200, 86400 Lower South-America, morning X in [-180., 0], Y in [-90, 0 Z in [0, 50000], T in [0, 43200 Lower Australia, morning X in [0.,180.], Y in [-90, 0 Z in [50000, 0], T in [0, 43200 12 unaffected tiles  Figure 4. A Typical Tree with Depth 1 3.B.5-3 A third afternoon flight within North-America 


A third afternoon flight within North-America below 50,000ft would necessitate further subdivision\(s a 2D-view of the generated tiles. The area containing both trajectory one and trajectory three might be conflict free due to altitude or time based separation and has to be subdivided otherwise 1 Traj 1 Traj 2 Traj 3  Figure 5. 2D-World View The smallest tile possible matches the separation minima. Table 1 shows typical values for minimum separations. Be aware that all separations have to be assured at the same time. The lateral position x/y and the time are dependant. Two aircraft are separated if  they have a lateral separation of at least 5NM at the same time or  they are passing the same x/y-position with a time based separation of e.g., at least 90 seconds The proposed algorithm uses the first theory in order to keep the tree small. Therefore, a time separation of 5s at maximum is used to model the term  at the same time  The error of approximation leads to a minor increase of potential conflicts Column five of Table 1 gives an idea for the maximum depth of the tree. The minimum altitude separation is already reached after 7 divisions; thus the altitude interval is constant starting with a depth of 7. A time interval of 5s is reached after 14 divisions. Having a high resolution in one dimension while being less detailed with other dimensions widens the tree earlier than necessary and produces too many nodes Table 1.

The 


for all dimensions within the same step. The balancing can be performed automatically after tree initialization. The intervals are extended on one side only to avoid additional tiles. Being extended, only 3.B.5-4 the original part of the interval might contain flights Table 2 shows the balanced intervals Table 2.

The latitude conversion can easily be performed by the equivalence of an arc minute and a nautical mile. The longitude conversion needs to be adapted to the fact that the meridians are narrowing when getting closer to the poles Affected Tiles  the Subdivision Process When a tile contains more than one trajectory the subdivision process has to be carried out. Each of the 16 possible children of the tile affected by at least one of the trajectories is generated Figure 6 shows that not only the penetrated tiles are affected but also tiles that are below separation distance from the trajectory. On the other hand, a tile could be affected by more than one trajectory without the chance of having a conflict \(Figure 7 keep the tree small the center tile should not be subdivided  Figure 6. Conflict between Tiles  Figure 7. Affected by Two, but No Conflict The algorithm has to distinguish between real penetrations \(fly through fly by fly through aircraft and any others. Thus, the subdivision process is executed only if  The Tile is affected by at least two trajectories and  At least one of the trajectories is a fly through Potential Conflicts Since the conflict detection is carried out by storing the trajectory in the tree, no explicit conflict detection is necessary with each surrounding trajectory. A real conflict may only occur within the lowest separation-sized leaf. Therefore, the complexity of the scenario has only minor influence on the algorithm  s runtime When reaching a leaf of the tree \(i.e. a tile sized with the separation minima than one trajectory, a potential conflict is detected Since the subdivision process is executed independently for latitude and longitude using the Manhattan metrics as distance, the situation of two aircraft penetrating the same leaf does not necessarily result in a conflict \(Figure 8 3.B.5-5  Figure 8. No Conflict for Two Aircraft in Same 


Figure 8. No Conflict for Two Aircraft in Same Tile Therefore, a final conflict check is necessary to approve the existence of the conflict. Assuming an orthogonal coordinate system the final conflict check should check if NMyx 522 Assuming the often used World Geodetic System 84 \(WGS84 earth the check could be performed using Vincenty  s formulae [4 The List of Conflicts All detected conflicts are stored in the root tile for easy access. The stored information contains  Identifier aircraft 1  Identifier aircraft 2  Begin and End of conflict \(time  Closest point of approach  Most often, conflicts exceed tile boundaries Thus, the same conflict is detected in multiple tiles Figure 9 implemented algorithm determines the start and end time of the conflict. Thus, the detected conflict can easily be compared to already registered conflicts to avoid duplicates. Based on begin and end time complete 4D position can be calculated using the trajectory information start end  Figure 9. Start and End of Conflict The closest point of approach is the midpoint of both aircraft positions at the moment when both aircraft are nearest to each other. The closest point of approach is handled as the reference point of the conflict If conflicts are only essential for a subset of aircraft these aircraft can be specified to even improve the algorithm  s performance. In this case the algorithm works on some selected aircraft of interest and the surrounding traffic. Only conflicts containing at least one selected aircraft are detected conflicts within the surrounding traffic are not recognized. The pre-selection of aircraft also leads to a significantly reduced memory usage because tiles are subdivided only if the tile is affected by a selected aircraft Figure 10 shows a conflict between 2 aircraft with the surrounding tiles   3.B.5-6 Figure 10. Detected Conflict with Surrounding Tiles A Large Scale Example First simulations with large scenarios and the above mentioned setup proved a high performance of the algorithm. Input for the simulations was one day of traffic above Germany with more than 10,000 aircraft \(Figure 11 improvements provided from the described algorithm, the simulations were also performed with standard conflict detection procedures  Figure 11. Trajectories of Traffic Sample 3.B.5-7 The first version of the standard conflict detection algorithm simply compares new trajectories with already known trajectories and stores the new trajectory as a known one.

The speed-up factor \(about 15 significant. The converging appearance of the graph does not mean that there is a maximum of 4.5 seconds which will never be exceeded. Instead, this behavior is reasoned by the time-based sorting of the input data and by the fact that there are only few aircraft in the air near midnight on the right side of the graph 0 1 2 3 4 5 0  2000  4000  6000  8000  10000 A ve ra ge T im e pe r T ra je ct or y s  Number of Trajectories Figure 13.

Tile Distribution on Levels As mentioned above, further significant increase in speed can be achieved by subdividing all aircraft in aircraft of interest and surrounding traffic. This might be useful if responsibility for conflict freeness is distributed to different sites so that one site is responsible for a subset of all aircraft. Thus, conflicts within the surrounding traffic are supposed to be unimportant Figure 18 shows how the overall conflict detection time decreases when specifying a subset of aircraft. Selecting 50 aircraft of interest, the detection time drops from 15 minutes to 30 seconds. Since the calculation time depends on which aircraft are selected, the graph just gives an impression of the dimension and is not monotonically increasing 5 10 15 20 25 30 0  10  20  30  40  50 C on fli

Selected Aircraft of Interest 3.B.5-9 Working On the Tree The proposed algorithm does not only speedup the initial conflict detection but provides fast operations for further investigations. The biggest challenge arising after conflict detection is most often conflict resolution. The usual ways of rerouting an aircraft are  lateral conflict resolution, e.g., turning 20 degree clockwise  vertical conflict resolution, e.g descending  time/speed-based conflict resolution e.g., reducing speed All these deconflicting methods have in common that the real outcome is hard to predict Due to  mass inertia of the aircraft  performance limitations of the aircraft  interdependencies between e.g., vertical profile and speed simple models are often not accurate enough to represent the real behavior properly. On the other hand, more accurate flight management system algorithms reproducing real aircraft  s behavior in more detail are often too complex to generate validated conflict solutions in an analytical way Furthermore, solving one conflict might produce other conflicts because the conflict solution will penetrate new 4D-airspaces. Thus, a try-and-error approach is often used for conflict solution Providing conflict detection times of less than 100ms and deletion times of around 1ms, potential conflict solutions can be validated with high frequency even for large scenarios The very efficient deletion method also advises to use the tiling algorithm as a twenty-four-seven process. Explicit deletion of data being older than a specified time and addition of new trajectories to the tree would lead to a representation of the actual and future conflict situation. The tree size remains all about the same Further Application Fields Further application fields are numerous Thanks to the generic architecture, trajectories may have a large variety of time horizons from longterm gate-to-gate planning to short term conflict 


term gate-to-gate planning to short term conflict detection \(STCD detection is generally not based on trajectories STCD can be achieved by feeding the current aircraft  s 4D-position and the position in e.g., 2 minutes calculated from the 4D-speed-vector as two-points-trajectory into the algorithm. Fast change times allow high update frequencies and reliable conflict detection Currently, the only supported object is a 4Dtrajectory. Implementation of new objects like 4Dfaces and -hulls would allow a large number of new applications, e.g  Conflicts with restricted areas  Conflicts with weather data \(e.g thunderstorms  Ground proximity warning  Signals when entering new airspaces country borders   When integrating new geometries, the only question that needs to be answered is if a tile is affected by the geometry. Thus, implementation of 4D-faces and -hulls is rather simple Conclusion This paper proposes a highly efficient algorithm for conflict detection of 4D-trajectories Compared to standard conflict detection algorithms the advanced tiling algorithm increases the detection speed for huge scenarios with 10k aircraft by a factor of 50. The algorithm runs dynamically on every kind of scenario from local airport traffic to the global airspace foreseen by SESAR and NextGen, from short term conflict detection to the global gate-to-gate scenario. The performance of new computers counteracts the memory usage of the algorithm. One day of Germany  s air traffic fits in a standard off-the-shelf personal computer today Further efforts will be made to extend the supported geometries. That will allow putting further information into the proposed algorithm incorporating restricted areas, weather situation and maybe even ground elevation and allow the tiling algorithm to have the real global view 3.B.5-10 References 1] SESAR Joint Undertaking, 2008, SESAR Brochure: Today  s partners for Tomorrow  s aviation http://www.sesarju.eu/gallery/content/public/doc/S ESAR_Bochure.pdf 2] Federal Aviation Administration, 2009 Implementation Plan http://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/nextgen/media NGIP_0130.pdf 3] Koeners, J., M. de Vries, Conflict Resolution Support for Air Traffic Control based on Solution Spaces: Design and Implementation, Oct 2008, 27th Digital Avionics Systems Conference, St. Paul, MN 4] Vincenty, T., 1975, Direct and Inverse Solutions of Geodesics on the Ellipsoid with application of nested equations, Survey Review XXII\(176 93  28th Digital Avionics Systems Conference October 25, 2009  pre></body></html 


crafts documents focusing on her immediate work practices and with minimal contextual clues. Karen?s note card on Anna \(see Figure 4 basic information Karen?s needs to administer Anna?s care. For instance, the card lists Anna?s record number and weight ? all central when Karen fills out a new flow sheet or check if Anna?s medication dose is appropriate. The rest of the note card constitutes a simple itinerary of activities Figure 3. Nurse?s management plan Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 Karen does not need to specify these activities in any more detail. With seven year tenure on the ward she knows the nurses? work rhythm by heart. There is no need to specify Anna?s medical history, nor the times she requires oxygen or nebulizer treatments Karen relies on a non-verbal understanding and simply uses her notes as a scaffold to support her unfolding practices. The doctors use their brain notes in a similar fashion. Referring to his brain notes an ER intern explains No one else is going to understand what this means. This is very specific to what I do. Most people just jot notes to themselves -- you know: '5 year old, nasal foreign body, 10 days out of 21 days thick discharge, yellow green, treat with XYZ contact primary.' There is no time line in it; there is no thought process. I know what this means because I am here. But no one else will be able to make sense of it Anna Hauge #846 R8 2 Mos 5.6 kg Bronch obstructions O2 nebs Q2 No surgery consult today Social: mother today  Figure 4. Karen?s brain notes As indicated by the intern these private notes only work for their author. By the end of a shift the intern will update the resident note and add clues which will orient his fellow interns. Still these remain rather vague and rely heavily on the interns shared knowledge of the patients and the rhythm of work on the ward. In Karen?s case, she adds context clues as she edits the management plan. To motivate changes to Anna?s diet or personal needs she may add to the concise history? field of the management plan. She will only add changes that she deems important to her close community of nurses at 10 East. She writes when the surgery team meeting is scheduled, but she will only summarize her meeting with Anna?s mother if information relevant to the nurses? comes to light Towards the end of Anna?s hospitalization the same process takes place. The resident note system largely consists of a list of patient identifiers and activities. In the process of writing Anna?s discharge summary Marc strips away these local coordination tools and adds contextual information by positioning Anna?s care on 10 East as the culmination of a narrative starting with her past medical, family history, and diagnosis upon arrival in the hospital The rest of the discharge summary reviews what is considered relevant organ groups for Anna?s case or rather relevant sub-specialties involved in her care while at 10 East. In the process of writing the discharge summary Marc adds genre clues broadly accepted in the medical community, involving formatting, and terminology. Senior residents and attending doctors often scold interns for using acronyms and lingo specific to Kiltham Hospital in 


acronyms and lingo specific to Kiltham Hospital in their discharge summaries. Marc is literally making Anna?s history public and portable by turning the resident note list into a narrative with full sentences and specification of authorship. The document cycle is completed Documents oscillate between broader &amp narrower explication Participants Times Places Content Format Background knowledge Explicit Documents Br oa de r N ar ro we r N ar ro we r Br oa de r  Figure 5. Document cycles and their oscillations As summarized in Figure 5, we can depict the two document cycles as a continuous oscillation between a broader and narrower framing of Anna?s care. The daily cycles \(small cycles cycle covering Anna?s stay at 10 East. These oscillations involve changes to how broadly and narrowly the documents explicate participants, times places, and content. The cyclical integration mitigates the tension between a documents power to explicate its use and the background knowledge people bring to the document. The two triangles in Figure 5 signify the inverse relationship between documents and users. In the top of the cycle we find documents broadly explicating the relevant participants, times places, and content, thus facilitating understanding by people holding little background knowledge. As we move down in the cycle we see a shift towards documents leaning heavily on users? intimate knowledge of the work but which offers little guidance to the reader 4. 4 Dialog at Beginning &amp; End of Cycles At the beginning and end of each document cycle one finds interactions involving oral communication The dialogs engage the participants in reflections about their patient?s past and future care and stand out as central to the oscillation taking place within each cycle. Doctors and nurses place great emphasis on these meetings. When two interns were asked Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 what time of day they considered the most important they answered in unison: ?Sign-out.? Here, the doctors update their respective resident and senior notes. Each intern and senior resident will report on their patients to their on-call colleague, the doctor 


their patients to their on-call colleague, the doctor staying in the hospital over night. Their conversations focus on the patients that need the most attention during the night, difficult orders and other urgent tasks. It is a time to recount the work done in the course of the day and establish an itinerary for the night. Likewise, the other meetings engage the participants in dialog about individual cases and/or how to manage all patients under their collective care Tensions tend to escalate when a document cycle does not start or end with a reflective encounter Interns quarrel locally about the content of their resident notes during sign-out and attending doctors scold residents during rounds; but it is nothing compared to the anger doctors and nurses express when receiving a document from another setting countering their expectations and with no chance to clarify the problem Primary care doctors regularly complain that the discharge summaries that they receive from other health care settings lack information significant to them. One primary care doctor, Frida, with 18 years tenure grumbled one afternoon about a discharge summary, she had received that afternoon from a surgeon who had set her patient?s leg after a skiing accident a few days earlier. The teenager, Jacob showed up in her clinic with a swollen leg and a rash After examining Jacob, Frida explained to the ethnographer This is a crappy note [from the surgeon]. It?s no help to me. He [the surgeon] does not even tell me what antibiotic he gave Jacob [post operation] and how much. I have no way of telling whether the rash he presents with today is related to the antibiotics Frida calls the surgeon?s office to clarify the issue. The surgeon has left his clinic at 3:00pm. His discharge summary does not provide her enough information to help her diagnose the problem. A flow sheet filled out during the surgery most likely contains the information Frida needs. However, in the discharge papers the surgeon summarized his setting of the leg but does not describe the administration of antibiotic post surgery ? that to him is probably an inconsequential routine Dialog and reflective encounters play a central role in each document cycle. The dialog allows a heterogeneous groups of healthcare professionals with different responsibilities and routines to mend the relationship between the background knowledge people bring to Anna?s care and the degree to which documents explicate relevant participants, times places, content, and form. Such discussions also allow doctors and nurses to question patients? history and their care. By engaging with patients? histories people with different perspectives on care can suggest changes to the configuration of participants times, places and data relevant for the patient Document cycles lacking routine reflective encounters often leave little chance for the different constituencies to clarify their position and repair the relations between documents and their users 5. Discussion More than ten years ago Star and Ruhdeler [1 112] called for a practice-based approach to organizational infrastructure and knowledge flows one that does not depict system integration as a substrate: something upon which something else runs or operates \(e.g., railway system doctors and nurses integrate documents, whether electronic or paper-based, in the course of their daily work allows us to extend such an approach to system 


work allows us to extend such an approach to system integration We find that doctors and nurses continuously transform documents making them relevant to a particular set of participants, times and places. In doing so they adjust the relationship between how much documents explicate and the background knowledge required from the readers. Two such transformations stand out as central First, doctors and nurses engage in a number of cyclical transformations, within which they oscillate between documents addressing a broader and narrower audiences \(see figure 1 and 2 they manage to straddle the demands of local work practices and the needs to coordinate with other teams in other times and places Second, as summarized in figures 1 and 2 one finds a number of transformations between the cyclical organized documents \(e.g., nurse management plans, brain notes, intern notes, senior notes, etc e.g., lab work, flow sheets, orders, etc nurses use their document cycles as the clearing station for a host of document systems. The cyclical organized documents allow people to transform data from peripheral documents into something useful for their immediate work practices. At the same time they draw from their cyclical documents to produce other non-cyclical documents. For instance, Marc and other doctors integrate test results from the laboratory Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 system into their brain notes and later the residence note system. Likewise, they write orders and other request information based on their brain notes The existing literature allows us to capture only parts of these cyclical transformations. Latour and Woolgar [12] and Knorr-Cetina [22] work describes the individual transformations well. The concept of communicative genres [6] offers insights to the individual documents and how they might be linked into sequentially organized genre systems. Likewise we could conceive of the documents in the present case as boundary objects bridging the relations among different communities [3 The cyclical patterns reported here, however present an opportunity to integrate these related practice-based research streams. The concept of communicative genres, for instance, supplements descriptions of document transformation in document cycles. Furthermore, the findings suggest the existence of multiple document types playing different roles in knowledge flows. Boundary objects may not stand alone in knowledge sharing across communities. Rather, they seem to interact with a host of other documents. For instance, one could argue that lab results serve as a boundary object for many groups caring for Anne. As a repository each group can draw from and contribute to the lab result system. Yet, this boundary object does not stand alone. Only when we see the lab result system in relation to the use of nurse management plans, brain notes, intern notes and senior notes do we understand the intricate knowledge flow. The boundary object is but on cog in a larger document machinery Reflection and dialog play central parts in the cyclical integration of documents. Confirming findings in the boundary object literature, conflicts are prone to surface when people from different professions, sub-specialties, or local organizational cultures negotiate their often diverging approaches to patient care [3, 4, 32].  Reflective encounters allow 


patient care [3, 4, 32].  Reflective encounters allow collaborators to recalibrate the reciprocal relationship between documents and organizational members \(i.e document explicates and background knowledge the same time these interactions serve as a staging ground for questions that may broaden or narrow the collective work practices. Doctors and nurses may question whether they need more information about the patient?s medical history or consider alternative treatment plans. The meetings secure an ongoing reflection on the appropriate course of Anna?s care Much like a hermeneutic process, doctors and nurses engage with parts of patients? care ? only to return to a broader picture to interpret the integration of its parts. The movement of their understanding and writing, then, is a constant moving from the whole to its parts and back to the whole [9, 33 Finally, the document cycles offers a window into the institutional structure of the hospital and the temporal and spatial organization of work. We notice how the cycles support departmental divisions and the temporal structure of work in the institution Without these document cycles it would be impossible to maintain the high level of complexity where multiple professions and subdisciplines work together, with somebody present to knowledgably care for Anna 6. Conclusion &amp; Implications The study identifies a cyclical pattern to the knowledge flow in a heterogeneous information systems environment. Drawing on data from the healthcare industry we describe how doctors and nurses organize a host of document systems around a central cyclical pattern involving an oscillation between addressing a broader and narrower configuration of participants, times, places, and content. Numerous documents feed to and from the cyclically organized documents. The constant transformation from one document to the next allows organizational members to manage the reciprocal relationship between how much documents explicate their use and how much background knowledge readers need to bring to the document. This relationship is brittle and despite the many transformations among documents it often breaks down. The research suggests that organizational members build opportunities for dialog into the document cycles in an effort to patch any possible breaks in knowledge sharing The present research is not without limits. It relies on a single in-depth ethnographic study, thereby subjecting it to a set of well-known limitations, most notably restricted empirical generalizability. Despite the limitations, the research has implications for research and practice. First, to fully take advantage of our cyclical notion of documents and integrate the existing practice-based theories require more theoretical and empirical work. For instance, what cyclical patterns do we find beyond the healthcare industry? Second, future research will have to explore how efforts to standardize medical information and facilitate retrieval can coexist with cyclical documenting practices In regard to practice, system design may gain from supporting a host of document types and allow people to transform one document into another document characterized by different configurations of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10 participants, times, places, content, and form. Across documents the content may be deceivingly alike. Yet one must keep in mind that each document manages 


an intricate reciprocal relationship between how much the document explicate and the background knowledge people bring to its use Finally, system designers may distinguish circular integration of documents and documents feeding to and from the cycles. People use their central cycles to manage many other document systems. The cycle allows people to transform data from peripheral documents into something useful for their immediate work practices 7.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
