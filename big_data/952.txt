INTRODUCTION W IRELESS Mesh Networks \(WMNs  network in places where wired network's deployment is not available or costly, and serve as broadband wireless access to the internet 1 In our paper, we classify mesh network into bi-Ievel infrastructure as showed in Fig. 1. The backbone-level includes Mesh Routers \(MRs GWs less devices \(laptop, PDA, Smart Phone communicate with MRs or even can directly communicate with others \(in ad-hoc mode routing thanks to unlimited energy and higher capacity to reduce routing delay, while client-level uses reactive routing to reduce overhead of periodically exchange routing information messages The efficiency of multi-path routing for communication is proved by many existing literatures and now becoming hot research topic that aims to assist IEEE standard for WMNs. However, after carefully survey the most up-to-date Internet Fig. 1. Hi-level Mesh Architecture proposals, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work considering the balance between the numbers of multipaths can be used and the needed transmission data in each communication session with the consideration of packet's loss rate. For wireless communication, this balancing is very critical to reduce routing overhead and transmission time that can directly improve throughput and routing reliability. The reminder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II briefly reviews current routing techniques, especially focus on multipath routing with single or multiple radios. The main part with adjustable path balancing for data transmission is proposed in section III. We show that our proposal using new scheme to drive routing protocol works more efficiently by simulation analysis in section IV. Finally, section V, some conclusions are discussed 


are discussed II. RELATED WORK The main goal of any routing protocol is to support effective communication. To reach this goal, many researches have proposed different routing protocols for wireless network as well as for specific wireless mesh network. Each routing protocol bases on routing metrics which are designed to achieve different targets. For example, some routing metrics capture the stability of a path, some concern about bandwidth of a path, and some focus on energy consumption. For WMNs recently, researchers have proposed some link quality metrics such as 'Per-hop Packet Pair Delay" \(PktPair  noise-ratio" \(SNR  ETX 6], "Per-hop Round Trip Time" \(RTT  Link 3 m Fig. 2.

Let s\(k packet will be successfully delivered from x to y after k - th attempts The expected number of transmissions required to successfully deliver a packet from x to y is denoted by ETX. It is also can be considered as a representative of loss rate \(the more probability of packet loss, the more retransmission attempts 00 1 ETX == Lk.s\(k 3 k=l 1 - P Eq. \(3 the metric from x to y is the same as the metric from y to x The ETX is used for further calculation of time's threshold T a critical parameter to decide how many disjoint paths can b used for a data transmission session between two end nodes To do that, we execute "Multi-path Finding Algorithm" in [13 to find m disjoint paths, and calculate the link speed of each path candidate. We use the same approach in [14] to evaluate the available bandwidth in each node. Here, the Maximum Unused Bandwidth \(MUB MUBi == Ci - Llij \(4 j with Vj E neighborhood of i. Ci is the maximum bandwidth or the capacity of the Node i, and lij denotes the traffic flow from Node i to neighbor Node j in bits/second. lij contains traffic generated at the Node i and transit traffic through that node. From Eq. \(4 MAB as MABi == MUBi - L L Ijk \(5 jENi kENj In the next step, we sort path candidates by link's speed "'Ii with l == {h, l2' l3' ...lm} candidate links found in the previous step as illustrated in Fig. 2.

TORA in [6] supports multi-path routing by using Directed Acyclic Graph \(DAG disjoint paths. Also, DSR [7] can not avoid using the same intermediate nodes for multiple routing. The Split Multipath Routing \(SMR   an extension to AODV 


AODV not dropped, but this is at the cost or more RREQs. AOMDV 10] is also an extension to AODV for computing multiple loop-free and link-disjoint paths which uses the notion of advertised hop count" to guarantee loop-freedom and uses a particular property of flooding to achieve link-disjoint routes Richard Draves et ale in [5] proved that ETX [11] performs very well with single radio multi-path, but in case of multiple radios, it dose not work well due to the following reason in [11], the authors implemented their routing protocol using TestBed with single 802.11b wireless card. However, in case of multiple radios, it does not work well. For example, in the scenario with an 802.11a and an 802.11b radio per node ETX will route most of the traffic on the 802.11blinks In the scenario with two 802.11 b radios per node, ETX is again likely to select sub-optimal paths since ETX will not give any preference to channel-diverse paths. Therefore it will not derive full benefit from the availability of two radios From those claims, [5] proposed new routing metric \(WCETT working with multiple radios, multi-channel protocol However, [5] did not utilize the efficiency of channel scheduling even though the cost of hardware upgrade for multiple radios is high. With an effort to improve performance of single radio multi-channel WMNs, we propose a novel routing protocol which takes into account the balancing between the amounts of data needed to transfer and the number of disjoint path serving simultaneously that has never mentioned before Using the same channel scheduling policy in [12], by dividing time into slot, we coordinate channel usage to avoid collision and utilize multi-path transmission at the same time. Our new routing scheme is combined with our previous work in [13 to find multiple node-disjoint paths and limit the number of path's candidates adaptable with the demand of the amount of data and variable follow the loss rate. The number of disjoint path which is used increases when the data size is big or the loss rate is high, that is the way the routing scheme reacts in on-demand manner III. BALANCING MULTI-PATH FOR DATA TRANSMISSION Our work inherits the probabilistic model in [11]. Let PI and Pr denote the probability of packet loss in forward and reverse directions respectively. The expected number of transmissions including retransmissions, is calculated base on PI and Pr. The probability P that the packet transmission from x to y is not successful can be formulated as 1 7 8 TABLE I PSEUDO CODE FOR APS Begin With the found m-disjoint paths Calculate flEm = min{M ABiEl Sort fl E m follow the reduction of link speed Calculate total speed fE, needed time T, threshold r If T 2:: T use both m-disjoint paths Else  for I = 1, I ::; m, I T' = ETX m M T' = T while I = m 2:fi l=l Compare and break while T' ::; T Use I disjoint paths end  End Suppose, the amount of data needs to be sent from source to destination is M \(bytes transmission when taking into account the loss rate is M M 


M M T == ETX -- == ETX -f'"'ll '"'IE l=l If the amount of data is big enough or the loss rate represented by ETX is high, we can use all found m disjoint paths to utilize the total speed of all links. But in reality the probability that the data size is small and ETX is usually greater but approximately equal 1 is very high, so we should use only fewer paths out of the m found paths for data transmission. To solve this problem, we define a time threshold 7 to determine how many paths can be used on-demand of data size and adjustable following the packet's loss rate M 3 7 == 3---rn-- == ETX T == {3T \(9 L'"'Il l=l Eq. \(9 communication, to reuse the frequency, the minimum spatial reuse distance is 3 hops. This key weakness causes the average bandwidth capacity divided by three, so that the transmission time also increases triple times. And for ideally the transmission is successful without loss \(ETX=1 value of 7 as demonstrated. In common standard, packets will be retransmitted up to 7 times, so the value of {3 is in the range [3/7, 3]. Using Eq. \(9 very effective algorithm to calculate the needed disjoint paths named Adjustable Path Selection \(APS The value of T' is reduced by increasing the number of disjoint paths. From Eq. \(8 more paths need to be used to reduce the transmission time IV. SIMULATION ANALYSIS To evaluate the performance of proposed scheme, we have implemented a OMB module in the NS - 2 [15].

We schedule transmission time into slots as the model in [12]. By dividing time into slots, OMB also coordinates channel usage among slots and schedules traffic flows on multi-paths to avoid collisions, and utilizes multipath transmission at the same time. The channel scheduling in 12] works only with dual links while our channel scheduling can work with more than two links. We learn the affection of path length, distance \(V size in scheduling model to throughput and delay of OMB compare to Expected Transmission Count" \(ETX  Joint Multi-channel and Multi-path control \(JMM 12]. To show the key point improvement of our proposed scheme, we do simulate our OMB with 2 disjoint paths \(l == 2 and 3 disjoint paths \(l == 3 A. Impact of Path Length The network topology as showed in Fig. 4 with H == 200 meters and V == 300 meters is tested. We observe the endto-end throughput from source gateway to destination by verifying the different path lengths \(hop byte packets are transmitted from source to destination. The 


byte packets are transmitted from source to destination. The results are shown in Fig. 5a. The ETX throughput decrease dramatically as the number of hops increases. While OMB with dual paths \(l == 2 worse than MCMP \(two radios l == 3 scheduling two non-adjacent paths \(link 1 and link 3 in parallel while link 2 is idle and reversely, link 2 is active in the next time slot while link 1 and link 3 are idle, link 1 and link 3 do not interference each other B. Impact of Distance V Because the backbone nodes are equipped with single radio only, it is obvious that the distance between two adjacent links will affect the performance of data transmission. We adjust the distance from 100 meter to 700 meters to see the reaction of end-to-end throughput. As showed in the Fig. 5b both OMB \(l == 2 l == 3 when the distance V increases. After V reaches over the interference range \(500 meters increases sharply. Also, only OMB with triple links \(l == 3 performs better than MCMP, which does not be affected by distance V thanks to doubly-equipped radios   35 lt;r - - ~ - - ~ - - -&lt _. _  _.

[Online]. Available http://www.isLedu/nsnamlns/index.html V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have shown that the WMNs can achieve good performance and utilize scheduling availability with only one radio card by carefully design multi-path routing protocol with multi-channel capacity. When the packet loss rate is high or the amount of data is large, the number of disjoint paths also needs to be increased on-demand to reduce transmission time The proposed protocol especially works very well with bigger amount of data as well as bigger data packet size. Although the proposed protocol is affected by interference due to the chronically single interface problem, the experiment results show that OMB performs very well with triple disjoint links thanks for effective time scheduling D. Impact of Slot Size In time division method, slot size can influence the performance of routing protocol. If the length of slot size is too short, the channel switching overhead becomes considerable and degrades the system performance. In contrary, longer slot size may result in increased end-to-end delay as well as the buffer requirement at each node. To find the balance value we vary the slot size from 10 milliseconds to 35 milliseconds with packet size of 1024 bytes and 1536 bytes. In the Fig. 5e the results show that OMB \(I == 3 MCMP in both cases: 1024 bytes and 1536 bytes packet size The figure also shows that at slot size of 30 milliseconds, the OMB reaches the best aggregate throughput while this case 


OMB reaches the best aggregate throughput while this case happens in MCMP with 25 milliseconds slot ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the MKE under the ITRC support program supervised by the IITA" \(IITA-2008-\(C10900801-0002  Dr. CS Hong is corresponding author REFERENCES 1] I.

Impact of Data Size As discussed above, the proposed scheme works very well with the big data size needed to transmit in a communication session. First, we send a 100 Mbytes data with the incensement of distance V as the same previous model. Next, we increase the data size to 500 Mbytes and compare with the transmission time of the first case. Even though the shapes of line in Fig 5c and Fig. 5d are almost same, we can easily figure out that the needed time to transfer 500 Mbytes data is considerable larger than five times of one of 100 Mbytes. This evaluation proves that our declaration is reasonable pre></body></html

Hence, each approximation space, even at the lowest resolution will contain functions that have at least one nondierentiable ?corner?. This may not be desirable Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 especially if the points of interest in the original signal happen to fall on these corners at every resolution \(for example, at the midpoint of the data set basis \(i.e., has no corners A scaling vector was developed by the author in 6] that has approximation order 4, and generates a space that contains the spline space S13\(Z is, the space of piecewise cubic polynomials that are both continuous and dierentiable at the integer knots.

Pattern Matching The premise behind using wavelets for pattern matching is that the wavelet decomposition for the pattern for which you are searching and for the pattern added to data sampled from a polynomial of degree less than the approximation order of your scaling vector will be equal. For example, the wavelet decompositions for both data sets shown in Figure 16 will be identical when using either of the bases discussed in Sections 2.2 and 2.3. It is necessary that the pattern not be in the lowest-resolution approximation space, so that it will not have a wavelet decomposition with only 0 coecients. This problem is rare, but if it occurs, it is remedied by either continuing the decomposition to an even lowerresolution space, or by using a dierent scaling vector of lower approximation order In most cases, the pattern will not be overlaid upon perfectly polynomial data, and so, the wavelet decompositions will not match exactly. However, if the pattern is prominent enough in the signal so that the root mean square error \(UPVH new decomposition {gl} when compared to the decomposition {gl } of the original pattern, as dened Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 by UPVH vuuuut QX l=1 gl  gl Q 


is suciently small, then the pattern will still be detected Figure 16: Pattern data \(top data obscured by cubic polynomial data bottom When using a single scaling function and wavelet are used in applications, each successively smoother approximation of the data stretches the support of the basis functions, eectively drawing more data from outside the region where the pattern actually occurs. By using the scaling vectors and multiwavelets mentioned in Section 2, we are able to analyze data on a bounded region, and ignore data outside of that region 3.1 When to Use Wavelets Wavelet decompositions can be used to nd patterns in any type of data, but there are no advantages to using them for exact pattern matching. For example, if searching for the word ?the? in a text le or in packet data, we have to search for the exact ASCII values 116, 104, and 101 in succession Changing those values, even by a constant amount changes the word. Also, to apply the wavelet bases mentioned in Section 2, we need 2q + 1 data values for some integer q A 1 for the DGM and the approximation-order-4 basis, and 2q+2 data values for some integer q A 1 for the basis in Section 2.3 so we would have to pad the target pattern with spaces. This type of search can be conducted much more eciently using other search methods, such as Bloom lters, etc However, for quantitative data like packet trac dependent upon time, multiwavelets have the potential to spot patterns that are not immediately noticable to the human eye, such as in the bottom graph of Figure 16. The following section gives an example of how multiwavelets can be used to detect a ?low and slow? pattern caused by data exltration 3.2 Trac Analysis Example Suppose that we have a corrupted computer and we are aware through previous experience that this particular piece of malevolent code tends to sneak? data out under the ?TCP? protocol in the following pattern a single packet of size 256 bytes, followed approximately 1 second later by another packet of size 512 bytes one second later, four packets of size 256 bytes are sent with a quarter second gap between 


the packets, and one quarter-second later, three packets of size 512 bytes are sent, followed one-quarter second later by one packet of size 256 bytes The accumulated bytes sent with respect to time in seconds are shown in Figure 17 Total Bytes Seconds Figure 17: Accumulated bytes for the example pattern The packets described above have been inserted into a set of network trac packet collected from the author?s laptop over roughly 4 minutes of usage starting at w = 240 seconds. The total accumulated outgoing bytes are illustrated in Figure 18. To apply the basis looking for this specic pattern, we Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 accumulate the bytes on quarter-second intervals and generate a wavelet decomposition for a sliding 4-second window, which is compared to the original pattern?s decomposition with the UPVH. The UPVH for the dierent starting times are shown in Figure 19. Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time Total Bytes Seconds Figure 18: Accumulated outgoing bytes of a sample usage period plus the packets in our pattern UPVH Seconds Figure 19: UPVH values \(less than 50 blocks of data with digerent starting times Note the low value of the UPVH at w = 240 seconds, indicating a close match to our target pattern at that time In fairness, this method of nding patterns has many of the same weaknesses found in other signature-matching approaches. The pattern has to be known ahead of time, which means that this detection scheme would still be vulnerable to rst-time attacks. Also, a completely innocuous data ow occurring with very similiar timing and quantities as our pattern will still cause a low UPVH value, possibly causing a false-positive alert. We do claim 


however, that we have a greater capacity for nding patterns in quantiable amounts that are obscured by standard network trac. Also, we can adjust the sensitivity of the search without changing the signature for which we are searching, by adjusting the threshold of the UPVH?s for which an alert is issued. Thus, statistical techniques and adaptive learning can be used to help develop optimal threshold levels for a particular pattern 4. Conclusion Wavelet analysis holds an as-of-yet untapped potential for analyzing usage patterns in network trac ows, due to their ability to lter out data up to a given approximation order. Neither simple character searches nor Fourier analysis has this capability. Also, while Fourier analysis generally gives only frequency information within an analysis window, wavelet analysis gives some amount of both frequency information and the location of that frequency activity. The additional information comes at no additional computational costs, since the bases are generally applied by convolving matrix lters over the data \(repeated matrix multiplication over sliding blocks of data tiwavelet bases introduced in this document should prove to be particularly useful in pattern-matching applications, due to their short support \(that is, non-zero only over a small interval the inclusion of splines in the approximation spaces instead of just polynomials, and the ability to use them on time series with left and right boundaries The author is currently working with computer scientists at the CyberDefense Lab \(CDL at Western Kentucky University to develop software that will utilize these bases in network security, intrusion-detection, and data-extrusion applications. Once developed, we will study the eectiveness of this type of analysis in detecting malicious behavior as compared to the more commonly used techniques, with the hope of improving detection capabilities while maintaining a low false-positive rate. The software will initially be tested in the CDL?s sandbox while running attacks from its attack library with various background usage scripts being implemented, but will eventually move to less controlled network environments Acknowledments: This work supported in part by the NACMAST consortium under contract

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
