Mining Frequent Patterns in Data Stream over Sliding Windows WU  Feng 1 WU Quanyuan 1 ZHONG Yan 1 JIN Xin 2  1 School of Computer National University of Defense Technology,  Changsha China 2 Changsha Social Work College, Changsha China wfttyy_2000, mandy_zh82}@163.com  Abstract 227Frequent pattern mining in data stream is an important task. Under the time decay model, this paper presents a new algorithm SWFP for mining frequent patterns over sliding windows. The new definitions of the infrequent, critical and frequent patterns which reflect the actual statistical property of each pattern within the sliding windows, grasp the real substance of mining process and help to improve the mining quality essentially. The support decay mechanism is designed not only to 
differentiate the current and history transaction, but also to make the online pattern maintain operation easily and accurately The reasonable strategy for the pattern pruning periodically is used to make big cuts in the maintenance cost and the error controlled in a small bound. Theoretical analysis guarantees no false negatives of SWFP. Experimental evaluation over a number of synthetic data sets demonstrates the efficiency and scalability of our method Keywords-frequent pattern mining; sliding windows; time decay model; data stream I   I NTRODUCTION  Recently, frequent pattern mining in data stream has gradually become a research hotspot. The classical algorithms include LossyCounting 1 and FPstream 2 algorithm. The former can incrementally mine the frequent patterns online, but the storage complexity is too high. Adopting FP-Tree 
3 as its basic data structure, under the tilted time window model, the later  can store the pattern information for different data stream periods at various time granularity. In order to find the latest patterns, [4 p r o p o s ed th e M S W alg o r ith m u n d er th e sl id i n g  window model, which used the decay factor to weaken the impact of history data, however, the efficiency had yet to be strengthened In practical application, the evolvement characteristics of the latest data stream are of more importance. Therefore  this paper proposes a method of data stream frequent pattern mining over sliding windows: SWFP. Innovative points include: 1\ew frame for frequent pattern mining essentially explains the connotation of the infrequent, critical and frequent pattern within sliding windows, guarantees no false negatives with the strategy, and fundamentally improves the mining quality; 2\ a support decay mechanism prunes the overdue pattern 
information \(according to the size of the current sliding window, the occurrence time of each pattern can be divided into two parts, i.e. active and overdue information which are within and outside the current window respectively; the overdue pattern is the part that only contains overdue information.\ by eliminating its effect using the decay factor instead of pruning it factually, which helps to enhance the operability and efficiency of our algorithm; 3\ a reasonable pattern periodical pruning strategy effectively prunes infrequent pattern and overdue pattern which are useless to the final mining result, and greatly reduces the time and space complexity of the algorithm. Theoretically analyses the effectiveness of SWFP. Several experiments on synthetic  data set confirm the high efficiency and scalability of our algorithm II  P RELIMINARIES  Data stream 1    j DS TA TA

005 005 212  To mine the complete frequent patterns, we define WTDF to represent the complete decayed support of a pattern within the current sliding window In the actual situation, the limited memory and processing speed make the algorithm be only able to maintain each pattern of incomplete information. Therefore, we define WADF to represent the incomplete decayed support of a pattern within the current sliding window Definition 3 Within the current sliding window, let the 
occurrence time set of pattern P maintained by an algorithm be  T wa  P At the current time t c  WADF is defined as   wa c D Pt     2 cj jwa tT TT P 978-1-4244-4507-3/09/$25.00 \2512009 IEEE

Therefore, we consider using TADF  TTDF to estimate WADF  WTDF  respectively Definition 6 At the end of current time t c let the occurrence time set of pattern P maintained by an algorithm be T ta  P Then TADF  is defined as     2 cj jta tT ta c TTP DPt 005  006 000  Definition 7 At the end of current time t c let the complete occurrence time set of P be T tt  P then TTDF  is defined as  tt c D Pt     2 cj jtt tT TTP 005  006 000  Here, we point out the goals for this paper. Let 0 T be the basic time unit. At any time 0 1,2 TNTN  for frequent pattern mining, we must ensure the output over the current sliding window to satisfy 1\ All the frequent patterns must be output 2\Any infrequent pattern cannot be output 3\Any overdue pattern cannot be output 4  TTDF WTDF M TADF WADF M 010\010    III  F REQUENT P ATTERN M INING  A  Online Maintain Theory Data stream constantly produces plenty of overdue or infrequent patterns. To 000\003 reduce maintenance costs, it is necessary to prune them periodically \(the pruning period 0 Dl TT  Pruning the overdue pattern only needs the latest occurrence time, however, pruning the infrequent pattern needs to use TADF  TTDF to estimate WADF  WTDF respectively The theoretical basis is given as follows Propostion 1 Given 1/\(1 2  M 005   where M is the size of sliding windows. Suppose WADF  WTDF of P are   wa c D Pt    wt c D Pt and TADF  TTDF are   ta c D Pt    tt c D Pt At the current time c t we can get    tt c D Pt      wt c D Pt M 010    ta c wa c D Pt D Pt M 010   After introducing the periodic pruning mechanism, we need to define a TADF threshold function 012 to determine whether WTDF is less than   M 007\010  at time t  Definition 8 Suppose the latest established time  of P is t P  At the current time t c the TADF threshold function 012 is defined as 1  12   cP tt Pc tt M 005 012\007\010     Propostion 2 Suppose the latest pruned time of P is t m the latest established time is t P At the current time t c if   ta c DPt   Pc tt 012 then      wt c D Pt M 007\010   If the TADF of P is less than    Pc tt 012 according to Propostion  2, we know WTDF of P is less than   M 007\010   which means P is a infrequent pattern. Obviously, we can surely prune the patterns whose TADF is less than    Pc tt 012 at the pruning period. With       tt c wt c D Pt D Pt M 010  if the TADF is larger than M 007 then      wt c D Pt M 007\010  which means P is not a infrequent pattern. Obviously, the algorithm output the active pattern whose TADF is larger than M 007 can meet the requirement of goal \(2\, \(4\. According to the analysis and Propostion 1, we know goal \(1\\(3\ can also be satisfied B  SWFP To begin with, we propose a new pattern tree of GSW-tree based on SW-tree 4 each node except the root contains      ta P l item D P t t t nodelink where P t is the latest established time of P and l t is the latest occurrence time of P  In ItemHeadTable, each item contains    item head of nodelink  SWFP algorithm is given Algorithm 1:SWFP Algorithm 1 Get the newly arriving transaction T at current time t c  2 Merge T, Root ,t c  3 If t c  T D 1 en 4 For each item in ItemHeadTable 5 For each node in GSW-tree on the node link of item  6 where node.item=item  7 Update node  item  D ta  P  t  t p  t l  nodelink  t c  8 End For 9 End For 10 If the request for mining result arrives then 11 Use the current GSW-tree to generate result 12 End if 13 End if Algorithm 1, Line 2 absorbs the newly coming transaction TA whose concrete process will be explained in algorithm 2 Line 4-9 express the pruning operations, which first update the data fields of each node and then prune the infrequent and overdue patterns \(see algorithm 3, 4\.

Let i n  1  B iNum 003\003 denote the number of patterns in C  whose earliest occurrence within the current sliding window is in bucket 1 B Num i  Let m i denote the occurrence times for any pattern from bucket 1 B Num i  to B Num Therefore, we can get 11  1   1  jj iiDl B ii nmTjNum  003 000¦\000 According to the pruning rule, we know i mi  and then  log  Dl Dl CT MT 003  Let the maximal size of pattern be max L such that the scale of C is max log  Dl Dl OT M T L 013\013  Next, we analyse the size of the critical and frequent pattern group C 1 over the current sliding window, where any two patterns don't share the same prefix. Similar to [5   th e  ov er all  weight of the current sliding window is a constant 1 0 2 i M M i W 005     000 According to the threshold  M 007\010  we can get 1     M COW M 007\010  so that the scale of C 1 is max  M OL W M 007\010 013  B  Error analysis Let the latest pruned time of P be t m At the current time 1 1,2 cD tNTN  suppose the TADF  TTDF of P is D ta  P  t c  D tt  P  t c respectively. Since the algorithm prunes infrequent and overdue patterns, we only consider the error caused by critical and frequent patterns. So, they satisfy      2   cm tt tt c ta c D Pt D Pt M 005 007\010  003  Combining with 1 cm D tt T 011 we can get 1 2  D T error M 005 007\010  003  V  E XPERIMENTAL A NALYSIS  A  Experimental settings In this section, we present an experimental evaluation of SWFP. All experiments were performed on an Intel Core2 Duo CPU 2.1 GHz PC. We implemeted SWFP as well as the comparative method MSW 4 in Visual C++. The synthetic data sets were generated by the illiMine simulator, and marked as follows  D’ indicates the number of transcations in the data set, whereas ‘T’ and ‘I’ indicate the average transaction size and the average maximal potentially frequent pattern size respectively. Unless particularly mentioned, the default parameters are setted as follows: the number of items 10,000 minimum support threshold 0.01 007  the largest error 0.1 010\007  the sliding window size 10000 M  the pruning period T D1 2500, and the decay factor 005  0.001  Algorithm 2:Merge T,Root,t c lgorithm 


B  Execution time Firstly, we compare the efficiency between SWFP and MSW. Figure 1 shows that the efficiency of the SWFP is superior to MSW, which is more obviously advantage as the data stream developing  Figure 1  Execution Time Secondly, test the efficiency of SWFP on data streams with different number of transactions, various average transcation size and average maximal potential frequent pattern size  a  b  c  Figure 2  Execution Time vs. Number of Transactions/Average Transaction Size/ Average Maximal Potentially Frequent Pattern Size Figure 2 \(a\ shows that the average processing time per transcation is approximate 4ms/Trans, which means it is very efficient, stable, and scalable to handle the high-speed data stream. Figure 2 \(b\ shows that as the average transcation size increases, the execution time is linear trend, obviously influenced by the size. Figure 2 \(c\ shows that the execution time sharply decreases with the average maximal potential frequent pattern size, but at the length between 10 to 15, the tend changes to be gentle Finally, we study the impact of the sliding window size on the efficiency of our algorithm. Figure 3 shows the efficiency of the algorithm is independent of the sliding Window size  Figure 3  Execution Time vs. Length of Sliding Windows VI  C ONCLUSION  The frequent pattern mining to reflect the recent development trend is particularly important. On the basis of an introduction and a review of the existing methods of frequent pattern mining over sliding windows, an attempt is made to establish a new theory frame to improve the mining quality and efficiency, which is scientifically illustrated. When the data stream develops, the support decay mechanism is designed to prune the overdue pattern information of each pattern. At the same time, by the reasonable pruning strategy, the overdue pattern and infrequent pattern are pruned to reduce the cost of maintenance. Not only the theoretical analysis but also the experimental verification shows that our algorithm has high efficiency and scalability R EFERENCES  1  G. Manku and R.

3. Proposed Methodology  An international Fortune 500 company has agreed to participate in this study.  A division of this company contracts out system administration support work involved in the configuration, maintenance, and management of computing infrastructures.  All work activities are initiated through problem tickets or change tickets, as described above In an effort to improve the productivity of their system administrators, the organization has developed a knowledge management system.  This voluntary use system provides a list of tickets to be worked on, current and historical system state information, and an interface to search for solutions to similar tickets The organization employs thousands of external support system administrators and has agreed to randomly select 300 to participate in this study Survey data will be collected through online surveys and the employer will supply productivity data in Fall 2008.  Except for productivity measures, all other measures will be adopted from previous research The data will be analyzed using structural equation modeling, given that this method allows us to test complex causal models  4. Conclusion  This study proposes an extension to existing KMS success models by measuring the effects of both knowledge sharing and knowledge sourcing activities. When evaluating individual impact of KMS use we will be able to evaluate the additional contribution of KMS use when other sources of knowledge are available. Furthermore, we will also be able understand whether there is a difference in the influence of the two KMS use modes on productivity and perceived usefulness of the KMS. A better understanding of the impacts of sourcing and sharing can help us answer some interesting questions:  Are free-riders \(those that only source more productive than knowledge providers? As compared to free-riders, are knowledge providers adversely affected by spending time to share their knowledge? If so, are free-riders more satisfied with the KMS?  In regard to the context of this study, who are the more productive system administrators knowledge seekers or knowledge providers These important questions have not been adequately addressed in prior literature, and we hope that the proposed study will contribute by providing some initial answers  5.

 11  Impact \226 Strauss\222s Derivative of Moore The impact of such a simple statement is at the same time beautiful and difficult to realize.  What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.  It can be easily seen that in terms of memory technology for space, the selection is limited \226 especially so when it comes to non-volatile radiation hardened devices Part II 6  H IGH C APACITY S OLID S TATE R ECORDER  The impetus of this paper was the assignment to predict mass, power, volume, and cost for multi-terabit data recorders of the capacities shown in Table 3 with deliveries occurring in the year given [2   Table 3 - Data Recorder Capacity Requirements YEAR DATA CAPACITY 2010 2.88 Tb 2020 30 Tb 2030 130 Tb  This part of the paper presents a design of a 130 Tb NonVolatile data recorder which could be built for delivery in the year 2030, based on the information presented in Part I In developing the SSR design, technology selection was limited to the two technologies examined in detail in Part I Flash and NROM\nd a technology freeze date of 36 months in advance of delivery was assumed  SSR \226 Flash & NROM Based designs Table 4 - ITRS predicted device capacity \(Gb for three technologies Year 2015 2018 2021 2025 Technology CRAM 0.032 0.064 0.064 0.128 NROM 4 8 16 32 Flash 64 128 256 512  In this particular case, the year 2025 is selected as the freeze date and appropriate device capacity is used.  The ITRS is predicting that by the year 20 25, CRAM-based devices will have a capacity of 128 Mbit per die; NROM will have 32 Gb per die. Flash will be available at 512 Gb per die [9 Table  5 highlights the number of die necessary of three discussed technologies to achi eve a recorder of specified capacity in the timeframe given Table 5 - Minimum Device Count by Technology to achieve a Data Recorder of Specified Capacity in the Year shown.  \(Example, a 30 Tb recorder being designed in the year 2020 would require 468,750 CRAM devices or 1,875 NROM devices, or 118 Flash devices  Therefore, a 130 Tb data recorder designed using devices predicted available in the year 2030, would require the following number of devices \226 not including any additional devices used for Error Detection and Correction \(EDAC\ or sparing and word control 200  CRAM: > 1 million devices Year Recorder Capacity CRAM 4Mb NROM 1Gb Flash 16Gb 720,000 2,880 180 64Mb 16Gb 256Gb 468,750 1,875 118 128Mb 32Gb 512Gb 1.02E+06 4,063 254 Required Not Reqiured Required EDAC Technology / Device Capacity /Chip Count 2010 2020 2030 2.88 Tb 30 Tb 130 Tb 


 12  200  NROM: approx 4060 devices 200  Flash: approx 256 devices By examination, it can be easily seen that developing a high capacity data recorder as pr oposed using CRAM technology is impractical Error Detection and Correction Codes  All technologies are subject to lo ss of information, be they the loss of a single bit or the loss of an entire chip, the inclusion of Error Detection and Correction is an appropriate action by any system designer Just by using EDAC, there is an associated bit-penalty ranging from a few percentile to over 25 per cent   The exact selection of most-appropriat e Error Correction codes is highly dependent upon error phenomena not only for each  rt ain aspects of the exact part being considered as well as the environment to be encountered [2  25  F o r t h e reco rde r  de scri be d bel o w a Reed-Solomon code was selected.  It is important to note that this may not be the prime candidate, but was chosen for known characteristics Selection of a more appropri ate EDAC code [2 w oul d  most assuredly, bring about a reduction in recorder mass and power One final, important, distinction between the two prime technologies is required The NROM devices analyzed for this paper have built-in an incredibly powerful error detection and correction machine, capable of detecting four bits in error in a single word, and correcting three bits per word [10  W i t h th is m e th od t h e Bit Error Rate is calculated by the manufacturer to be less than 1.18E 19  errors/bit-day \226 equivalent to 3 unrecoverable bit errors every 550 years for the entire recorder; therefore, the package numbers presented here do not include extra devices required for EDAC other than that provided by the chip itself Table 6 - HC-SSR Basic Features 200  Redundant SpaceWire interfaces 200  Redundant Power Converters 200  Redundant Controllers/Supervisors 200  Multi-plane Non-volatile storage 200  Error detection and correction 200  Device isolation to the EDAC Word  Figure 18 - HC-SSR Conceptual Block Diagram

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
