We demonstrate an improved matching algorithm i.e. the Semantic Relatedness Scores \(SRS Language \(SWRL together to achieve better reliability and precision in matching heterogeneous data schemas. We introduce a process methodology support this. The goal here is to develop a consistent knowledge model across enterprises that are more precise and reliable. We have also implemented a multi-agent system \(MAS prototype based on the service oriented architecture SOA how our approach is represented in the Zachman Framework  1. Introduction  Schema heterogeneity is a major barrier for enterprises to seamlessly share and reuse organizational data. Although the federated data approach and platform integration technologies provide much support for this area, with the advent of Web 3.0 technologies and beyond such as the Semantic Web enterprises have to start rethinking as to how they can start sharing and reusing data in a seamless fashion This is paramount in the services sector that involves government as well as private entities The Semantic Web platform enables software agents to sift, winnow and integrate data on-the-fly However, technologies that make up the Semantic Web such as ontologies, Web Ontology language \(OWL and resource description framework \(RDF aligned to achieve this interoperability. Tim BernersLee states that it is important for data to be made machine understandable and processable for Semantic Web to enable data integration across the Semantic Web. This also includes the provision for metadata and data interchange formats such as N3 \(Notation 3 XML \(Extensible Mark-up Language Terse RDF Triple Language 


RDF Triple Language Ontologies, which are at the core of this technology, are meant to resolve schema heterogeneity However, it is necessary for ontological commitments to be made by enterprises for a shared vocabulary before. As such, the vocabulary available in ontologies per se is not able to provide any solutions for a consistent information model. For example, various ontologies exist for the travel domain today. Although they describe the same travel information, the schema structure and data type defined in them may not necessarily be the same. In other words semantically identical information for travel may be expressed differently by various ontologies. As such the need for integration becomes necessary for the extraction and reuse of information from such sources Let?s look at an example to understand the problem better.  We describe the data heterogeneity problem by providing two cases. Case 1 is a travel domain example and case 2 is an e-government example. Case 1, is illustrated by figure 1 and 2. Figure 1 shows a travel reservation ontology of enterprise A that has a super class called ?Travel Reservation?, below which, two subclasses are defined i.e. ?Accommodation? and Transportation?. The accommodation class is made up of subclasses i.e. hotel, motel and others. The transportation class is made up of subclasses i.e. sea air and land.  ?Airlines? appears as a subclass under Air? and ?Coach? appears as a subclass under ?Land The arrows here represent the ?is-a? relation between classes for example hotel is a type of accommodation  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1978-0-7695-3450-3 2009 U.S. Government Work Not Protected by U.S. Copyright   Figure 1. Travel Reservation Ontology A  Figure 2 also illustrates a travel reservation ontology for enterprise B which uses a slightly different naming convention. It has the same super class ?Travel Reservation? but it?s subclasses have different names compared to figure 1, such as Lodging? instead of ?Accommodation? and Transport? instead of ?Transportation?. Also air transportation is defined with more granularity compared to the description in figure 1, where flight is described as domestic and international. ?Flight? has also been used to describe ?Airlines? in ontology B In conclusion, enterprise A and enterprise B illustrate semantically identical information that is not defined explicitly in the same fashion. The ontology differences here result from mainly different naming conventions and the structure of the taxonomies in use In terms of naming conventions the usage of Lodging? instead of ?Accommodation?, ?Flight instead of ?Airlines? and ?Transportation? instead of Transport? illustrate the problem caused by different naming conventions. The exclusion of accommodation types in ontology B as well as land transportation that do not exist at all in ontology B, are the main causes for structural heterogeneity So it is clear from the examples above that ontologies are not the solution for mitigating machine processable data and resolving data heterogeneity Ontologies alone cannot resolve data heterogeneity problems without commitment for shared vocabulary 1][2]. Ontologists, quite often do not agree on the same definitions, semantics and structure when developing their ontologies [6][8][15]. This causes two or more ontologies of similar contexts to be expressed differently as we have just discussed previously 


differently as we have just discussed previously So, how can we share and reuse data in such a situation? To build a good travel web service we must be able to reuse existing travel definitions and schemas without reinventing the wheel. Our solution this problem is to build a consistent information model across enterprise A and B where existing travel data definitions from their own local ontologies can be reused and shared. We approach this problem via ontology mediation and mapping. Ontology mediation is a process of finding a common ground for interoperability and ontology mapping is a process of producing concept and attribute matching. Now let?s take a look at case 2    Figure 2. Travel Reservation Ontology B  Currently, public service departments have implemented XML schemas with Web Service interfaces such as the Danish e-government project 21]. The effort is similar to that of maintaining a shared repository to ensure interoperability for all government systems by using the same schema language to avoid reusability problems of syntax specific definitions [3][4][7 Schema interoperability guidelines are issued for this purpose and in most cases made mandatory to ensure all government agencies adhere to the same naming conventions. For example in England the schema has to be registered with UK GovTalk [22 Examples of such schemas for addresses are CorrespondenceAddress,HomeAddress,BusinessAddre ss and ElectoralAddress. In some cases interoperability is only limited to central control such as the UN/CEFACT initiative [23 This creates a barrier for inter-organizational services between public agencies of different domains outside that boundary. The lack of semantics causes data exchange to be impossible. For example figure 3 illustrates a data heterogeneity problem for interorganizational services between public agencies where Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 a customer wants to renew his driver?s license online The customer logs onto the DMV \(Department of Motor Vehicle Then he enters his full_name, DOB \(10-10-1974 DMV customer ID \(A11-03-5767 3234 Hampton Rd Fairfax VA 22030 onto a license renewal inspector to be verified. Also the payment mode is chosen and verified. Data collected is then sent to the DMV License Renewal server which validates and updates the renewal data When payment is validated by the DMV License Renewal server, the records inspector receives this information with updates exchanged from DMV Records server. The bank is then notified for the charges and the customer?s account is debited    Figure 3. DMV License Renewal Process The basis for data heterogeneity problems in the above example are clearly due to the different naming conventions by the two DMV agencies i.e. DMV Licence Renewal and DMV Records. For example DMV Records maintains first_name, middle_name and last_name however DMV Licence Renewal maintains a complex string called full_name that literally combines first_name, middle_name and last_name 


combines first_name, middle_name and last_name Also address in DMV Licence Renewal is treated as a complex string e.g. \(?Hampton Rd Fairfax VA 22030 and in DMV Records it is divided into street name city, state and zipcode, e.g. \(?Hampton Rd?, ?Fairfax VA?, ?22030 own systems independently from each other, the granularity of how information is expressed can differ a great deal. As mentioned earlier having all agencies to adhere to one naming convention and making it mandatory is not practical. This approach would be analogues to the federated schema approach \(see figure 4 and a shared vocabulary. This approach is not practical as all local schemas have to be agreed upon and be integrated ahead of time. Sometimes they also have to be hard-coded. This does not allow local ontologies to be domain specific and maintain common data to exist at the higher level of the hierarchy. This approach also doesn?t produce semantically rich data because of the reasons stated earlier  Figure 4. Domain Ontology Approach  Our approach is based on shared vocabulary and is quite similar to the federated approach but includes the source data in its own local ontology and shared vocabulary is achieved via inter-ontology mappings. A simple formalism is provided to capture only the domain knowledge pertaining to potential semantic conflicts \(see figure 5 is that it is not only domain-specific but it also doesn?t lose semantic richness as it maintains local ontology definitions [14][15][16][17   Figure 5. Hybrid Approach  This approach provides the semantic interoperability for inter-agency data exchanges and thus helps create the common information model that Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 is desired. To achieve this, we need to adopt a shared hierarchical information architecture  2. Shared Hierarchical Structures  In the shared hierarchical structure [2] below, DMV License Renewal and DMV Records would maintain their own naming conventions for their customer records but at the same time borrow general concepts from an upper ontology. This helps facilitate knowledge reuse and allows domain experts to express their own specific definitions, even when they don?t completely agree with each other \(shown in figures 1 and 2 earlier in different levels, each inheriting knowledge from upper level or parent ontologies. For multiple inheritance relationships it is important for knowledge inherited in local ontologies to be consistent with upper ontologies with no naming clashes    Figure 6. Shared Hierarchical Knowledge Repository  It will be impossible to find a perfect ontology to maintain rich definitions, as such a shared hierarchical structure is crucial [2][20]. Figure 6 illustrates a shared hierarchical knowledge repository that begins with 


hierarchical knowledge repository that begins with knowledgebase O \(KB-O agencies i.e. DMV License Renewal and DMV Records would have their own local knowledgebases that house their local ontologies e.g. KB-B1, KB-I1 KB-A1 KB-B4, KB-I4 and KB-A4. DMV license renewal contains KB-B1, KB-I1 and KB-A1 and would inherit knowledge from KB-D1 which inherits data from KB-X DMV Records contains and manages ontologies in KB-B4, KB-I4 and KB-A4. These ontologies inherit data from KB-D4, which then inherits from KB-Y Both KB-X and KB-Y inherit data from KB-O \(see figure 6 are aware that their inherited knowledge is common to KB-O when they collaborate. Knowledge reuse becomes easier in this way. Particularly when creating a new ontology, we can determine which parent ontology to inherit from and start adding new knowledge to what already exists    Figure 7. Distributed Shared Hierarchical Knowledge Repository  Although the hierarchical structure helps knowledge reuse, it will not be realistic to assume that all developed ontologies will be under one central control and available at all times [19]. As such, a distributed model of a hierarchical repository is more appropriate \(see figure 7 i.e server 1, server 2 and server 3 The servers could be maintained by other agencies within the DMV consortium or even other agencies. To solve the availability problem, when a new ontology inherits knowledge from another upper ontology, a copy of the inherited knowledge is made available locally. The reason for this is that the parent ontology does not have to be available online at all times to have its children ontologies to function properly  3. Semantic Bridging Process Methodology  In this section we present our process methodology for semantically bridging the knowledgebases \(see figure 8   development. It involves creating or selecting the source ontology \(SO TO Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 mentioned earlier DMV License Renewal could maintain its own set of definitions that is different from DMV Records. This is really a very important step for the ontologist as the domain specific local ontologies of public agencies e.g. DMV License Renewal and DMV Records have to be determined before mediation can be done. If DMV License Renewal is selected to be SO, then TO would be DMV Records    Figure 8. Semantic Bridging Process Methodology  In the second step, ontologies are checked for equality \(E IC D concepts are negated. We use the following symbols 1 and 3  for E, IC, CN and D were based on definitions in [11 The definitions are as follows  


 Equality \(E Two classes \(C DMV Records are equal if, they: 1 semantically equivalent data labels, 2 synonyms or 3 names. For example: 1 C2=Customer, 2 3 c lt;CustID, name, address, DOB&gt; and c2= &lt; CustID name, address, DOB &gt   Inclusiveness \(IC Two classes \(C DMV Records are inclusive if, the attribute \(c one is inclusive in the other. For example if ci StreetAddress and cj = Address, then ci is a type of cj. In other words StreetAddress is inclusive in Address ci \(ci ? cj     Disjoint \(D Two classes \(C DMV Records are disjoint if, their attributes \(c and cj have nothing in common between them. For example charge and name are not equal or inclusive and have nothing in common which results in an empty set    Our Semantic Relatedness Score \(SRS matching technique that combines syntactic and semantic matching. SRS scores are populated into a similarity matrix which is then used as a basis to match the different schemas that the public agencies have defined in their ontologies. This is explained in detail in section 4. In the third step, the respective ontologies are tested for consistency. This is to ensure that the concepts that have been mapped are in fact consistent and that there are no conflicting concepts.  We use a reasoning engine \(i.e. RacerPro  inconsistencies. If inconsistencies are discovered then they are resolved immediately. We define consistency as follows   Consistency \(CN Two classes of DMV Licence Renewal and DMV Records are consistent if, all the attributes for C1 O1 nothing in common \(c1~CustID ? c2~name c3~address ? c4 ~DOB c1~CustID, c2~name, c3~address, c4 ~DOB be subsets of C1 \(O1 RacerPro  In step four, SO and TO are merged and integrated. At this point to ensure that schemas are perfectly matched data labels which have scores higher than the threshold score of 0.5 \(e.g. t&gt;0.5 the threshold are maintained in a log for the ontologist to refer to at a later point. SRS produces scores between 0 and 1. A score of 0 means that data labels have no match and 1 indicates a perfect match For instance if DMV License Renewal had the following schema, &lt;/Address&gt; and at the same time if DMV Records, had the following schema &lt;/Address&gt it would result in a score of 1. We have developed a Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 detailed matching algorithm to illustrate and explain the process of arriving at the scores and also introduced a new measure for validation which is made up of the 


a new measure for validation which is made up of the precision and relevance measure [15].  In step five, we use the same reasoning engine \(i.e. RacerPro  check for post matching inconsistencies. This is to ensure that consistency is maintained even after data labels are matched. It also ensures integrity of matched data labels Lastly in step six, a log report is produced and published. This data is also annotated to document all changes that have been updated. We do this to provide other ontologists to trace the lineage of data that had been used to make any changes during the mapping process. In the next section we describe how SRS is determined  4. Semantic Relatedness Scores \(SRS  We have researched thirteen well established linguistic and cognitive algorithms for finding the best measure for semantic correspondence. Some of the algorithms use pure syntactic \(SYN others use semantic matching \(SEM algorithm was tested individually and then in combinations. The combination of these five algorithms i.e. Lin, Gloss Vector, WordNet, LSA Latent Semantic Analysis highest the most accurate results [15]. SRS is a hybrid measure that comprises SYN and semantic matching SEM. Our experiments have proven that the combination of these five measures provide the highest reliability and precision [15 Figure 9, shows that SRS had a higher precision and relevance score when matched against actual feedback received from human experts, i.e. human cognitive responses \(HCR conducted with 30 word-pairs based on a study done at Princeton [6] to test the accuracy of our SRS. SRS had a 96.67% relevance score and a 40% precision score These were higher compared to pure SYN algorithm scores which only had a 73.33% relevance score and a 16.67% precision score [15    Figure 9. Semantic Bridging Process Methodology  Figure 10. Variance for SRS scores and HCR scores  Figure 11. Variance for SYN and SEM scores  When tested for correlation, SRS had a positive correlation i.e. r = 0.919 \(91.9 also had a smaller variance \(see figure 10 Huge variance Small variance Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 when matched against HCR scores had a negative correlation and also had a higher variance \(see figure 11 pure SYN scores for matching schemas. For the enterprise knowledge model to be efficient, SRS must be coupled with SWRL so that commonly used data schemas can be ascertained and matched ahead of time based rules without having to measure the scores every time that piece of information is used. This improves the efficiency and provides just-in-time data  5. Bridging via SWRL  In this section we present how semantic bridging 


In this section we present how semantic bridging with SRS can be complemented with rules. SRS provides schemas that are likely to be matched with high reliability and precision [15]. Rules on the other hand are cardinality constraints that can be used for matching data labels, schemas and concepts. Rules can be predefined ahead of time so that frequently appearing schemas can be matched automatically [10 To match schemas on names for instance we can write a rule that would match &lt;/first_name&gt lt;/middle_name&gt; and &lt;/last_name&gt; with lt;/full_name&gt;.If we had schemas for example lt;/street_name&gt;, &lt;/city&gt;, &lt;/state&gt; and &lt;/zipcode&gt; to define an address in one domain ontology and defined as just &lt;/address&gt; in another, a simple rule can be executed to match them on-the-fly. As mentioned earlier in section one and two, DMV Licence Renewal and DMV Records may have domain specific schema definitions that are different. Since establishing services between them will be an ongoing task rules could provide an automatic solution for creating homogeneity amongst heterogeneous schemas used by them [10] [18 In view of the reasoning aspects that are possible in the Semantic Web, that supports web services, we propose an approach where rules can be used to match concepts.  Reasoning is an approach when agents in a knowledge system perform tasks by inference [8][9 Given the following statement ?If X has a son Y, and X has a brother Z, given that X is a male? the agent is able to then infer that Y has an uncle, Z. The agent does not need to be explicitly told about the relationship between Y and Z. As long as uncle is defined earlier an agent will be able to infer this quickly. SWRL is based on OWL and RuleML \(Rule Markup Language It enables OWL axioms to include Horn-logic that can be used to execute rules in a knowledgebase like the ones that public agencies will need to share \(see section 2 an antecedent \(body head words if the antecedent holds true, then the consequent must hold true also. In our example earlier if antecedents ?X has a son Y, and X has a brother Z?, X is a male? is all true then the consequent must also hold true which is ?Y has an uncle, Z With rules in place we can easily automate matching of schemas on-the-fly, which otherwise would be very labor intensive. As such SWRL rules and SRS would be complementary efforts towards semantic bridging. For example \(see figure 12 Records maintains first_name, middle_name and last_name however DMV Licence Renewal \(see figure 13 the address in the DMV License Renewal is treated as a complex string and in DMV Records it is divided into street_name, city, state and zipcode  lt;?xml version ="1.0"?&gt lt;rdf:RDF  lt;owl:Ontology rdf:about=""/&gt lt;/owl:ObjectProperty&gt lt;owl:ObjectProperty  rdf:ID="Customer"/&gt lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="First_Name"/&gt lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="Middle_Name"/&gt lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="Last_Name"/&gt lt;/rdf:RDF&gt lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="Address"/&gt lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="Street_Name"/&gt lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="Zipcode"/&gt lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="City"/&gt 


lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="City"/&gt lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="State"/&gt lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="Customer"/&gt lt;/rdf:RDF&gt  Figure 12. DMV Records schema definition  lt;?xml version ="1.0"?&gt lt;rdf:RDF  lt;owl:Ontology rdf:about=""/&gt lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="Client"/&gt lt;owl:Class rdf:ID="Full_Name"/&gt lt;rdfs:domain rdf:resource="#Address"/&gt lt;/rdf:RDF&gt  Figure 13. DMV License Renewal schema definition  5.1. Expressing Rules in SWRL  In this section we show how SWRL rules are written to accomplish the bridging task to execute schema matching based on data labels, schemas and concepts rules for DMV Records and DMV License Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 Renewal. The first rule would be to associate lt;/Street_Name&gt;, &lt;/City&gt;, &lt;/State&gt; and &lt;/Zipcode&gt from DMV Records to &lt;/Address&gt; in DMV Licence Renewal  The following is how the rule 1 is expressed  Rule 1 hasStreet_Name ^ hasCity ^ hasState ^ hasZipcode hasAddress  This implies that the \(Antecedent \(hasStreet_Name hasCity, hasState and hasZipcode. Thus the consequent would be \(hasAddress expressed for matching two concepts that are similar using ?sameAs? as part of the rule. In this case the schema client and customer are really the same so a simple rule can be used to match them on-the-fly  Rule 2 lt;?Client&gt;owl:SameAs&lt;?Customer&gt  Rule 3 determines the full name by concatenating first_name, middle_name and last_ name and is expressed as  Rule 3 hasFirst_Name ^ hasMiddle_Name ^ hasLast_ Name hasFull_Name  6. Mapping to the Zachman Framework  The Zachman Framework defines a logical structure for classifying and organizing the descriptive representations of an enterprise. It showcases a twodimensional six-by-six matrix that is represented by players represented by the rows \(i.e. Planner, Owner Designer, Builder i.e. Data, Function Network, People, Time, Motivation the columns. In order to build a consistent model for information and knowledge across the enterprise, we have to address the columns and they can be described as follows   Data \(what 


 Data \(what  This column answers the question ?what and enterprise is made of?? It is clear from our discussions in previous sections as to ?what data? of the enterprise is significant to be semantically bridged. From case 1 and 2 we can deduce the entity relationship involved in each perspective of the enterprise   Function \(how  This column answers the question ?how does it work We describe our hybrid approach based on SRS and SWRL on how the actual mediation process takes place transforming data and mapping them on-the-fly to achieve the goal of the enterprise, that is to achieve a common and consistent information model across the enterprise   Network \(where  This column answers the question ?where does it work?? Our hybrid approach based transforms data maps them and performs the actual mediation process in any platform that connects service providers government departments, vendors and offices in any geographic location worldwide as its technology is based on Web 3.0 and beyond i.e. the Semantic Web   People \(who  This column answers the question ?who is responsible?? Our approach suggests that the responsibility for the workflow has to come from the people involved in the organization such as involved in the workflow of DMV License Renewal and DMV Records   Time \(when  This column answers the question ?when?? which an important business rule. We suggest using the workflow sequences in the DMV License Renewal and DMV Records example to determine the turn around time to minimize processing time and to provide justin-time information to clients and service providers   Motivation \(why  This column answers the question ?why?? and as we have explained earlier the goal is to prevent from reinventing the wheel?. Data has to be shared and reused easily among all the service providers government departments and vendors  7. Conclusion  Our approach provides a two part solution for building a common information model. Firstly, we introduce a detailed process methodology for semantic bridging Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 via specific tests of equality \(E IC negating disjoint \(D consistency \(CN This is also supported by an empirical test of SRS a hybrid measure that combines i.e. linguistic properties and syntactic properties. We have also shown validation of the success of SRS via our reliability and precision scores. Secondly, we have provided SWRL rules to increase the efficiency while 


provided SWRL rules to increase the efficiency while agents perform matching on-the-fly Lastly, we describe how our approach can be mapped to the Zachman Framework by describing in detail it?s application in all six columns.  We also imply that each column described is actually unique and that the columns have no order in terms of priority   10.

record To enhance the level of services provided by the organization, we decided to establish an enhanced e-services environment through an e-government portal. The main target of the portal is to minimize the need for citizen  s presence in regional of?ces and intents to deal with all the drawbacks of the current e-service platform. It provides easy access to citizens and businesses twenty four hours per day, seven days per week. It also promotes the increase of e-services to users, facilitating the organization to accomplish its strategic goals. The portal facilitates on-line transactional services and ensures on-line access to the databases of the legacy information system Provision of transactional e-services re?ects the operation of the legacy system and thus results in its renovation. In order to effectively support both systems \(e.g the portal and the legacy system able to apply the same policies and minimize maintenance cost. Thus, it was decided to explore the renovation of the legacy information system by adopting modern technological trends, such as multi-tiered application architecture server-based computing and light clients. It was decided also to rewrite application code based on J2EE architecture to develop a web interface for the legacy information system in order to support a uni?ed environment for both the legacy system and the portal. This decision affected the legacy system architecture, described in System Network View. Some of issues raised included: \(a database architecture? It is currently distributed. Should it become centralized? What are the implications in the network infrastructure? \(b complished to minimize maintenance cost Though EA was never fully described, the organization had already decided to establish an EA based on Zachman framework a few years ago. RUPmethodology was used for software development, thus application description models were developed within Rational Rose platform. In order to be able to apply the proposed tasks identi?ed in section 4, relative information had to be extracted from the corresponding cells. Application description \(e.g. applications and modules tracted from corresponding Rational Rose ?les. Though the process was not automated, the provision of System Network meta-model, helped architecture designer to identify the information needed to obtain from software designers Detailed service description in terms of load requirements could not be extracted from software description.

Topology View - Existing System ments, with security and availability being the most important ones. Security issues have to do with the security of the network, security of data, authentication control, etc. Availability requirements deal with the backup subsystem, the recovery system and high availability UPS. Privacy must be enforced with the use of cryptography and compression techniques. All these requirements were identi?ed during the System Architecture design process and consequently exported in System Motivation cell where all system requirements are gathered using a simpli?ed text-based requirement description method System Architecture design tasks were performed by existing tools already described in [20]. The existence of System Network meta-model and its implementation in XML facilitated tool integration and interoperability. The identi?cation of primary EIS engineering activities served by Zachman matrix rows and columns facilitated a better understanding between software developers, architecture designers and organization management and enhanced discrete methodology integration. Existing and renovated application architecture of the legacy system de?ned by Topology View are presented in ?gures 7 and 8 respectively. The screenshots are from the MagicDraw [2] tool, enhanced with EIS pro?le to provide the appropriate functionality 6. Conclusions &amp; Future Work MB-EISE process based on Zachman framework was explored in the paper. The designer may adjust basic MB-EISE activity model for each cell, formulate a methodology-independent EIS cell-related view, and ?nally identify methods and tools appropriate for implementing each speci?c task. One could argue that in such a case, 36 distinct EIS sub-views should be de?ned, each of them being rather complex, while basic MB-EISE activity should be adjusted 36 times, resulting in a very complicated process Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Central Organization Building lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Application Server lt;&lt;ServerProcess&gt;&gt Oracle Central database lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Medium Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Datacenter server room lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt Large Regional Office lt;&lt;Site&gt;&gt

Topology View - Renovated System However, EIS engineering process, as enterprise architecture, is itself complex. The bene?t of the proposed approach is that all aspects \(simple or complex form and modular fashion. Cell-related sub-views and corresponding meta-models, as well as cell-related MB-EISE activity model may be progressively formed according to the designer  s priorities and perspectives Having a black-box view of each Zachman cell, the proposed approach focuses on EIS view integration and interview consistency. The notion of external entities when de?ning EIS cell-related views provides the means for interoperability with external cells, while at the same time facilitates atomicity within the limits of each cell. We are currently emphasizing Business and System rows, and especially Function and Network cells, exploring in parallel Motivation column and the way non-functional requirements are managed Having a white-box view of each Zachman cell, it is evident that the de?nition of a technology neutral metamodel and the identi?cation of basic engineering tasks, corresponding to EIS cell-related views, contributes to the integration of different methodologies and tools. A library of EIS System Network models has been already implemented in XML.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
