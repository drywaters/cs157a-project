INTRODUCTION At the present, a mobile phone can be a device that provides user  s location. Several researches attempted to study and discover methods to employ it in transportation system Especially, it is particular in localization and certainly traffic information. A major challenge of employing a cellular phone as a traffic probe for estimating congestion is to locate a mobile phone in positioning process accurately. The review of this study was focus on the methodologies to achieve the mobile phone localization. Nevertheless, there are plenty of approaches to achieve mobile phone localization, for example equipping a GPS function with a mobile phone, or relying on a mobile phone transmission signal.  In the first method, it is capable to provide trustworthy location data, however the user needs to pay extra cost for it.   Another method, concerning with the transmission signal, is expressed as Cell Identification CI TA AoA ToA TDoA  complexity of the separated architectures are issues of consideration, these approaches are rather complicated Received signal strength method recently receives attention as a mobile phone positioning technique. It is a technique that estimates the position of a mobile phone by matching the signal strength with neighbor reference points 2]. For this propose, the calculation of signal strength difference depends on the number of broadcast channels BCCH  positioning techniques based on this method yields widely inaccurate band. Nonetheless, it is still attractive, since this technique is economical For the accuracy of this approach, Mile Y. Chen and et at 4] measured the positioning accuracy of the three positioning algorithms from the research literature. The three positioning algorithms are the centroid algorithm, a radio fingerprinting 


algorithms are the centroid algorithm, a radio fingerprinting algorithm and Monte Caro localization with a learned Gaussian Processes signal propagation model. In this examination, they mentioned that the accuracy of positioning can be improved to a mean error of 65-134m. In addition, Goh Pong Chai [5] developed a software resident in a handset and performed mobile phone localization by using the GSM network parameters. This method was able to accomplish sub100m accuracy in most environments. Nevertheless, the location exactness that they attained is much less than GPS accuracy Moreover, a genetic algorithm or a neuron network was applied to locate the position of a mobile phone. Zoran Salcic and Edwin Chan [8] classified the position of a mobile phone by applying two inputs into a neuron network model. The inputs that they used are signal strength from each base station and the angle between the mobile station and the antenna. The experimental results were quite satisfied. However, there are still issues that needed to be considered. 1 parameters had an impact to model accuracy and 2 network model was appropriate for using in some specific areas [8]. The positioning error of this approach was more than hundreds of meters In this paper, we presented road traffic estimation based on the position and the velocity of cellular phones. The positioning technique, Received Signal Strength method, was applied to obtain position estimation. The positions are subsequently changed to be an average velocity, which is the quantity that we use to represent traffic status. Note that a mobile phone without a GPS function was implemented in our localization process. Basically, we assumed that there is at least one mobile phone in a car. A GSM module was utilized to extract mobile phone signal strength for the database Proceedings of the 12th International IEEE Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, St. Louis, MO USA, October 3-7, 2009 TuAT1.2 261 978-1-4244-5521-8/09/$26.00  2009 IEEE collection. The entire database was automatically recorded since we needed the large database size. Mobile phone localization is implemented using signal strength matching in order to locate its position. According to the large size of the collected database, we additionally present a noise reduction algorithm, which eliminates bad data and compacts the database. For the localization algorithm, the fast nearest neighbor strategy is applied in the clustered database to reduce computation time II. METHODOLOGY A. Database Collection using GSM Module In our positioning method, we presented a GSM mobile phone positioning by using signal strength matching. In order to obtain signal strength of a mobile phone we selected a GSM module as a probe. The database collection procedure is shown in Figure 1. Generally, a mobile phone located at an area can receive signal transmitted from several base stations Thus, a GSM module which was used as a probe automatically sent signal strength to the main laptop. The position data is likewise sent from a GPS receiver. Transmission was rather real-time with a refresh rate of one second. The position data and the signal strength patterns are packed together to become a database frame for each position on the route       Figure 1. The database collection device, utilized a GSM module to extract signal strength of a mobile phone, a GPS receiver was used to obtain the phone position 


receiver was used to obtain the phone position The system was carried on a car to collect data on the test roads. The density of data points was about 300-800 points per kilometer. In the process of database collection, there were noises of the measurement for example, inaccurate positions and missed signal strength. Therefore, the noisy data need to be eliminated before used as the real database. We described a noise reduction algorithm and the method to cluster the largesize database in the next section B. Noise Reduction and Fast Nearest Neighbor Application The database collection is a significant procedure in this research. More reliable database provides more accurate results. Because GPS receivers have measurement noise, the noisy positions need to be removed. Before adding raw data to the database, we implemented a noise reduction process to eliminate the noisy data. Furthermore, the fast nearest neighbor for localization is applied to reduce the computation time. These two algorithms are described as follows 1 The data at one point which was collected at a test route consists of the position data and the signal strength data. The position data is in term of latitude and longitude. The signal strength data is the transmission signal level that a mobile phone receives from base stations. The inaccurate positions sent from a GPS receiver or invalid signals from GSM module are remarked as the error in measurement or  noises  For example, an error of the position measurement sometimes caused the measured positions to be thousands meters away from the real positions.  All cases of noise needed to be removed before being put into the database. Our noise reduction algorithm utilized reduction rules based on the characteristics of the errors that we found. Figure 2 shows both of the ordinary data and the erroneous data. Generally the trajectory of the position path tends to follow the route path. Therefore, the correlation of signal and location of a mobile phone should be nearby the correlation line Occasionally, there were some positions located far away from the real path. This makes its signal strength and its location disagree Before putting each data into the database, the data was considered for deletion in the term of a group. The reference points were grouped together with a signal strength threshold Generally, the location data of a mobile phone in an area must correlate with its signal strength pattern. The correlation between the signal strength and the location in a group was show in figure 2 In each group, the data needs to be considered with two similarities of features. They are the similarity of signal strength pattern and the similarity of the positions. If the signal strength pattern or the position in the term of latitude and longitude is different from the trajectory, it was considered as invalid data and needed to be removed. For better understanding, we divided the reduction of the inaccurate data into two points of view as in Figure 3       Figure 2. The correlation of signal strength and location of a mobile phone According to the assumption that the signal strength pattern and the location of a mobile phone must correlate to each other in a group, we deliberated on the consideration with signal space and location space. For inaccurate location reduction, we considered the scan line in signal space. That is to say, a number of points in a group that have signal strength agreement must also have the location agreement. In figure 3\(a disagreement of the locations were removed. For inaccurate 


disagreement of the locations were removed. For inaccurate location reduction in figure 3\(b in signal space. The points that have the same locations but have disagreement of the signal patterns were removed. Both 262 procedures used fix thresholds. The points that need to be removed under the noise reduction rules are circled in figure 3           a           b Figure 3. Noise reduction, \(a reduction, \(b The two local thresholds in figure 3 are the thresholds that were calculated from the information in the group. Local location threshold came from the standard deviation of the distance between each point in a group and local signal threshold came from the standard deviation of the signal strength difference in the group.  A number of points with its signal strength pattern correlate to its location data were added into the database. However, with noise reduction algorithm the database is still huge. Therefore, it requires the use of the fast nearest neighbor process in order to reduce the computation time in the positioning procedure.  The fast nearest neighbor algorithm that performed database clustering are mentioned in the next section 2 According to the fact that our positioning algorithm was based on signal strength pattern matching, the nearest neighbor algorithm in the term of Euclidean distance of the signal strength was applied to indicate the difference of the signal strength pattern. Due to the size of the large database, it could take minutes or might be days to search for the most similar signal pattern within a small city. Thus, the fast nearest neighbor algorithm was applied to reduce the computation time. If the entire database was divided into n groups, the overall computation time can be reduced. Because there were only n representative points of the database was formerly searched to discover which group was the nearest group of a test point [7]. After that, the members in the nearest group were implemented the localization using the conventional full search   Figure 4. Two techniques for database clustering based on a fast nearest neighbor application, \(a and \(b To achieve this concept, the entire database was clustered into individual group by using area-based clustering and centroid of signal strength-based clustering. This is to separate the database into layers. The procedure of querying a test point is as follows. First, a coarse search is performed on the top layer to find a group that represents the query point. Each group has a centroid of signal strength that was a center point 


group has a centroid of signal strength that was a center point of signal pattern in the group. Second, a fine search is performed within the group to match the query point with the closet data. With this method, the separate layers of data can reduce the computation time in searching process, because it can eliminate irrelevant data in other groups. A cluster which 263 has the most similar signal pattern is selected as the proposed reference points Figure 4 shows the two proposed techniques of database clustering based on the fast nearest neighbor algorithm: the area-based clustering and the centroid of signal strength-based clustering. For the first method, the test route or the test area was divided into n cells. Each cell has its individual centroid which was the center of signal strength pattern in the cell Each category of reference points in both techniques is the proposed reference points. It has one representative used for formerly search to find the most nearest area of a test point For centroid of signal strength-based clustering, the signal strength pattern of the entire reference points was divided into n clusters. Conceptually, the reference points which have the similar signal strength pattern were assigned to be the same group. Due to signal strength of a mobile phone at a point is transmitted from several base stations, a signal data in a point was collected in n dimensions matrix. For this clustering algorithm, we used the k-means algorithm to cluster n signal data based on attributes into k partitions, k&lt;n. This algorithm also automatically finds the center of the cluster. In each cluster, the centroid of signal strength was used to be a representative of the cluster. For a test point, its signal strength pattern was compared with a representative of each cluster. A cluster which provided the most similar signal strength matching was utilized to be a proposed reference group Afterwards, the difference of signal strength pattern between a test point and every single member in a proposed reference group was performed by the full search in order to obtain the first and the second nearest points. These two nearest points will be used to interpolate the test point  s position by using the localization algorithm which is mention in the positioning algorithm section C. Positioning Algorithm According to the previous research paper, we selected the best positioning algorithm called mobile phone positioning by using linear interpolation of position from signal strength method [2]. This algorithm is described as follows  1  2  For a test point P, its signal strength pattern was compared with the signal strength pattern of the representatives in each clustered database. The most similar signal strength matching was deployed as the proposed cluster. To interpolate the location of point P, its signal strength pattern was compared with the signal strength pattern of all members in the cluster by using the conventional full search. This is to obtain the real two nearest reference points, A and B  For the position P, which is the position we wanted to locate. Parameter  lat  and  lon  represent the position of P in the term of latitude and longitude respectively. The subscriber A and B are the first and the second nearest referent points The constant ? is equal to 100 as a bias value EuPA and EuPB are Euclidean distances of signal strength between a test point and the reference points. The constant  PAEu?? indicates that more similar of the signal strength pattern higher weighting value. A high weighting value between a test point, P, and a reference point implies that the estimated position is located nearby that reference point III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 


III. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS We collected data in the database by carrying out the probe system in a car, and drove along real roads in Bangkok Thailand. The speed of a test car was in a range of 40-60 km/hr. Signal strengths and the positions of the mobile probe were collected in pairs and recorded into a laptop. The average distance between points to be measured is down to 6-11 meters approximately. The entire database was passed through the noise reduction procedure and clustered into groups Figure 5 shows the examples of the data points on the test route           Figure 5. The proposed reference points after performing the fast nearest neighbor application For the test route, we selected a short routes that have both straight paths and curve paths. This is to be certain that our noise reduction algorithm was able to deal with several characteristics of the route path A. The Results of Positioning a Mobile Phone In order to estimate the position of a mobile phone, we drove the car with a sensor system along a test route to collect the signal strength pattern. Signal-position pairs of 766 test points were collected as a test set. The database which was eliminated the noisy data was used as a real database for performing the mobile positioning. The positioning results are shown in table 1. The results shown in table 1 do not involve the database clustering mentioned Errors in location were practically occurred from a GPS receiver.  Occasionally, the error points happened more than thousands meters away from the real positions. This greatly affected the error of positioning without noise reduction Sometimes, the errors were as high as kilometers. As the results shown in table 1, the errors in measurement provide inaccurate positioning result 264 However, the implementation of noise reduction improved the positioning results. In the table 2, the database was both incorporated with noise reduction and database clustering. In the clustering process, the database was clustered into 9, 16 25, 36 and 49 groups. The results in table 2 show that the computation time 68% decrease after the implementation of the database clustering. On the other hand, errors in positioning increase because test points are sometimes associated with the wrong cluster before implementing fine search According to the reversed outcome of two features, we needed to consider the performance of the positioning by weighing these two features with different ratios. The performance of the positioning I and II are presented in table 3 and 4 TABLE I.

According to the performances that were based on these two features computation time and positioning accuracy, we compared various percentages of each features with each other For accurate positioning applications, we recommend that the size of clustering which high accuracies in positioning are needed. The performance of such systems needs to be relied on high percentage of the error in positioning. On the other hand, high percentage of computation time is desired for the applications that need short time in calculation or applications that have low computational power. Mobile phone positioning is one of these. In our experiment, we emphasized more on the reduction of computation time. The results show that our test route with 12.8 kilometer long was appropriate with 49 database clusters. As seen in the data in table 2, the results of the different number of clusters provided no effect to the positioning errors. Therefore, higher number of database clusters was appropriate B. The Results of Road Traffic Estimation In order to estimate the traffic status, we use the velocity of a mobile phone in a car to indicate road congestion. The easiest way to obtain car speed is by determining the travel distance divided by travel time \(space mean speed the estimated position from the  previous point was used to calculate the speed of the car. In this study, we made an experiment on a local road of 12.8 kilometer long. The estimated velocities calculated by the space mean speed method were compared with the reference velocities obtained from the GPS receiver. Figure 6 shows the comparison of the real speeds of a car and the estimated speeds    Figure 6. The velocity estimation The results in the figure 6 show that the line of the estimated velocity is able to track reference trajectory According the estimated velocity of entire route, we interpreted the traffic status as fluent with an average error 11 km/hr 0 20 40 60

CONCLUSTION This paper presented road traffic estimation by using the speed of a mobile phone in moving car to represent the traffic status. The mobile phone positioning was implemented by signal matching with the collected database. Since a large database size was desired, we built a new sensor system to automatically collect mobile phone information. A sensor system and the positioning algorithm are tested along a real road. According to the fact that our database is sizeable, a noise reduction technique was applied database implementation. Moreover, a fast nearest neighbor algorithm was also combined in reference point searching to reduce the computation time. The positioning results show that a mobile phone is able to employ as a traffic probe. The positioning technique is performed by using signal strength matching. The implementation of positioning algorithm combined with a proposed noise reduction and a fast nearest neighbor application has efficiency to estimate the traffic congestion ACKNOWLEDGMENT The work described in this paper was supported by Thailand Graduate Institute of Science and Technology TGIST Technology Development Agency \(NSTDA Electronics and Computer Technology Center \(NECTEC Thailand  REFERENCES 1] C.

of end-to-end operational process considerations to provide emergency medical care as seen through the eyes and experience of a patient. The top level of this diagram represents a linear work flow of a patient from emergency notification \(e.g., ACN, 911 phone call provision, and arrival and definitive care provision at an emergency department and/or trauma center Based on findings, emergency responder processes may be viewed as dynamic or sequential. But the sequential representation is meant to take into account the patient experience, an important system design characteristic as described by Schooley and Horan [18 2. As shown in the second level \(from the top Figure 5, a multi-organizational view of the system architecture is an essential consideration for the ICTIN concept. As described throughout this paper and illustrated in Figure 6, many organizations are involved in emergency response activities, from emergency notification through care provision. Many other practitioners and organizations are involved in Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 crash analysis, public health research, patient outcome research, and other analyses. Therefore, the architecture needs to accommodate the information and data needs of a wide variety of organizations including authorized access to information, while maintaining the privacy and security of patient information. Fortunately, the technology exists to enable these software quality attributes.  How to implement such attributes in a complex large-scale environment is a challenge yet to be resolved 3. Dynamic information sharing considerations are represented on the third and fourth levels of Figure 5 From this analysis, and prior research, a number of information types, or taxonomies, are captured analyzed, and distributed across EMS organizational actors and hardware and software systems. The view represented here is one that would allow for information to be fully utilized by authorized emergency responders \(and information systems downstream? points of an emergency response episode. For example, rather than waiting for a paramedic to click the ?submit report? button of an electronic patient care record, patient information would be dynamically \(and incrementally physicians at a receiving ED or trauma center. To enable such open systems, web services and related information architecture standards would need to be implemented across organizations and information systems so that both ?push? and ?pull? functionality could exist for any and all authorized users 4. End-to-end performance reporting capabilities across organizations and information systems are also enabled through such an architecture. The ability to pull any number of data elements not  Figure 5. Information Coordination across the Emergency Response Process  only benefits real-time clinical decision making, but would also allow for the creation of customized reports for real-time monitoring \(e.g., dashboards retrospective research and analysis. The idea here is that performance analysis becomes a system design consideration at the outset, as opposed to taking the traditional approach of constructing performance reports after the system has been built. As shown in Figure 6, reporting and analytics would be a key component of the ICTIN 5. Additional enterprise architecture characteristics 


5. Additional enterprise architecture characteristics are illustrated in Figure 6. Though alluded to in the above discussion, these include a. Security/Privacy: A standard suite of network software, and data security measures would be implemented to ensure safe transport of patient information in accordance with State and National privacy guidelines and laws Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 b. Patient tracking system: In order to accurately identify data from one system to another, there must be a common data identifier that could associate data with a patient, including vehicle, incident, medical information, care provision, receiving hospital medications administered, dispatched emergency resources, time of phone call, etc. The data would all be linked back to the patient for real-time and retrospective analysis. A patient tracking system would facilitate this core function of the ICTIN c. Directory and Access Services: This would be one or several secure databases that include a listing of all authorized organizations and individuals allowed to access ICTIN information. Individuals would register,,be approved by the managing organization, and then allowed access to certain information based on the information access policies prescribed by the managing body. The directory is controlled by a managing entity to be determined by the network stakeholders  5.1. Directions for Subsequent Phases  While there exists a need for an integrated crash trauma information network \(CTIN a paucity of guidance, literature, and directions on how to achieve such a complex system implementation.  As confirmed by the local and state focus group discussions in Minnesota, further exploration into the potential and feasibility of developing an integrated crash trauma information network would provide an innovative advancement from both a research and practice perspective. More specific recommendations for taking a phased and incremental research approach to move the concept forward are discussed below In our phased approach, several methods are being employed.  A first task would be to validate the Minnesota case studies by conducting a comparative case study review in another state. Findings from a cross-case comparison would be used to outline the parameters for an initial prototype of the integrated crash information system. The prototype would be a simplified ?sample? system to provide a ?proof of concept? and illustrate how crash information could be shared from the moment of impact, through emergency dispatch and response, and then into the emergency room and health treatment services. A key component of this prototype will be the integration of data around the patient. Our straw man system CrashHelp series of interviews and focus groups with significant stakeholders in the process, including departments of transportation, public safety, 911, emergency services, and healthcare. Small data sets from crash EMS, health information systems would be collected and used to develop and populate the prototype to demonstrate its utility for safety decision support and planning purposes.  Feedback analysis from policymakers, planners, public health, EMS, safety engineers, emergency planners and citizens will focus on operational, organizational, and policy 


on operational, organizational, and policy deployment challenges surrounding an enhanced EMS system, including possible benefits from its utilization  Figure 6. Organizations and Integrated Crash Trauma Information Network Services  6. Expected Benefits &amp; Conclusion  The Trauma network would organize the information around the patient, providing a user/consumer centric approach to information design and use. In doing so, the trauma network would extend current EMS systems to include a greater range of information, including information that has been requested by emergency room physicians but often not available. This information is expected to improve not only the timeliness, but also the quality of the emergency response and improve patient care An end-to-end trauma network would allow for more holistic data analysis that can be both visualized and conducted in real-time. Just as private sector operations have achieved benefits through integrated customer systems \(e.g., CRM apply to the victim of a trauma. In this case, the issue is not just better customer service but fundamental issues of life and death  8.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
