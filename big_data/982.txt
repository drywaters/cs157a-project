INTRODUCTION Statistical Process Control \(SPC quality control in industry for decades. Its origins were established in the 30  s from the work performed at Bell Labs and Western Electric [1]. The goal was to improve uniformity of products manufactured in a production line SPC charts such as that developed by Shewhart [2] have been used since then to monitor small sets of key product variables in order to detect deviations. However, industrial processes have become increasingly complex along the years and monitoring few quality variables has become inadequate for most modern industries Works such as those of Mahalanobis [3] and Hotelling [4 promoted the evolution of traditional SPC theory allowing the analysis of multivariate data. The set of the analysis techniques resulting from these developments, such as the Mahalanobis distance \(MD   s T2 statistics is named Multivariate SPC \(MSPC extensively used in industries such as chemical [6] and mineral [7] to help process engineers identify any process 1 1978-1-4244-2622-5/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper #1279, Version 4, Updated December 19, 2008 deviations from a state of statistical control. More recently MSPC continues to evolve producing techniques that provide improved statistical control, fault detection and isolation [8], [9]. Techniques such as MD and Principal Component Analysis \(PCA  other fields of knowledge, such as image processing and pattern recognition. Similarly to what happens in the process industry, SPC and MSPC can also be applied for the health monitoring of components and systems. In fact some of those techniques have already been applied with such 


of those techniques have already been applied with such purpose. Schimert [11] uses PCA and Independent Component Analysis \(ICA with the purpose of monitoring aircraft sub-systems. Kumar et al. [12] presents the use of MD for monitoring electronic systems. Mimnagh et al. [13] presents the use of Hotelling  s T2 for the diagnostics of a helicopter drive system The present work shows an application of SPC and MSPC techniques for monitoring the health state of electromechanical components onboard an aircraft. More specifically, this paper focuses on monitoring the types of degradations of flap and slat mechanisms which may lead to surface jamming. Such health monitoring capability provides the means for identifying incipient failures allowing the execution of preventive maintenance which can avoid such jamming events along with their safety financial and operational adverse consequences The remaining sections are organized as follows: section 2 describes the system under consideration and its dynamic simulation model; section 3 presents the health monitoring techniques considered; section 4 presents the simulated tests and results and section 5 is the conclusion 2. FLAPS AND SLATS SYSTEMS AND MODEL Flaps and slats are control surfaces used for fixed wing aircraft to provide additional lift during aircraft takeoff and landing. Flaps are located on the trailing edge and slats are located on the leading edge of the wings. Unlike the main control surfaces \(elevators, ailerons and rudder be freely commanded between predefined limits, flaps and slats usually present only few possible predetermined positions. These positions are usually associated with takeoff and landing configurations for different runway 2 lengths and go-around procedures. The transition between each predetermined position is commanded by the flight crew and automatically controlled in a closed loop form to follow a definite operational pattern. Closed loops for surface position and speed control are usually implemented to guarantee the required performance for extension and retraction of flaps and slats surfaces Flaps and slats systems are usually electro-mechanical Figure 1 presents a schematic of part of a sample architecture for a flap system. The pilot/copilot moves the flap handle to one of its discrete positions. This handle provides the indication to the electronic controller, which in turn commands system electric motors and verifies position and speed feedback signals from system sensors. The torque is transmitted from the motors to the actuators through a gearbox and mechanical linkages \(usually torque tubes or flexible shafts components which transform the rotary movement from the mechanical linkages to a linear movement of extension or retraction of the surfaces Figure 1  Sample flap system architecture  Each transition from one surface position to another follows a definite pattern. Figure 2 presents a sample operational pattern for the extension of the flap surfaces. This pattern is used as a reference for the controller, which implements the closed loop control law to take the system to this reference The crew operation of these surfaces during flight also follows a definite operational procedure. For instance during approach the surface is gradually extended, one position at a time, until the system reaches the final landing configuration. Different speed limits and control surfaces trimming positions apply for each different flap/slat configuration One of the most relevant failure modes of flaps and slats electro-mechanical systems is the surface jamming. This jamming may present operational and safety adverse consequences. Various failure mechanisms may lead to a 


consequences. Various failure mechanisms may lead to a surface jam. Some failure mechanisms may be abrupt such as water freezing, but many times this failure mode is a consequence of gradual degradation of the mechanical components, which leads to a corresponding increment of total system friction. Monitoring this gradual degradation and providing early warning so that maintenance can be performed prior to system jam is the focus of this work Figure 2 - Sample operational pattern for flap extension from position X to Y  The present work was developed based on data from a flap system dynamic model.

Nonlinearities such as current limiting were included. The relevant mechanical components were represented together with the corresponding friction loads. Aerodynamic loads were also included as a function of measurable operational conditions airspeed, temperature and altitude loads. Figure 4 presents the command current, surface position and motor speed measurements for a sample flap extension simulated using the presented model. The measurements are presented at a 10Hz rate, which is compatible with current technology for data recording available onboard commercial aircraft 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 10 20 30 cu rr en t 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 50 0 50 100 po si tio n 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 5000 10000 time [s m ot or  sp ee d Figure 4 - Sensor measurements for a sample flap extension 3. HEALTH MONITORING TECHNIQUE As previously presented, each flap extension is performed according to a fixed pattern and these extensions occur at definite instants during each flight. This means that every flap extension with the same commanded positions that resulted on the measurements of Figure 4 should result in patterns which are similar to those of the figure. Therefore a statistical model could be developed from sensor data to describe the expected behavior of the system under certain conditions. The comparison between new sensor measurements and the statistical model could then be used to identify abnormalities. This is the foundation of statistical process control SPC is an analytical decision making tool which allows the detection of abnormal process behavior. Classical SPC methods check for rule violations in a group of measurements. Most of the rules use a group of measurements, and the corresponding average and standard 


measurements, and the corresponding average and standard deviation values Figure 5 illustrates the design and usage of SPC on this solution. In the modeling phase, a statistical model is built using healthy system data from a fixed pattern of operation and a threshold for normal behavior is designed. The model consists of statistical characterizations, such as means and variances from healthy system data The monitoring phase consists in a continuous comparison between new data and the patterns determined previously This comparison is performed by checking the violation of the thresholds generated in the modeling phase Extract Healthy Data from Fixed Pattern of Operation Perform Statistical Analysis Build Statistical Model Extract New Data from Fixed Pattern of Operation Perform Statistical Analysis Compare to Model System OK Y N Generate Alert Modeling Phase Monitoring Phase Figure 5 - Modeling phase and monitoring phase  Since the system presents closed loop control for speed and position, motor speed and surface position measurements are not good indicators for system degradation leading to increased friction. The control law compensates for some amount of degradation and disturbances, keeping the system working according to the required performance. Therefore these measurements would only be sensitive to degradations that are large enough to prevent the controller from performing its intended function. However, since the controller must compensate the increment in friction with an increment in motor power, the motor current is a good indicator for the degradation One possible SPC approach consists of calculating the mean and variance of a specific window of the motor current using data from various healthy system flights. The mean and variance of the population of healthy system flights in this case represent the statistical model. Then, for each new flight the mean value of the current data window is compared to a threshold to identify an abnormal behavior The threshold may be defined based on the sample variance calculated over normal system flights and a confidence limit, assuming a certain distribution, such as a gaussian distribution. The threshold may also be defined based on a non-parametric probability density function \(pdf from the measured data. The latter has the advantage of not requiring a priori assumptions on the distribution type 4 However this method requires the availability of sufficient data to build the non-parametric pdf. One method of estimating such non-parametric pdf  s may be the use of Parzen windows [14 For the univariate SPC method, the degradation index is the 


For the univariate SPC method, the degradation index is the average value of the command current, which may be calculated according to equation 1    L t ti L i 1  1  \(1 where L is the length of the time window considered and i is the measured command current One limitation of the univariate SPC approach is that other factors besides the system degradation may also lead to an increment of the command current. The main such factor is the aerodynamic load. If the surface is extended for different airspeed, altitude or air temperature conditions different dynamic pressures will be acting on the surfaces which correspond to different motor powers that must be commanded by the controller. Therefore, MSPC would be a more adequate approach for the problem. For this purpose two variables may be considered: the average values of command current and dynamic pressure over a pre-defined window. In this case, a vector of the mean values and a covariance matrix represent the statistical model Hotelling  s T2 statistic [4] indicates how far each new measurement is from the model Considering X a matrix containing current and dynamic pressures average values for a set of n healthy system data samples. The feature vector is represented in equation 2           nn T qi qi qi X 22 11 2 where q stands for dynamic pressure A statistical model can be obtained by estimating the mean and the covariance matrix from normal data according to equations 3 and 4 respectively    n i ixn 1 1?   \(3        n i T ii xxn 11 


ii xxn 11 1 ??  \(4 where xi are the columns of the X matrix After obtaining a pattern of normal behavior, it is possible to monitor the system by calculating the distance of a new data xnew to this pattern according to Hotelling  s T2 statistic Hotelling  s T2 statistic is calculated using the following equation   12 ?? ??= ?? newTnew xxT  \(5 Abnormal behaviors can be detected by checking if a threshold is violated. This threshold can be obtained parametrically according to equation 6      1\( knkF knn knntH   6 where k is the number of variables considered \(in this case two k, n  k level ? and degrees of freedom k and \(n  k assumes that the variables pdf  s are gaussian. This threshold may also be obtained non-parametrically, based on the same ideas described for the univariate SPC An additional improvement may be performed to increase the sensitivity of the method for detecting system degradations. As previously described, the operational conditions \(dynamic pressure command current but are not related to system degradation In this case, Runger U2 statistic may be used instead of Hotelling  s T2 to improve the sensitivity The method proposed by Runger [8] overcomes an important difficulty present in T2 Hotelling  s statistic and other MSPC methods. In many real applications it is possible that only a subset of variables change when an incipient failure occurs. The main idea from this method is to concentrate the analysis in these fault-sensitive variables without excluding influences of other non fault-sensitive variables in system behavior Consider an observation xi of the feature vector ikijiTi xxxx ""1=  \(7 Assuming that a fault only affects the mean of variables xi1 to xij, we can divide xi in two sets ijiTi xxy  1=  \(8 and ikjiTi xxz   9 5 where yi contains the features that are sensitive to an incipient failure and zi contains those not sensitive to failure occurrence The idea of Runger U2 statistic is to calculate Hotelling  s T2 statistic and subtract the influence of zi in the final calculated distance while keeping zi influence in yi behavior Runger U2 statistic can be defined as   122 znewz T znew zzTU ?? ???= ??  \(10 where znew is a new data vector containing just the features that are not affected by the degradation and ?z and ?z are estimated according to equations 3 and 4 respectively using a matrix of healthy system data which contains only the same set of features not affected by degradation According to Runger [8] the threshold calculation may be done in a parametric way by assuming a chi-squared distribution with a given confidence level and \(k  j degrees of freedom. This can be done when the variables pdf  s are assumed to be gaussian. Similar to the methods previously presented, non-parametric methodologies may 


also be used for defining such thresholds 4. TESTS AND RESULTS To test the described methodology, data was extracted from simulations of the described flap model. Degradation of mechanical components was simulated through the increase of overall viscous friction coefficient. The data window considered corresponds to the first 9.1 seconds after the first flap extension command performed during approach. This provides a systematic way to compare different flights and different aircraft The first step \(step 1 in Figure 6 healthy system flights to build the statistical model. 100 simulations were performed for this purpose. Operational conditions \(dynamic pressure coefficient \(B  s. The gaussian pdf considered for the viscous friction coefficient in this case accounts for manufacturing tolerances. The standard deviation \(?B of this coefficient. For each simulation the average values of command current and dynamic pressure were calculated step 2 in Figure 6 to build the feature matrix X \(step 3 in Figure 6 was then used to calculate ? and ? \(step 4 in Figure 6 the case of univariate SPC, X is a vector and a variance is calculated instead of a covariance matrix. The thresholds used were based on a 99% confidence interval from a nonparametric distribution adjusted for the statistics of each method. Table 1 presents the comparison of these thresholds with those calculated based on the assumption of gaussianity for the considered variables. Univariate SPC Hotelling T2 and Runger U2 were used and compared. It can be noticed that parametric and non-parametric approaches produced similar results in all cases Figure 6 - Steps for building the statistical model  Figure 7 - Steps for using the statistical model for monitoring the health of the system  After building the statistical model, it can be used for monitoring various instances of the system. 250 instances of the system were simulated. Each one had an initial B value B0 deviation ?B. The B value was kept constant \(B = B0 100 simulated flights, accounting for the initial health state For subsequent flights this value was increased linearly to simulate a degradation of the system. The abnormal condition is defined as the exceedance of the manufacturing limits for B. These limits were defined as  3?B  3% of the nominal value each new simulated flight dataset to obtain a degradation index \(distance to the model condition 1.

the degradation indexes for one instance of the system using each of the three considered methods. It can be noticed from the graphics that the univariate SPC using only the current information is not very sensitive to the degradation. The MSPC methods provide better sensitivity Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 present the confusion matrix for each of the three methods considering all the flights for the 250 simulated instances. To measure the sensitivity of each method, the average run length from fault occurrence to fault indication was calculated. Table 5 presents the summary of the metrics used to compare the methods Runger U2 presents the best performance for all figures of merit To guarantee that the best performance of Runger U2 is not limited to the considered threshold of 99%, the receiver operating characteristic \(ROC presents a comparison of the ROC curves for the three methods. Using the criteria of area under curve it can be noticed that Runger U2 consistently presents the best performance among the three One possibility to further improve the quality of any of these methods is to use debounce times such that more than one consecutive faulty value would be necessary to trigger a fault indication Table 1 - Comparison of the thresholds obtained with the parametric and the non-parametric methods Parametric Non-parametric SPC 0.86757 0.8804 Hotelling  s T2 9.2103 9.2789 Runger U2 6.6349 6.4636   0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 1.5 1 0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 Cycles Co m m an de d Cu rr en t A v er ag e Va lu e  Figure 8 - Degradation index evolution for one instance of the system - SPC method 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 200 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40

CONCLUSION This work presented data-driven statistical approaches to monitor the health state of aircraft flap and slat systems. The health monitoring methods were based on statistical process control concepts. The techniques were tested using data from the simulation of a flap system dynamic model Runger U2 statistics based on measurements of motor command current and operational conditions produced the best results from the considered set of techniques Future work may include the use of real aircraft data to test the presented methodologies. Another possibility is the development of prognostics algorithms using the same statistical features. This would require a better knowledge on the way the degradation evolves in the system for the failure mode under consideration REFERENCES 1] G. E. P. Box; J. S. Hunter and W. G.

this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
