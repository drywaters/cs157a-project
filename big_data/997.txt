In urban area most buildings can be simplified to the models that are made up of approximate plane surfaces to which features of buildings refer, in this paper. Among these surfaces, there are distinct points and intersection lines \(the edges and vertices of the building object restoration, model parameter calculation, and model reconstruction constitute the main research of extracting geometric features and modeling the object. In this contribution some examples of deriving information from the point clouds are presented to demonstrate the method. And, the results prove that when the geometric information of vertices, edges and normal lines of the plane surface, together with the topological relations \(Surface adjacency relations is derived from the point cloud data, the model, representing building in this paper, can be built effectively. Equally significant, models generated from this method, while occupying less memory space, can store more comprehensive structural information, and have a better exhibitive effect. And this method can provide three dimensional data of buildings from point cloud data in applications like GIS, navigation and virtual city I.  INTRODUCTION In recent years, the automation and computer-assisted technology of 3D surface modeling, which is based on the surface point clouds of 3D entity, has gradually become the foundation of virtual reality, decision analysis and computerassisted design. And the sources of point clouds show the trend of diversification, such as Space-borne and ground-based LiDAR data. In the realms of surveying, urban planning, and urban 3D landscape modeling, the objects of modeling are normally buildings which consist of plentiful plane surfaces in most cases. Therefore, utilizing the information extracted from the corresponding point clouds, the research of deriving building features, especially plane features, has practical needs The main characteristics of these modeling targets are 1.The object, such as the complex polyhedrons, has many regularly plane surfaces or approximate plane surfaces. 2. The object might only have a small quantity of curved surfaces. 3 The angle between normal lines of two adjacent surfaces is always an approximate right angle. The characteristics determine that it is necessary to model buildings in a new method, which is different from methods in reverse engineering [1] and other fields [2]. At the same time, extraction of geometric information of plane surfaces, such as vertices edges and normal lines and acquisition of the topological relationships among those are the most critical parts To achieve the goal mentioned above, several processes should be done: 1. Error elimination of point clouds [3]. 2 Triangle mesh model generation [4]. In the focus of the research extracting basic geometric information of a plane surface is 


extracting basic geometric information of a plane surface is based on the triangle mesh model of 3D object. Besides topological information transmission and spatial index methods are used to solve the problem of the shortage of the geometric and topological information Then after the three main processes, plane detection surface adjacency relations restoration, and model parameter calculation and model reconstruction, the 3D object can be expressed by both simple and abstract geometric features  II. MAIN PARTS IN THE RESEARCH OF DERIVING FEATURES FROM THE POINT CLOUDS OF BUILDING IN URBAN AREA A. Plane detection The process of Plane detection is based the triangle mesh of the building  s surface, as well as the normal and the topologic relationship of the triangles. In this paper, the method used to achieve this aim is growth triangle classification  starting with an initial growth triangle, based on the share relationship of edge among triangles. This approach classifies the triangles whose differences of normal lines are small, in a continuous region, into one class The  class  here means a surface. As to the building, the surface is represented by a mathematical plane. With the vertices coordinates of the triangles, which belong to the same class, the equation of each surface could be calculated. Due to 2009 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event  978-1-4244-3461-9/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE the data loss at the vertices and edges of the building in the sampling process of point clouds, some originally non-existed surfaces would appear in the model; therefore, these falsely added surfaces should be eliminated from the final result B. Recursive algorithm of Plane detection All the triangles, through recursive algorithm, are classified into several classes, according to the normal lines and the relation of the adjacent triangles The main processes of the growth triangle classification are as follows  Step 1: Input one triangle as the initial growth triangle from the triangle mesh of the object adjacent triangles into the growth candidate array  Step 2: Traverse the adjacent triangles of the initial growth triangle, and if the difference of the normal lines between the initial growth triangle and its adjacent triangle is less than the threshold provisions the adjacent triangle is classified as the same class of the previous one. And its adjacent triangles are also added to the growth candidate array  Step 3:  Calculate the average normal and the total area of the current class  Step 4: Traverse all the triangles in the growth candidate array, and use the triangle as input of step 1 The process from 1 to 3 will repeat until no triangle meets the condition of step 2  Step 5: Traverse all the unclassified triangles, and use one of these triangles as input of step 1. The process from step 1 to 3 will repeat until all the triangles are classified In this process, recursive algorithm can accelerate the growth triangle classification. The main substance of recursive algorithm is expressed in Figure 1. At the end of every recursive process, a new class of surface is detected And Figure 2 shows the result of recursive algorithm of growth triangle classification. Different yellow levels in Figure 2 represent different surfaces \(one surface here is tantamount to one class in the triangle classification C. Surface adjacency relations restoration Due to the unorganized discrete sampling of point cloud d a t a   t h e  m a j o r  s u r f a c e s  e x t r a c t e d  i n  t h e  P l a n e  d e t e c t i o n  l a c k  the adjacency relations. But these relations are significant and 


the adjacency relations. But these relations are significant and basic information to obtain the geometric features and build the model of the object Two methods are employed in this paper to help restore the surface adjacency relations. The first method is based on a 3D spatial index. Like Figure 3 shows that, the space, containing the point clouds, is first subdivided into small commensurate cubes, whose sizes are determined by sampling density. Under this circumstance, every surface of the building penetrates a set of cubes, therefore the spatial range of each surface, known as its buffer could be expressed by the very set of cubes. Finally the adjacency relations of the surfaces could be obtained through comparison among buffers, if two buffers include same cubes, the two surfaces is contiguous; else they are not The adjacency relations cannot be directly taken out from the adjacency relations of the triangles, because data might get lost in the sampling process of point clouds at the vertices and edges of the building the three 3D surfaces \(not plane index Figure 1.  Recursive algorithm of Growth Triangle Classification  Figure 2.  Result of  Plane detection,different  color represent different surface \(a. a part of a building surface; b. a cylinder object The second method is based on the transferring of surface adjacency relations. Because there are many small surfaces considered as noise adjacency relations of major surfaces are lost, which actually 2009 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event  978-1-4244-3461-9/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE exist between the real surfaces. So this method employs these small surfaces to transfer the adjacency relations between the major surfaces. Just like Figure 4 shows that, surface 4, 5, 6 are noise surfaces, and the adjacency relations between major surfaces 1, 2, 3 are lost. As an example of this method, the noise surface 4 is the adjacency surface of major surface 1 and 2. So the surface 4 will transfer this contiguous relation to the major surface 1 and 2. In this way, the surface adjacency relations among the major surfaces can be restored  Figure 3. 3D spatial index  Figure 4. Surface adjacency relations restoration  D. Model Parameter Calculation and Model Reconstruction The contiguous relations of the object  s surfaces could reveal that the two surfaces which share a common edge and the three or more surfaces which share a same vertex. Then the coordinates of all vertices, together with the equations of all edges, could be calculated based on the equations of the surfaces [6]. Furthermore, the contiguous relations of plane surfaces help to determine the two vertices which are the terminal points of a certain edge, and the edges which surround a certain surface [7][8]. At this point, the whole building model is built from the point cloud. The geometric features, including vertices, edges and normal lines of plane surfaces, are already extracted from the point clouds data. And the topological relationships among the geometric features are also obtained The results are expressed in next Section: Examples  III. EXAMPLES In this section, a practical example is presented to prove the method demonstrated above of deriving Features and building modeling from LIDAR point clouds in Urban Area. The vertices, edges and normal lines of the plane surface, and the topology relationships among them are extracted from the point cloud data of a building in urban area The building point cloud data are taken from a groundbased LiDAR scanner. Due to certain substances, such as trees which are near the building and some small parts of the 


trees which are near the building and some small parts of the building that could obstruct other parts, the data is not complete  Figure 5. An example of building point cloud data and the extracted plane features The data has 36972 points. And after triangle mesh construction there are 73113 triangles that made up of the surface Figure 5 shows the features derived and the original point clouds. From Figure 5, the result of modeling building and derived features prove the feasibility of the method demonstrated in the section 2. There are totally ten planes extracted from the point cloud data to make up the building model In Figure 6, the ten plane surfaces are shown in the picture along. In this picture, the main structure expressed by simple planes demonstrates that the method fits this type of building point cloud data well. And using this method to model the building only records a small amount of parameters 2009 Urban Remote Sensing Joint Event  978-1-4244-3461-9/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE  Figure 6.

Update Once new route plans have been devised verify them and upload them to vehicles via their M2M connection. Additional information such as firmware upgrades can also be transmitted if and when necessary Act On board the vehicle, whenever new scheduling is received, locally stored information is updated to inform the driver of re-planning. If the container has an RFID scanner installed, a scan of current freight will be compared against the new schedule to verify compliance. If other data, e.g firmware upgrades, are received, they are installed automatically In particular, during the deliberation phase, route optimization and the derivation of schedules can directly use both information relating to vehicles movements as they proceed through delivery schedules and feedback from RFID transponders notifying when orders have been added to or removed. This real-time component implies that time windows can be more finely tuned according to current events, resulting in alternative schedules that can either compensate for delays or take advantage of time saved. Preliminary results with a prototype demonstrate that employing real-time data in the optimization process can further reduce transportation operating costs by up to 3 beyond the 5-10% achieved from the standard optimization process described earlier - depending on the particular business case, order structure and system configuration  5. Challenges and Conclusions  There remain many scientific and practical challenges related to the design and use of real-time dispatching and optimizatio n systems. A selection of these we consider as relevant to LS/ATN and for consideration by the community at large are as follows A major challenge is the effective handling of intercompany, inter-region and inter-modal transportation Transportation intrinsically involves multiple carriers operating both within and across sectors \(i.e., road, air and shipping\ and across geographical boundaries Each carrier has their own, often proprietary, systems that do not necessarily integrate easily with one another. Addressing this integration problem is a significant engineering issue to be faced as the technologies addressed in this article come into more widespread use The integration of transportation planners into supply chain and production systems is also important As previously mentioned, freight is now often delivered directly to manufacturing plants without passing through transitional storage. Integration of these systems thus becomes a priority when shaping dynamic supply chains, and supply networks OBUs in use today typically consist of a simple processor, memory and communication interfaces Installed software is often designed solely for reading data from sensors and transmitting it to the TMS. One method of improving on this design is the integration of an autonomous software controller into the OBU to assist with the manipulation and coordination of collected on-board data. Example uses include assisting in the selection of M2M connection type in a multi-provider environment according to the type and volume of data to be transmitted and caching data locally if connections are temporarily unavailable. The controller can be further extended with a software agent that extends the distributed intelligence offered by the TMS optimizer. This agent essentially acts as a remote extension of the optimization platform allowing the agent to act as a proxy representative of the vehicle itself within the context of route scheduling. Vehicles can thus become active participants in the planning process, forming a network overlay of communicating data processors Further research is required on so-called smart  freight containers capable of announcing their presence and even negotiating with external devices. For example, a simple OBU fixed to a container will allow it to communicate with vehicles, customs checks and equipment at freight consolidation centers. Many major transportation companies use such centers, distributed at strategic locations, with the primary goal of consolidating freight onto as few vehicles as possible to maximize use of available capacity. With the installation of RFID readers, incoming freight with RFID tags can be traced as it moves through a facility providing TMS optimizers with complete coverage of freight location throughout its entire lifecycle within the business chain In addition, external factors also favor early adoption of pervasive technologies, such as the ongoing escalation of fuel prices and constant increases in demand for fast, high-volume freight shipping. This is recognized in the European Union white paper European Transport Policy for 2010  h ic h discusses the use of intelligent information services integrated with route planning systems and mobile communications to provide real-time, intelligent endto-end freight and vehicle tracking and tracing There can be little doubt that the adoption of intelligent transportation planners capable of using real-time data sourced from pervasive technologies such as those discussed in this article is a major objective of many freight transportation operators both in Europe and other areas of the world. With these techniques now widely recognized as an important Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8

The fact that the genotypes have been generated by recombination makes it very hard to close the set of bases by intersection. As mentioned before, haplotype inference studies usually select data from blocks where recombination probability is almost 0, so the instances in our experiments with recombination level 4, 16 and 40 are not even realistic but were tested because they are a kind of standard in the literature The results of the non-uniform instances are shown in table IV. Non-uniform instances are a little harder than uniform instances. Taking into consideration the number haplotypes generated by each preprocessing method we can see that the difference gets bigger as the problem size grows being zero or almost 0 for the smallest instances. It is also worth noticing that the time spent by the tabu search when data is preprocessed with the set-based preprocessing is lower than that of the RTIP preprocessing for 78 of the 90 instances The hapmap instances are considered hard; the execution

For small instances RTIP-based method is usually quicker and the number of haplotypes generated is almost the same as the number of haplotypes generated by the RTIP-based procedure. This is a deterministic process so execution times are quite similar Although the tabu search process was firstly implemented to test the preprocessing procedures it has proved to be an effective algorithm for the HIPP problem. The refinement process in the intensification phase is probably the strongest procedure in the tabu search; this is the procedure that, in most cases, returns the optimal solution Table V shows the result of the total number of instances solved by our algorithm another five solvers, which can be found in the reference section. Our algorithm, which was implemented in Java, was tested with a time limit of 10,000 seconds on a MacBook 2.1 with an Intel Core 2 Duo processor up to 2.16GHz and 3GB RAM, although, JVM  s maximum heap size \(on Mac OS X five solvers were tested by Lin  e and Marques-Silva  [10 with a time limit of 10,000 seconds, using a 1.9GHz Athlon XP. However, using different machines to test the solver does not mean that the number of solved instances can be increased, since, when solved, the executions of our algorithm never took longer than 4 minutes  VI. CONCLUSIONS We have presented a new preprocessing algorithm for the HIPP problem coupled with a tabu search. This new preprocessing is based on manipulating subsets of haplotypes instead of haplotype units. The experimental results show that in the hardest instances this new preprocessing step can dramatically decrease the time spent by the whole algorithm \(preprocessing + tabu search fact is due to the reduction in the search space provoked by the new preprocessing. On the other hand, the new preprocessing does not work properly in instances with recombination. However, we can think about the two proposed preprocessing algorithm as complementary procedures, because the weaknesses of the set-based procedure \(recombination and small instances solved by the RTIP-based procedure As mentioned before, our aim was to develop a new preprocessing method to deal with large problem instances but, since the implemented tabu search has proved to be an effective algorithm, new functionalities should be developed  VII.

South Korean versus American market  In terms of the effect of WOM, we find no discernable difference in the motion picture markets of South Korea and the United States. Volume of WOM is positively correlated to the following week?s revenue in both markets, and valence of WOM is not significant The effect of critical reviews, however, did not concur While the literature on the American market data reports that positive critical reviews are positively related to box office revenue[21, 34], the results on the Korean market was different. There could be several reasons for this. First, South Korea and the United States have different sources for critical reviews, and the sources may have different impacts on moviegoers Second, the characteristics of critics might be different i.e., Korean critics may prefer movies that are considered less commercial or artistic than American critics  5. Conclusion  WOM and critical reviews both are important attributes that influence box office revenue in the motion picture industry. In this study, six hypotheses related to this issue were set up and tested. Data was collected on the motion picture industry of South Korea by using several websites that provide content and statistical data about movies. Finally, data on 118 movies was collected and the movies were categorized into two groups based on the distributors of the movies If the distributor of a movie was one of the major distributors in South Korea, that movie was categorized into mainstream movies, and if not then the movie was categorized into non-mainstream movies. As expected mainstream movies had much higher box office revenue and volume of WOM than non-mainstream Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews 


movies. In the case of the volume of critical reviews however, there was no big difference between mainstream and non-mainstream movies. WOM and critical reviews were usually positive H1 and H2 tested the relationship between WOM and weekly box office revenue, and the results supported the hypotheses. The volume of WOM was positively related to weekly box office revenue, while the valence of WOM had no significant effect. H3 H4a, and H4b tested the impact of critical reviews, and the results also supported the hypotheses except H4b The volume and valence of critical reviews had no consistent significances to weekly box office revenue H3 H4b. Table 7 showed that the number of critical reviews was statistically significant to aggregate box office revenue \(H4a for the attitude of critical reviews \(H4b the result more detail, an additional test was performed using only those factors related to critical reviews as independent variables. The result of the additional test supported H4, but the signs were reversed, i.e. positive critical reviews had minus signs, and negative critical reviews had plus signs. This reversed signs imply that the preference of critical reviewers is very similar to that of normal moviegoers. H5s and H6s tested the different effects of WOM and critical reviews on mainstream and non-mainstream movies. The result failed to determine that WOM give different impact on mainstream and non-mainstream movies, so H5a and H5b were rejected. H6, however, was supported, i.e the effects of critical reviews were different for mainstream and non-mainstream movies. There were no significant relationships between critical reviews and aggregate box office revenue in mainstream movies. For non-mainstream movies, however, the volume of critical reviews and the percentage of negative critical reviews were significant. Nonmainstream movies have fewer sources from which consumers can get information, and this might explain the results The above findings lead to several managerial implications. First, producers and distributors of movies could forecast weekly box office revenue by looking at previous weeks? volume of WOM. It does not matter what attitude people have when they spread WOM, the important factor is its volume. Therefore producers and distributors need to develop an appropriate strategy to manage WOM for their movies For example, the terms related to WOM marketing such as buzz and viral marketing are easily found Second, for the distributors who usually distribute less commercial and more artistic movies, and consequently have a smaller market compared to the major distributors, critical reviews can impact their movies box office revenues in a significant way. There are usually fewer sources for information for nonmainstream movies than mainstream movies, and so small efforts could leverage the outcomes. Finally, for those who are dealing with mainstream movies, the finding that the valence of WOM and critical reviews do not have significant relationship with box office revenue can have certain implications. Particularly, the attitude of critical reviews showed reversed effects Therefore, they may need to concentrate on other features rather than attitude of moviegoers or critical reviews, such as encouraging moviegoers to spread WOM This study contributes to the understanding of the motion picture industry, especially the relationship between box office revenue and WOM including critical reviews. There are existing studies that already 


critical reviews. There are existing studies that already dealt with similar issues, but this study has some differentiated features compare to prior studies. First the data used in this study was collected from South Korea, while most of the relevant studies usually focus on the North American market. This helps to provide the opportunity to understand the international market especially the Asian market, even though South Korea is a small part of it in terms of the motion picture industry. Second, movies were categorized to two groups, i.e. mainstream and non-mainstream and this study attempted to determine how WOM impacts these categories differently by testing several hypotheses In this study, there are also several limitations that could be dealt with in future research. First, using box office revenue as a dependent variable is more meaningful for distributers rather than producers. Due to there is close correlation between box office revenue and number of screens, one of producers? main concerns is how many screens their movies can be played on. Moreover, DVD sales are also important measurement for success of movies these days, and so it also could be a dependent variable. Therefore, it could be possible to give more fruitful managerial implications to various players in the motion picture industry by taking some other dependent variables Second, in this study, movies were categorized simply as mainstream and non-mainstream movies, but there could be further studies with diverse techniques of movie categorizations. For example, it would be possible to study the varying influence of WOM or critical reviews on different genres or movie budgets Third, an interesting finding of this study is that positive critical reviews could have negative relationship with box office revenue while negative critical reviews could have positive relationship. This study tried to provide a reasonable discussion on the issue, but more studies could be elaborate on it  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 References  1] Dellarocas, C., The Digitization of Word of Mouth Promise and Challenges of Online Feedback Mechanisms Management Science, 2003. 49\(10 2] Bone, P.F., Word-of-mouth effects on short-term and long-term product judgments.
