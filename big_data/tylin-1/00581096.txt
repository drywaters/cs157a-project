THE APPLICATION OF DATABASE MINING TECHNIQUES TO DATA FUSION IN SPATIAL DATABASES Janusz R Getta, Lusiana and Phillip J McKerrow Department of Computer Science University of Wollongong Northfields Ave Wollongong NSW 2522 Australia e-mail j rg Lusiana, p hillip} @cs uow  edu au ABSTRACT This work applies some of the techniques used in min ing of association rules in large relational databases to fusion of data from large 
spatial databases The specific objective is to show that algorithms developed for the identification of frequent itemsets in the rela tional databases can be after slight modifications suc cessfully used to fuse complex two dimensional objects from large amounts of range data collected with ultra soinic sensors The paper presents two algorithms that use this approach to construct polylines and polygons from ultrasonic range data 1 INTRODUCTION Data fusion is commonly defined as a process of ex tracting useful 
information from noisy sensor data 5 6,7 141 We prefer to view data fusion as a process that synthesis of information about complex real world ob jects from raw and low level informationobtained from external sensors Data fusion techniques provide an important shift in abstraction from information about properties of primitive objects to properties of the ob jects at the higher levels of abstraction Different data furjion strategies strongly depend on the format of in put data e.g 
signals maps of pixels or collections of primitive geometric elements In our approach we sh<all consider data fusion from a large set of geometri cal primitive elements  line sections  into two dimen sional complex geometrical objects Database mining is the data-driven extraction of information from large databases 4 Its objective is to identify the patterns rules or functions that occur This work was supported by a Small ARC Grant 
obtained form The University of Wollongong in large amounts of experimental and measured data Understanding of data, that is learning about implicit information from explicit data is important for the sup port of making strategic decision and for technical ap plications Database mining also provides a shift in ab straction from information about the elementary facts into a collection of rules that govern the occurrences of these facts Our prime objective is to develop the algorithms to fuse 
ultrasonic range data collected by a mobile robot as it navigates through a room into a formal descrip tion of an indoor environment using spatial database techniques The robots with ultrasonic sensors take sets of readings as they move through the environment The readings are converted into primitive geometric el ements  edges and surface segments S 91 The pro posed data fusion algorithms will combine the primi tive elements obtained in a 
random order from several robots into complex two dimensional objects and de termine the location of such objects An important assumption is that a database of prim itive geometric elements is so large that it cannot be entirely stored and processed in fast transient memory As a consequence of this assumption we have to con sider a class of data fusion algorithms that promote an efficient management of persistent memory and that minimize the number of data transfers 
between tran sient and persistent memory Efficient data fusion of complex objects from a large database of primitive geo metrical elements requires optimal organisation of spa tial structures of persistent memory and minimization of passes through the database This is the reason why we believe that some of the techniques which are presently used in database mining can be adopted to data fusion in large spatial databases 0-7803-3601 -1/96/$5.00 0 1996 IEEE 135 


The problem of mining association rules out of so called basket data has its roots in the processing of massive databases that contain data about customer transactions in large supermarkets l 2 3 12 131 An example of an association rule is an implication say ing that 98 of the customers that purchase tires and car accessories also get a car service done Identifi cation of such rules in commercial data is valuable for marketing analysis of buying patterns sales programs and strategies An important part in the identifica tion of association rules is the discovery of frequent large itemsets A frequent itemset is a set of objects items such that the number of its occurrences in the customer transactions exceeds a certain threshold Our hypothesis is that the techniques used to discover fre quent itemsets are similar to those required for fusion of data in large spatial databases Thus its solutions can be used to develop efficient data fusion algorithms We observe that at a certain level of abstraction the objectives of data fusion and discovery of frequent itemsets are almost the same In both cases we need to synthesis the structures of complex objects from large sets of elementary primitive objects In data fusion membership of a primitive element in a complex ob ject is determined by its position in two dimensional space In database mining a frequent itemset is a col lection of semantically related elementary items An item belongs to a frequent itemset if it has is-part of is-component-of type of relationship etc with the other items from such a set Discovery of the frequent itemsets is done by anal ysis of customer transactions Is it possible to detect such transactions in a data fusion case  In order to answer this questions we have to investigate what does the term transaction mean for discovery of frequent itemsets  If we assume an ideal case where the cus tomers always purchase all components of one or more complex objects then each transaction precisely rep resents such objects Unfortunately customers some times buy only subsets of complex objects However these cases do not completely destroy the above defi nition of transaction In these cases a transaction is a rough approximation of one or more complex objects Discovery of frequent itemsets is equivalent to iden tification of complex objects from their rough approxi mations Therefore in a data fusion case a transaction should always be a rough approximation of complex geometrical objects How do we detect such trans actions  The idea is to divide a space of primitive objects into small partitions and to register which ob ject fits within each partition Then a description of each partition is equivalent to a transaction The par titions should be constructed in such a way that their shapes are rough approximations of the fused objects One of the problems is identification of the best partitioning strategy A regular square grid is one of standard space partitioning techniques recommended by the theory and practice of spatial databases lo In our case square grid is not the best approximation of line segments If we assume that a partition should roughly approximate the objects then its shape should be similar to the shape of the objects For instance if we expect to fuse long straight lines e.g walls then the elements of grid should be similar to long and narrow rectangles The next problem is an efficient analysis of the par titions One of the local aims in discovery of frequent itemsets is elimination of all transactions that are bad approximations of complex objects It is achieved by the decomposition of entire set of transactions into sev eral smaller subsets which are  seeds for complex objects Transactions which are inconsistent with a decomposition are skipped An important property is that all transactions are independent Such an assump tion is not valid in the data fusion case This is why an analysis of partitions cannot be done in exactly the same way For instance if two partitions overlap or if they have a common border then it is possible that both of them represent the same complex object In formation about the relative position of two or more partitions can be used to eliminated some of them or to synthesis an object that overlaps several partitions The partitions are constructed in one pass through the entire database of primitive geometrical objects We test the parameters of each object in order to find all of the partitions that it belongs to Then each ob ject is replaced with its identifier which is later written into the representations of respective partitions Effi ciency of this step strongly depends on our ability to minimize the number of partitions an object is inserted into In the next step the partitions with the largest num ber of objects are used to synthesis the initial com plex objects The other partitions that represent only parts of complex objects are discarded This step re quires the comparison of partition properties and its efficiency depends on the number size and representa tion of partitions The complex objects identified in the first pass are written to a new database This database is used for fusion of the higher level complex objects in the next passes Section 2 describes the organisation of the spatial database and integration of the elementary line seg ments into grid representation An algorithm for fusion of polylines from grid elements is presented in Section 3 Finally, Section 4 describes fusion of the polygons from 136 


Figure 1 Grid planes the descriptions of polylines and information about the ba;sic movements of sensing devices 2 DATABASE Fusion of complex two dimensional objects starts with the integration of elementary line segments obtained from the ultrasonic sensors into a spatial database The description of elementary line segment is a quadruple PI p2 p  p where pl and pa are the endpoints of the segment while p and p are the locations of the sens ing device when the current line segment was detected Thie direction of line segment is relative to the x-axis of the coordinate system A conceptual view of the database is formed by a sequence of n planes pl  pn such that the coordinate systems of adjacent planes pi and pi+l are rotated by angle 6 where n x 6  T see Figure 1 Each plane contains information about all of the line segments whose angle lies between the x-axis of plane pi and the x-axis of pi 6 The planes are partitioned into a uniform rectangu lar grid whose horizontal lines are parallel to the x-axis and vertical lines are parallel to the y-axis The size of a single grid element is determined by an assump tion that no line segments span over more than two ad.jacent rows Therefore the height of grid element must be greater than d x sin\(6/2 where d is an ex pected maximum length of segments and 6 is an angle by which coordinates of plane pi+l are rotated in re spect to coordinates of plane pi The width of grid element is an integer multiplication of its height that is width  IC  height All grid elements are divided into k square zones The spatial database of grid elements is implemented in object-oriented database technology Collection of k+3 k+2 k+l k Figure 2 Grid elements and zones i+3 i+2 I I i-1 all grid elements is represented in the database by a class of grid objects An instance of grid object con sists of logical identifier the descriptions of all zones in the respective grid element and descriptions of all places from where the line segments that span over the grid element have been detected In order to reduce access time a class of grid objects is partitioned into n database clusters in such a way that a single cluster contains the instances of all objects representing the grid elements from only one plane A database cluster is a collection of objects which are physically stored closed to each other i.e in the same disk block or in a segment of consecutive disk blocks placed on the same disk track or on the same cylinder Further reduction of access time is achieved by in dexing the grid objects over their logical identifiers Such index maps the coordinates of grid elements into the physical addresses of respective grid objects Logi cal identifiers of grid objects are constructed by con catenation of string representations of row and col umn numbers separated by a nondigit delimiter Each database cluster has a separate index Separate index ing of clusters decreases size of each index and allows for simultaneous access to more than one cluster Fi nally to speed up a horizontal scan of grid planes the grid objects representing the grid elements from the same row and adjacent columns are linked by refer ences to their physical addresses Object-oriented database management system Ode v 4.2 ll is used for implementation of the database Integration of line segments is performed in the fol lowing way For each line segment the system finds its direction and identifies grid plane pi it belongs to The line segment is rotated by angle 4 x 6 in order to adjust its endpoints to coordinate system of plane pi The endpoints of rotated line segment are transformed into numbers of rows and columns of all grid elements overlapped by a segment If a segment spans over sev eral grid elements then it is partitioned into a number of smaller segments. Index of cluster representing plane pi is accessed to find the physical addresses of respective 137 


grid objects Approximate position of a line segment is recorded in the database by incrementing all counters associated with all zones overlapped by a segment At the end of this process the groups of line segments with similar orientations are represented by the grid objects stored in the same cluster Density of line segments per elementary area of grid element is represented by the respective zone counters Figure 2 Note that zones play a similar role to products pur chased by a customer and grid elements are similar to transactions in the problem of frequent itemsets min ing Like in the previous case we search for all combi nations of zones such that their counters exceed a given threshold level 3 POLYLINES Fusion of polylines is done in two stages First the system constructs the elementary polylines on the sep arate grid planes Next the endpoints of elementary polylines from different grid planes are matched to fuse longer polylines In the same step, all short polylines whose directions are contradictory to directions of the larger polylines are identified as wrong measurements and are removed from the database To fuse elementary polylines the system randomly picks a nonempty grid element on an arbitrarily se lected plane The first step is to check whether the selected grid element actually represents the majority of line sections in this area In order to identify the grid element that contains the maximum number of line sections we scan vertically through all of the grid planes and compare zone counters of all grid elements in the nearest neighbourhood of initially selected grid element A grid element with the largest value of all zone counters is adopted as the best starting point Next we move to the next previous column on the same grid plane to find the largest rectangular ar eas of zones with counters greater than a given thresh old value In this process all zones whose counters are less than a given threshold value are discarded This procedure is repeated for all columns on the left and right hand side of a starting grid element until a col umn with no adjacent grid elements is found Rect angles identified in this process are used to construct the elementary polylines in the following way For any two adjacent rectangles ri and ri+1 a point pi\(zi,yi in the middle of their common border is found If a rectangle has no left right neighbour then the posi tion of the leftmost rightmost point is in the middle of its leftmost rightmost edge A sequence of points constructed in such a way determines the corners of an elementary polyline  see Figure 3  Figure 3 Construction of elementary polyline It is important to note that different sensors usually provide inconsistent information about position and shape of sensed objects This is why elementary poly lines cannot be treated as exact representation of solid objects Elementary polyline may considered as a core of fuzzy polylzne whose shape and width is determined by the grid elements with nonzero zone counters In fact due to the errors and limited precision of the measurements we encounter the same problem as in mining of frequent itemsets Combinations of items obtained at the end of mining process depend on a threshold value which is used for representation of the term frequent In our case the shape of elementary polylines depends on a threshold value which is used for elimination of zones with the small counter values  4 POLYGONS The final objective of data fusion is to construct the polygons that represent free and occupied areas of the analyzed space Fusion of the polygons is based on information about polylines sensing routes and sens ing directions obtained from the analysis of elementary line segments and fusion of the polylines in the previous steps We consider either explicit or implicit polygon fusion Explicit fusion provides the results in the form of a complete map of all free and occupied areas Im plicit fusion does not provide full information about all areas in a format that can be directly interpreted in a visual way Its objective is to construct the additional database structures that speed up computation of the spatial queries related to free and occupied areas For example the database structures that improve performance of the navigation queries are one of the goals of implicit fusion Explicit fusion is more time consuming than implicit fusion because identification of all free and occupied areas requires multiple accesses to the database Typically, implicit fusion requires no more than a single scan of entire database Our implementation of explicit fusion merges the descriptions of elementary areas into a collection of free and occupied polygons f and o-polygons Informa 138 


fused polyline Figure 4 Elementary free and occupied areas tioln about position and shape of the elementary areas is obtained from the description of polylines sensing routes and sensing directions An elementary area is a pair of adjacent free and occupied areas A free area is a polygon whose boundaries consist of a fused polyline on one side and the route of the sensing device on the other The remaining two edges are the parallel sens ing directions An occupied area is a polygon whose boundary on one side is a fused polyline and on the other side the maximum range of the sensing device The parallel sensing directions form the left and right hand sides of the elementary occupied area A sample elementary area is given in Figure 4 The explicit fusion off and o-polygons starts with the merging of any two overlapping elementary areas Thle result consists of one o-polygon and two f-polygons Figure 5 presents a sample merge of two elementary ar ear into i 0-polygon,\(ii iii and iv v unknown areas The fused polygons consist of either solid or dot ted edges A solid edge represents a border between free and occupied areas while a dotted edge repre sents a border between either a free or an occupied area and unknown area Fusion of the remaining f anjd o-polygons is performed by successive merges of the elementary areas with the already obtained poly goins In order to speed up identification of overlapping elementary areas and f and o-polygons the entire space is indexed by an R-tree When a full map of free and occupied areas is not needed implicit fusion is more effective In our case implicit fusion targets a class of navigational queries whiere an objective is to find whether a path from one location to another is entirely made up of f-polygons Computation of such queries requires a number of it erations over the database contents A single iteration statrts with the identification of all f-polygons that con tain a given point Then for an arbitrarily selected Figure 5 Merge of two elementary areas f-polygon the intersection of its border and the current segment of the route is found The intersection point is moved outside of the f-polygon by a small distance in the direction of the current route segment In the next iteration a new set of f-polygons is found The iterations are repeated until the destination of a route is reached or no f-polygon can be found on the current path Efficiency of such an algorithm strongly depends on how fast it is possible to find all f-polygons that contain a given point in a single iteration One of the solutions would be to fuse of f-polygons only in a given direc tion In our case it is possible to fuse elementary free areas and later on use them as f-polygons Correctness of such an approach is justified by the fact that the merging of free elementary areas with any other area always provides a free area of the same shape The additional advantage of this approach is that spatial index structures constructed for fusion of the polylines can be re-used for more effective computation of a con tainment test A procedure to find a sequence of f-polygons in order to detect a possible path for the robot is as follows A grid plane whose direction vector is perpendicular to the direction of a current route segment is selected The coordinates of the destination point are used to find the column number on a selected grid plane Next the procedure finds all elementary polylines that cross the given column An index that maps col umn numbers into descriptions of all elementary poly lines that cross the columns allows for fast selection of relevant elementary polylines The descriptions of elementary polylines leads to the descriptions of full polylines, sensing routes and sensing direction From such information it is possible to fuse a description of the respective free elementary area A standard test that checks the number of intersec tion points of a current route segment with the borders of free elementary area is done to determine whether a 139 


point is included within the free area If only one inter section point is found we consider it as the next place on the route to which it is possible to move the robot Otherwise a movement is impossible and another free elementary area should be fused If on a given plane there is no free elementary areas that contain a point then the same procedure is repeated for the next grid plane An index of elementary lines that cross the columns on each grid plane is used to minimize the number of containment tests 5 SUMMARY The main objective of this work was to apply the se lected database mining techniques to fuse two dimen sional objects from the range sensor data We assumed that line segments are submitted in a random order by a number of robots with ultrasonic sensors Moreover the total number of line segments is so large that infor mation about all of them must be stored in the spatial database We argue that it is possible to adopt the techniques normally used for the discovery of associa tion rules to fuse polylines and polygons from sensor data The paper proposes organisation of the spatial database that integrates information about the sensed objects The main contributions of the paper are the algorithms for fusion of the polylines and polygons from grid elements There is still a number of directions for future re search In our case organisation of the spatial database is more based on spatial clustering than on the tradi tional methods of spatial indexing Efficiency of this approach should be confirmed by the experimental re sults When the large number of elementary free and occupied areas are fused into f  and o polygons the efficient merge of polygons and elementary areas is still an open problem 6 REFERENCES Agrawal R Imielinski T Swami A Mining As sociation Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc of the ACM SIGMOD Intl Conf on Management of Data pp 207-216 May 1993 Agrawal R Imielinski T Swami A Database Mining A Performance Perspective IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering 5\(6 pp 914 925, 1993 Agrawal R Srikant R Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules Proc of the 20th Intl Conf. on Very Large Databases VLDB September 1994 41 51 E61 71 E81 Fayyad U.M Piatetsky-Shapiro G Smyth P.J Uthurusamy R Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining AAAI/MIT Press 1995 Henderson T Weitz E Hansen C Multisensor Knowledge Systems Interpreting 3D Structure Int.

old as in Section 6.2 and increasing confidence thresholds For example, the WWW database was mined with confi dence thresholds of 0.06 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 and 0.9 using a 0.06 support threshold in all cases The results of the application of this preprocessing tech nique on the association rules outputted by these ten min ing processes of the WWW database are summarized in the upper left hand histogram of Figure 2 Each gray bar indi cates the number of rules mined using a specific confidence threshold For example, the first leftmost gray bar in the WWW histogram depicts the 9,206 association rules that were mined with 0.06 confidence level The black bar su perimposed on it indicates the number of rules deleted as a result of the application of this preprocessing technique on the respective list of rules, 3,793 in this case That is over 41 of the rules mined by from the WWW database us ing 0.06 support and confidence thresholds were deleted by Interestingness Preprocessing technique 1. This deletion is very significant considering that no information of any sort was required to perform it. This Interestingness Preprocess ing technique performed even better on the output of mining the WWW database using increasingly higher confidence levels deleting as much as 65 of the rules mined with 0.9 confidence levels, as indicated by the rightmost bar in the WWW database histogram out of the 1,503 rules mined the rightmost gray bar\977 rules \(the superimposed black bar\rules were deleted The other five histograms in Fig ure 2 summarize the results of applying the first Interesting ness PreProcessing technique to the other five databases The average deletion brought about by the application of the first Interestingness PreProcessing technique are 49.3 f 7.9 for the WWW database, 55.2 f 9.8% for the Mushroom database 69.4 If 18.0 for the Nursery database 57.7 f 7.3% for the Chess database, 72.6 f 8.6 for the Adult database and 3.7 f 1.5 for the Gro cery database These results are extremely encouraging a significant number in most cases an average of over half the rules outputted by the mining algorithm are deleted by the application of this preprocessing technique This is a significant result not only because of the large number of rules that is deleted but also because this deletion requires no information of any kind from a user of the KDD process 6.3.2 The results of the application of the Interestingness PrePro cessing 2 technique \(Section 5.2 to the six databases were more modest than those of the application of the first tech nique Even these modest results are very significant a re duction even of a small percentage of the rules is both ef fective and important when these results are achieved au tomatically without any interaction with any users The average elimination brought about by the second prepro Results Interestingness Preprocessing Tech 2 Figure 3 Results of the application of Inter estingness Preprocessing 2 technique cessing technique was as follows 3.3 f 3.4 for the WWW database 17.4 f 5 for the Mushroom database 2.5 f 2.7 for the Nursery database 3.1 f 1.8 for the Chess database 1 f 1.9% for the Adult database We present the detailed results in a graphical representation in Figure 3 for the first two databases 6.3.3 Results Sequential Application of Interesting ness Preprocessing Techniques As depicted in Figure 1, the Interestingness PreProcessing techniques can and should be applied sequentially We pro ceeded to do so applying the two preprocessing techniques we introduced in this paper sequentially The results of this sequential application are depicted in Figure 4 7 Conclusions and Future Work In this work we defined an Interestingness Preprocessing Step, as part of the interestingness analysis framework, that eliminates association rules that can be determined to be not interesting in a user-, domain-, and task-independent man ner The generic nature of the preprocessing differentiates it from the interestingness processing that do impose a bias on the type of rules outputted as interesting In this work we also introduced the first Interestingness PreProcessing techniques The deletion of un-interesting rules by these techniques is very significant since it is achieved without requiring a user to provide any informa tion Our empirical results indicate that these are powerful techniques in most cases more than half the rules were eliminated by their application It is important to note that any filtering power however weak of any preprocessing technique is significant since all the Preprocessing methods are deployed sequentially immediately following the min ing process on any set of mined rules and these results add up We hope that this work will encourage the development of more preprocessing techniques by the KDD community 495

 9 For instance, while in the “ISS Rendezvous Mode”, the function of actuating docking mechanisms might be disabled, and the firing of RCS thruster enabled. However in the “ISS Dock Mode”, the firing of RCS thrusters is inhibited, while docking actuation is available. On the left side of Figure 8 are the mode s from which entrance to the state is allowed.  Note that si nce there is more than one state from which you can enter the ISS Operations State”, the entrance modes called out may not all be in the same state Similarly, the exit modes on the right hand side of the diagram lead to modes in different states The spacecraft states and tran sition activities were then modeled as operational flows in CORE as shown in Figure 9 \(next page\e operational activities and their logical sequence are consistent with the Spacecraft State Transition Diagram shown above in Figure 7.  The operational model also identified the operational elements, which are tied to the physical hardware elements of the system that perform the operational activities Figure 8 Spacecraft Operational Modes  ISS Rendezvous Mode ISS Proximity Operations Mode ISS Dock Mode State Entrance State Exit S/C ISS Operations State From: Orbit Maneuver Mode To: Orbit Maneuver Mode From: ISS Checkout Mode To: ISS Checkout Mode ISS Undock Mode ISS Safe Haven Mode ISS Emergency Departure Mode From: S/C Powered Up Mode To: S/C Powered Up Mode 


 10 Figure 9 Spacecraft Operational Flow Functional Models After addressing the operational activities that the OSP system needed to perform, the functional models of the OSP system were developed consistent with the system engineering process discussed above.  The first step was to identify the physical hardware elements of the OSP system as prescribed by NASA.  The physical hardware elements of the OSP system were captured in CORE through component decomposition and represented as the product breakdown structure shown in Figure 10  Figure 10 Product Breakdown Structure of OSP System The OSP system functional models were developed by identifying the system functions based on the mission goals and operations that the system needed to perform.  These functions were then allocated to the prescribed physical hardware elements of the sy stem. As requirements and the system architecture evolved, the system functionality was re-allocated to different physi cal hardware elements.  In addition, the functional models also captured the physical interfaces between the OSP system, both internally and externally Interface Definition The CORE database also modeled and captured the interface complexity th at existed for the OSP system.  In the database a functional interface was represented as a collection of links that existed between physical hardware elements and an operational interface was represented as a collection of need-lines that existed between operational elements.  The links/need-lines were further defined by either  performance indices or constraints Internal and external functi onal interfaces were modeled within the CORE database by looking at different layers of the system physical hierarchy For example the interfaces between the OSP system and external systems were modeled as shown below in Figure 11, which depicts the interfaces that exist between the ISS Mating Adapter and ISS.

Therefore the OSP system had to meet the mission objectives using only existing technologies.  These existing technologies were introduced into the CORE modeling database as requirement constraints on the OSP system Requirements Management Requirements management was performed within the CORE database to track and perform requirements flowdown as well as tie the requirements together with the operational models, functional models, and technologies Requirements told either how well the system needed to perform, set constraints on the system, or defined the interfaces.  In the CORE database, all requirements appeared as either performance indices or constraints The customer objectives were introduced into the CORE database as originating requirements.  These originating requirements included mission requirements, design requirements, environmental conditions, guidelines, and standards.  Originating requi rements were then traced to OSP System Level requirements.  The OSP System Level requirements defined the performance indices and constraints at the system leve l.  These performance indices and constraints were then flowed down and decomposed into lower level performance i ndices and constraints at the segment level, element level, and component level.  This supported the development of the system and segment performance specifications and requirements traceability matrix All of the requirements captured in CORE were directly tied to either the operational model, functional model, or technologies.  If the requirement was a performance requirement, it was tied to either the operational or functional model through a performance index.  The performance index indicated how well the function or operation needed to be accomplished. The function or operation in turn was tied back to the hardware elements of the OSP system.  For example, the requirement for two days of contingency operations by the spacecraft while not mated to ISS was represented as a performance index exhibited by the “Spacecraft On-O rbit Operations” activity previously shown in Figure 9. The “Sp acecraft On-Orbit Operations activity was in turn performed by the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement set a constraint on the system, it was depicted as a constraint on either an operational element or hardware element in CORE.  For example, the requirement that the spacecraft shall have an operational service life of thirty years was captured in CORE as a constraint on the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement defined an interface, it appeared as either a performance index or constraint on a link.  For example, the requirement that the mechani cal interface between the ISS Mating Adapter and Spacecraft shall be the Low Impact Docking System \(LIDS constraint that was placed on 


 12 the “Mating Adapter to Sp acecraft Docking/Attachment Mechanism\(s\k previously identified in Figure 12 One of the challenges for the requirements management process was capturing the manmachine interfaces.  This specific challenge was to develop and implement a methodology that allowed operational requirements to drive the physical hardware design.  In CORE, this was accomplished by allowing performance indices tied to the operational model to decompose into performance indices related to the operational model as well as the functional model 6  C ONCLUSION  A robust systems engineering process is required for a large scale program with many interfaces.  The processes and implementation presented in this paper are ideal when faced with a rapidly changing requirements environment and dynamic interfaces.   Traditional acquisition of systems revolves around a rigid set of design-to requirements.   As recent history has shown, opera tionally based acquisition is on the rise.  This means that requirements are more likely to be in flux further into the program The C4ISR methodology and implementation presented in this paper provide a robust system engineering process for a large scale program with many interfaces.  In particular, the dynamic interfaces and the integration of human interfaces were handled through the development of segment states and modes.  The state transitions were driven by system operations.  This operations based systems engineering is necessary to understand large, complex systems The process was implemented using the CORE systems engineering tool.  A flexible tool such as CORE was required to build the custom schema required for this unique program.  The capability to rigorously define the dynamic interfaces as well as decompose those interfaces was required to capture the dynamics of operationally driven systems.  Functional and physical models responded to these operations. This implementation in CORE allowed for a “Systems of Systems” view to be modeled within the same database as requirements management The demise of the OSP and precursor programs cut short the full implementation of this process.  Given time, states modes, and then operational and functional models would have been built for all segments of the system.  In addition the end to end traceability from operational requirements to component design requirements would have provided a robust platform for system verification While human spaceflight is a unique problem, the issue of systems of systems” integration is present in many fields When this is coupled with human integration, the need for an operations approach is multiplied.  Determining how to operate a system after it is functionally and physically designed results in delays and cost escalation.  An approach that takes into account human interaction and operations at the outset is more likely to re sult in a system that succeeds throughout the program lifecycle 7  R EFERENCES    DoD Archi t ect ure Fram ework W o rki ng Group DoD Architecture Framework Version 1.0” August 30, 2003 8  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The primary development effort of the C4ISR CORE methodology as implemented on the OSP program was completed by Michael Wood, Orbital Sciences Corporation and Marge Dyer, Vitech Corporation 9  B IOGRAPHY  Staci N.

4 Data mining 4.1 Association rule mining Data mining which is a recent hot research topic in the database field is a method of discovering useful information such as rules and previously unknown patterns existing behind data items It enables more effective utilization of transaction log data which have been just archived and abandoned Among the major applications of data mining is association rule mining so called 217\217basket analysis.\220\220 Each of the transaction data typically consists of a set of items bought in a transaction By analyzing them one can derive some association rule such as 217\21790 of the customers who buy both A and B also buy C.\220\220 In order to improve the quality of obtained rules a very large amount of transaction data have to be examined requiring quite a long time to complete First we introduce some basic concepts of association rule Let 000 000 001 000 1 001\000 2 001\002\002\002\001\000 000 002 be a set of items and 003 000 001 003 1 001\003 2 001\002\002\002\001\003 001 002 be a set of transactions where each transaction 003 002 is a set of items such that 003 002 004\000  n itemset 004 has support 005 in the transaction set 003 if 005  f transactions in 003 contain 004  here we denote 005 000 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 An association rule is an implication of the form 004 005 n  where 004\001 n 004 000  and 004 006 n 000 007  Each rule has two measures of value support and confidence  The support of the rule 004 005 n is 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002  The confidence 013 of the rule 004 005 n in the transaction set 003 means 013 of transactions in 003 that contain 004 also contain n  which can be written as 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002  For example let r 1 000 001 1 001 3 001 4 002  r 2 000 001 1 001 2 001 3 001 5 002  r 3 000 001 2 001 4 002  r 4 000 001 1 001 2 002  r 5 000 001 1 001 3 001 5 002 be the transaction database Let minimum  support and minimum confidence be 60 and 70 respectively First all itemsets that have support above the minimum support called large itemsets  are generated In this case the large itemsets are 001 1 002 001 001 2 002 001 001 3 002 001 001 1 001 3 002  Then for each large itemset 004  n association rule 004 t n 005 n 001 n 004 004 002 is derived if 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 t n 002 n minimum confidence  The results are 1 005 3 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 75 002 and 3 005 1 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 013\b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 100 002  The most well known algorithm for association rule mining is the Apriori algorithm[1 We have studied several parallel algorithms for mining association based on Apriori One of these algorithms called HPA Hash Partitioned Apriori is discussed here Apriori first generates candidate itemsets and then scans the transaction database to determine whether each of the candidates satisfies the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence Using these results the next candidate itemsets are generated This continues until no itemset satisfies the minimum support and confidence The most naive parallelization of Apriori would copy the candidates over all the processing node and make each processing node scan the transaction database in parallel Although this works fine when the number of candidates is small enough to fit in the local memory of a single processing node memory space utilization efficiency of this method is very poor For large scale data mining the storage required for the candidates exceeds the available memory space of a processing node This causes memory overflow which results in significant performance degradation due to an excessive amount of extra I/Os HPA partitions the candidate itemsets among the processing nodes using a hash function as in the parallel hash join which eliminates broadcasting of all the transaction data and can reduce the comparison workload significantly Hence HPA works much better than the naive parallelization for large scale data mining The 022 th iteration pass 022  f the algorithm is as follows 1 Generate the candidate itemsets Each processing node generates new candidate itemsets from the large itemsets of the last  001 022 t 1 002 th iteration Each of the former itemsets contains 022 items while each of the latter itemsets contains 001 022 t 1 002 items They are called 022 itemsets and 001 022 t 1 002 itemsets respectively The processing node applies the hash function to each of the candidates to determine the destination node ID If the candidate is for the processing node itself it is inserted into the hash table otherwise it is discarded 13 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
