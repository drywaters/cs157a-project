OFF-LINE CWM3 HANDWRITING SEGMENTATION Ke Han and Ishwar K Sethi Vision and Neural Networks Laboratory, Department of Computer Science Wayne State University, Detroit MI 48202 Abstract The segmentation of ofl-line cursive handwriting is an important step in cursive handwriting recognition In this paper a new approach is described for this task The suggested approach uses a set of heuristic rules to determine possible letter boundaries in the image of a cursive word The heuristic rules are based on associations that exist between certain geometric 
and topologic features and the English language characters A segmentation system incorporating the proposed approach has been built to perform segmentation on postal address images The system includes several preprocessing steps to extract cursive handwritten words om a postal emelope and normalization steps to allow variations in pen thickness and tilt in writing The experimental results obtained thus far show that the proposed approach is capable of accurately locating the letter boundaries in cursive words 1 Introduction Despite of successes achieved in character 
recognition over the last three decades, the recognition of off-line cursive handwriting including numerals characters and signatures still remains a challenging problem It is mainly due to the difficulties involved in the segmentation of cursive handwriting to isolate individual characters Since cursive handwriting segmentation is a difficult task in an off-line environment the use of word-level recognition approach in place of common character-level approach has been suggested to avoid the segmentation problem altogether While word-level recognition 
strategy does avoid the difficult segmentation issue the approach is limited in its discrimination capability and is suitable only for limited vocabdary applications In the work reported in this paper we describe a new cursive handwriting segmentation scheme The suggested scheme uses a set of heuristic rules to determine possible letter boundaries in the image of a cursive word The heuristic rules are based on associations that exist between certain geomettic and topologic features 
and the English language characters A segmentation system incorporating the proposed approach has been built to perform segmentation on postal address images The system includes several preprocessing steps to extract cursive handwritten words from a postal envelope and normalization steps to allow variations in pen thickness and tilt in writing The experimental results obtained thus far show that the proposed approach is capable of accurately locating the letter boundaries in cursive words The organization of the paper is 
as follows. Section 2 outlines the proposed handwriting segmentation approach Section 3 presents an off-line cursive handwriting segmentation system built upon the proposed approach A segmentation system using the proposed scheme for processing postal address images is described in Section 4 along with its performance The concluding remarks are presented in Section 5 2 Cursive Handwriting Segmentation Approach At the outset it should be noted that cursive handwriting segmentation 
is a task which provides best results if recognition is integrated with it and the whole process is canied out in an iterative fashion as indicated in Figure 1 To initialize the iterative segmentation process of Figure 1 a basic cursive word segmentor is required The proposed segmentation scheme is aimed at this basic segmentor Hypothesis of Confirmation Figure 1 Gened Diagram of Character-level Handwriting Recognition System The basic segmentor is based 
upon a set of associations that exist between a set of features and different groups of English language letters From the graphological point of view these features can be classified into two groups regular and singular The former includes geometric shapes such as horizontal bars, vertical bars and loops he latter contains singularities and quasi-topologic features such as end points branch points crossing points convex points 894 


and concave points The choice for these features is based on several previous works 1,2 where their use for describing handwriting has been clearly established In our segmentation scheme the alphabet is divided into six basic character classes based on the presence of above feature These classes are class 1 f t x Class 2 a e 0 s Class 3 b d 4 k 1 Class 4 g j P q Y z Class 5 c i m n r U v w Class 6 Initial Capital Character A character in Class 1 can be identified by a crossing point near the upper body line together with an ascen8er/~nderandhorizontavverticalbarsintheupper zone or lower zone A center loop is the reliable indicator of a character in Class 2 In case the loop is not closed a pair of convex point and concave point in the main body mne are reliable markers of the loop A letter in Class 3 is indicated by an ascender in the upper zone and a couple of singular features in the main body zone In addition b or d should have a loop in the main body zone and in case the loop is not closed the similar rule as in Class 2 will deal with it h k and 1 are captured by singular features in the upper zone and main body zone and in most cases there is a small loop in the upper zone that will be helpful to identify them The identification of characters in Class 4 can be carried out using the similar features as in Class 3 except that in Class 4 a descender is used instead of an ascender All the cbaracters in Class 5 can be segmented by analyzing curvature extrema Based on the characteristics upward downward leftward or rightward relationships and number of concavities, several extrema are combined together as a character of this class If curvature extrema can not be detected because of writing styles a sequence of pairs of end points and branch points are good indicators of characters in Class 5 and some of these points can be used to identify a instance in this class The segmentation of initial capital characters is straightforward They can be cut off at the middle of the first valid ligature or a certain distance from the beginning ofa word based on what featum are present In order to determine the letter boundaries based on this alphabet classification, several global coefficients reference lines and zones of a word are calculated The global icients include the estimated width of characters EWC and the estimated number of characters ENC in the word The reference lines are upper line, upper body line, lower body line and lower line The reference zones are upper zone main body zone and lower zone When global and local information is available the letter boundaries of the word are determined based on the distributions of all the features in the different zones and a set of heuristic rules Finally a sequence of physical segmentation points are located on ligatures between letters These ligatures are provided by the off-line cursive handwriting tracing algorithm suggested by Lee and Pan 31 3 Cursive Handwriting Segmentation System The diagram of an off-line cursive handwriting segmentation system using the proposed approach is shown in Figure 2 The input of the system is a binary image of a cursive handwriting Figure 3\(a shows an example input word The output is a sequence of physical segmentation points Word preprocessing Determination 1 Skeleton Reference 1 Lines  Zones EWC  IZNC Feature Sets Letter Boundaries Segmentation segmentation points Figure 2 Diag\224 of Off-line Cursive Handwriting Segmentation System The input word is processed through two paths The first path consists of two stages The first stage includes mutines for Wng reference lines and zones Figure 3\(b In the second stage ENC and EWC are calculated based on the size of the input word and reference zones In the second path the input word is preprocessed to generate the binary and skeleton images and then the regular and singular features are extracted from these two images The regular features include horizontal bars vertical bars and loops The loops are extracted from the skeleton image using 4-co~ected component labeling algorithm The horizontal and vertical bars are extracted fmm the binary image using the morphological hit-or-miss operation The singular features include end points, branch points crossing points convex points and concave points To extract these features the skeleton image is first decomposed into end points branch points crossing points, loops, and simple curves. The simple curves are the open curves without junction points To extract convex points a!nd concave points on the simple curves the salient curve-point selection algorithm proposed by Fischler and Wolf 4 is used Figure 3\(c d e 0 g h and i indicate the bars loops end points branch points crossing points, convex points and concave points of the example input word respectively 895 


Figure 3 A Series of Pmcessing Results In the letter bo determination stage global and local information are synthesized to generate a sequence of letter boundaries of the input word using the alphabet classification and a set of heuristic rules The letter boundaries of the example @ut word are given in Figure 3d The principal heuristic rules are described below Loop determination If there is a loop detected in the main body zone then a character in Class 2 is identified and before d after the loop are two letter boundaries Ifthe is a loop detected in the upper zone then after the loop is a letter boundary If there is a loop detected in the lower zone then before the loop is a letter boundary Crossing domination A crossing point found hthe upper zone is an indicator of a character in Class 1 A crossing point found in the main body zone indicates either a character in Class 1 or an end point of a ligature between two consecutive letters A crossing point found in the lower zone is an end point of a ligature between two consecutive letters In the case of a character in Class 1 two letter boundaries are determined according to EWC and features y In tbe case of an end point a letter boudary is produced near the crossing point Double t's splitting If there are a loop and two crossing points found in the mainbody zone and/or the upper zone that are close together double t's are located The centroid of the loop is chosen as a cutoff point of these two t's that forms a letter boundary between two t's The other two boundaries of two t's are on the opposite sides of the crossing points and are determined using Rule 2 Dream team A feature cluster in the upper zone and a feature cluster in the lower zone that are in a similar vertical position are markers of longer characters According to the properties of relative features and EWC proper letter boundaries may be determined Central musses It is used to deal with characters in Class S In this case a sequence of convex/concave feahm points appear in the main body zone Based on the characteristics and positions of these features and EWC proper letter boundaries are determined Upward masses If there are features in the upper zone and main body zone they belong to characters in Class 3 Based upon characteristics and positions of these features and EWC proper letter boundaries are determined Downward masses If there are features in the lower zone and main body zone they belong to characters in Class 4 Based upon characteristics and positions of these features and EWC proper letter boundaries are determined Alignment A couple of letter boundaries close to each other are aligned to the leftmost or rightmost one based on the features that produced these boundaries In the final stage, physical segmentation points are located at ligatures between letters of the input word Here we consider a convexkoncave point on a ligature as the best cutoff point and if there is no such a convex/concave point the middle of a ligature is treated as the best cutoff point The final physical segmentation points of the example input word is shown in Figure 3Q 896 


4 Application to Postal Address Images A segmentation system incorporating the proposed cursive handwriting segmentation scheme has been applied to perform segmentation on postal address images Since postal address images are gray level and contain several rows of words the segmentation system first applies seveml prepmessing operations to emct these words and subsequently feed each of them into the proposed cursive handwritten segmentation system for segmentation These preprocessing operations include thresholding word exhaction word slant correction and noise fdtering Experiments have been performed on a database of 50 envelopes extracted from real mailpieax These envelopes contain a total of 11 19 cursive hawbitten characters For this database the proposed segmentation system segmented 959 characters correctly which corresponds to 85.7 accuracy rate Some of the successful segmentation results are given in Figure 4 Analyzing the failure cases produced by the proposed segmentation system it is noticed that most errors are due to the inherent segmentation ambiguity of characters in Class 5 Other failures are geaemted by the writing defaults involved in the original input word Some failure segmentation cases an shown in Figm 5 5 Conclusion and Future Research Plan In this paper a new approach for off-line cursive handwriting segmentation has been described and a segmentation system incorporating the proposed approach has been built to perform segmentation on postal address images The experimental results obtained by the segmentation system on postal address images show that the proposed approach is capable of accurately locating the letter boundaries in cursive words Obviously there an a number of errors occurring in the segmentation most of which have to do with the ambiguity of segmenting a sequence of specific letters. In order to break the Wiculty we think that combining word segmentation and character recognition is a better way to achieve a higher accuracy rate in a real situation and under a large vocabulq This is currently being investigated References 1 2 H Nishida and S Mori Algebraic description of curve J.J Bradt and R Plamondon A complexity measure of handwriting curves  modeling of dynamic signature S Lee and J.C Pan Off-line tracing and representation of signatures IEFE SMC-22\(4 755-771 1992 M.A Fischler and H.C Wolf Locating perceptually salient points on planar curves IEEE PAMI-16\(2 113 129 1994 structure IEEE PAMI-14\(5 516-533 1992 forgw IEEE SMC-23\(2 400413 1993 3 4 Figure 4 Some of Correctly Segmented Words Figure 5 Some of Failure Cases Produced by System 897 


 5 Figure 3 OSP System Interfaces C4ISR Overview The Department of Defense \(DoD\tecture Framework DoDAF\des guidance fo r developing and describing architectures for Systems of Sy stem DoDAF is an evolution of the concepts introduced in the Command Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence Surveillance, and Reconnai ssance \(C4ISR Framework.  This framework defines the three views presented in Figure 4 of an architecture and their interrelationships:  Operational View, System View, and Technical Standards View  Figure 4 C4ISR Architecture Framework Views The Operational View is a description of the operational activities, operational elements, and information exchange within the architectur e.  The System View is a functional description of the architecture which defines the system elements and resources.  Th e Technical Standards View provides standards and guidelines for the system capabilities as well as addresses new technology development.  The three interre lated views are necessary to fully describe a “System of Systems C4ISR Systems Engineering Process Based on the C4ISR framework, a systems engineering process was established for the OSP program that allowed the system operations as well as the mission requirements to drive the system design.  The system operations were identified in terms of how the OSP system would be used and how it interfaced/integrated into the existing Human Space Flight Program.  The main emphasis was placed on the human interactions. The functionality of the system was then primarily driven by the identified operations.  How the system was being used defined the functions of the physical hardware elements.  Technologies and technology development influenced the system operations and functionality One of the unique challenges for the development was modeling the man-machine interf ace.  As presented earlier the OSP spacecraft crew were not in fact considered a part of the system.  They were the operators of one segment of the system.  Both human rating guidelines as well as human integration standards had to be considered.  Modeling the crew as an interface to the system allowed the dynamic operational aspects of human operations to be captured as a part of system operations 5  I MPLEMENTATION  This section describes the implementation of the C4ISR methodology in a systems engineering tool in order to tie together requirements management with operational modeling, functional modeling, and technologies CORE Overview The tool selected to tie this methodology together was a systems engineering database, CORE TM by Vitech Corporation.  The tool served as an integral part of the systems engineering process The C4ISR CORE methodology was developed for the OSP program to support specific products and viewpoints necessary to support the systems engineering process.  The products included Design Capture and Traceability Specification Generation, Operations and Simulation Analysis, and Technology Integration.  Figure 5 \(next page depicts the overall use of the CORE database.  The originating requirements, which included mission requirements, design requirements, environmental conditions, as well as guidelines and standards, served as inputs to the database.  These inputs captured the customers objectives.  The database was th en used to model the system through different views; the physical elements, a functional view, an operational view, an interface view, and a verification view.  The models were then used to generate outputs such as design documentation and to make system assessments C4ISR Schema Details A modified C4ISR schema was developed for this application, which allowed for the traditional functional views as well as the operational views of the system to be captured within the database.  Using the C4ISR framework as a guideline, an interpretation of the database elements was established in order to develop a schema which would allow for a “systems of syst ems” engineering approach The classes and relationships necessary to capture this information were defined to support this specific CORE application for the OSP program as shown in Figure 6.  The classes and relationships were primarily organized into three main categories consistent with the C4ISR framework System/Component Classes, Operational Classes, and 


 6 Derived Requirements Classes.  The System/Component Classes defined the physical hardware elements of the system, the physical interfaces of the system, and the functions performed by the physical 


 7 Figure 5 CORE Database Overview hardware elements.  The Operational Classes defined the operational elements of the system, the operational interfaces, and the operational activities including human interaction.  The Derived Requirements Classes defined the derived requirements based on th e originating requirements These derived requirements were then tied directly to the functional and operational models through either performance indices or constr aints.  Performance indices either indicated how well a function or an operational activity needed to be perfo rmed.  Constraints either constrained the physical hardware elements or operational elements Figure 6 CORE Element Classes CORE Models Using the previously discussed systems engineering process and CORE schema, the OSP system was defined and modeled within the CORE database.  This included the development and integration of an operational model system model, and technologies, as well as requirements management Operational Models Given the mission goal to support the crew transfer and rescue needs of ISS, heavy emphasis was placed on operations.  During the early phases of the program, the operational activities, both f light and ground, that the system needed to perform in order to meet the mission objectives were identified. These high-level operational activities were then further decomposed and addressed at a lower level.  For example, th e approach that was taken to further identify flight operations was to look closely at the operations the spacecraft would need to perform.  This was accomplished by identifying th e Spacecraft State & Mode along with the Transition Diagrams \(See Figure 7 and Figure 8 next page  Operational Classes  System / Component Classes  Derived Requirement Classes  Link  Fu nction  Compon ent System  Perf.

 8 Figure 7 Spacecraft State Transition Diagram The Spacecraft State Transition diagram depicts the unique states that exist, based on unique configurations and/or unique boundary conditions. Thes e states and transition activities were in essence the operational activities that needed to be performed by the system. Referring back to Figure 1, you can see a cartoon representation of the mission that parallels the states presented here.  Starting at the bottom of Figure 7, the spacecraft is in the “S/C Integrated LV State”.  This state exists during un-crewed joint operations with the launch vehicle, before the vehicle is on the pad. Once the joint stack is integrated to the pad the spacecraft moves to a new state.  The change in boundary conditions, specifically the addition of the pad as an interface source, forces a st ate change for the spacecraft Note that while a nominal mission would proceed clockwise through the state transition diagram opportunities exist to step back through the flow if conditions require.  The arrows indicate the only ways by which the spacecraft can change state.  Addition of crew members is a major state cha nge to the spacecraft.  Recall that the crew is modeled as an external interface to the system.  Therefore, with th e addition of crew, a major external interface is exercise d.  The conditions indicated along the state transition arrows dictate events that occur and define state transitions.  Of interest in the center of the state transition diagram is th e “S/C Crew Escape State This is the only state that is not part of a nominal mission During spacecraft operations, in itiation of the crew escape system creates a unique confi guration of the spacecraft, and therefore presents a new sp acecraft state.  Mission abort does not necessarily require crew escape, and may follow the nominal states, though at an expedited pace While states were defined by changes in boundary conditions of the spacecraft, modes are defined by a grouping of the functionality of the spacecraft. The operational modes within the “ISS Operations State” \(refer back to Figure 7\presente d in Figure 8.  Each mode within a state represents a set of functions that are enabled while further implying that certain functions are disabled 


 9 For instance, while in the “ISS Rendezvous Mode”, the function of actuating docking mechanisms might be disabled, and the firing of RCS thruster enabled. However in the “ISS Dock Mode”, the firing of RCS thrusters is inhibited, while docking actuation is available. On the left side of Figure 8 are the mode s from which entrance to the state is allowed.  Note that si nce there is more than one state from which you can enter the ISS Operations State”, the entrance modes called out may not all be in the same state Similarly, the exit modes on the right hand side of the diagram lead to modes in different states The spacecraft states and tran sition activities were then modeled as operational flows in CORE as shown in Figure 9 \(next page\e operational activities and their logical sequence are consistent with the Spacecraft State Transition Diagram shown above in Figure 7.  The operational model also identified the operational elements, which are tied to the physical hardware elements of the system that perform the operational activities Figure 8 Spacecraft Operational Modes  ISS Rendezvous Mode ISS Proximity Operations Mode ISS Dock Mode State Entrance State Exit S/C ISS Operations State From: Orbit Maneuver Mode To: Orbit Maneuver Mode From: ISS Checkout Mode To: ISS Checkout Mode ISS Undock Mode ISS Safe Haven Mode ISS Emergency Departure Mode From: S/C Powered Up Mode To: S/C Powered Up Mode 


 10 Figure 9 Spacecraft Operational Flow Functional Models After addressing the operational activities that the OSP system needed to perform, the functional models of the OSP system were developed consistent with the system engineering process discussed above.  The first step was to identify the physical hardware elements of the OSP system as prescribed by NASA.  The physical hardware elements of the OSP system were captured in CORE through component decomposition and represented as the product breakdown structure shown in Figure 10  Figure 10 Product Breakdown Structure of OSP System The OSP system functional models were developed by identifying the system functions based on the mission goals and operations that the system needed to perform.  These functions were then allocated to the prescribed physical hardware elements of the sy stem. As requirements and the system architecture evolved, the system functionality was re-allocated to different physi cal hardware elements.  In addition, the functional models also captured the physical interfaces between the OSP system, both internally and externally Interface Definition The CORE database also modeled and captured the interface complexity th at existed for the OSP system.  In the database a functional interface was represented as a collection of links that existed between physical hardware elements and an operational interface was represented as a collection of need-lines that existed between operational elements.  The links/need-lines were further defined by either  performance indices or constraints Internal and external functi onal interfaces were modeled within the CORE database by looking at different layers of the system physical hierarchy For example the interfaces between the OSP system and external systems were modeled as shown below in Figure 11, which depicts the interfaces that exist between the ISS Mating Adapter and ISS.

Therefore the OSP system had to meet the mission objectives using only existing technologies.  These existing technologies were introduced into the CORE modeling database as requirement constraints on the OSP system Requirements Management Requirements management was performed within the CORE database to track and perform requirements flowdown as well as tie the requirements together with the operational models, functional models, and technologies Requirements told either how well the system needed to perform, set constraints on the system, or defined the interfaces.  In the CORE database, all requirements appeared as either performance indices or constraints The customer objectives were introduced into the CORE database as originating requirements.  These originating requirements included mission requirements, design requirements, environmental conditions, guidelines, and standards.  Originating requi rements were then traced to OSP System Level requirements.  The OSP System Level requirements defined the performance indices and constraints at the system leve l.  These performance indices and constraints were then flowed down and decomposed into lower level performance i ndices and constraints at the segment level, element level, and component level.  This supported the development of the system and segment performance specifications and requirements traceability matrix All of the requirements captured in CORE were directly tied to either the operational model, functional model, or technologies.  If the requirement was a performance requirement, it was tied to either the operational or functional model through a performance index.  The performance index indicated how well the function or operation needed to be accomplished. The function or operation in turn was tied back to the hardware elements of the OSP system.  For example, the requirement for two days of contingency operations by the spacecraft while not mated to ISS was represented as a performance index exhibited by the “Spacecraft On-O rbit Operations” activity previously shown in Figure 9. The “Sp acecraft On-Orbit Operations activity was in turn performed by the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement set a constraint on the system, it was depicted as a constraint on either an operational element or hardware element in CORE.  For example, the requirement that the spacecraft shall have an operational service life of thirty years was captured in CORE as a constraint on the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement defined an interface, it appeared as either a performance index or constraint on a link.  For example, the requirement that the mechani cal interface between the ISS Mating Adapter and Spacecraft shall be the Low Impact Docking System \(LIDS constraint that was placed on 


 12 the “Mating Adapter to Sp acecraft Docking/Attachment Mechanism\(s\k previously identified in Figure 12 One of the challenges for the requirements management process was capturing the manmachine interfaces.  This specific challenge was to develop and implement a methodology that allowed operational requirements to drive the physical hardware design.  In CORE, this was accomplished by allowing performance indices tied to the operational model to decompose into performance indices related to the operational model as well as the functional model 6  C ONCLUSION  A robust systems engineering process is required for a large scale program with many interfaces.  The processes and implementation presented in this paper are ideal when faced with a rapidly changing requirements environment and dynamic interfaces.   Traditional acquisition of systems revolves around a rigid set of design-to requirements.   As recent history has shown, opera tionally based acquisition is on the rise.  This means that requirements are more likely to be in flux further into the program The C4ISR methodology and implementation presented in this paper provide a robust system engineering process for a large scale program with many interfaces.  In particular, the dynamic interfaces and the integration of human interfaces were handled through the development of segment states and modes.  The state transitions were driven by system operations.  This operations based systems engineering is necessary to understand large, complex systems The process was implemented using the CORE systems engineering tool.  A flexible tool such as CORE was required to build the custom schema required for this unique program.  The capability to rigorously define the dynamic interfaces as well as decompose those interfaces was required to capture the dynamics of operationally driven systems.  Functional and physical models responded to these operations. This implementation in CORE allowed for a “Systems of Systems” view to be modeled within the same database as requirements management The demise of the OSP and precursor programs cut short the full implementation of this process.  Given time, states modes, and then operational and functional models would have been built for all segments of the system.  In addition the end to end traceability from operational requirements to component design requirements would have provided a robust platform for system verification While human spaceflight is a unique problem, the issue of systems of systems” integration is present in many fields When this is coupled with human integration, the need for an operations approach is multiplied.  Determining how to operate a system after it is functionally and physically designed results in delays and cost escalation.  An approach that takes into account human interaction and operations at the outset is more likely to re sult in a system that succeeds throughout the program lifecycle 7  R EFERENCES    DoD Archi t ect ure Fram ework W o rki ng Group DoD Architecture Framework Version 1.0” August 30, 2003 8  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The primary development effort of the C4ISR CORE methodology as implemented on the OSP program was completed by Michael Wood, Orbital Sciences Corporation and Marge Dyer, Vitech Corporation 9  B IOGRAPHY  Staci N.

4 Data mining 4.1 Association rule mining Data mining which is a recent hot research topic in the database field is a method of discovering useful information such as rules and previously unknown patterns existing behind data items It enables more effective utilization of transaction log data which have been just archived and abandoned Among the major applications of data mining is association rule mining so called 217\217basket analysis.\220\220 Each of the transaction data typically consists of a set of items bought in a transaction By analyzing them one can derive some association rule such as 217\21790 of the customers who buy both A and B also buy C.\220\220 In order to improve the quality of obtained rules a very large amount of transaction data have to be examined requiring quite a long time to complete First we introduce some basic concepts of association rule Let 000 000 001 000 1 001\000 2 001\002\002\002\001\000 000 002 be a set of items and 003 000 001 003 1 001\003 2 001\002\002\002\001\003 001 002 be a set of transactions where each transaction 003 002 is a set of items such that 003 002 004\000  n itemset 004 has support 005 in the transaction set 003 if 005  f transactions in 003 contain 004  here we denote 005 000 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 An association rule is an implication of the form 004 005 n  where 004\001 n 004 000  and 004 006 n 000 007  Each rule has two measures of value support and confidence  The support of the rule 004 005 n is 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002  The confidence 013 of the rule 004 005 n in the transaction set 003 means 013 of transactions in 003 that contain 004 also contain n  which can be written as 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002  For example let r 1 000 001 1 001 3 001 4 002  r 2 000 001 1 001 2 001 3 001 5 002  r 3 000 001 2 001 4 002  r 4 000 001 1 001 2 002  r 5 000 001 1 001 3 001 5 002 be the transaction database Let minimum  support and minimum confidence be 60 and 70 respectively First all itemsets that have support above the minimum support called large itemsets  are generated In this case the large itemsets are 001 1 002 001 001 2 002 001 001 3 002 001 001 1 001 3 002  Then for each large itemset 004  n association rule 004 t n 005 n 001 n 004 004 002 is derived if 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 t n 002 n minimum confidence  The results are 1 005 3 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 75 002 and 3 005 1 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 013\b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 100 002  The most well known algorithm for association rule mining is the Apriori algorithm[1 We have studied several parallel algorithms for mining association based on Apriori One of these algorithms called HPA Hash Partitioned Apriori is discussed here Apriori first generates candidate itemsets and then scans the transaction database to determine whether each of the candidates satisfies the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence Using these results the next candidate itemsets are generated This continues until no itemset satisfies the minimum support and confidence The most naive parallelization of Apriori would copy the candidates over all the processing node and make each processing node scan the transaction database in parallel Although this works fine when the number of candidates is small enough to fit in the local memory of a single processing node memory space utilization efficiency of this method is very poor For large scale data mining the storage required for the candidates exceeds the available memory space of a processing node This causes memory overflow which results in significant performance degradation due to an excessive amount of extra I/Os HPA partitions the candidate itemsets among the processing nodes using a hash function as in the parallel hash join which eliminates broadcasting of all the transaction data and can reduce the comparison workload significantly Hence HPA works much better than the naive parallelization for large scale data mining The 022 th iteration pass 022  f the algorithm is as follows 1 Generate the candidate itemsets Each processing node generates new candidate itemsets from the large itemsets of the last  001 022 t 1 002 th iteration Each of the former itemsets contains 022 items while each of the latter itemsets contains 001 022 t 1 002 items They are called 022 itemsets and 001 022 t 1 002 itemsets respectively The processing node applies the hash function to each of the candidates to determine the destination node ID If the candidate is for the processing node itself it is inserted into the hash table otherwise it is discarded 13 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
