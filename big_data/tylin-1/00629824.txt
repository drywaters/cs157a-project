Grouping Web Page References into Transactions for Mining World Wide Web Browsing Patterns  R Cooley B Mobasher and J Srivastava Department of Computer Science and Engineering University of Minnesota Minneapolis MN 55455 USA Abstract Web-based organizations often generate and collect large volumes of data in their daily operations Ana lyzing such data involves the discovery of meaningful relationships from a large collection of primarily un structured data 
often stored in Web server access logs While traditional domains for data mining such as point of sale databases have naturally defined trans actions there is no convenient method of clustering web references into transactions This paper identifies a model of user browsing behavior that separates web page references into those made for navigation pur poses and those for information content purposes A transaction identification method based on the brows ing model is defined and successfully tested 
against other methods, such as the maximal forward reference algorithm proposed in I Transactions identified by the proposed methods are used to discover association rules from real world data using the WEBMINER sys tem TI 1 Introduction and Background As more organizations rely on the World Wide Web to conduct business traditional strategies and tech niques for market analysis need to be revisited Or ganizations collect large volumes of data and analyze it to determine the life time value of 
customers cross marketing strategies across products and effectiveness of promotional campaigns In the Web such infor mation is generally gathered automatically by Web servers and collected in server or access logs Anal ysis of server access data can provide information on how to restructure a Web site for increased effective ness better management of workgroup communica tion and analyzing user access patterns to target ads This work was supported in part by NSF grant ASC 9554517 to specific groups of users Most 
existing Web analysis tools 2 3 S provide very primitive mechanisms for reporting user activity i.e it is possible to determine the number of accesses to individual files the times of visits and URLs of users However these tools usually provide little analysis of data relationships among the accessed files which is essential to fully utilizing the data gathered in daily transactions Web server access logs have been used as a testbed for the application of certain data mining tasks such as the discovery of 
frequent episodes 6 Recently maximal forward ref erences have been proposed l as a way to extract meaningful user access sequences The overall task of Web usage mining is not one of simply adapting existing algorithms to new data Because of many unique characteristics of the client server model in the World Wide Web including rad ical differences between the physical and logical data organizations of web repositories it is necessary to develop a new framework to enable the mining pro 
cess Specifically there are a number of issues in pre processing data for mining that must be addressed be fore the mining algorithms can be run These include developing a model of web log data developing tech niques to clean/filter the raw data to eliminate outliers and/or irrelevant items grouping individual page ac cesses into semantic units i.e transactions and spe cializing generic data mining algorithms to take ad vantage of the specific nature of web log data This paper presents a general 
model for identi fying transactions for data mining from WWW log data The specific contributions include i definition of generic transaction identification modules ii def inition of a user browsing behavior model that can be used to separate important or information con tent page references from references used for naviga tion purposes iii development of specific transac tion identification modules based on web page refer ence lengths or web site structure iv and evaluation 2 0-8186-8230-2/97 10.00 0 1997 IEEE 


of the different transaction identification modules us ing generated server log data with known association rules 2 User Browsing Behavior Model In order to group individual web page references into meaningful transactions for data mining an un derlying model of the user\222s browsing behavior is needed A reasonable assumption seems to be that a given user treats each page in one of two ways either for navigation purposes to find links to the desired data or for actual information or content purposes What is merely a navigation page for one user may be a content page for another While it may be possible to classify some web pages based on the number of links versus text contained on the page most pages will probably not fit clearly into only one category For example a page that contains a title followed by a list of links to other pages can easily be classified as a navigation page However a page with a mix of text and links can not easily be classified as naviga tional or content and could serve a different purpose for different users Using the concept of navigation and content page references there are two ways to define transactions The first would be to define a transaction as all of the navigation references up to and including each content reference for a given user Mining these navigation content transactions would essentially give the com mon traversal paths through the web site to a given content page The second method would be to define a transaction as all of the content references for a given user Mining these content-only transactions would give associations between the content pages of a site without any information as to the path taken between the pages It is important to note that results gener ated from content-only transactions only apply when those pages are used as content references For exam ple an association rule A  B is normally taken to mean that when A is in a set so is B However if this rule has been generated with content-only trans actions it has a more specific meaning, namely that A implies B only when both A and B are used as con tent references This property allows data mining on content-only transactions to produce rules that might be missed by including all of the page references in a log If users that treat page A as a navigation page do not generally go on to page El inclusion of the navi gation references into the data mining process would reduce the confidence of the rule A  B possibly to the point where it is not reported Depending on the goals of the analysis this can be seen as an advan tage or a disadvantage The key is that navigation content transactions can be used when this property is undesirable The challenge of identifying transac tions is to dynamically determine which references in a server log are navigational and which are content Even sorting the server log by user identification is not a straightforward task due to anonymous logins and proxy servers A discussion of the user identification problem is given in 9 This paper assumes that the page references in a server log can be readily sorted by user identification Once a log has been sorted by user identification the date/time stamp and the URL of the page accessed are two other pieces of informa tion in the Common Log Format specified as part of the HTTP protocol by CERN and NCSA 5 that can be used to classify each reference in the server log as a navigation or content reference Section 3 describes methods to use these pieces of information to classify the references in a web server log 3 Transaction Identification 3.1 General Model The raw server log can be thought of in two ways either as a single transaction of many page references or a set of many transactions each consisting of a single page reference The goal of transaction identification is to create meaningful clusters of references for each user Therefore the task of identifying transactions is one of either dividing a large transaction into mul tiple smaller ones or merging small transactions into fewer larger ones This process can be extended into multiple steps of merge or divide in order to create transactions appropriate for a given data mining task A transaction identification module can be defined as either a merge or a divide module Both types of mod ules take a transaction list and possibly some param eters as input and output a transaction list that has been operated on by the function in the module in the same format as the input The requirement that the input and output transaction format match allows any number of modules to be combined in any order as the data analyst sees fit Let L be a set of server ac cess log entries A log entry 1 E L includes the client IP address lip the client user id l.uid the URL of the accessed page l.ur1 and the time of access 1.time There are other fields in web log entries such as the request method used e.g POST or GET and the size of the file transmitted however these fields are not used in the transaction model 3 


Definition 1 A General Transaction t is a triple t  ipt,uidt l~.url,l~.time     lL.ur1 time  where for 1 5 k 5 m 1 E L l;.ip  ipt l$.uid  uidt Note that definition 1 assumes that each transac tion is made up of references from only one user Al though there may be reasons to create transactions of references from different users this paper assumes that the initial step in identifying transactions will always be to use a merge module based on user id Once the appropriate transaction identification mod ules have been applied to the server log a final prepa ration module can be used to properly format the transactions for the type of data mining to be accom plished For example since temporal information is not needed for the mining of association rules a final association rule preparation module would strip out the time for each reference and do any other format ting of the data necessary for the specific data mining algorithm to be used 3.2 Specific Transaction Identification Since the initial merge module identifies transac tions consisting of all of the page references for a given user the next step in the transaction identification process will always be the application of a divide mod ule This section describes three divide transaction identification modules The first two reference length and maximal forward reference make an attempt to identify transactions based on the model described in section 2 The third time window is not based on the section 2 model and is mainly used as a bench mark to compare with the other two algorithms All of the modules operate on the not necessarily valid assumption that the sequence of web page references contained in a server log are an accurate representa tion of the users behavior Mechanisms such as local caches and proxy servers can severely distort the over all picture of user traversals through a web site Cache busting and mandatory user registration are two ex amples of attempts to obtain accurate data but do not address all of the potential problems A more complete discussion of the shortcomings of the current log standard and potential solutions are the subject of 9 The transaction identification modules and exper iments presented in this paper do not attempt to ad dress problems surrounding accurate data collection Modules 3.2.1 Reference Length Module The reference length transaction identification module is based on m Figure 1 Histogram of Web Page Reference Lengths seconds the assumption that the amount of time a user spends on a page correlates to whether the page should be classified as a navigation or content page for that user Figure 1 shows a histogram of the lengths of page ref erences between 0 and 600 seconds for a server log from Global Reach Internet Productions GRIP Analysis of several other server logs reveals that like figure 1 the shape of the histogram is usually close to an expo nential distribution It is expected that the variance of the times spent on the navigation pages is small and the navigation references make up the lower end of the curve The length of the content references are expected to have a wide variance and would make up the upper tail that extends out to the longest refer ence If an assumption is made about the percentage of navigation references in a log a reference length can be calculated that estimates the cutoff between nav igation and content references Specifically given a percent of navigation references n the reference length module uses a normal estimate of a chi-squared distri bution to calculate the time length that n percent of the references in the log are less than with 95 con fidence The definition of a transaction within the reference length module is given in definition 2 It has the same structure as definition 1 with the reference length added for each page Definition 2 A Reference Length Transaction t,l is a quadruple t,l  iptrl,uidt l~'.~rl,l~~.time lF'.length     1 url lkl.time l$.length  where for 1 5 IC 5 m lk E L 1kl.i  ipt 12 uid  uidt 4 


The length of each reference is estimated by taking the difference between the time of the next reference and the current reference Obviously the last refer ence in each transaction has no 223next\224 time to use in estimating the reference length The reference length module makes the assumption that all of the last ref erences are content references and ignores them while calculating the cutoff time This assumption can intro duce errors if a specific navigation page is commonly used as the exit point for a web site When a log spans a significant portion of time there is a good chance that the same users will visit the site more than once In this case the length of the last refer ence for the previous visit can be calculated as being hours long It is highly unlikely that the user actually actively used the web page for this period of time In order to prevent these outliers from skewing the cutoff time estimation only the reference lengths of one hour or less are taken into consideration when calculating the cutoff time While interruptions such as a phone call or lunch break can result in the erroneous classifi cation of a navigation reference as a content reference it is unlikely that the error will occur on a regular basis for the same page A reasonable minimum sup port threshold during the application of a data mining algorithm would be expected to weed out these errors Once the cutoff time is calculated the two types of transactions discussed in section 2 can be formed by comparing each reference length against the cut off time Depending on the goal of the analysis the naviga tion-conten t transactions or the content only transactions can be identified If C is the cutoff time for navigation-content transactions the conditions for 1 5 k 5 m  1  length 5 C and k  m  l>\221.length  C are added to definition 2 and for content-only transactions the condition for 1 5 k 5 m  221.length  C is added to definition 2 The one parameter that the reference length module requires is an estimation of the overall percentage of references that are naviga tional The estimation of the percentage of navigation references can be based on the structure and content of the site or experience of the data analyst with other server logs The results presented in section 6 show that the module is fairly robust and at wide range of navigation percentages will yielld reasonable sets of as sociation rules 3.2.2 Maximal Forward Reference Module The maximal forward reference transaction identification module is based on the work presented in l Instead of time spent on a page each transaction is defined to be the set of pages in the path from the first page in the log for a user up the the page before a back ward reference is made A new transaction is started when the next forward reference is made A forward reference is defined to be a page not already in the set of pages for the current transaction Similarly a backward reference is defined to be a page that is al ready contained in the set of pages for the current transaction The underlying model for this module is that the maximal forward reference pages are the content pages and the pages leading up to the each maximal forward reference are the navigation pages For example an access sequence of A B C D C B E F E G would be broken into three transactions of A B C D A B E F and A B E G The content pages in this example would be D F and G Like the reference length module two sets of transactions navigation content or content-only can be formed The definition of a general transaction definition 1 is used within the maximal forward reference module The maximal forward reference module has an advantage over the reference length and time window modules in that it does not require an input parameter that is based on an assumption about the characteristics of a particu lar set of data 3.2.3 Time Window Module The time window transaction identification module simply divides the log for a user up into time intervals no larger than a specified parameter The module does not try to iden tify transactions based on the model of section 2 but instead assumes that meaningful transactions have an overall average length associated with them For a suf ficiently large specified time window each transaction will contain all of the references for each user Since the time window module is not based on the section 2 model it is not possible to create two separate sets of transactions The last reference of each transaction does not correspond to a content reference the way it does for the navigation-content transactions of the ref erence length and maximal forward reference modules If W is the length of the time window definition 1 ap plies for transactions within the time window module with the following added condition Z&.time  1t.time 5 w Since there is some standard deviation associated with the length of each 223real\224 transaction it is un 5 


likely that a fixed time window will break a log up appropriately However the time window transaction module can also be used as a merge module in con junction with one of the other divide modules For example after applying the reference length module a merge time window module with a 10 minute input parameter could be used to ensure that each transac tion has some minimum overall length 4 The WEBMINER System The WEBMINER system 7 divides the Web usage mining process into two main parts The first part in cludes the domain dependent processes of transform ing the Web data into suitable 223transaction\224 form and the second part includes the largely domain in dependent application of generic data mining tech niques such as the discovery of association rule and sequential patterns as part of the system\222s data min ing engine The overall architecture for the Web min ing process is depicted in Figure 2 Generally there are a variety of files accessed as a result of a request by a client to view a particular Web page These include image sound and video files executable cgi files coordinates of clickable re gions in image map files and HTML files Thus the server logs contain many entries that are redundant or irrelevant for the data mining tasks For example all the image file entries are irrelevant or redundant since as a URL with several image files is selected the images are transferred to the client machine and these files are recorded in the log file as independent entries The process of removing redundant or irrele vant entries from the Web server log files is referred to as data cleaning A very simple form of data cleaning is performed by checking the suffix of the URL name For instance all the log entries with filename suffixes such as gif jpeg GIF JPEG jpg JPG and map are removed from the log After the data cleaning the log entries must be partitioned into logical clusters using one or a series of transaction identification modules as discussed in section 3 As depicted in Figure 2 access log data may not be the only source of data for the Web usage mining pro cess User registration data for example is playing an increasingly important role particularly as more security and privacy conscious client-side applications restrict server access to a variety of information such as the client IP addresses or user IDS The data col lected through user registration must then be inte grated with the access log data While WEBMINER currently does not incorporate user registration data various data integration issues are being explored in the context of Web usage mining For a study of data integration in databases see 4 Once the domain-dependent data transformation phase is completed the resulting transaction data must be formatted to conform to the data model of the appropriate data mining task For instance the format of the data for the association rule discovery task may be different than the format necessary for mining sequential patterns Finally a query mech anism will allow the user analyst to provide more control over the discovery process by specifying var ious constraints The information from the query is used to reduce the mining process 5 Creation Data  scope and thus the cost of the of Test Server Log In order to compare the performance of the trans action identification modules presented in section 3 for the mining of association rules a server log with known rules is needed Mining of association rules from actual web server logs naturally results in differ ent lists of rules for each module and even for the same module with different input parameters It was de cided to create server logs with generated data for the purpose of comparing the three modules The model used to create the data is the user browsing behav ior model presented in section 2 The data generator takes a file with a description of a web site as a directed tree or graph and some embedded association rules The embedded association rules become the 223inter esting\224 rules that are checked for during experiments with different transaction identification modules For each 223user\224 the next log entry is one of three choices a forward reference backward reference or exit The probability of each choice is taken from the input file and a random number generator is used to make the decision If the page reference is going to be a con tent reference the time is calculated using a normal distribution and a mean time for the page taken from the input file The times for navigation hits are cal culated with an exponential distribution The point of using an exponential distribution for the navaga tion references and a normal distribution with differ ent averages for the content references is to create an overall distribution that is similar to those seen in real server logs Figure 3 shows a histogram of the refer ence lengths for a generated data set which is very similar to the histogram of the real server log data shown in Figure 1 6

  9 operation. In actuality the control of the hardware elements extends even further back to the TSX-5 and STEP heritage busses. These have over a dozen years more on-orbit success for the Air Force. Figure 9 shows several of these heritage satellites   The Glory hardware draws its heritage from the same series of satellites, namely the Defense Systems Inc. \(DSI CTA Space Systems \(CTASS\P bus architecture. TSX5 was an evolution from the STEP heritage, upgrading the electronics for radiation hardness. The TSX-5 mission is flying in a highly elliptical orbit that passes through the Van Allen belts. It has been flying for over 4 years in this environment. ACRIMSAT, OV-3 and VCL made only minor improvements to the TSX-5 designs  The reaction wheels are built by Orbital and are flying on the OV-3 satellite. The propulsion system was assembled and tested by Orbital and is identical to the OV-3 system More than 75% of the bus co mponents were built by Orbital at either the Dulles campus, or previously at the McLean or Germantown facilities. Orbital also manufactured the bus structure elements, including the aluminum honeycomb decks. The same methods were used on the extremely successful ACRIMSAT structure  In terms of the purchased components, most also have flight heritage. The GPS receivers have more than 100 years of combined on-orbit satellite years of operations on the Orbcomm constellation alone. The LN-200S is flying on the TSX-5 mission, and flew briefly on QuikToms \(launch vehicle problem\ RF transmitters and receivers are from L3-Conic and have significant flight heritage on both Orbital satellites and others across the industry. The Orbital-built antennas have extensive flight heritage. The torque rods are the industry standard units from Ithaco. The Solar Array Drive Assemblies SADAs\re the standard Type 2 gimbals from Moog. Orbital has flown these same drives on our geo-synchronous satellites    Figure 9 - ACRIMSAT, STEP-0 and VCL Satellites  The arrays are populated with single junction GaAs cells from Emcore, which was Tecstar when the cells were made and laid down on the panels. These cells are of the same vintage as those flying on the Orbcomm and GALEX satellites. The NiH2 battery is an SPV from Eagle-Picher. It is the same technology, although a smaller capacity, as the batteries flying on the Iridium constellation. The baseline star trackers are the ESA flight heritage Advanced Stellar Compass from the Danish Technical University \(DTU This unit has more than 5 years on orbit with the Oersted satellite, and has flown on more than 8 missions to date with no known failures  The Taurus launch vehicle has had 6 successful flights in various configurations. ACRIMSAT was successfully 


  10 launched on the same 2110 Taurus vehicle configuration in 1999 with the KOMPSAT satellite  Orbital has flown numerous missions from the Mission Operations Center \(MOC\lles using the MAESTRO ground software for command and telemetry. The MOC is shown below in Figure 10. This software is hosted on Sun workstations running the Solaris operating system. The most recent missions are OV-3 and GALEX. Both programs are running smoothly and operating as planned. ACRIMSAT has recently converted over to using the MAESTRO system for operations as well. USN is supporting the GALEX mission, including X-band pass services at Hawaii and Australia. Glory will follow this proven path. USN has also supported most of Orbital’s geo-synchronous satellite launches and on orbit checkouts    Figure 10 – Orbital’s Mission Operations Center  6  S UMMARY   In the case of the Glory program, it is concluded that reuse of many components from the VCL program not only significantly reduces the cost of the Glory mission but helps to make something of what could be shelved for an indeterminate amount of time.  By employing existing resources and knowledge from a program that was very mature, the Glory program is doing its part to contribute to cost saving measures and maximizing benefit to NASA. The Glory program provides savings of nearly $15M over a ground-up bus design effort, while mitigating significant risk on the bus portion of the mission  Glory is an ideal mission for ear th sciences in the realm of climate change research. It draws from significant flight heritage elements in both th e instruments and the spacecraft bus. It uses an existing NASA asset with minor refurbishment to save significant development costs. It uses a LV that has flown several NASA and DOD missions to date. The ground system employs flight proven hardware and software with a robust plan for backup coverage   7  R EFERENCES   NASA Facts Aerosols June 1999   NASA Godda rd Space Flight Center Glory Program Science and Mission Requirements Document  Greenbelt, Maryland, February 2, 2004  8  B IOGRAPHIES   Darcie A.
