Visualizing Association Rules for Text Mining Pak Chung Wong, Paul Whitney, Jim Thomas Pacific Northwest National Laboratory 206 ABSTRACT An association rule in data mining is an implication of the form X  256  Y where X is a set of antecedent items and Y  is the consequent item. For years researchers have developed many tools to visualize association rules. However, few of these tools can handle more than dozens of rules, and none of them can effectively manage rules with multiple antecedents. Thus, it is extremely difficult to visualize and understand the association information of a large data set even when all the rules are available. This paper presents a novel visualization technique to tackle many of these problems We apply the technology to a text mining study on large corpora The results indicate that our design can easily handle hundreds of multiple antecedent association rules in a three-dimensional display with minimum human interaction, low occlusion percentage and no screen swapping 1 INTRODUCTION Association is a powerful data analysis technique that appears frequently in data mining literature. An association rule is an implication of the form X  256  Y where X is a set of antecedent items and Y is the consequent item. An example association rule of a supermarket database is 80% of the people who buy diapers and baby powder also buy baby oil The analysis of association rules is used in a variety of ways, including merchandise stocking, insurance fraud investigation, and climate prediction. For years scientists and engineers have developed many visualization techniques to support the analyses of association rules. Commercial data mining systems such as SGI\222s MineSet [10  an d I B M\222s Q U E S T 8 p r o v i d e  to o l s to v i s u a liz e th e a s so c i a tio n s  o f  b u s in e s s  d a ta bases. Many of the visualizations, however, have come up short in dealing with numerous rules or rules with multiple antecedents This limitation presents serious challenges for analysts who need to understand the association information of large databases This paper presents a novel association-rule visualization system designed to tackle many of these problems. The system was developed to support our ongoing text mining and visualization research [6  7   11  13  14  15 o n  l a r g e u n s t r u c t u r e d do c u m e nt corpora. The focus is to study the relationships and implications among topics or descriptive concepts, that are used to characterize a corpus. The goal is to discover important association rules within a corpus such that the presence of a set of topics in an article implies the presence of another topic. For example, one might learn in headline news that whenever the words \223Greenspan\224 and \223inflation\224 occur, it is highly probably that the stock market is also mentioned. We demonstrate the results using a news corpus with more than 3,000 articles collected from open sources. We show that it is critical to have an effective visualization tool to support the analysis of topic associations on large corpora 2 RELATED WORK A visualization of association rules is a depiction of one-to-one or many-to-one mapping of information items. Prior work on visualization of association rules can be found in commercial data mining software such as MineSet [10 a n d  Q U E S T  8 9   T h e  ma t r i x based visualization designs that position items on separate axes are among the most popular approaches to visualize binary relationships.

Our definition of association rules is similar to that found in QUEST [9  T h e b a s i c a p pr oa ch i s  t o m i ne  qualitative 12 ru le s th a t d e sc ri b e a s so c i a tio n s b e tw e e n se ts  o f  i t e m s  This is different from the mining of quantitative rules in scientific simulation and modeling. Because our application \(text analysis requires no domain knowledge for mining, we adopt the qualitative definition in our implementation Given a set of items S   i 1 i 2,\205   i j 205  i n  where n 263 2. An association rule is an implication of the form X  256 i j where X  314  S  and i j 316  S such that i j  317 X The set of items X is the antecedent while the item i j is the consequent of the association rule. The size of X is between 1 to \(n-1\ items. The support of the rule X  256 i j is defined as the percentage of items in S that satisfies the union of items in X and i j The confidence of the rule is the percentage of articles that satisfies X and also satisfies i j   MineSet ha s similar definitions but uses the terms predictability and prevalence instead of confidence and support\ to describe the strengths of association rules. These are also naturally interpreted as estimates of conditional and joint probability 4 ASSOCIATION RULE VISUALIZATION At least five parameters are involved in a visualization of association rules: sets of antecedent items, consequent items, associations between antecedent and consequent, rules\222 support, and confidence. Our goal is to visualize a large number of association rules and their metadata in a three-dimensional \(3D\ display with minimum human interaction, minimum occlusion, and no screen swapping. There is no maximum limit on the number of antecedent items allowed in an association 4.1 Current Technology The two prevailing approaches used today to visualize association rules are the two-dimensional matrix and directed graph This section describes the general design of each approach and discusses their strengths and weakness 4.1.1 Two-Dimensional Matrix The basic design of a two-dimensional 2D\ association matrix positions the antecedent and consequent items on separate axes of a square matrix. Customized icons are drawn on certain matrix tiles that connect the antecedent and the consequent items of the corresponding association rules. Different icons can be used to depict different metadata such as the support and confidence values of the rules. Figure 1 depicts an association rule \(B 256 C\. Both the height and the color of the column icon can 206 P.O. Box 999, Richland, WA 99352, USA pak.wong@pnl.gov, paul.whitney@pnl.gov, jim.thomas@pnl.gov Pacific Northwest National Laboratory is operated for the U.S. Department of Energy by Battelle Memorial Institute under contract DE-AC0676RLO 1830 Figure 1: B 256 C 


Figure 4: Object occlusions be used to present metadata values. In Quest [8 e v a l u e s o f support and confidence are mapped to 3D columns that are built separately on and beneath the matrix tiles. Other icons such as disk and bar are also used to visualize metadata in the Rule Visualizer of MineSet  A 2D matrix is arguably the most effective technique to show one-toone binary relationship   I t  has  a long history of analyzing a wide variety of data in different disciplines The strengths of a 2D matrix, however, break down when we need to visualize many-to-one relationships such as association rules with multiple antecedent items. For example, in Figure 2 it is almost impossible to tell whether there is only one association rule \(A+B 256 C\ or two \(A 256 C and B 256 C\. The lack of a practical way to identify the togetherness of individual antecedent items makes a 2D matrix a weaker candidate to visualize rules with multiple antecedent items MineSet addresses the problem by grouping all the antecedent items of an association rule as one unit and plotting it against its consequent, i.e an antecedent-to-consequent plot. For example, a dedicated item group A+B\ created in Figure 3 to describe the association rule A+B 256 C\. The strategy works fine for smaller antecedent sets \(e.g., less than 3 items\. In our text mining studies, we encounter association rules with as many as 12 items in the antecedent. The replication of items in the antecedent groups creates a much larger antecedent-to-consequent plot when compared with the corresponding item-to-item plot. The loss of item identity within an antecedent group also defeats the purpose of visualizing the associations with a matrix. For example, the row \(or column\of the matrix connected to an item can no longer be used to search for all the rules involving that item Another problem in a 2D-matrix display is object occlusion, especially when multiple icons are used to depict different metadata values on the matrix tiles. The occlusion problem is obvious in Figure 4 4.1.2  Directed Graph A directed graph is another prevailing technique to depict item associations. The nodes of a directed graph represent the items and the edges represent the associations. Figure 5 shows three association rules \(A 256 C, B 256 C, A+B 256 C This technique works well when only a few items \(nodes\ and associations \(edges\ are involved. An association graph can quickly turn into a tangled display with as few as a dozen rules. Hetzler et al. [6 d d r e s s t h e p r o b l e m  b y animating the edges to show the associations of certain items with 3D rainbow arcs. The animation technique requires significant human interaction to turn on and off the item nodes. It is not an easy task to show multiple metadata values, including support and confidence, alongside the association rules 4.2 A Novel Visualization Technique We present a novel technique to visualize many-to-one association rules. Instead of using the tiles of a 2D matrix to show the item-toitem association rules, we use the matrix to depict the rule-to-item relationship. In Figure 6 and CP1, the rows of the matrix floor represent the items \(or topics in the context of text mining\, and the columns represent the item associations. The blue and red blocks of each column \(rule\ represent the antecedent and the consequent of the rule. The identities of the items are shown along the right side of the matrix. The confidence and support levels of the rules are given by the corresponding bar charts in different scales at the far end of the matrix. The system supports basic query commands through the use of pop-up menus to restrict key items to be included in the visualization. The display has a mousecontrolled zooming capability to support context/focus analysis The rule-to-item visualization approach has many advantages over all the other matrix-based predecessors 267  There is virtually no upper li mit on the number of items in an antecedent 267  We can analyze the distributions of the associations \(horizontal\and the items within \(vertical\ simultaneously 267  Unlike Figure 3, the identity of individual items within an antecedent group is clearly shown 267  No new antecedent groups are created because of the multiple antecedent items in association rules 267  Because all the metadata are plotted at the far end and the heights of the columns are scaled, few occlusions occur 267  No screen swapping, animation, or human interaction \(other than basic mouse zooming\ is required to analyze the rules From our experiments, this technique works well with up to several hundred association rules and dozens of antecedent topics on a 17-inch monitor. This is a significant improvement over the traditional 2D item-to-item association visualization 5 TEXT MINING - AN APPLICATION This section briefly describes our design philosophy and implementation issues of a text association mining system. \(See f o r more information about the overall system.\ The design is based on ideas from information retrieval and syntactic analysis.

5.1 Demonstration Corpus The experimental results and graphics presented in this paper are generated using a news article corpus obtained from open sources The medium-sized \(~9MB\ news corpus is stored as an ASCII file with more than 3,000 articles collected during April 20-26, 1995 This corpus has a strong theme associated with the bombing of the U.S. Federal Building in Oklahoma. Other major news stories during the week include the Simpson trial, the Unabomber, the Bosnian crisis, and the France election 5.2 System Overview Figure 7 shows a high-level system overview of the topic association mining system. A corpus of narrative text is fed into a text engine for topic extractions. The mining engine then reads the topics from the text engine and generates topic association rules Finally, the resultant association rules are sent to the visualization system for further analysis 5.3 Text Engine We developed two text engines to generate conceptual topics from a large corpus. The first one is word based and results in a list of content-bearing words for the corpus. The second is concept based and results in concepts \(represented as word groups\ based on the corpus. The engines are similar in that the topics and concepts are initially evaluated using the entire corpus. Because of limited space, we only present the word-based engine here. A description of the concept-based text engine is available in  The word-based text engine selects an interesting subset of words Words separated by white spaces in a corpus are evaluated within the context of that corpus to assess whether a word is \223interesting\224 enough to be a topic. Bookstein\222s [3 i d e a s  r e ga r d i n g i d en t i f i ca t i on of content-bearing words are used to assess the relative contribution of a word to the content of the corpus. The co-occurrence or lack of co-occurrence of these \223interesting\224 words in documents is used to evaluate the strengths of the words. Stemming is used to remove suffixes so that similar words are represented by the root word. Commonly appearing words that do not directly contribute to the content \227 such as prepositions, pronouns, adjectives, and gerunds \227 are ignored Table 1 shows the top 20 topic words generated from this text engine using the news corpus. The content-bearing topic words all nouns in this example\ included in the table represent many familiar headline news stories of the week Table 1: Top 20 topic words and their corresponding news stories Topic Word News Story billion Congress and budget Neufeld Simpson trial Korea North/South Korea nuclear talks Chirac France election tribunal Bosnian crisis Bosnian Bosnian crisis Unabomber Unabomber CIA Unabomber Mazzola Simpson trial treaty North/South Korea nuclear talks Jospin France election Serb Bosnian crisis McVeigh Oklahoma bombing Simpson Simpson trial Nichols Oklahoma bombing Nuclear North/South Korea nuclear talks Sarajevo Bosnian crisis Ito Simpson trial Koernke Oklahoma bombing refugee Bosnian crisis 5.4 Topic Association Mining The topic words selected by the text engine are fed into the mining engine to compute the association rules according to the requested confidence and support values. Table 2 shows a sample of topic association rules with confidence 263 80% and support 263 1% generated from the April 1995 news corpus Table 2: A sample of twelve association rules \(not in order Antecedent Consequent Confidence Support Manager & McVeigh Michigan & motel Nichols & sketch Truck 91.30 1.39 Ito & court & jury Mazzola & testimony Simpson 100.00 1.72 France & election socialist Chirac 97.30 1.19 Blood & testimony Fung 81.25 1.29 Court & judge & jury Ito 96.49 1.81 Blood & vial Mazzola 100.00 1.19 Ammonium & nitrate bomb & FBI Nichols 89.13 1.35 Bomb & cult Michigan & militia McVeigh 100.00 1.22 Hutu & Rwanda Refugee 92.86 1.29 Bosnia & Bosnian Crimes Serb 100.00 1.22 Bosnia & Serb Sarajevo War 90.48 1.25 Cult & gas & subway Tokyo 95.00 1.88 5.5 Topic Association Visualization Figure 8 and CP 2 depict a set of topic association rules extracted from the April 1995 news corpus with support 263 6% and confidence 263 60%. The rules are shown in ascending order from the left side according to the confidence values. This visualization can be used to study different aspects of the topic associations, including the topic distribution of selected rules and the correlation between different metadata values. Figure 9 and CP3 show a different arrangement of the same set of association rules, which are now ordered by the consequent items. All the associations with the same consequent items are group together for analysis 6 DISCUSSION Switching from an item-to-item arrangement to a rule-to-item design of a 2D matrix lets us effectively display association rules with multiple antecedent topics. The current design works well with up to several hundred association rules on a 17-inch monitor Figure 7: Overview of the topic association system

We introduce a new visualization technique designed to overcome many of the shortcomings of it predecessors. We apply the new technique to a text mining system to analyze a large text corpus The results indicate that our design can easily handle hundreds of multiple antecedent association rules in a 3D display with minimum human interactions, low occlusion percentage, and no screen swapping Our long-term goal is to integrate many of our tools and techniques into a single visualization environment that provides userfriendly navigation, in-depth association and implication analyses time sequence analysis, hypothesis explanation, and document summarization ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This research has been supported by a Laboratory Directed Research and Development grant funded by the U.S. Department of Energy for the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics X$bn 2-5 November 2003 Rule set Rd classify the test data set is 82.35 and the number of cases that is classified wrongly is 3. These results are showed in Table 1 Among the cases that are classified wrongly by the set of DTR, there is just one case that appears in the cases that is classified wrongly by the set of CAR This point shows that there is complementary relation between the set of DTR and the set of CAR and we can combine them to improve the precision of class prediction Lastly, we compare the precision of classification of R with the precision of Rd and R respectively The two ride sets Rd and R are combined using the algorithm C2S in section 4.3 and a new rule set R with 51 rules is gotten The accuracy of using R to classify the test data set is 88.23 The results are also showed in Table 1 We find the final rule set R has higher precision classification than Rd and R This indicate that it is efficient to substitute the combining rule set R for individual Rd and Ra to classify video Table 1 Experimental results Rule No Precision I Errors 26 76.47  4 I  R I 29 I 82.35 I 3 I R 151 1 88.23 12 The experiment results show that our approach of combining two rule sets outperform using just one rule set to classify the video 6 Conclusions A novel content-based automatic video classification approach based on data mining is proposed in this paper Firstly in the video segmentation process the method extracts a set of video attribute to represent the content of video and generates a video attribute database. Then the decision tree and class association rule mining techniques are used on this video attribute database to extract a decision tree rules and class association rules Lastly a combining and pruning algorithm is proposed to combine these two rule sets to generate a final rule set The experiment results verify the consistency and certain complementarities of decision tree classification with class association classification The results also show the combined rule set improve the classification precision and have higher classification precision than just one rule set Acknowledgements The paper is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(No.60173058 References M.J.
