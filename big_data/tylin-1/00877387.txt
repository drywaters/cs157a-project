of Computing Nottingham Trent University Nottingham NG14BU UK Abstract In this paper we discuss an issue of description of highly dimensional data realized in terms of fuzzy sets The underlying idea is to granulate numeric data using fuzzy sets and afterwards reveal and quantify relationships between these granules This naturally impacts the dimensionality of any original dataset under discussion and provides with its 
nonlinear transformation through the corresponding membership functions These information granules give rise to the notion of associations  multidimensional information granules Being fuzzy relations these constructs are direction  free The directionality arises when one defines inputs and outputs and in this way confines himself to some sort of rules capturing a directional nature of main relationships within the data. Rules arising from associations 
may be in conflict The essence of data is then captured via a granular signature regarded as a mixture of associations and rules Keywords information granulation associations relevance linkage, granular signature, data mining 1 INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS Intelligent Data Analysis IDA\has emerged as a new and promising direction of research that intends to make sense of multivariable data The agenda of IDA as well as data mining 
is very broad IDA provides with an insight into the data by revealing main trends and relationships between variables By analyzing data in the IDA environment one derives useful patterns that can be refined and used afterwards in the form of detailed models In this way these patterns help 0-7803-6274-8/00/$10.00 O 2000 IEEE make predictions and making decisions In a nutshell IDA attempts to 
operate at a level that is comfortable to the human user operating at the level of specificity that allows the user to build a global picture about the nature of relationships occurring within the data set The duality of the quantitative-qualitative approach is particularly appealing when dealing with complex systems They are abstract to a very high extent and usually not guided by any specific laws of physics Furthermore they exhibit a high level 
of variability that calls for a careful treatment In particular modeling has to be carried out at various levels of specificity These levels give rise to models of varying level of specificity granularity by concentrating on and revealing different levels of details In this study we pursue a concept of associations formed at the level of information granules 3][4][5 regarded as basic building blocks used in data analysis Roughly 
speaking associations are highly homogeneous and experimentally strongly justifiable information granules capturing the essence of given data at hand To illustrate the concept refer to Figure 1 illustrating various clouds of two-dimensional experimental data When analyzing this data set from such perspective we may easily identify several regions of concentration of data emerging in a form of some clusters \(associations 69 


I Figure 1 An example data set visualizing some well formed regions of high density of data along areas of low density and poorly visible structure As seen there in some regions the data points exhibit clear high density and take on some well defined shape say hyperellipsoidal or single-line structure In some other regions there are few scattered points with no clear and strong dependency Intuitively one can delineate some highly populated regions and view them as highly representative to the entire data set. Subsequently all such associations can be subject to further detailed analysis and form a basis for a construction of a detailed model quantifying specific dependencies between the variables It becomes apparent that association analysis can be viewed as a preliminary step in data analysis that may be afterwards refined by building detailed models In this sense constructing data associations may serve as blueprint of further more detailed and mathematically specific models say regression lines correlation coefficients neural networks and alike 2 THE DESIGN OF GRANULAR ASSOCIATIONS In this section, we define a concept of information granules and reveal how these are used in the design of associations The proposed development methodology involves two key phases a building basic information granules for each individual variable and b\forming associations with the use of these information granules 2.1 Building information granules for individual variables For each variable \(measure we specify a certain number of information granules By information granules we mean a collection of elements that are collected together owing to their similarity or functional cohesiveness Information granules exhibit a well-defined semantics and easily comprehended by humans and therefore could serve as useful descriptors of the problem For instance when talking about lines of code of a certain software product it is convenient to talk about small, medium and large size of code rather than confining to a single number, say 700K code These terms like small medium and alike are examples of information granules they are easy to understand highly descriptive and handy when communicating findings about the given data set Similarly they are helpful in making design decisions The way in which we proceed at the formal end may vary Such information granules can be represented as sets fuzzy sets rough sets shadowed sets etc Now an important question arises as to the determination of the fuzzy sets information granules First, we have to decide on the form of the membership functions that describe a way in which the membership grades vary over the space The simplest model is a triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy set While each fuzzy set comes with a transparent semantics its parameters need to be adjusted and should reflect the nature of the experimental data these fuzzy sets have to granulate Fuzzy equalization 2 forms a simple yet efficient algorithm of determining the parameters of the fuzzy sets In a nutshell the concept of fuzzy equalization originates from the idea of fuzzy events 1][3 Consider a fuzzy set A defined over some universe of discourse X In this universe we have a family of experimental numeric data that are conveniently described by a certain probability density function pdf p\(x Then the probability of the fuzzy event fuzzy set A\is computed in the form X 1 Essentially P\(A is just an expected value of A Interestingly the probability of the fuzzy event carries a straightforward interpretation Fuzzy set can be viewed as meaningful if its probability P\(A is equal or exceeds a certain critical value a namely P\(A a If this holds we say A is e.xperimentally justified valid The monotonicity property holds if A C A\222 \(that is the granularity of A is higher that the one of A\222 then the corresponding probabilities satisfy the monotonicity condition P\(A 5 P\(A\222 Now let us consider a family of fuzzy sets, say A Al A2  4 is given To make each Ai meaningful in the above sense of experimental justification we request that there is an equal level of experimental evidence equal to l/c that is 2 According to the above equalization condition fuzzy sets become more specific \(detailed in the P\(AJ l/c 70 


regions of X where the pdf attains some local maximum On the other hand, in the areas of low values of pdf we need fuzzy sets of broader support to gain sufficient experimental evidence see Figure 2 Figure 2 The idea of fuzzy equalization 2.2 Building associations as multidimensional experimental structures Fuzzy sets defined in the individual coordinates spaces are generic components forming associations Consider n" variables in the data set The fuzzy sets in each coordinate is denoted by A A2  A first variable\B1 B1  B second variable\etc Formally speaking an association A is a Cartesian product of any combination of the fuzzy sets for each variable Formally the association A comes in the form A=Ai X Bj 3 The operation of combining the membership grades is realized using a t-norm In particular one may consider a minimum operation as one of the plausible options This gives rise to the expression A\(x Y  A X x, Y  min\(A,\(x B,\(Y 4 An illustration of the associations in the case of two variables is illustrated in Figure 3 sequence of indexes it i2  in where ik describes an index of the fuzzy set in the k-th coordinate variable contributing to this specific association. Say, for n  3 a certain association B comes in the form B  2,4 1 In light of the introduced design procedure, several interesting features are worth emphasizing Associations are relations more specifically fuzzy relations defined in the Cartesian product of the space of all variables As relations they do not assume any direction meaning that we do not make any statement as to a possible implication between the software measures say measure a implies some values of measure b By being direction-free the construct is far more general than any rule \(that is a conditional statement of the form if  then In the sense of this lack of directionality associations resemble correlation coefficient or correlation matrices that do not stipulate any implication between the variables The main difference between correlation analysis and association analysis lies in the fact that the first deals with a global analysis while the latter is aimed at the analysis carried out at a local level of some well-defined and experimentally justified information granules Global analysis may be appealing but it could be also dangerous especially when there are some gaps in a data set \(and this could be quite visible in cases where there is no justification for continuity of underlying phenomena and the ensuing data\Association analysis helps avoid this pitfall Figure 4 contrasts these two general approaches The global analysis would support moving into a single regression model The local association-based analysis promotes a series of highly justifiable local models built around individual associations and in this manner avoids drawing conclusions in the regions where data are almost nonexistent or very sparse In the sequel one may carry out a local type regression analysis t A A Figure 3 Associations for two dimensional case note that the variables we granulated by two A and A and three fuzzy sets B B and BJ respectively The association A is uniquely specified by a sequence of indexes identifying the coordinates of the fuzzy sets. Thus we may characterize A by a Figure 4 Local regression models constructed on the basis of associations From the formal standpoint associations are a better starting point of data analysis. Evidently not all associations relations are functions It could 71 


well be that there are associations in the data but not necessarily functions One should identify associations first and then start revealing functions that are definitely constructed on the basis of the given associations 3 BUILDING AN AGENDA OF ASSOCIATIONS The number of all possible associations is tremendous With n variables and p information granules fuzzy sets or sets defined for each of them we end up with p possible associations Only a small fraction of these is meaningful that is justified supported by the experimental evidence data at hand For a uniform distribution of data \(which is usually not a case the probability of data supporting each association is  Most of the associations are void meaning that there is no data behind them Naturally a straightforward criterion to select meaningful associations would be to quantify a level of experimental evidence behind them Two measures of experimental support are of interest here U-count For association A see 8 we compute 1 P N  Cmin\(Ai\(xk y k=l cardinality This applies to the support of A and involves counting all elements of the data set falling under the support of A No membership grades are used in this case The computations follow the formula where XAi and XBj are the characteristic functions of the supports of the corresponding fuzzy sets, namely 1 if XE supp\(A 0 otherwise X.4 x  The most meaningful associations are combined in a form of an agenda that is a collection of associations with the highest values of the cardinality and arranged in a decreasing order with respect to the cardinality value The size of the agenda is selected in such a way so that all associations there cover a certain percentage of the overall data set say 70 As emphasized the number of all possible associations is high A brute-force enumeration can work for 10  12 variables and 3  4 fuzzy sets in each variable Quite quickly this approach is not feasible Fortunately there is a simple solution that helps overcome the problem A complete enumeration can be combined by a simultaneous pruning technique which avoids exploring combinations of fuzzy sets not supporting enough data The pruning is possible because the cardinality and o-count decreases its value once more variables come into play Moreover at each stage of expanding the association see Figure 5 some combinations are pruned and the related expansions are not pursued This immensely reduces the number of possibilities that need to be investigated Figure 5 The pruning of associations in their process of successive development note that at each level when adding one extra variable only a portion of the most meaningful Cartesian products is retained 4 FROM ASSOCIATIONS TO RULES Associations are direction-neutral local structures in which we do not distinguish between input independent and output dependent variables This obviously leads to a significant level of generality of such constructs In addition to being direction-free the associations are structure-free They do not confine themselves to any specific type of analytical relationships between the software measures Treating associations, and the agenda in particular as a starting point for any detailed modeling pursuit several main directions can be envisioned 72 


a identifying rules b constructing detailed parametric models for each association In contrast to associations rules are direction sensitive structures Variables have to be declared as independent or dependent The independent variables come as a condition part of the rule The dependent variables appear in the conclusion part Once we have identified the variables each association can be viewed as an individual rule  if condition and condition2 and  and condition then conclusion1 and conclusionz and conclusion where r  p  n In contrast to associations rules cannot be treated individually but have to analyzed and utilized en block Some rules resulting from the above transformation of the associations could be in conflict Two rules are said to be in conflict if they have identical condition parts and have different conclusion parts 5 REDUCTION OF RULEBASES The rules come as a direct transformation of the associations Their number could be reduced through some merging process For instance two rules   if A1 and B1 then C1 if A2 and B1 then C1 can be easily merged into a single more general rule in which one of the conditions is a disjunction of two information granules \(assuming that A1 and A2 are two adjacent fuzzy sets The generalization of this nature reduces the number of all rules and could be automated to some extent The crux of the optimization approach dwells on a well-known Quine-McCluskey reduction scheme commonly encountered in digital systems To illustrate how this optimization is carried out let us confine ourselves to a simple illustrative example Consider only two variables and four fuzzy sets \(information granules\defined in each of them, say AI A2 A3 and  as well as B1 to B4 The rules are if A1 or A2 and B1 then C1 if A2 and B2 then C1 if A2 and B3 then C1 if A2 and B4 then C1 Each fuzzy set is coded in a binary fashion The binary assignment is carried out in such a way that the neighboring fuzzy sets say small  medium medium-large are made adjacent on the Karnaugh map \(K-map say Al OO A2  01 A3 ll and  lo Using the above coding scheme, the original rules occupy single entries in the K-map The Quine-McCluskey method determines all prime implicants and thus helps us carry out the simplification generalization of the rules in an automatic fashion The prime implicants lead to the reduced rules   if A2 and B2 or B3 then C1 if A2 and B3 or B4 then C1 Some further generalization is still possible even though the original simplification method does not cope with this phenomenon We can merge the two rules by generalizing the first condition in the following form if A2 and B2 or B3 or B4 then C1 6 CONCLUSIONS Intelligent data analysis \(data mining is definitely a human-centered endeavor with a high level of useddesigner interaction Granularity of information is a key conceptual and algorithmic notion that makes this interaction effective and leads to transparent results Two fundamental modeling concepts  associations and rules have been introduced and discussed in detail along with a comparative analysis ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada \(NSERC and ASERC Alberta Software Engineering Research Consortium\is gratefully acknowledged 7 REFERENCES 1 Pedrycz W F Gomide 1998 An Introduction to Fuzzy Sets Analysis and Design MIT Press Cambridge MA 2 Pedrycz W Fuzzy equalization in the construction of fuzzy sets Fuzzy Sets and Systems to appear 3 Zadeh L.A 1979 Fuzzy sets and information granularity In M.M Gupta R.K Ragade R.R Yager eds Advances in Fuzzy Set Theory and Applications North Holland, Amsterdam 3 18 4 Zadeh L.A 1996 Fuzzy logic  computing with words IEEE Trans on Fuzzy Systems vol 4 5 Zadeh L.A 1997 Toward a theory of fuzzy information granulation and its centrality in human reasoning and fuzzy logic Fuuy Sets and Systems 2 103-111 90 111-117 73 


  6  The APS collects global aerosol data based on along-track sub-satellite polarimetric measurements taken within the solar reflective spectral region \(0.4 to 2.4 microns Measurements of spectral radiance are restricted to the sunlit portion of the orbit.  Clouds have a significant impact on the quality of polarimetric measurements.  This is the reason for the on-board cloud cameras that are used to distinguish between clear and cloudy scenes. Each of the cameras covers a different spectral band, but the mission can be accomplished with e ither of them. A pictorial representation of the APS instrument is shown in Figure 5   Figure 5 The APS Science Instrument has a Scanning Mirror Assembly in the Along-Track Direction  The Glory mission will use the APS instrument to help understand the climate-relevant chemical, microphysical and optical properties, as well as spatial and temporal distributions of human-caused and naturally occurring aerosols 2 Specifically, Glory will be used to assist in determining  1  The global distribution of natural and anthropogenic aerosols \(black carbons, sulfat es, etc\curacy and coverage sufficient for reliable quantification of   The aerosol effect on climate   The anthropogenic componen t of the aerosol effect   The long term change of the aerosol effect caused by natural and anthropogenic factors 2  The direct impact of aeroso ls on the radiation budget and its natural and anth ropogenic components 3  The effect of aerosols on clouds and precipitation and its natural and anthropogenic components 4  Investigating the feasibility of improved measurements of black carbons and dust absorption to provide more accurate estimates of their contribution to the climate forcing function  Solar Science  Total solar irradiance \(TSI\ addition to the absorption and reflection of this radiation by the Earth’s atmosphere determines the global average te mperature of the Earth.  The intensity of the sun and the response of the atmosphere directly affects the climate Changes in either arena can dramatically change the global cl imate.  Solar intensity is a natural phenomenon whereas the composition of the atmosphere has been strongly influenced by the byproducts of modern industrial societies The average temperature of the Earth has increased by 0.5  C over the past 100 years.  It is important to understand whether this change in global climate is a result of modern industry or if it is an effect of the natural solar phenomenon  One of the Glory mission’s goals is to measure TSI in such a manner that allows determination of the Sun’s direct and indirect effects on the Earth’s climate. This will be achieved by continuing the database of TSI measurements started on the ACRIM, SOHO and SORCE missions. The instrument is sensitive enough to see variations in the TSI from Sunspots and Solar Flares \(shown in Figure 6    http://umbra.nascom.nasa.g ov/images/latest_eit_304.gif  Figure 6 - Solar Flares and Sunspots The TIM instrument collects hi gh accuracy, high precision measurements of total TSI using an active cavity radiometer that monitors changes in incident solar energy to the Earth’s atmosphere.  The TIM is designed to operate in a solarviewing orientation, therefore it is mounted on a gimbaled platform that accommodates targeting independent of the spacecraft’s nadir viewing attitude The TIM inst rument that is flying on the SORCE mission is shown in Figure 7  Solar Calibrator Scanning Mirror Assembly Nadir Aperature Motor Assembly 


  7  Figure 7 TIM Science Instrument  4   D IFFERENCES F ROM VCL TO G LORY   Modifications are being made to the VCL bus to configure it to meet the Glory mission requirements.  Some of the major changes include changing the or ientation of the spacecraft solar array repositioning for biaxial articulation, as well as the instrument structure assembly.  The requirement changes from VCL to Glory that had the largest impact are   Mission Parameter Glory VCL Orbit Altitude 824 km \(+/-10 km 400 km \(+/-10 km Orbit Inclination 98.67 degrees 69.0 degrees Sun Synchronous Yes, with 10:30am descending crossing \(-15/+45 minutes No Solar Beta Angle Range \(derived from above 7 to +31 degrees 90 to +90 degrees \(note, yaw maneuver effectively limits beta to 0 to +90 for thermal purposes Mission Life 3 years for science, 5 years for bus 25 months \(including 1 month checkout Flight Attitude Battery toward earth, solar array gimble forward, Sun on propulsion deck  \(positive beta angles Propulsion deck toward zenith  Sun always on shear panel near transmitter and transponder, Battery in forward or aft direction depending on yaw manuever   The new orbit and vehicle orientation have changed the spacecraft environment and sink temperatures.  New solar array orientation and tracking also changed the local spacecraft environment and view factors.  The solar arrays must be maintained within specification limits, but are now exposed to a colder environment in eclipse  Optimization of the array pointing has increased the spacecraft power generation re sulting in an increased spacecraft and battery heat dissip ation.  This new orientation was traded against the higher cost of upgrading the solar array cells to higher efficiency triple-junction cells. The VCL payload went into quiescent mode over water while the Glory observatory operation is continuous in sunlight and the instruments are not powered off.  Heater power demand is expected to be well within the 32W VCL heater power budget due to the hi gher overall average bus temperature  There are several relocated and added bus components including new star trackers a nd star tracker electronics mounted on the instrument structural assembly. Cost for completion of the old Ball trackers was traded against the cost for new trackers \(selected\yload Interface Processor \(PIP\s required to accommodate the 1553 interface for APS and TIM, as well as several other mission unique payload interfaces. Several processor candidates were traded for the PIP, with the SCS-750 being selected for its combination of cost and features. A second S-Band receiver was added to improve reliability.  Lower cost redundant GPS units were sel ected to replace the sciencequality JPL BlackJack planned for VCL, which had not been completed on that program  The most significant thermal hardware change will be to the battery thermal control design.  This is due to the battery radiator external environment and dissipation changes.  On VCL the battery radiator was in the velocity/anti-velocity vector with a better view to space. This resulted in a lower sink temperature for the battery.  The attitude change required to fly the Glory pa yloads caused increased earth albedo input and higher sink temperature for the existing radiator design. For Glory the radiator was split onto two panels adjacent to the nadir panel \(Figure 8\ External header heatpipes will be used to transport the heat from the battery panel to the two adjacent radiator panels. In addition the saddle holding the battery will be improved for more efficient heat transport. This will decrease the  T from the battery to the radiator from 25°C to 10°C. In addition a trade study was performed to assess whether it made more sense to buy a new battery or convin ce the review committees that it would be acceptable to fly an 8-year old battery. A new battery will be flown on the Glory mission  


  8  Figure 8 Battery Heatpipe Configuration  Due to the higher LV loads on Glory, the propulsion tank brackets must be redesigned for improved strength. A stiffener may also be required for the propulsion deck, but analysis is still in progress The stringers and plates are sufficient to handle the increased loads and payload mass  The antenna placement for Glory is significantly different than for VCL. VCL had their payload nadir pointing and the X-band antenna mounted on the instrument deck facing nadir. For Glory, the X-band antenna is still nadir pointing but mounted on the edge of the propulsion deck. The –Y Sband antenna is marginally changed in location and orientation from VCL. The +Y S-band antenna will be mounted on a deployable boom for Glory in order to extend beyond the open APS Earth shield and to not impinge on the field of view of the APS cryoradiator  There will be significant wire harness changes required for Glory. Many of these are to accommodate the new suite of instruments, however some are to correct problems in the VCL design and to improve the overall reliability for the Glory mission. One major change is incorporating an external fuse plug for the power switches. This change also allows an additional 12 field-effect transistor \(FET switches to be used instead of being ganged together as they were on VCL. Significant system engineering effort went into this decision as well as a trade on how to route the instrument harness and component location on the IMA  The last major change required from VCL to Glory is the Flight SW on all the proce ssors. The ACRIMSAT, VCL and OV-3 software started from a common baseline in 1997 Since that time the codes dive rged to some extent, even though the overall architecture is the same module-based design. The OV-3 code has had 3 more years of development since VCL was put into storage. It has been flying for more than a year at this point. Because of this, it was decided that it made much more sense to start from the OV-3 baseline for the Glory mission. The sole exception to this is the ACS algorithms, which will be from VCL, as the VCL code has most of the el ements to meet the Glory requirements, with minimal changes required. OV-3 is a highly agile platform that slews constantly, and thus less applicable from an attitude control viewpoint than VCL which was also a nadir pointer like Glory. Using the OV-3 C&DH software does not require major changes either, in that most of the hardware components are common between the two programs, including the PIP software that will draw significant heritage from the OV-3 PIP baseline  The overall cost trade between reuse of the VCL bus versus a new bus is not simple to resolve.  There are numerous things that would have to be done differently on a new bus versus retrofitting the fully redundant VCL bus for Glory However, an educated estimate of the delta cost for a new bus over VCL refurbishment is on the order of $10M-$15M or a third of a new bus cost. On a $200M program including launch vehicle costs, this is a significant cost driver. Therefore it made sense for NASA to use an existing asset over a new procurement. Fu rther, there is a significant reduction in risk for the bus portion of the mission since the majority of the hardware is built and has been shown to be flight worthy. Both cost and schedule risk has been mitigated  5  H ERITAGE   The Glory instruments have varied amounts of heritage TIM has the most direct, extensive heritage since it is a rebuild of the TIM instrument on SORCE, which has been flying for two years. The gimbal is new for TIM, but the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics \(LASP\of the University of Colorado has heritage with the control electronics from a previous program. The Fine Sun Sensor is new as well, but has been in development at LASP for a significant time and is not considered a risk  The Cloud Camera similarly has heritage as it is based on the Ball star tracker platform This cloud camera is identical to the flight heritage star trac kers with a different filtering scheme and focal length. The system has been flight qualified for the CALIPSO missi on and will be flown soon The Glory units will be identical in manufacture to the CALIPSO units, although the da ta readout scheme and rate and the filter bandwidth will be different for Glory  The APS instrument has the least heritage of the Glory suite. It is essentially a new development, although it does use some heritage parts and circuits. Some of the optics and materials derive heritage from the EOSP mission. There is also some heritage for parts of the instrument drawn from the RSP airborne instrument, with flight heritage by Spectir  The Glory bus has significant flight heritage in nearly all regards. As mentioned above, the flight software draws extensively from both the ACRIMSAT and OV-3 programs with more than 6 years of successful combined on-orbit Radiator Heatpipes Header Heatpipes to transfer heat to radiator panels Radiator Panel 


  9 operation. In actuality the control of the hardware elements extends even further back to the TSX-5 and STEP heritage busses. These have over a dozen years more on-orbit success for the Air Force. Figure 9 shows several of these heritage satellites   The Glory hardware draws its heritage from the same series of satellites, namely the Defense Systems Inc. \(DSI CTA Space Systems \(CTASS\P bus architecture. TSX5 was an evolution from the STEP heritage, upgrading the electronics for radiation hardness. The TSX-5 mission is flying in a highly elliptical orbit that passes through the Van Allen belts. It has been flying for over 4 years in this environment. ACRIMSAT, OV-3 and VCL made only minor improvements to the TSX-5 designs  The reaction wheels are built by Orbital and are flying on the OV-3 satellite. The propulsion system was assembled and tested by Orbital and is identical to the OV-3 system More than 75% of the bus co mponents were built by Orbital at either the Dulles campus, or previously at the McLean or Germantown facilities. Orbital also manufactured the bus structure elements, including the aluminum honeycomb decks. The same methods were used on the extremely successful ACRIMSAT structure  In terms of the purchased components, most also have flight heritage. The GPS receivers have more than 100 years of combined on-orbit satellite years of operations on the Orbcomm constellation alone. The LN-200S is flying on the TSX-5 mission, and flew briefly on QuikToms \(launch vehicle problem\ RF transmitters and receivers are from L3-Conic and have significant flight heritage on both Orbital satellites and others across the industry. The Orbital-built antennas have extensive flight heritage. The torque rods are the industry standard units from Ithaco. The Solar Array Drive Assemblies SADAs\re the standard Type 2 gimbals from Moog. Orbital has flown these same drives on our geo-synchronous satellites    Figure 9 - ACRIMSAT, STEP-0 and VCL Satellites  The arrays are populated with single junction GaAs cells from Emcore, which was Tecstar when the cells were made and laid down on the panels. These cells are of the same vintage as those flying on the Orbcomm and GALEX satellites. The NiH2 battery is an SPV from Eagle-Picher. It is the same technology, although a smaller capacity, as the batteries flying on the Iridium constellation. The baseline star trackers are the ESA flight heritage Advanced Stellar Compass from the Danish Technical University \(DTU This unit has more than 5 years on orbit with the Oersted satellite, and has flown on more than 8 missions to date with no known failures  The Taurus launch vehicle has had 6 successful flights in various configurations. ACRIMSAT was successfully 


  10 launched on the same 2110 Taurus vehicle configuration in 1999 with the KOMPSAT satellite  Orbital has flown numerous missions from the Mission Operations Center \(MOC\lles using the MAESTRO ground software for command and telemetry. The MOC is shown below in Figure 10. This software is hosted on Sun workstations running the Solaris operating system. The most recent missions are OV-3 and GALEX. Both programs are running smoothly and operating as planned. ACRIMSAT has recently converted over to using the MAESTRO system for operations as well. USN is supporting the GALEX mission, including X-band pass services at Hawaii and Australia. Glory will follow this proven path. USN has also supported most of Orbital’s geo-synchronous satellite launches and on orbit checkouts    Figure 10 – Orbital’s Mission Operations Center  6  S UMMARY   In the case of the Glory program, it is concluded that reuse of many components from the VCL program not only significantly reduces the cost of the Glory mission but helps to make something of what could be shelved for an indeterminate amount of time.  By employing existing resources and knowledge from a program that was very mature, the Glory program is doing its part to contribute to cost saving measures and maximizing benefit to NASA. The Glory program provides savings of nearly $15M over a ground-up bus design effort, while mitigating significant risk on the bus portion of the mission  Glory is an ideal mission for ear th sciences in the realm of climate change research. It draws from significant flight heritage elements in both th e instruments and the spacecraft bus. It uses an existing NASA asset with minor refurbishment to save significant development costs. It uses a LV that has flown several NASA and DOD missions to date. The ground system employs flight proven hardware and software with a robust plan for backup coverage   7  R EFERENCES   NASA Facts Aerosols June 1999   NASA Godda rd Space Flight Center Glory Program Science and Mission Requirements Document  Greenbelt, Maryland, February 2, 2004  8  B IOGRAPHIES   Darcie A.
