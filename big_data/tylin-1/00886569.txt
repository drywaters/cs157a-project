Efficient Mining of Categorized Association Rules in Large Databases Shin-Mu Tseng Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering National Cheng Kung University Tainan Taiwan Email tsengsm@mail.ncku.edu.tw Abstract A number of studies have been made on discovering association rules in a large database due to the wide applications The common goal of the studies focused on finding the associated occurrence patterns between all items in a database In practice mining the association rules with the granularity 
as fine as an item could result in a huge number of rules that are too large to utilize efficiently In practical applications the users may be more interested in the associations between the categories the items belong to In this paper, we propose a new method for mining categorized association rules efficiently by using compressed feature vectors With the proposed method at most one scan of the database is needed to produce the categorized association rules in each user query even under different mining parameters Furthermore the calculation time during the mining 
process is also reduced greatly by using only the simple logic operations on feature vectors Hence the overall performance in mining categorized association rules could be improved substantially 1 Introduction Data mining is the process of extracting previously unknown and useful information from a large database It has been extensively applied to a wide variety of applications like sales analysis, healthcare manufacturing etc A number of studies have been made on efficient data mining methods and the relevant applications Among the data mining problems association rules discovery might be the 
most studied ones. This problem was introduced in l Given a set of transactions, where each transaction is a set of items an association rule is an expression X s Y where X and Y are sets of item An example of an association rule is 22325 of transactions that contain beer also contain diapers 5 of all transactions contain both items\224 Here 25 is called the confidence of the 
rule and 5 the support of the rule  1,211 Most existing work on this problem focused on finding the association rules among all items in 21 large database that satisfy user-specified minimum \(confidence and support  1  4 6-71 A number of studies were made to propose efficient methods for mining association rules by reducing either the CPU computation time or the disk access overhead 3-4 71 Some studies considered the usage of\221 sampling techniques for 
reducing the processing overhead  1 1 121 Srikant and Agrawal 9 incorporated into considerations the quantities of the items purchased in discovering association rules Some approaches were proposed for mining generalized association rules 8 101 Sarawagi et al lo considered the integration of association rules mining with SQL in standard databases Srikant and Agrzwal 8 introduced the problem of mining gener-alized association rules as follows Given a set of transactions where each transaction consists of a set of items and a 
taxonomy on the items we find associations between items at any level of the taxonomy For example, given a taxonomy that says that jackets is a outerwear is-a clothes, we may infer a rule that 22350 of people who buy outerwear tend to buy shoes 5 of all transactions contain both these items\224 This reflects the fact that the taxonomies over the items exist in marly real-life applications In this paper we are aimed at another problem related to mining generalized association rules We call the problem as 223mining categorized association 
rules\224 and the scenario in this problem is as follows 0-7803-65~3-6/001$10.00 0 2000 IEEE 3606 1 Although the taxonomy may be used to model the hierarchical relationships of items in an application very well people are often interested in association rules under a simpler taxonomy i.e the one-level category an item belongs to 2 Users are often interested in finding association rules involving only some specified categories rather than all categories in a query Hence constraints on categories will be specified 


3 Users may make continuous queries in which new requirements for parameters like support are set based on the previous query results This is because the number of discovered rules may not be suitable Therefore quick response to users\222 queries is needed With the scenario as described above the existing mining algorithms may not perform well in terms of responding the user\222s query quickly The main reason is that the existing mining algorithms are mostly designed in forms of several passes so that the whole database needs to be read from disks several times for each user\222s query under the constraint that the whole database is too large to fit in memory This is very inefficient in considering the big overhead of reading the large database even though only partial items are interested in fact The worse part is the existing mining algorithms will repeat reading the whole database several passes for a subsequent query even it involves the same specified items as the previous query but changes only the minimum confidence and support A new method is proposed in this paper for mining categorized association rules efficiently. The main features of the method are as follows: For each category a compressed feature vector and a feature record are built to represent the occurrence patterns of the items belonged to this category The feature vector and feature record are built only once while reading the database first time Then the associations between the categories are constructed by using the feature record information and performing simple logical operations on the feature vectors without reading the large database again Hence all the disk access overhead, calculation time for mapping the items to belonged categories and the calculation time for finding the associations between the categ9ries can be reduced substantially The rest of the paper is organized as follows We state the problem formally in Section 2 In Section 3 the proposed method is described in details. A conclusion and the future work is given in Section 5 2. Problem Statement Ih the following we give a formal statement of the problem Let I  il ir   i,,,}be a set of items Let D be a set of transactions, where each transaction Tis a set of items such that T c I Each transaction is associated with a unique identifier, called its TID An association rule is an implication of the form X 3 Y whereXc I Yc I andXn Y 0 The ruleX 3 Y has support s ifs of transactions in D contain Xu Y and it has confidence c if c of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y This is the original definition of an association rule given in 2 For the categorized association rules mining the following information is complemented. Let C   Cl C  C  be a set of categories and M ik ck ikE I and ck E C}be a set of mapping which specifies which category an item belongs to Here we assume that an item belongs to only one category. Besides, let IC c C be the set of categories the users are interested in the query the user wants to submit The set of IC s and c constitutes the mining constraints Given the mining constraints the problem is to find all categorized association rules involving items contained in IC with support and confidence larger than s and c respectively Category sets with satisfied support are called large category sets We call s and c as minsup and minconf respectively The user\222s behavior is modeled as shown in Figure 1  Interested Category Association Rules  Interested CatEgory sm cn Figure 1 The system architecture In the system model initially a user submits a submitting subsequent query since the number of query with some mining constraints After the discovered rules may not be suitable That is the association rules are detected the user might change user may make continuous queries based on some of the mining constraints like IC for previous mining results 3607 


The problem of discovering the association rules for all items can be decomposed into two subproblems  1,2 1 2 Find all sets of items or itemsets that have transaction support above minimum support Use the large itemsets to generate the desired rules It is pointed out that subproblem 2 is quite trivial compared to subproblem 1 Hence most work focus on solving subproblem 1 i.e to find the large itemsets In our problem the focus shifts from itemsets to categories. Similarly we will aim to find large category sets which can be used to generate the association rules between categories easily 3 Proposed Method In this section we describe the proposed method in details. The main idea of the proposed method is to extract the occurring patterns of the interested categories and store them in compressed vectors Once the compressed vectors of the interested categories are built all computations for the concurrent occurrences of the interested categories are made by Boolean AND operation by using the feature vectors without accessing the database again Hence the high disk overhead incurred in other mining algorithms due to multiple parses of the database can be reduced substantially The algorithm of the proposed method is as shown in Figure 2 Central to our method are two databases namely Category Support DB CSDB and Category Feature DB CFDB CFDB records the feature vectors for the interested category while CSDB records the calculated support for each data item When a user submits a query for mining a database with the constrained support s confidence c and interested category IC the proposed method firstly examines if the CSDB exists and builds it if it is absent 1 IF  CSDB is empty Scan the database to build CSDB and determine LI and build CFDB for interested category ELSE Retrieve CSDB and determine L1 and build CFDB for non-existent category 2 k=2 3 Generate candidate large category set ck from I 4 IF ck is not empty Obtain the count for each category in ck by bitwise AND operations on the category\222s feature vectors and get Lk k=k+l go to step 3 5 Answer  union of all Lk  Figure 2 Algorithm for finding large category set 3608 


The process for building the feature vector V for a category C is as follows Basically V is compressed form of a bit vector in which bit is set as 1 if C appears injth transaction of the whole database otherwise it is set as 0 Note that a category is inherently a collection of data items Hence in determining the bit vector jth bit of feature vector V is set as 1 if any data item belonging to C appears in jth transaction of the whole database; otherwise, it is set as 0 In this way the recording of information shifts from the level of data items to that of category To store the feature vector it is physically recorded in disk in segments of 8 bit, i.e one byte However in considering the possibility of sparse occurrences of a data item in a large database the consecutive 0\222s in the feature vector is counted and stored as a count index if the count is larger than 8 since we use 1 byte as a segment\By storing the appearing pattern of each category as a compressed vector separately the size of the database to be accessed can also be reduced greatly This will reduce the memory requirement problem substantially. Hence the disk overhead of scanning the whole database as existed in other mining algorithms can be reduced In producing the large category sets we use an approach similar to Apriori 2 Basically the proposed method executes in multiple passes and in each pass a candidate large category set ck was generated and pruned by using Lk-1 However our method adopts completely different way from Apriori in counting the number of occurrences for each candidate category set ck In each pass our method does not scan the whole database as Apriori does instead only the vectors for the categories contained in ck are accessed for doing bitwise AND operations and the count is obtained easily by counting the number of 1\222s in the AND operated result The candidates generating and counting process goes on until no candidate can be generated any more Finally the large category sets are the union of all Lk and the association rules can be obtained easily by using the specified minimal confidence c as described in Section 2 In the following we give brief comparisons of the proposed method with Apriori-based methods For our problem the merits of the proposed method are 1 Less disk access overhead For Apriori the database has to be read k times if we found large category sets as many as Lk For our method at most one database scan is needed for each user query 2 No repeated database access and computation occurs in our method For two continuous queries from some user with different mining constraints Apriori treats both queries equally and redo the mining tasks for each query Consequently all database access will be done repeatedly even though some of the information has been obtained in previous query By taking this into consideration the proposed method stores both the occurring patterns of the interested category and the mining result such that no repeated database accesses are made This will save considerable execution time 3 Less computation for mapping interested items into interested categories With Apriori-based methods the mapping of interested items into corresponding category was calculated in each pass incurring a big computation overhead. For our method this computation was done only in the first pass since all further computations are done on the built feature vectors Therefore the method we propose can reduce both the disk access time and computation time greatly compared to Apriori-based methods In particular the improvement will be especially obvious under the following conditions i the interested category IC involves only some portion of all categories 2 only the value of support and confidence are changed, and the IC is kept still 3 several queries have been made with different IC In this case most feature vectors of the categories the users may query would be built already hence almost no database access is needed for all subsequent queries 4 Conclusions and Future Work An efficient mining method is proposed for discovering categorized association rules in a large database by using compressed feature vectors With the proposed method at most one scan of the database is needed for producing the categorized association rules in each user query even with different mining parameters Furthermore the calculation time during the mining process is reduced greatly by using only the simple logic operations on feature vectors Hence the performance of the proposed method outperforms other methods greatly in terms of the response time to user\222s queries The proposed method can be applied to various applications like sales analysis 3609 


and health care for decision support A number of interesting problems are left for further investigation First we would apply the proposed method to mining generalized association rules with complete taxonomy Second the quantities of the data items appearing in a category should be taken into consideration since it indicates another meaninghl measure of the association rules Third the performance of the proposed method will be compared with other methods via detailed simulations covering various mining parameters References 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 R Agrawal T Imielinsi and A Swami 223Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items in Very Large Databases,\224 Prof ACM SIGMOD Conf Management of Data pp 207 216,1993 R Agrawal and R Srikant 223Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases,\222\222 Prof 20\221h Int\222l Con Very Large Data Bases pp 478-499,1994 S Brin R Motwani J D Ullman and S Tsur 223Dynamic Itemset Counting and Implication Rules for Market Basket Data,\224 Proc ACM SIGMOD 1997 pp 255-264 J S Park M S Chen and P S Yu 223An Effctive Hash based Algorithm for mining association rules,\224 Prof ACM SIGMOD Conf Management of Data May 1995 M Klementtinen H Mannila P Ronkainen H Toivonen and A I Verkamo 223Finding Interesting Rules from Large Sets of Discovered Association Rules,\224 Proc CIm 1994 H Mannila H Toivonen and A I Verkamo 223Efficient Algorithms for Discovering Association Rules,\224 MI Workshop on fiowledge Discovery in Databases pp 181 192 1994 A Savasere E Omiecinski and S B Navathe 223An Efficient Algorithm  for Mining Association Rules in Large Databases,\224 Prof 2Ith Int 222I Conf Very Large Data Bases 1995 R srikant and R Agrawal 223Mining 9 10 11 12 Generalized Association Rules,\224 Pro 2Ith Int 222I Conf Ery Large Data Bases pp 407-419 1995 R Srikant and R Agrawal 223Mining Quantitative Association Rules in Large Relational Tables,\224 Prof ACM SIGMOD Conf Management of Data pp 1-12 1996 S Sarawagi S 221Thomas and R Agrawal 223Integrating Association Rule Mining with Relational Database Systems: Alternatives and Implications,\224 Prt ACM SIGMOD Conf Management of Da,ta 19981 H Toivonen 223Sampling Lar e Databases for Association Rules,\224 ProJ 22\221 Int\222l Con Very Large Data Bases Bombay India 1996 8 M J Zaki S Parthisarathy W Li and M Ogihara 223Evaluatictn of Sampling for Data Mining of Associati on Rules,\224 Technical Report 6 17 CS Dept U Rochester May 1996 361 0

For example, for an internet based supermarket, it will be more efficient to combine the user registration information and the ordering information with the log data. We plan to study how to integrate more heterogeneous data sources into the current framework The other direction is to develop more generic models to cope with transactions of other application data such as bank transactions and DNA sequence data in biochemical areas Reference   A g ra w a l A  Gu pta, an d S.

old as in Section 6.2 and increasing confidence thresholds For example, the WWW database was mined with confi dence thresholds of 0.06 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 and 0.9 using a 0.06 support threshold in all cases The results of the application of this preprocessing tech nique on the association rules outputted by these ten min ing processes of the WWW database are summarized in the upper left hand histogram of Figure 2 Each gray bar indi cates the number of rules mined using a specific confidence threshold For example, the first leftmost gray bar in the WWW histogram depicts the 9,206 association rules that were mined with 0.06 confidence level The black bar su perimposed on it indicates the number of rules deleted as a result of the application of this preprocessing technique on the respective list of rules, 3,793 in this case That is over 41 of the rules mined by from the WWW database us ing 0.06 support and confidence thresholds were deleted by Interestingness Preprocessing technique 1. This deletion is very significant considering that no information of any sort was required to perform it. This Interestingness Preprocess ing technique performed even better on the output of mining the WWW database using increasingly higher confidence levels deleting as much as 65 of the rules mined with 0.9 confidence levels, as indicated by the rightmost bar in the WWW database histogram out of the 1,503 rules mined the rightmost gray bar\977 rules \(the superimposed black bar\rules were deleted The other five histograms in Fig ure 2 summarize the results of applying the first Interesting ness PreProcessing technique to the other five databases The average deletion brought about by the application of the first Interestingness PreProcessing technique are 49.3 f 7.9 for the WWW database, 55.2 f 9.8% for the Mushroom database 69.4 If 18.0 for the Nursery database 57.7 f 7.3% for the Chess database, 72.6 f 8.6 for the Adult database and 3.7 f 1.5 for the Gro cery database These results are extremely encouraging a significant number in most cases an average of over half the rules outputted by the mining algorithm are deleted by the application of this preprocessing technique This is a significant result not only because of the large number of rules that is deleted but also because this deletion requires no information of any kind from a user of the KDD process 6.3.2 The results of the application of the Interestingness PrePro cessing 2 technique \(Section 5.2 to the six databases were more modest than those of the application of the first tech nique Even these modest results are very significant a re duction even of a small percentage of the rules is both ef fective and important when these results are achieved au tomatically without any interaction with any users The average elimination brought about by the second prepro Results Interestingness Preprocessing Tech 2 Figure 3 Results of the application of Inter estingness Preprocessing 2 technique cessing technique was as follows 3.3 f 3.4 for the WWW database 17.4 f 5 for the Mushroom database 2.5 f 2.7 for the Nursery database 3.1 f 1.8 for the Chess database 1 f 1.9% for the Adult database We present the detailed results in a graphical representation in Figure 3 for the first two databases 6.3.3 Results Sequential Application of Interesting ness Preprocessing Techniques As depicted in Figure 1, the Interestingness PreProcessing techniques can and should be applied sequentially We pro ceeded to do so applying the two preprocessing techniques we introduced in this paper sequentially The results of this sequential application are depicted in Figure 4 7 Conclusions and Future Work In this work we defined an Interestingness Preprocessing Step, as part of the interestingness analysis framework, that eliminates association rules that can be determined to be not interesting in a user-, domain-, and task-independent man ner The generic nature of the preprocessing differentiates it from the interestingness processing that do impose a bias on the type of rules outputted as interesting In this work we also introduced the first Interestingness PreProcessing techniques The deletion of un-interesting rules by these techniques is very significant since it is achieved without requiring a user to provide any informa tion Our empirical results indicate that these are powerful techniques in most cases more than half the rules were eliminated by their application It is important to note that any filtering power however weak of any preprocessing technique is significant since all the Preprocessing methods are deployed sequentially immediately following the min ing process on any set of mined rules and these results add up We hope that this work will encourage the development of more preprocessing techniques by the KDD community 495

 9 For instance, while in the “ISS Rendezvous Mode”, the function of actuating docking mechanisms might be disabled, and the firing of RCS thruster enabled. However in the “ISS Dock Mode”, the firing of RCS thrusters is inhibited, while docking actuation is available. On the left side of Figure 8 are the mode s from which entrance to the state is allowed.  Note that si nce there is more than one state from which you can enter the ISS Operations State”, the entrance modes called out may not all be in the same state Similarly, the exit modes on the right hand side of the diagram lead to modes in different states The spacecraft states and tran sition activities were then modeled as operational flows in CORE as shown in Figure 9 \(next page\e operational activities and their logical sequence are consistent with the Spacecraft State Transition Diagram shown above in Figure 7.  The operational model also identified the operational elements, which are tied to the physical hardware elements of the system that perform the operational activities Figure 8 Spacecraft Operational Modes  ISS Rendezvous Mode ISS Proximity Operations Mode ISS Dock Mode State Entrance State Exit S/C ISS Operations State From: Orbit Maneuver Mode To: Orbit Maneuver Mode From: ISS Checkout Mode To: ISS Checkout Mode ISS Undock Mode ISS Safe Haven Mode ISS Emergency Departure Mode From: S/C Powered Up Mode To: S/C Powered Up Mode 


 10 Figure 9 Spacecraft Operational Flow Functional Models After addressing the operational activities that the OSP system needed to perform, the functional models of the OSP system were developed consistent with the system engineering process discussed above.  The first step was to identify the physical hardware elements of the OSP system as prescribed by NASA.  The physical hardware elements of the OSP system were captured in CORE through component decomposition and represented as the product breakdown structure shown in Figure 10  Figure 10 Product Breakdown Structure of OSP System The OSP system functional models were developed by identifying the system functions based on the mission goals and operations that the system needed to perform.  These functions were then allocated to the prescribed physical hardware elements of the sy stem. As requirements and the system architecture evolved, the system functionality was re-allocated to different physi cal hardware elements.  In addition, the functional models also captured the physical interfaces between the OSP system, both internally and externally Interface Definition The CORE database also modeled and captured the interface complexity th at existed for the OSP system.  In the database a functional interface was represented as a collection of links that existed between physical hardware elements and an operational interface was represented as a collection of need-lines that existed between operational elements.  The links/need-lines were further defined by either  performance indices or constraints Internal and external functi onal interfaces were modeled within the CORE database by looking at different layers of the system physical hierarchy For example the interfaces between the OSP system and external systems were modeled as shown below in Figure 11, which depicts the interfaces that exist between the ISS Mating Adapter and ISS.  Internal functional inte rfaces were also modeled by looking at the interfaces that ex ist within the OSP System's physical product breakdown structure.

Therefore the OSP system had to meet the mission objectives using only existing technologies.  These existing technologies were introduced into the CORE modeling database as requirement constraints on the OSP system Requirements Management Requirements management was performed within the CORE database to track and perform requirements flowdown as well as tie the requirements together with the operational models, functional models, and technologies Requirements told either how well the system needed to perform, set constraints on the system, or defined the interfaces.  In the CORE database, all requirements appeared as either performance indices or constraints The customer objectives were introduced into the CORE database as originating requirements.  These originating requirements included mission requirements, design requirements, environmental conditions, guidelines, and standards.  Originating requi rements were then traced to OSP System Level requirements.  The OSP System Level requirements defined the performance indices and constraints at the system leve l.  These performance indices and constraints were then flowed down and decomposed into lower level performance i ndices and constraints at the segment level, element level, and component level.  This supported the development of the system and segment performance specifications and requirements traceability matrix All of the requirements captured in CORE were directly tied to either the operational model, functional model, or technologies.  If the requirement was a performance requirement, it was tied to either the operational or functional model through a performance index.  The performance index indicated how well the function or operation needed to be accomplished. The function or operation in turn was tied back to the hardware elements of the OSP system.  For example, the requirement for two days of contingency operations by the spacecraft while not mated to ISS was represented as a performance index exhibited by the “Spacecraft On-O rbit Operations” activity previously shown in Figure 9. The “Sp acecraft On-Orbit Operations activity was in turn performed by the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement set a constraint on the system, it was depicted as a constraint on either an operational element or hardware element in CORE.  For example, the requirement that the spacecraft shall have an operational service life of thirty years was captured in CORE as a constraint on the Spacecraft hardware element. If the requirement defined an interface, it appeared as either a performance index or constraint on a link.  For example, the requirement that the mechani cal interface between the ISS Mating Adapter and Spacecraft shall be the Low Impact Docking System \(LIDS constraint that was placed on 


 12 the “Mating Adapter to Sp acecraft Docking/Attachment Mechanism\(s\k previously identified in Figure 12 One of the challenges for the requirements management process was capturing the manmachine interfaces.  This specific challenge was to develop and implement a methodology that allowed operational requirements to drive the physical hardware design.  In CORE, this was accomplished by allowing performance indices tied to the operational model to decompose into performance indices related to the operational model as well as the functional model 6  C ONCLUSION  A robust systems engineering process is required for a large scale program with many interfaces.  The processes and implementation presented in this paper are ideal when faced with a rapidly changing requirements environment and dynamic interfaces.   Traditional acquisition of systems revolves around a rigid set of design-to requirements.   As recent history has shown, opera tionally based acquisition is on the rise.  This means that requirements are more likely to be in flux further into the program The C4ISR methodology and implementation presented in this paper provide a robust system engineering process for a large scale program with many interfaces.  In particular, the dynamic interfaces and the integration of human interfaces were handled through the development of segment states and modes.  The state transitions were driven by system operations.  This operations based systems engineering is necessary to understand large, complex systems The process was implemented using the CORE systems engineering tool.  A flexible tool such as CORE was required to build the custom schema required for this unique program.  The capability to rigorously define the dynamic interfaces as well as decompose those interfaces was required to capture the dynamics of operationally driven systems.  Functional and physical models responded to these operations. This implementation in CORE allowed for a “Systems of Systems” view to be modeled within the same database as requirements management The demise of the OSP and precursor programs cut short the full implementation of this process.  Given time, states modes, and then operational and functional models would have been built for all segments of the system.  In addition the end to end traceability from operational requirements to component design requirements would have provided a robust platform for system verification While human spaceflight is a unique problem, the issue of systems of systems” integration is present in many fields When this is coupled with human integration, the need for an operations approach is multiplied.  Determining how to operate a system after it is functionally and physically designed results in delays and cost escalation.  An approach that takes into account human interaction and operations at the outset is more likely to re sult in a system that succeeds throughout the program lifecycle 7  R EFERENCES    DoD Archi t ect ure Fram ework W o rki ng Group DoD Architecture Framework Version 1.0” August 30, 2003 8  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The primary development effort of the C4ISR CORE methodology as implemented on the OSP program was completed by Michael Wood, Orbital Sciences Corporation and Marge Dyer, Vitech Corporation 9  B IOGRAPHY  Staci N.

4 Data mining 4.1 Association rule mining Data mining which is a recent hot research topic in the database field is a method of discovering useful information such as rules and previously unknown patterns existing behind data items It enables more effective utilization of transaction log data which have been just archived and abandoned Among the major applications of data mining is association rule mining so called 217\217basket analysis.\220\220 Each of the transaction data typically consists of a set of items bought in a transaction By analyzing them one can derive some association rule such as 217\21790 of the customers who buy both A and B also buy C.\220\220 In order to improve the quality of obtained rules a very large amount of transaction data have to be examined requiring quite a long time to complete First we introduce some basic concepts of association rule Let 000 000 001 000 1 001\000 2 001\002\002\002\001\000 000 002 be a set of items and 003 000 001 003 1 001\003 2 001\002\002\002\001\003 001 002 be a set of transactions where each transaction 003 002 is a set of items such that 003 002 004\000  n itemset 004 has support 005 in the transaction set 003 if 005  f transactions in 003 contain 004  here we denote 005 000 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 An association rule is an implication of the form 004 005 n  where 004\001 n 004 000  and 004 006 n 000 007  Each rule has two measures of value support and confidence  The support of the rule 004 005 n is 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002  The confidence 013 of the rule 004 005 n in the transaction set 003 means 013 of transactions in 003 that contain 004 also contain n  which can be written as 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 b n 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002  For example let r 1 000 001 1 001 3 001 4 002  r 2 000 001 1 001 2 001 3 001 5 002  r 3 000 001 2 001 4 002  r 4 000 001 1 001 2 002  r 5 000 001 1 001 3 001 5 002 be the transaction database Let minimum  support and minimum confidence be 60 and 70 respectively First all itemsets that have support above the minimum support called large itemsets  are generated In this case the large itemsets are 001 1 002 001 001 2 002 001 001 3 002 001 001 1 001 3 002  Then for each large itemset 004  n association rule 004 t n 005 n 001 n 004 004 002 is derived if 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 002 f\005\006\007\007\b\t 003 001 004 t n 002 n minimum confidence  The results are 1 005 3 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 75 002 and 3 005 1 001 005\006\007\007\b\t 003 000 60 001 013\b\016\017 000\020\021\016\013\021 000 100 002  The most well known algorithm for association rule mining is the Apriori algorithm[1 We have studied several parallel algorithms for mining association based on Apriori One of these algorithms called HPA Hash Partitioned Apriori is discussed here Apriori first generates candidate itemsets and then scans the transaction database to determine whether each of the candidates satisfies the user specified minimum support and minimum confidence Using these results the next candidate itemsets are generated This continues until no itemset satisfies the minimum support and confidence The most naive parallelization of Apriori would copy the candidates over all the processing node and make each processing node scan the transaction database in parallel Although this works fine when the number of candidates is small enough to fit in the local memory of a single processing node memory space utilization efficiency of this method is very poor For large scale data mining the storage required for the candidates exceeds the available memory space of a processing node This causes memory overflow which results in significant performance degradation due to an excessive amount of extra I/Os HPA partitions the candidate itemsets among the processing nodes using a hash function as in the parallel hash join which eliminates broadcasting of all the transaction data and can reduce the comparison workload significantly Hence HPA works much better than the naive parallelization for large scale data mining The 022 th iteration pass 022  f the algorithm is as follows 1 Generate the candidate itemsets Each processing node generates new candidate itemsets from the large itemsets of the last  001 022 t 1 002 th iteration Each of the former itemsets contains 022 items while each of the latter itemsets contains 001 022 t 1 002 items They are called 022 itemsets and 001 022 t 1 002 itemsets respectively The processing node applies the hash function to each of the candidates to determine the destination node ID If the candidate is for the processing node itself it is inserted into the hash table otherwise it is discarded 13 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
