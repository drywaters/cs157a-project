6.26 IT Support for new Business Processes connected with the Liberalisation of the Energy Market in Germany L Kirchner Siemens Germany N Vierheilig W. Zimmermann Fran-ken Data STW Wurzburg Germany Germany SUMMARY Germany has an unique approach for the deregulation of the energy market There is no regulation authority in place With the new 221Hssociations\222 Agreement on Criteria to Determine Use of System Char es for Electric Energy\224, signed on December 13 1999 the rules for the liberalized electricity market in Germany 
were completely re-defined. This document replaced the existing transaction model defined in the first version of the Associations\222 Agreement by a point of connection model. This new model specifies that electricity customers have to buy the network access to be able to buy electricity on the free market The new rules give a central role to distribution network operators The new business processes coming with this market model are described in this paper and IT solutions to solve the new tasks are shown The Implementation at the Stadtwerke Wurzburg AG is an example how to implementate an Energy Balance 
Management NEW RULES ARE DEFINED The new Associations\221 Agreement AA defines simplified methods to assign the costs for network use and the settlement of imbalances to the different market players Network customers have the right to build so-called balancing groups 223Balancing groups are virtual entities within which the difference between the feed-in and extraction is offset vis-a-vis the respective transmission company TransCo l Differences between feed-in and extraction are compensated by the TransCo The TransCo as operator of the control area charges the balancing group manager for these differences To avoid 
investment in expensive load profile meters for small customers standard load profiles were developed A special role was assigned to the distribution network operator NetCo He owns and operates the measuring devices at the customer sides Therefore he is obliged to collect the meter data and provide it to the different energy supply companies \(EsCo which are active in his network area Additionally he has to supply the TransCo and the balancing group managers with aggregated load profiles for determination and billing of the network imbalances 3 Due to the high amount of data the NetCo can 
fulfil the new tasks only with the support of computerized tools He has to manage the new business processes from the beginning in an efficient way The NetCo needs support by IT tools for the following key business processes o Manage the contract data network access contracts network use contracts electricity supply contracts and keep the relation meter 222 customer-supplier updated 0 Manage a high amount of load profile data o Calculation and aggregation of synthetic 
or analytic load profiles based on the standard load profiles o Distribute aggregated load profile data to the different market participants 0 Determination of the fees for network use for all customers 0 Calculation of yearly consumption\221 differences after the yearly measurement for not telemetered customers o Consider the new renewable energy law and other legal aspects FEES FOR NETWORK USE The AA defines the contractual relations between the market participants Fig 1 
The electricity customer needs three contracts o The network access contract defines the technical conditions for the access to the network o With the network use contract the customer buys the right to extract electricity at his connection point o The electricity supply contract defines the prices and conditions for delivery of electricity by the EsCo Today with the vertical integrated structure of the utilities and the very small customer change rate most electricity customers still have their old single electricity supply contract with the EsCo who is at 
the same time the NetCo If a separate EsCo gets the electricity supply contract from the customer he will sign the first two contracts in the name of the customer with the NetCo Therefore he asks for a mandate. In both cases the EsCo bills the customer for the whole price of electricity delivery  energy and network use The TransCo charges the NetCo for network access and network use CIRED2001, 18-21 June 2001, Conference Publication No 482 0 IEE 2001

This includes 0 Network infrastructure for all voltage levels used by the customer 0 System services like network operation load frequency control or\222voltage regulation D Consumption of reactive power up to defined limit o Network losses o Metering devices and reading 0 Concession fee to the municipalities D Costs for the handling according to the new renewable energy law LOAD PROFILE PROCESSING In the context of metering and aggregating of small customers\222 values AA provides simplified methods with model load profiles in order to make it unnecessary to install expensive and costly load profile metering systems Small customers load behavior can be described by model load profiles 2 Generally this model load profiles depend on the type of customer i.e households small commercials or farmers the season i.e summer winter transition period and day types i.e working days Saturdays Sundays The load profiles are normalized to a yearly consumption of 1000 kWh Dynamic functions can adapt model profiles to different parameters like temperatures etc. The NetCo can choose between two different methods of load profile processing  In order to proceed according to the synthetic load profile processing the NetCo assigns a model profile to each small customer Since the model profiles are normalized to a yearly consumption of 1000 kWh each profile is scaled with the customers\222 forecasted yearly consumption In the next step the NetCo collects the profiles of all customers having a contractual relationship to a supplier or trader and aggregates the profiles He hands over these profiles to the suppliershraders They use them to organize their energy supply In contrast to synthetic load profile processing analyfic load profile processing starts from the total demand in NetCo\222s network He subtracts all load profiles metered and the network losses to get a so-called rest curve This rest curve represents the load behavior of small customers NetCo split this rest curve in parts for each supplier by multiplying the rest curve with participation factors There are two different ways to get these participation factors Following the simple analylic load profile processing the NetCo sums up the forecasted yearly consumption of all customers assigned to a supplier Thus the participation factor for a supplier is given by the ratio between this aggregated yearly consumption and the sum of yearly consumption of all customers This ratio remains unchanged until supplier\222s composition of customers changes Each supplier gets an analytic load profile, which shape is like the shape of the rest curve 


6.26 The simple analytic load profile processing does not consider suppliers\222 composition of his customer group To overcome this shortcoming NetCo can proceed according to the extended analytic load profile processing In a first step NetCo calculates a complete synthetic load profile The participation factors for a supplier and a customer type are given by the ratio between the synthetic load profile of the customer type and the complete synthetic load profile Thus the supplier\222s participation factors are functions of the time and can change although supplier\222s composition of customer types remains the same Because of that the shape of supplier\222s analytic profile can differ from the shape of the rest curve Both methods of load profile processing base on small customers\222 forecasted yearly consumption After reading of all small customers\222 meters NetCo can determine the differences between the yearly consumption of all suppliers The differences have to be settled between NetCo and suppliers IT SOLUTION FOR THE NETCO  The necessary tool to solve the 221business processes of the NetCo as mentioned above is the Energy Balance Management EBM It is based on Oracle and Java Therefore it is platform independent and scaleable to the needs of all sizes of NetCo\222s The data base contains time series values like load profiles as well as source data and contract data This system EsCo Balancing Groups concept fulfils the requirements on such a solution like Performance 0 0 Scalability and flexibility Availability A special challenge in the implementation of an EBM is the integration into an existing IT landscape of a NetCo. Therefore interfaces are necessary to automated meter reading systems of different vendors to billing systems and customer care solutions CCS EBM imports most of the source data e.g customer data via these interfaces Handling of high amount of data With the new Distribution Code published in October 2000 a first set of standards is defined for protocols to be used for the communication to the market participants 222 This introduces EDIFACT as general frame for the communication architecture Web based solutions are also available They allows EsCo\222s and customers to collect their data themselves Depending on contract data access rights to the appropriate data are set automatically Prior to the implementation of EBM it has to be clarified to which extend the solution should be integrated and automated The praxis shows that many legacy systems are not able to provide the necessary interfaces and data So as starting solution EBM is able to work independently. Only load profiles have to be made available via an interface \(may be manual operated TransCo Network Customer Figure 2 


6.26 It is possible to implement EBM stepwise in a NetCo In a first step only the customers supplied by external EsCo\222s are managed with the system When interfaces become available with the introduction of new systems all customer data can be loaded The migration effort for this step is minimal because EBM is already prepared for the integrated solution SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AT A MUNICIPAL UTILITY Stadtwerke Wuerzburg AG is a municipal utility for a town with 120.000 inhabitants and supplies electricity gas water and district heating. In two own power stations  a stone coal and gas fired district heating power station and a waste power station  60  of the electricity consumption is generated Stadtwerke Wuerzburg AG decided in May 2000 to buy an EBM to fulfil the requirements of the new AA As the system implementation of an EBM affects many departments in a utility the following departments of the company were involved in the planning and the implementation of the project network operation \(VNB 0 0 0 sales household customers 0 commercial  billing department 0 legal department 0 IT department 0 power economics department district heating power station HKW sales industrial  commercial customers At the start of the project some organizational and technical conditions of the project had to be defined The organizational issues are clearly influencing human resource topics A detailed clarification of these points is necessary before the project start so that every department knows his duties and his rights Under the organizational conditions the following points have to be mentioned 0 business processes and distribution of tasks between the involved departments especially VNB HKW Sales and also the new balancing group 0 definition of the project team and of inter department working groups 0 decide about the incorporation of the responsible for the network fee in the company organization 0 time schedule 0 responsibilities In the next step the departments have to describe together the technical conditions for the project Important for the decision on implementing a specific software product are the following topics functionality system concept 0 investigation of the network use fees 0 decision about synthetic or analytic load profile processing 0 define which customers have to be equipped with load profile meters 0 handling of metering data \(raw data Exchange of meter data is a very essential point for the operation of an EBM Therefore a decision about the used meter data format is necessary The preferred solution should be the use of the format defined in the Metering Code This format has four parts 0 country code 2 characters 0 postal code 5 characters 0 20 characters as internal identifier of the unique identifier of the network operator 6 characters NetCo While the first three bullets are clearly defined for every customer it is the task of the NetCo to define an identifier for the fourth bullet so that the Metering Code gets a unequivocal key. Different possibilities are available continuous number combination of geographic data meter number customer-number, etc In all cases it has to be assured that the key\222s identity is not only temporary and that this numbering system also fits to the needs of the future In some cases it may be necessary to adapt the automatic meter reading system in order to implement the new meter data format As described above the integration of the EBM into the IT landscape of the company has a very important role in such a project For Stadtwerke Wuerzburg AG there were some points of special importance 0 standard interfaces of the used software package Import  Export 0 support of the different types of communication Online Offline protocols EDIFACT e-mail FTP data formats Format, EXCEL ASCII 0 quality reliability, technology 0 data consistency within all involved systems MSCONS, DELFOR UTILMD XML DVG The goal is to integrated EBM with a degree as high as possible into the IT landscape of the company Reasons for this are 0 most of the data needed in EBM is already available in existing systems  avoid multiple data entry and data maintenance 


6.26 the network operation department has no own billing system  the calculation of network use fees can be done in EBM and the prepared billing data are send to the billing department known data base structure  In the past Stadtwerke Wuerzburg AG gained good experience with the FrankenDataWareHouse and knowledge in the data model which help a lot to do a better and faster integration of EBM EBM is based on Oracle and Java and therefore can be handled easily 0 using standard software  It doesn\222t make much sense to start with a complete integrated system from the beginning Implementing the EBM stepwise gives advantages in getting the system running fast It is possible to start with a basic system only for the customers of external EsCo\222s and by using manual interfaces This way of implementation gives the chance to gain experience and knowledge in the handling of the system With this approach it is possible to define the common data interfaces between the involved systems with the feedback from the praxis The result of the described project implementation can be summed up as follows 0 it is necessary to define a clear separation in organization and staff for the tasks concerned with the project 0 installation of a large data base system is necessary 0 the interfaces of the EBM for import and export of data are very important 0 the most important experience  the problems appears in the details CONCLUSION The concept of balancing groups and load profile processing is clear and straightforward However the NetCo needs a computer based energy balance management system EBM to handle the great amount of data up to several hundreds of Gigabyte and to distribute results to the relevant market participants. Special software techniques are necessary to get a flexible scalable and performant solution The example of a EBM implementation gives an idea about the difficulties and challenges a utility is faced with during the project EBM is an inter department application and has to be handled as such from the beginning This require also appropriate management support within the utility REFERENCES l Verein Deutscher Elektrizitatswerke VDEW 223Associations\222 Agreement on Criteria to Determine Use of System Charges for Electric Energy\224 VDEW-Publication M-22/2000 13.1 2.1 999  Meier H Funfgeld C Adam T Schiefer decker B 224Reprasentative VDEW-Last-profile\224 VDEW-Publication M-28/99, 1999 \(German 3 Vierheilig N Werner T.G Wirth W 223Energiebilanzmanagement  Effizientes Werk zeug zur Umsetzung der VV2 fur den Verteil netzbetreiber\224 Energy Balance Management  An Efficient Tool to 221get the Associations\222 Agreement Work for Distribution Network Operators Elektrizitatswirtschaft 20/2000 page 34-40 \(German AUTHOR\222S ADDRESSES Lothar Kirchner Siemens AG PTD EM IT, Humboldtstr.\22259 D-90459 Nuremberg, Germany Tel.: +49 91 1 433 7882, Fax 49 91 1 433 7932 E-mail lothar kirchnerQev.siemens.de Norbert Vierheilig FrankenData GmbH  Co KG Am Weichselgarten 13 91058 Erlangen Germany Tel.: +49 91 31 7704 MS Fax 49 91 31 7704 44 E-mail: norbert.vierheilia @frankendata.de Wolfgang Zimmermann Stadtwerke Wurzburg AG Bahnhofstr 12-1 8 D-97070 Wurzburg, Germany Tel.: +49 931 36 1392 E-mail W.Zimmermann G3wvv.de

tigated how data skewness affects parallel ef“ciency Figure 8 shows that the effect of data skewness are worse for the pure distributed implementations Although data skewness increases as we reduce the minimum support parallel ef“ciency increases for lower minimum support values since the asynchronous phase becomes more relevant  0  50  100  150  200  250  300  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16   Execution time \(secs  Number of processors  WPortal - 0.01   Data Distribution \(Distributed   Candidate Distribution \(Distributed    Data Distribution \(Hierarchical    Candidate Distribution \(Hierarchical               0  50  100  150  200  250  300  350  400  450  500  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16   Execution time \(secs  Number of processors  WPortal - 0.005   Data Distribution \(Distributed   Candidate Distribution \(Distributed    Data Distribution \(Hierarchical    Candidate Distribution \(Hierarchical              Figure 5 Total Execution Times as a function of number of processors SMP cluster The other series of experiments employed the two clusters but to make equal the computational power of both clusters we used only 4 dual nodes of the rst cluster Our objective is to evaluate our algorithms in terms of execution times and speedup We varied the number of processors and the minimum support value and in each parallel con“guration employed each cluster used the same number of processors i.e 2 processors mean that cluster 1 and cluster 2 used 1 processor Figure 9 shows the execution times obtained For    0.01 we observed a speedup number of 11/16 while for    0.005 the speedup number reached almost 14/16 These numbers shows that combining both Data and Distribution approaches in the inter-cluster parallel environment can be an ef“cient approach since it reduces communication among the clusters and reduces data skewness since there are only two logical partitions  1000  10000  100000  1e+06  1e+07  1e+08  1e+09  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16   Communication \(bytes  Number of processors  WPortal - 0.01   Data Distribution \(Distributed   Candidate Distribution \(Distributed    Data Distribution \(Hierarchical    Candidate Distribution \(Hierarchical          Figure 6 Communication as a function of number of processors  0  0.05  0.1  0.15  0.2  0.25  0.3  2  4  6  8  10  12  14  16   Data Skewness  Number of processors  WPortal - Data Distribution   Distributed \(0.01   Hierarchical \(0.01    Distributed \(0.005    Hierarchical \(0.005            Figure 7 Data Skewness as a function of number of processors 5 Related Work Several algorithms for mining frequent itemsets were proposed in the literature 2 12 11 A PRIORI 2 w as the rst ef“cient algorithm and it forms the core of almost all current algorithms During the rst pass over  the support of each item is counted The frequent items are used to generated candidate 2-itemsets  is scanned again to obtain the support of all candidate 2-itemsets and the frequent ones are selected to generate candidate 3-itemsets This iterative process is repeated for   3,4 until there are no more frequent  itemsets to be found Clearly A PRI ORI needs  passes over   incurring in high I/O overhead In the parallel case A PRIORI based algorithms do a reduction operation at the end of each pass thus incurring also in high synchronization cost Three different parallel implementations of the A PRIORI algorithm on IBMSP2 a distributed-memory machine were presented in 1 In 10 t he aut hors s h o w ed t h e i mpact i n s ynchroni zat i o n Proceedings of the 15th Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing \(SBAC-PAD03 0-7695-2046-4/03 $17.00 © 2003 IEEE

It can also be added to cell CrossSales.3\(PC, printer one_year,\205 5  Distributed and Incremental Rule Mining There exist two ways to deal with association rules 267  Static that is, to extract a group of rules from a snapshot, or a history, of data and use "as is 267  Dynamic that is, to evolve rules from time to time using newly available data We mine association rules from an e-commerce data warehouse holding transaction data. The data flows in continuously and is processed daily Mining association rules dynamically has the following benefits 267  223Real-time\224 data mining, that is, the rules are drawn from the latest transactions for reflecting the current commercial trends 267  Multilevel knowledge abstraction, which requires summarizing multiple partial results. For example association rules on the month or year basis cannot be concluded from daily mining results. In fact multilevel mining is incremental in nature 267  For scalability, incremental and distributed mining has become a practical choice Figure 3: Distributed rule mining Incremental association rule mining requires combining partial results. It is easy to see that the confidence and support of multiple rules may not be combined directly. This is why we treat them as \223views\224 and only maintain the association cube, the population cube and the base cube that can be updated from each new copy of volume cube. Below, we discuss several cases to show how a GDOS can mine association rules by incorporating the partial results computed at LDOSs 267  The first case is to sum up volume-cubes generated at multiple LDOSs. Let C v,i be the volume-cube generated at LDOS i The volume-cube generated at the GDOS by combining the volume-cubes fed from these LDOSs is 345   n i i v v C C 1  The association rules are then generated at the GDOS from the centralized C v  214  The second case is to mine local rules with distinct bases at participating LDOSs, resulting in a local association cube C a,I a local population cube C p,I  and a local base cube C b,i at each LDOS. At the GDOS, multiple association cubes, population cubes and base cubes sent from the LDOSs are simply combined, resulting in a summarized association cube and a summarized population cube, as 345   n i i a a C C 1   345   n i i p p C C 1  and 345   n i i b b C C 1  The corresponding confidence cube and support cube can then be derived as described earlier. Cross-sale association rules generated from distinct customers belong to this case In general, it is inappropriate to directly combine association cubes that cover areas a 1 205, a k to cover a larger area a In the given example, this is because association cubes record counts of customers that satisfy   customer product merchant time area Doe TV Dept Store 98Q1 California Doe VCR Dept Store 98Q1 California customer product merchant time area Doe VCR Sears 5-Feb-98 San Francisco Joe PC OfficeMax 7-Feb-98 San Francisco customer product merchant time area Doe TV Fry's 3-Jan-98 San Jose Smith Radio Kmart 14-Jan-98 San Jose Association   population      base          confidence      support cube               cube                cube         cube                cube LDOS LDOS GDOS 


the association condition, and the sets of customers contained in a 1 205, a k are not mutually disjoint. This can be seen in the following examples 214  A customer who bought A and B in both San Jose and San Francisco which are covered by different LDOSs , contributes a count to the rule covering each city, but has only one count, not two, for the rule A  336  B covering California 214  A customer \(e.g. Doe in Figure 3\who bought a TV in San Jose, but a VCR in San Francisco, is not countable for the cross-sale association rule TV  336 VCR covering any of these cities, but countable for the rule covering California. This is illustrated in Figure 3 6  Conclusions In order to scale-up association rule mining in ecommerce, we have developed a distributed and cooperative data-warehouse/OLAP infrastructure. This infrastructure allows us to generate association rules with enhanced expressive power, by combining information of discrete commercial activities from different geographic areas, different merchants and over different time periods. In this paper we have introduced scoped association rules  association rules with conjoint items and functional association rules as useful extensions to association rules The proposed infrastructure has been designed and prototyped at HP Labs to support business intelligence applications in e-commerce. Our preliminary results validate the scalability and maintainability of this infrastructure, and the power of the enhanced multilevel and multidimensional association rules. In this paper we did not discuss privacy control in customer profiling However, we did address this issue in our design by incorporating support for the P3P protocol [1 i n  ou r data warehouse. We plan to integrate this framework with a commercial e-commerce system References 1  Sameet Agarwal, Rakesh Agrawal, Prasad Deshpande Ashish Gupta, Jeffrey F.
