Ab s t r a ct  We have applied rule induction to a publicly available adenocarcinoma gene expression data set. The typical approach to the analysis of gene expression data is to cluster the genes. However, interpreting the resulting clusters may be difficult. With rules, the interpretation is more obvious \(e.g., \(CDKN3 > 253  tumor-stage = 3\\. Our rule induction tool is a new semi-autonomous discovery system we are developing called HAMB, and we used it to learn rules for survival status, survival time, and tumor stage. When we searched the world-wide web for publications relating our top 53 
genes from our discovered rules to lung cancer, we found that 9 of them are known to be associated with lung cancer, 19 of them are known to be associated with other types of cancer, and the remaining 25 were not known to be associated with cancer. Our results suggest that the latter two groups of genes should be examined more closely for their association with lung cancer 1 Introduction The usual approach to data mining gene expression data is to use a clustering technique. However, the interpretation of the resulting clusters may be difficult We have found rule induction to be very useful and that 
the interpretation of the induced rules to be much simpler than with clusters \(e.g., \(CDKN3 > 253  tumor-stage 3\ The induced rules may be examined individually to extract çnuggetsé of information, or used in groups to predict membership in some class or to predict the values of a çtargeté attribute, such as the identification of highrisk patients, or predicting tumor stage. Some researchers may not believe rule induction to be very suitable for 
gene expression analysis because rule induction traditionally requires the user to completely set up the problem for the rule induction program: creating target classes, selecting a feature set of attributes from which the rules will be generated, and selecting parameters for the induction program. Moreover, manually analyzing the hundreds of rules which are typically output by rule induction programs may be overwhelming. We use a new program, HAMB h ic h  is  a s upe r v is o r  pr o g r am to  a rule induction program called RL H A M B h a s m a n y  
features which make it desirable for analyzing gene expression data: \(1\the user may specify multiple targeté attributes for which rules sets will be induced 2\AMB automatically selects the feature set and parameters for each of the target attributes using search and heuristics, and \(3\AMB does some post-processing of the induced rules, such as pruning and grouping similar rules 2 Methods Our gene expression data was generated and first examined by Beer et al.

expression data for 7,129 genes for 86 lung tumor and 10 normal lung samples. The patient data contains information on tumor stage \(stage 1 or stage 3\, tumor size, survival time \(months\, survival status, tumor histological type, tumor differentiation, p53 nuclear accumulation, K-ras mutation, and patient demographics age, sex and the number of years the patient smoked cigarettes We preprocessed the data by removing genes having more than 20% missing values, filtering genes with little 
change in expression, and genes were removed if their maximum values were 1,000 more than their minimum value and the ratios between standard deviation to average and the ratios between maximum value to minimum value were less than 10. After this filtering 485 genes remained Proceedings of the Computational Systems Bioinformatics \(CSBê03 0-7695-2000-6/03 $17.00 © 2003 IEEE 


For the findings presented in this paper, we instructed HAMB to find rules for many of the attributes describing the tumors, such as tumor stage, differentiation mucousity, and for the attributes describing the survival of the patients and survival time. HAMB automatically used RL to generate rule sets predicting the values of these attributes, automatically selecting the training sets features sets, and parameter settings needed by HAMB After running RL to predict each of these attributes HAMB analyzed the rules before presenting them to the user, performing pruning to eliminate redundant rules and grouping the rules to facilitate their understanding 3 Results and Conclusion To verify our findings, we searched the World Wide Web to identify which of our HAMBês findings might be novel. The web sites we searched were www.google.com  cc.ucsf.edu/people/waldman/GENES/c_genes.html  caroll.vjf.cnrs.fr/cancergene/RETRI1.html  www.ebi.ac.uk/proteome/HUMAN/chromosomes/disease _set/16.html and http://spore.swmed.edu/Luc++Lung+Cancer+genes.xls http://www.cancerindex.org/geneweb/X 1501.htm  Table 1 presents our strongest novel rules. When we searched the world-wide web for publications relating our top 53 genes to lung cancer, we found that 9 of them are known to be associated with lung cancer, 19 of them are known to be associated with other types of cancer, and the remaining 25 were not known to be associated with cancer. These results suggest that those genes that we have identified as novel might also have an association with lung cancer and should be examined more closely by biologists 4 References 1 L i v i n g s t o n G R o s e n b e r g  J  an d B u c h an an B  A n  Agenda- and Justification-Based Framework for Discovery Systems Journal of Knowledge and Information Systems 5 2\ to appear  r ovost, F.

ing technology in an additional system component that offers performance advantages for a huge range of appli cations and that is independent of the concrete applica tion and the DWDBS Currently none of the existing systems follows this approach Optimization Strategy 4.1 Rewrite Strategies for Query Sequences In formati on Information Request A Request C Strategy I Single-Query SQ Typical query sequences that are produced by deci sion support applications can be rewritten as a single and in most cases more complex query A straightforward method to achieve this single-query is as follows Start ing with the second query in the sequence, replace the occurrence of each temporary table in the FROM clause by the complete SELECT statement that generates data for this temporary table If we use this simple syntactic replacement algorithm for the query sequence in Figure 4 we first have to look at Q2 As this one does not use any temporary table we have to examine query 43 It needs data from table A1 as well as from A2 Therefore the FROM clause is changed and AI is replaced by the SELECT statement of Q1 The same replacement is nec essary for A2 The new query for A3 does not include any references to temporary tables Hence we can proceed with the last query in this sequence It is only based on the content of A3 Its purpose is to filter out the relevant data according to the ranking criterion We replace A3 in the FROM clause of query 44 by the new version of the query for A3 The resulting single-query for information request A is shown in Figure 6 a4.orderyear a5.partkey a5.partname. al.sumquantity a2 smquantity a1 sumquantity  a2 sumquantity AS incrquantity 1al.sumquantity  a2.sumquantity 1 from Q3 INSERT INTO A4 ordermonthkey, ardermodthname, orderyearkey, orderyear partkey. partname. swnquantity, Imsumquantity incrquantity incrquantity2 SELECT al.ordermonthkey al.ordermonthname, a1,orderyearkey a1.orderyear al.partkey al.partname, al.swnquantity a1 Imsumquantity. al.incrquantity. al.incrquantity2 FROM ISELECT a2.ordervearkev a2 ordermonthkev  al.partkey, SUM\(al.quantity  1 200ROM lineitem-orders al orderday a2 WHERE a2.orderdate  al.arderdate 1 AND a2.ordermonthkev IN 1199401 199402 I GROUP BY a2.orderyearkey. a2,ardermonthkey. al.partkey  AS a1 orderyearkey, ordermonthkey, partkey. sumguantity FROM lineitem-orders al orderday a2 WHERE a2.lastmonthdate i al.orderdate GROUP BY a2,ordermonthkey. al.partkey a2.ordermonthkey IN 199401 199602  AS a2 ordelmonthkey. partkey. sumquantity ordermonth a3 orderyear a4 part a5 WHERE al.ordermonthkey  a2.ordermonthkey AND al.partkey  a2.partkey AND al.ordermanthkey  a3.ardermonthkey AND al.orderyearkey  a4.orderyearkey AND al.partkey  a5.partkey  AS a1  ordermonthkey ordermonthname, orderyearkey orderyear partkey partname su-antity lmsumguantity incrquantity, incrquantityl  WHERE al.inc-antity2  98 from Q3 Figure 6 Single-Query for Request A This type of query rewrite that is similar to view ex pansion is an appropriate strategy for the DSS optimizer because it does not require any knowledge about the ap plication that generated the query sequence or about the DWDBS The rewrite strategy is only based on the list of queries that constitute the given query sequence I I 1 JOINS I SORTS I JOINS 1 SORTS f QS  Mergeselect SQ  Mergeselect I I I SQ  WhereToGroup I 16 1 16 Given these advantages of a single-query it seems to be a good idea to combine queries of a sequence into a single one in general, Nevertheless, the task is not that easy for the DSS optimizer. We have further analyzed the queries in our application scenario based on the query plans the optimizer of DB2 generated for our experi ments. Table 1 shows how they differ in the number of joins and sort operations. The values given here espe cially show that the straightforward combination of the original query sequence into one SQL query can result in a large number of joins and sorts For information request 181 


C the single-query SQ needs 33 joins and 37 sort opera tions The corresponding query plan has more than 200 nodes This complexity is not easy to handle for the optimizer of the DWDBS Its output might be a rather bad query plan As one example the number of join orders increases exponentially with the number of joins With more than 10 joins it is likely that the optimizer is not able to consider all relevant orders. Additionally it might not detect all common sub-expressions that are part of the query and that could be combined The appropriate and manageable complexity of queries depends on the characteristics of the optimizer used in the DWDBS So far our discussion has shown that in some cases a sequence of queries might run faster than the combined single-query and that in other situations this might not be true Our experiments show examples for both cases Hence, the DSS optimizer has to decide for each query sequence whether it should be combined or not Strategy IZ Partial Combination One alternative is not to combine the whole sequence into a single-query but to merge it into a couple of que ries As we have argued, one single-query could be too complex for the optimizer of a DWDBS to find a good execution plan If the DSS optimizer generates a small number of semi-complex queries this new sequence could be more efficient The optimization task is then to find the proper points where to cut off the original se quence. This could be done based on dependency graphs as given in Figure 8 For some query sequences it is not possible to gener ate an equivalent single-query  because there are depend encies within the sequence This appears in the case of ranking In the query sequence shown in Figure 4 the last query Q4 selects data according to a filter criterion For the sake of simplicity we assumed that the filter value is known in advance. Depending on the way the user de fined the information request and the query generation process of the application this filter predicate might be determined based on data in A3 In this case the last query of the sequence could include a variable instead of the filter predicate. Hence, the partial combination strat egy is applicable The DSS optimizer could combine QI Q2 and 43 as described for Strategy I and leave Q4 as is This strategy is not appropriate for the query se quences we present in this paper Nevertheless it is a suitable strategy for the DSS optimizer because it is only based on the list of queries that constitute the given query sequence Strategy ZIZ Semantic Rewrite Another deciding factor for the DSS optimizer could be based on supplementary analysis of the original query sequence. One method to minimize the runtime of query execution is to minimize the number of temporary tables in the whole sequence, thus removing the overhead for writing to and reading from temporary tables It is also important to avoid repeated references to temporary ta bles when composing the single query Most temporary tables imply joins between underlying tables Repeated referencing of temporary tables in different queries of a sequence implies a redundant computation of these tem porary tables via nested SQL statements when composing the single query Queries which restrict one single previous temporary table by additional projections and/or selections cat1 be propagated to the query creating this preceding tempo rary table i.e the projections and/or selections of the consuming query are moved into the foregoing query by concatenating both projections ConcutPruject  and/or selections ConcarSelect Queries with identical FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY HAVING and ORDER BY clause can be merged into one query by concatenating the SELECT clauses. We refer to this transformation as MergeSelect Queries with identical SELECT FROM GROUP BY HAVING and ORDER BY clauses can sometimes be merged into one query by concatenating the WHEW clauses by AND MergeWhere If the queries differ only in a selection on the same column they can be combined by replacing parts of the WHERE clause by an additional grouping on this column Where Tocroup Queries with identical SELECT FROM WHERE GROUP BY and ORDER BY clause can be merged into one query by concatenating the HAVING clauses by AND MergeHaving Simple transformations are the following QS QS  MergeSelect INSERT INK C5 Icustkey. stddeviation INSERT INlW C5 SELECT al.cuietkey sTwBVlal.urrtpric Icustkey stddevl stdde'r2 FROM lineitem-orders al orderday a2 CL 8TDDBV\(al..ndpric a1.custkey STDDBY\(Il..ndprice I AVC\(a1 ndpris IN 11992,1993,19941 FROM lineitemorders al AND al.cucfkey  C4.custkey orderday a2 GROUP BY al.custkey WHERE a2.orderdate i 11992,1993.1994 GROUP BY al.curtkey SELECT a1.custkey AND a2.ordaryearkey IN l1992,1993;1994 AND a1.custkey  C4.custkey GROUP BY al.aurtkey INSERT 1\260K Cl Icustkey cuscn stddevl, stddev2. turnoverl992 turnoverl993, turnoverl994 CS.stddevlation Cfi.stddeviation Cl.turnoverl992, C2.turnover1993 c3.turnovar1994 SELECT al.custkey. a4.custname FROM cl. c2, c3. c5 cs WHERE c5.cusckey  Cl.custkey AND C5,custkey  C2.custkey AND C5.custkey  C3.custkey AND C5.custkey  C6.custkey AND C5.custkey  a4.cu~tkey customer a4 INSERT 1\260K C7 Icustkey custnme stddevl stddev2, turnoverl992 turnove~1993 rurnoverl994l CS.stddev1.

We generated two modified query sequences for in formation request C QS+MergeSelect is built by using the Mergeselect transformation for the tables C.5 and C6 of QS and by using a more complex transformation which additionally reduces the number of joins in the new tables C.5 and C7 The transformation process is shown in Figure 7 The other modification QS WhereToGroup uses the WhereToGroup transfor mation to further reduce the number of queries in the sequence 25 Obviously, these rewrite strategies can also be com bined with the single-query strategy and the partial com bination strategy We refer to the queries resulting from these hybrid strategies as SQ+MergeSelect and SQ WhereToGroup where each respective query se quence is combined into one query As a consequence the number of join and sort operations in the rewritten queries drop drastically more than 50 as can be seen in Table 1 4.2 Parallelism In this section we discuss how parallel execution can support the query sequences generated by decision sup port applications. Our focus is not'on intra-query parallel ism We assume that the DWDBS is able to generate par allel query plans for all queries in a sequence, where suit able Apart from this perspective on parallelism it is also interesting to see whether the DSS optimizer can figure out a group of queries in the sequence that could be run in parallel Therefore, our focal point is inter-query paral lelism For each sequence of queries we can determine how the steps of the sequence depend on each other and describe these dependencies for example by means of a graph The dependency graphs for the query sequences A and C of our application scenario are shown in Figure 8 For sequence A the graph shows that AI and A2 could be generated in parallel For sequence C the tables CI C2 and C3 could first be generated in parallel and later in the sequence the same holds for tables C.5 and C6 In general a group of queries can be executed in parallel if none of the queries within the group depends on each other Figure 8 Dependency Graphs The dependency graph for a given sequence of que ries can easily be determined by observing the FROM clauses of all queries The graph consists of the tempo rary tables Temp as nodes An edge from node Temp to Temp exists if the FROM clause of query Q contains Temp In particular no knowledge about the application is required. Hence this optimization strategy turns out to be applicable for the DSS optimizer The implementation of this strategy can be based on methods that generate parallel execution plans for SQL queries as they are used in standard database systems These techniques produce an internal representation of the queries which is extended by data and pipeline paral lelism The same methods could be used to exploit de pendency graphs for query sequences like those in Figure 8 That is why available technology is very well suited for the DSS optimizer 7 21 But how about the interface of the DSS optimizer to the database system The standard interface of a DWDBS allows the application to send one query after the other within one database transaction For each of the SQL statements to be run in parallel a separate connec tion and a separate transaction is necessary. Since those queries that are independent of each other should be started in parallel only their access to the data warehouse base tables could inhibit the use of parallel transactions If we assume that decision support applications only read base tables in the data warehouse the standard SQL in terface of database systems turns out to be sufficient for the optimization strategy we have discussed here 4.3 Statistics Query sequences generated by decision support appli cations usually produce the result data set that is relevant for the end user as the last step of the sequence As soon as this last query terminates the final result is available and all other temporary tables could be dropped For query sequence A in our example table A4 contains all relevant data for the end user whereas tables AI A2 and A3 may be deleted as soon as A4 is complete Each query in a sequence is processed by the opti mizer of the DWDBS One important factor that deter mines the efficiency of query execution is whether all necessary statistical information is available for the opti mizer or not Relevant statistical information is the num ber of rows the number and type of all columns and the distribution of values in all columns of each table that is read by a query. Most database systems do not automati cally update statistical information For example a sepa rate statement is available for Oracle8i that starts the up date of statistical information for a single table 22 The following statement would be necessary to generate sta TISTICS Additional parameters may be used in order tistics for AI ANALYZE TABLE A1 COMPUTE STA 183 


to make available more detailed information on the table and its indexes  We assume that statistical information is up to date for all base tables of the data warehouse. However this is not true for temporary tables generated by a sequence of queries If the execution of a query sequence should be based on current statistics the statements that provide this information have to be added to the sequence. The sequence for query C as given in Figure 8 could be augmented by calling ANALYZE TABLE for the tempo rary tables Cl through C7 The statistical informatioo has to be available for each of these tables before the tables are read by another query in the sequence for the first time The statistical information for table C1 does not have to be present until the query for C4 starts execution This leads to an additional strategy for the DSS opti mizer that is applicable without any knowledge about the application that generated a sequence of queries A se quence could be extended by statements that provide ad ditional statistical information for the DWDBS optimizer For this task the DSS optimizer has to know, how this is done for different database systems and which parameters influence the available statistics It also has to take into account the trade-off between the time that is needed for the update of statistical information and the query execu tion time that is saved with execution plans based on this information. Further enhancements could be achieved by running statistic updates in parallel to other statements in the sequence. This is always possible if the queries do not depend on the temporary table for which the statistic up date is in progress 4.4 Partitioning and Indexing All optimization strategies we have discussed so far are based on rewriting a sequence of SQL statements or enhancing the way it is executed In this section we will briefly discuss some approaches to support OLAP appli cations by changing the schema of the data warehouse Additional indexes on base tables in the data ware house enable the optimizer of the DWDBS to find query plans that are more efficient No rewriting of queries is required It is necessary to find the proper combination of indexes that offer maximum support for all applications on the data warehouse and take into account given con straints on disk space and time for index maintenance If typical query sequences on the data warehouse are known, administration tools of current database systems can be used to establish the suitable set of indexes 5 Partition tables support typical OLAP queries because they reduce the amount of base data that has to be scanned for one sequence of queries. One large fact table could include data for several years If the typical query retrieves data for exactly one year it might be more effi cient to store the facts in partition tables for each year 31 184 The scan of one partition table instead of scanning the complete large fact table might then be sufficient for many queries A smaller volume of data is likely to result in a more efficient retrieval of results This kind of parti tioning is supported by some OLAP tools 16 Applications on a data warehouse can also be sup ported by aggregate tables Especially OLAP applicai ions require a lot of grouping and aggregation If the agge gated data is already present in the data warehouse, que ries run more efficient because less data has to be proc essed and less aggregations have to be computed. Some algorithms to find the proper set of aggregate tables are described in 12  describes a couple of approaches how a given query can be processed based on existing aggregate tables Our experimental results indicate that indexes, aggre gate and partition tables are appropriate means to en hance query sequences. Nevertheless, the DSS optimizer is not the suitable component to create indexes, aggregate tables or partition tables The successful exploitation of these three strategies is based on knowledge about the schema of the data warehouse and the characteristics of all applications that access data in the warehouse. There is another important difference to the optimization ap proaches described in Section 4.1 through 4.3 All strate gies we described there offer a local optimization for ex actly one sequence of queries, whereas additional indexes and additional tables also influence the performance of other queries Therefore they should be part of the DWDBS administration 5 Experimental Results For our experiments we have created the modified schema as described in Section 2.1 in a database system We populated the tables with data based on the originai TPC-H data generated with three different scale factors according to the benchmark specifications Our largest data set for which the results are presented here was pro duced with scale factor 10 The raw data summarizes to 10 GB the main fact table lineitem-orders has about 60 million rows The environment used for the experiments consists of a Sun Enterprise E4500 with 12 processors 12 GB main memory, the object-relational database sys tem IBM DB2AJDB V7.1 and a benchmark tool that is provided with DB2 From a technological point of view we could have used any other market-strength DBMS since we only used techniques that are commonly available e.g paral lelism indexes partitioning as well as statistics The decision for DB2 was twofold First we wanted to collect detailed information on the generated query plans This information is provided by the EXPLAIN utility of DB2 13 Second DB2 is known for its good optimization technology and thus can play a good reference point 


The results given in Table 2 are a subset of more than 400 experiments where one experiment is the execution of one query sequence for one information request on one test data set Each value presented here is the average of at least three experiments Some cells of Table 2 are empty because not all optimization strategies were appli cable to all of the three information requests Most of them are applicable to information request A and request C Business questions that are similar to these two are very likely to build the majority of questions in a real environment Table 2 Experimental Results in seconds Looking at the results in more details one can see that in almost all cases the optimization strategies were suc cessful in reducing the runtime of the information re quests. Sometimes there was only a slight enhancement whereas other strategies led to an execution time that was an order of a magnitude shorter than for the original query The execution time for the original sequence of que ries QS is given in line 1 The modified versions of the query sequences and their combination into a single query SQ as described in Section 4.1 are shown in lines 2 through 6 These results show that combining the statements of a sequence is likely to improve the per formance. However this is not true for information re quest C The sequence QS+WhereToGroup runs much faster than the corresponding single-query Hence the DSS optimizer has to decide in which situation it is ap propriate to combine the queries of a sequence and in which the eventually modified version of the sequence is the best choice Line 7 of Table 2 shows the results for the query se quence that was enhanced by generating additional statis tical information for temporary tables In our experi ments this version of the queries runs always faster than the original sequence. For information request C it was also faster than the very complex single-query SQ whereas for request A it was slower than the single query Therefore, leaving the query sequence as is and generating additional statistical information for tempo 185 rary tables is a supplementary alternative to the other strategies which can be used by the DSS optimizer The third basic alternative for the DSS optimizer is to run the sequence of queries as it was generated but with some queries of the sequence in parallel as described in Section 4.2 The experimental results for this strategy are given in line 8 They show only a slight improvement compared to the original sequence. Especially for infor mation request C the enhancement is less than 10 percent This is because the runtime of the query sequence for this question is dominated by only one query that joins sev eral temporary tables Some results for the strategies that turned out not to be appropriate for the DSS optimizer are given in lines 9 and 10 With additional indexes and partitions we can see a remarkable performance enhancement for informa tion request B Additional partition tables reduced the runtime for information requests A and C where the re duction is between 8 and 25 percent For the information requests A and C we achieved further improvements by other strategies that are useable by the DSS optimizer Hence we do not loose too much optimization potential if the DSS optimizer has to ignore additional indexes and partitions as optimization strategies Nevertheless in a real environment these strategies are mandatory for the administrator of the data warehouse 6 Conclusion In this work we investigated that an optimizer in be tween decision support applications and the DWDBS is essential for the efficient processing of some classes of typical information requests generated by DSS tools Hence we suggested an optimized system architecture for decision support applications In this architecture generated query sequences are rewritten by an additional system component, called DSS optimizer The transfor mation is based on optimization strategies that are inde pendent of the application and use little knowledge about the underlying database system. This DSS optimizer has two main advantages First it is able to support several applications without any need to change their query gen eration algorithms. Second it is capable of applying op timization strategies that are not supported by state-of the-art database systems We set up a realistic application scenario, selected a set of relevant information requests and ran a large series of experiments based on TPC-H data Our experiments have shown that all three strategies we proposed for the DSS optimizer were successful. They reduced the run time of the given query sequences significantly None of the three strategies turned out to be the best in all situa tions Hence it is the task of the DSS optimizer to decide upon the strategy to use This decision should be based on information gained from the query sequence itself and on meta data gained from the underlying database sys 


tem Therefore further work will focus on heuristics that could be used by the DSS optimizer in order to decide which optimization strategy or which combination of strategies should be used for a given sequence of queries Another important issue of future work is the design and implementation of the DSS optimizer The basic technology for a DSS optimizer is in place because all three strategies are based on matured technology Gener ating single-queries is similar to view expansion Deter mining queries within a sequence that could run in paral lel is based on parallel database technology 7 21 Us ing statistical information for query optimization is a ba sic optimization technology Furthermore we want to apply extensible optimization technology as is available with systems like CASCADES 8 In doing so one has to observe that the DSS optimizer is not a general purpose optimizer but only a specific component that supports only a predefined set of optimization strategies Consequently we want to reconsider the main design decisions of an optimizer e.g search space, rule set and cost-based decision making As a result we want to come up with a tailored and efficient DSS optimization compo nent Acknowledgement We would like to thank Leonard Shapiro and Ralf Rantzau for helpful discussions and their comments on an early version of the paper References  11 AberdeenGroup: Bringing Analytical Reporting to Enter prise Business Intelligence Aberdeen Group Boston 1999 R Agrawal J C Shafer Parallel Mining of Association Rules.

The execution time of the HPA program pass 2 is shown in figure 13 as the number of PCs is changed The maximum number of PCs used in this evaluation is 100 Reasonably good speedup is achieved in this application as the number of PCs is increased 5 Conclusion In this paper we presented performance evaluation of parallel database processing on an ATM connected 100 node PC cluster system The latest PCs enabled us to obtain over 110Mbps throughput in point-to-point communication on a 155Mbps ATM network even with the so-called 217\217heavy\220\220 TCP/IP This greatly helped in developing the system in a short period since we were absorbed in fixing many other problems Massively parallel computers now tend to be used in business applications as well as the conventional scientific computation Two major business applications decision support query processing and data mining were picked up and executed on the PC cluster The query processing environment was built using the results of our previous research the super database computer SDC project Performace evaluation results with a query of the standard TPC-D benchmark showed that our system achieved superior performance especially when transposed file organization was employed As for data mining we developed a parallel algorithm for mining association rules and implemented it on the PC cluster By utilizing aggregate memory of the system efficiently the system showed good speedup characteristics as the number of nodes increased The good price/performance ratio makes PC clusters very attractive and promising for parallel database processing applications All these facts support the effectiveness of the commodity PC based massively parallel database servers Acknowledgment This project is supported by NEDO New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization in Japan Hitachi Ltd technically helped us extensively for ATM related issues References  R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 207--216 1993  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases  1994  A C Arpaci-Dusseau R H Arpaci-Dusseau D E Culler J M Hellerstein and D A Patterson High-performance sorting on Networks of Workstations In Proceedings of International Conference on Management of Data  pages 243--254 1997  D.S Batory On searching transposed files ACM TODS  4\(4 1979  P.A Boncz W Quak and M.L Kersten Monet and its geographical extensions A novel approach to high performance GIS processing In Proceedings of International Conference on Extending Database Technology  pages 147--166 1996 15 Proceedings of the ACM/IEEE SC97 Conference \(SC\22297 0-89791-985-8/97 $ 17.00 \251 1997 IEEE

US Coast Guard approved personal floatation devices must be supplied and inspected where employees are engaged in work where there is danger of drowning Required employee protection in public work areas to include the following  Warning signs or flags and other traffic control devices  Barricades for additional protection to employees  Barricades around excavated areas  Warning lights at night prominently displayed Lines or equipment which may be sub to backfeed from cogeneration or other sources are to be worked as energized in accordance with the applicable paragraphs of the Rules Comments w APPA submits the following comments regarding this Special Conditions section Recommends that the wording regarding capacitors be modified to include a waiting period for five minutes prior to short circuiting and grounding in accordance with industry standards for discharging of capacitors For series street light circuits, recommends that language be added for bridging to either install a bypass conductor or by placement of grounds so that work occurs between the grounds Recommends modification of the section regarding personal floatation devices to not apply to work sites near fountains decorative ponds swimming pools or other bodies of water on residential and commercial property Definitions x This section of the proposed Rules includes definitions of terms Definitions particularly pertinent to understanding the proposal and which have not previously been included are listed as follows Authorized Employee  an employee to whom the authority and responsibility to perform a specific assignment has been given by the employer who can demonstrate by experience or training the ability to recognize potentially hazardous energy and its potential impact on the work place conditions and who has the knowledge to implement adequate methods and means for the control and isolation of such energy CZearance for Work  Authorization to perform specified work or permission to enter a restricted area Clearance from Hazard  Separation from energized lines or equipment Comments x The following summarizes the changes in some of the definitions which APPA recommends Add to the definition for authorized employee It the authorized employee may be an employee assigned to perform the work or assigned to provide the energy control and isolation function  Recommends that OSHA modify the definition for a line clearance tree trimmer to add the word qualified resulting in the complete designation as a qualified line clearance tree trimmer Recommends that OSHA modify the definition of qualified employee" to remove the word construction from the definition since it is felt that knowledge of construction procedures is beyond the scope of the proposed rule resulting in APPA's new A2-18 I 


wording as follows more knowledgeable in operation and hazards associated with electric power generation transmission and/or distribution equipment Recommends that OSHA add a definition for the word practicable and replace the word feasible with practicable wherever it appears in the proposed regulations and that practicable be further defined as capable of being accomplished by reasonably available and economic means OTHER ISSUES Clothing OSHA requested comments on the advisability of adopting requirements regarding the clothing worn by electric utility industry employees EEI has presented comments which indicates research is underway prior to establishing a standard for clothing to be worn by electric utility employees However EEI's position is that this standard has not developed to the extent that it could be included in the OSHA Rules Both APPA and EEI state that they would support a requirement that employers train employees regarding the proper type of clothing to wear to minimize hazards when working in the vicinity of exposed energized facilities Grandfathering Due to the anticipated cost impact on the utility industry of the proposed Rules requiring that existing installations be brought to the requirements of the proposed Rules both APPA and EEI propose that the final Rules include an omnibus grandfather provision This provision would exempt those selected types of facilities from modification to meet the new rules EEI states that if the grandfathering concept is incorporated that electric utility employees will not be deprived of proper protection They propose that employers be required to provide employees with a level of protection equivalent to that which the standard would require in those instances in which the utility does not choose to modify existing facilities to comply with the final standard Rubber Sleeves OSHA requests comments from the industry on whether it would be advisable to require rubber insulating sleeves when gloves are used on lines or equipment energized at more than a given voltage EEI states its position that utilities should continue to have the option of choosing rubber gloves or gloves and sleeves to protect employees when it is necessary to work closer to energized lines than the distances specified in the clearance tables Preemuting State Laws EEI requests that the final Rules be clear in their preempting state rules applicable to the operation and maintenance work rules for electric power systems. This is especially critical since some states now have existing laws which are more stringent than the proposed OSHA Rules Examples are 1 in California and Pennsylvania where electric utility linemen are prohibited from using rubber gloves to work on lines and equipment energized at more than certain voltages and 2 in California and Connecticut where the live line bare hand method of working on high voltage transmission systems is prohibited One utility Pacific Gas  Electric has obtained a variance from the California OSHA to perform live line bare-hand transmission maintenance work on an experimental basis Coiiflicts Between the Rilles and Part 1926 Subpart V Since many of the work procedures in construction work and operation and maintenance work are similar and difficult to distinguish between EEI requests that the final order be clear in establishing which rule has jurisdiction over such similar work areas A2-19 v 


IMPACTS ON COSTS AND ASSOCIATED BENEFITS In its introduction to the proposed rules OSHA has provided an estimate of the annual cost impact on the electric utility industry for the proposed des of approximately 20.7 million OSHA estimates that compliance with this proposed standard would annually prevent between 24 and 28 fatalities and 2,175 injuries per year The utilities which have responded to this proposed standard through their respective associations have questioned the claims both of the magnitude of the cost involved and the benefit to the industry in preventing fatalities and lost-time injuries Both EEI and APPA feel that the annual cost which OSHA estimates are significantly lower than would be realized in practice Factors which APPA and EEI feel were not properly addressed include the following OSHA has not accurately accounted for cost of potential retroactive impacts including retrofitting and modifying existing installations and equipment OSHA has not consistently implemented performance based provisions in proposed rules  many portions require specific approaches which would require utilities to replace procedures already in place with new procedures Estimates were based on an average size investor-owned utility of 2,800 employees and an average rural cooperative of 56 employees, which are not applicable to many smaller systems such as municipal systems OSHA has not adequately addressed the retraining which would be necessary with modifying long-established industry practices to be in accordance with the OSHA rules EEI claims that OSHA's proposed clearance requirements would not allow the use of established maintenance techniques for maintaining high voltage transmission systems and thus would require new techniques For an example of the cost which is estimated to be experienced as a result of the new Rules one of the EEI member companies has estimated that approximately 20,000 transmission towers would need to be modified to accommodate the required step bolts in the Rules at an estimated cost of 6,200,000 Additionally this same company estimates that the annual cost of retesting live line tools for its estimated 1,000 tools would be 265,000 Additionally, both EEI and APPA question the additional benefits which OSHA claims would result from implementation of the new Rules APPA questions the estimates of preventing an additional 24 to 28 fatalities annually and 2,175 injuries per year in that it fails to account for the fact that the industry has already implemented in large part safety measures which are incorporated in the Rules EEI and APPA also point out that many preventable injuries cannot be eliminated despite work rules enforcement and safety awareness campaigns since many such accidents which result in fatalities are due to employee being trained but not following the employer's training and policies PRESENT STATUS OF RULES According to information received from the OSHA office in February 1993 the final Rules are to be published no later than July 1993 and possibly as soon as March 1993 OSHA closed their receipt of comments in March 1991 and no further changes in the rules are thought possible A2-20 


CONCLUSION The OSHA 1910.269 which proposes to cover electric utility operation and maintenance work rules affects a multitude of working procedures as are summarized in this paper It is not possible at the present time to assess the final structure of the Rules as may be proposed in 1993 or subsequent years Since the comments from the utility associations APPA and EEI were made following the initial release of the proposed OSHA Rules in 1989 a significant amount of time has elapsed where other events have occurred which may affect the form of the final Rules The 1993 NESC went into effect in August 1992 and includes some of the requirements to which the commenters objected For example a significant requirement in the Part 4 of the 1993 NESC requires that rubber gloves be utilized on exposed energized parts of facilities operating at 50 to 300 volts This requirement is in conflict with EEl\222s proposed change to the OSHA Rules which would still allow working such secondary facilities without the use of rubber gloves Electric utilities are advised to review the January 31 1989 proposed operation and maintenance Rules as summarized in this paper and to review their procedures which would be affected by application of the Rules Many of the procedures proposed in the Rules provide valuable guidance in electric utilities\222 operation and maintenance activities Where the cost impact is not significant, it is recommended that utilities consider implementing such procedures in expectation of the Rules being published in the next few months Also it would be appropriate for electric utilities to review the 1993 edition of the NESC since there are portions of the Rules which have resulted in changes in the NESC These changes mainly occur in Part 4 Rules for the Operation of Electric Supply and Communications Lines and Equipment The concerns which the commenters have addressed regarding the cost impact and the resulting benefits experienced as a result of the promulgation of the Rules are real ones and must be addressed in the final Rules As a result this paper cannot present a conclusion regarding the full impact of the Rules The development of such Rules continue to be an ongoing matter and will undoubtedly require later analysis when the final rules are published A2-21
