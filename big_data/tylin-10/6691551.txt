P-DOT: A Model of Computation for Big Data   Tao Luo, Yin Liao, Guoliang Chen School of Computer Science and Technology University of Science and Technology of China Hefei, China luotao1, liaoyin}@mail.ustc.edu.cn glchen@ustc.edu.cn Yunquan Zhang Key Lab. of Computer System and Architecture Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing, China yunquan.cas@gmail.com   Abstract In response to the high demand of big data analytics several programming models on large and distributed cluster systems have been proposed and implemented, such as MapReduce, Dryad and Pregel. However, compared with high performance computing areas, the basis and principles of computation and communication behavior of big data analytics is not well studied. In this paper, we review the current big data computational model DOT and DOTA, and propose a more general and practical model p-DOT \(p-phases DOT\. p-DOT is not a simple extension, but with profound significance: for general aspects any big data analytics job execution expressed in DOT model or BSP model can be represented by it; for practical aspects, it considers I/O behavior to evaluate performance overhead. Moreover we provide a cost function implying that the optimal number of machines is near-linear to the square root of input size for a fixed algorithm and workload, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the function through several experiments Keywordsóbig data; computational model; distributed system I   I NTRODUCTION  In many areas such as science, internet and e-commerce etc the volume of data to be analyzed grows rapidly [1-4   Te r a bytes and petabytes datasets are increasingly the norm today so do requirements for efficiently extracting the value. Given the tendency for big data analytics, performance and scalability problems become increasingly severe In response to the high demand of big data analytics, several programming models on large and distributed cluster systems have been proposed and implemented. MapReduce [5 exploits a map function and reduce function to parallelize the user program automatically and to provide transparent faulttolerance. Dryad [7 p ec i f ie s a n arb i tr ar y D A G to for m a d a taflow graph for coarse-grain data-parallel applications. Pregel 8 i n s p i r ed  b y B u l k S y nc hr o n o u s P a ra l l e l  B S P  m o d e l  9  consists a sequence of iterations to process large-scale sparse graph computing. Although these models simplify the complicated work of algorithm designers and program developers while mapping their work onto real cluster systems, the basis and principles of computation and communication behavior of big data analytics is not well studied To address above issue, DOT model str a c t s  b a sic operations and communication patterns with three entities: distributed data sets \(D\, concurrent data processing operations O\and data transformations \(T\ respectively. It also provides principles for designing scalable and fault-tolerant software frameworks for big data analytics. DOTA model \(DOT Advanced\ [11 i n s p i r ed  b y B S P  m o d e l  re de fi ne s a n d  e x t e nd s t h e  DOT. It divides data processing into three steps: computation communication, and aggregation. And essentially, it is a bipartite communication model However, the aggregation step in DOTA model seems so special for MapReduce that other programming models like Dryad or Pregel do not actually need it. Besides, both DOT and DOTA model assume that the memory capacity of a single machine is sub-linear to the size of data. They ignore the nonlinearity of disk I/O performance under contention, which is a critical aspect of estimating the performance overhead of big data analytics applications [12, 13    In this paper, we propose a candidate for the general and practical model, called p-DOT. It limits the memory capacity per machine which is different from above models, and only allows each machine to perform sequential computations in polynomial time without too high a degree to the size of data For general aspects, it is more compatible with the BSP model of computation and communication in high performance computing \(HPC\ areas; and for practical aspects, understanding the effects of I/O behavior can make a better decision about how many machines to schedule on a cluster, which leads to better resource utilization We highlight our contributions as follows   We develop a computational model p-DOT for big data analytics. Any big data analytics job execution represented by DOT model or BSP model can be redefined by p-DOT. We also certify that the processing paradigm of p-DOT model is scalable and fault-tolerant   Under the p-DOT model, we provide a cost function where I/O behavior is included to evaluate performance overhead. The function implies that the optimal number of machines is near-linear to the square root of input size for a fixed algorithm and workload, which can then improve the execution time and perform a qualitative prediction on the number of resources necessary for a particular cluster The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II discusses the related computational models. Section III describes our p-DOT model and its properties. Section IV gives the cost function of p-DOT model by rigorous analysis. Section V demonstrates the effectiveness of the p-DOT model by several experiments.

II  R ELATED WORK  BSP BSP [9 is f a m o u s f o r its ex p l i c it r e q u ir em en t o n sy n chronization in each superstep. The program executed on it consists of a sequence of supersteps with periodicity L In each superstep, each processor/memory component can perform the combination of local computation on local available data and message passing. After each period of L unit times, a global check is performed to ensure all components have finished one superstep. Thus, a superstep includes three phases: computation, communication, and synchronization DOT DOT [10 is a m a trix m o d e l w h ich  d e s c ri b e s th e d a taflow of a big data analytics job with elementary/composite DOT blocks. An elementary DOT block can be represented in three layers   D-layer \(data layer\a big data set is divided into n parts from D 1 to D n in a distributed system, where each part is a sub-dataset   O-layer \(operation layer n workers \(from o 1 to o n erform concurrent operations, while each worker o i only processes D i and stores intermediate results   T-layer \(transformation layer\ a single worker collects all intermediate results, performs the transformation and finally outputs the ending result A composite DOT block is organized by a group of m independent elementary DOT blocks, which have the identical worker set of the O-layer and share the same big data set as input divided in an identical way. Their formulas are as follows               1 1 1 1 1 n n n i i i n n D o D o t t D o t o o D D OT D     1                 0 0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 0  1  1 1  1 1  1 1 2 1 1  1 1  2 1  2  1   2 2  2 1  2  1 2  1 1  1 1 n m n m m n n m n i i m i n i i i m m n n n m m n composite composite D o D o t D o D o t t t t D o D o t t t o o o o o o o o o D D T O D      2 DOTA Inspired by BSP model, DOTA \(DOT Advance   i s  a m a t r i x m o d e l w h i c h e x p l i c i t l y d i vi d e s da t a  pr oc e s s i ng into computation and communication. It redefines and extends the DOT model by four layers   D-layer \(data layer\a big data set is divided into n parts from D 1 to D n in a distributed system, where each part is a sub-dataset   O-layer \(operation layer n workers \(from o 1 to o n erform concurrent operations, while each worker o i only processes D i and stores intermediate results   T-layer \(transfer layer\ each operator t i,j do transfer on intermediate results from worker o i in O-layer to worker a j in A-layer   A-layer \(aggregation layer m workers \(from a 1 to a m  perform concurrent aggregations, while each worker a i only aggregates corresponding intermediate results and outputs the ending result The formula is as follows                           0 0 0 0 0 0     0 0 0 0 0 0   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  1 1  1 1  1 1 1  1 1 2 1 1  1 1 1 1  2 1  2  1   2 2  2 1  2  1 2  1 1  1 1 2 1  2  1   2 2  2 1  2  1 2  1 1  1 2 1 1 n n m n m m n n n m n i n n m i n i i m m n n n m m n i i i m m n n n m m n n D o t D o t a D o t D o t a a a a D o t D o t a a a t t t t t t t t t D o a a a t t t t t t t t t o o o D D OTA D        3 From the definition and formula, it is clear that both Olayer and A-layer contain only computation jobs, and their matrix are diagonal since independent computation can be executed concurrently; while T-layer merely do the communication jobs, and its matrix is ordinary since communication is interactive. Furthermore, it is obvious that computation jobs can be divided into two disjoint sets O and A by matrix T which implies that DOTA is indeed a bipartite communication model III  T HE P DOT MODEL  A  Model Definition Inspired by BSP model, the computation model p-DOT consists of a sequence of iterations, called phases During a phase q a vertex represents the input/output or intermediate data, a user defined computation operation O is invoked in parallel for each vertex first, and a user defined point-to-point communication operation T is performed between pairs of vertexes next. If the phase is the last stage p the output will be stored as a final result; otherwise, it will be served as the input for the next phase q 1. The detail is as follows   D-layer \(data layer\a big data set is divided into n parts from D 1 to D n in a distributed system, where each part is a sub-dataset   O-layer \(computation layer\ during a phase q  n q workers \(from o 1 to o n q perform concurrent computations while each worker o i only processes a sub \(intermediate dataset and stores intermediate results   T-layer \(communication layer\: during a phase q \(q p each operator t i,j do point-to-point communication on intermediate results from worker o i  i 1 n q  of phase q  to worker o j  j 1 n q+1  f phase q 1 32

The O-layer contains only computation jobs, and its matrix is diagonal since independent computation can be executed concurrently while T-layer merely does the communication jobs, and its matrix is ordinary since communication is interactive   Understandability it is easy to understand the definition and following property, cost function and related proof of p-DOT model just with a common matrix theory B  Model Properties Based on the definition of p-DOT model, in this section there are two useful theorems to be introduced Lemma 1.1  Any processing diagram expressed in DOT model can be represented by p-DOT model  Proof Since multiplying by an identity matrix I do not change anything for a matrix A i.e A A I I A   we can conclude that      2  1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0   2    2  2  2  1 2 1  2  1   2 2  2 1  2  1 2  1 1  1 1 2 1  2  1   2 2  2 1  2  1 2  1 1  1 1         p T O D p T O D T O T O D TI O I D t t t o o o o o o o o o D D t t t o o o o o o o o o D D T O D m n m m n n n m m n m m n n n m m n original original 5 Thus, any processing diagram expressed in DOT model can be represented by p-DOT model. And the real meaning of matrix I n and I m is that the former only performs the loading operation on data before communication, while the latter directly outputs the intermediate data as the final results after communication  Lemma 1.2  Any processing diagram expressed in BSP model can be represented by p-DOT model  Proof The program executed on BSP model consists of a sequence of supersteps, in each superstep, it can be described by 1-DOT model as follows      m n n n m m n n t t t t t t t t t o o o D D OT D OT D  2  1   2 2  2 1  2  1 2  1 1  1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 where matrix O represents the concurrent computation, matrix T represents the message transmissions, and the multiplication between O D and T represents the implicitly message arriving and synchronizing. In more details, the data vector  n D D D 1  represents the local available data for each processor, worker o i applys the local computation on each \(intermediate\ta D i and operator t i,j do message passing on intermediate results from worker o i to worker o j  Thus, each superstep of BSP model can be described by 1DOT model, and consequently, the dataflow of BSP model can be described by a combination of multiple 1-DOT models where i th outputs are \(i+1 th inputs. Clearly, this combination is p-DOT model, and any processing diagram expressed in BSP model can be represented by p-DOT model  Theorem 1  Pervasive Theory  Any processing diagram expressed in DOT model or BSP model can be represented by p-DOT model  Proof It is the corollary of Lemma 1.1 and Lemma 1.2  33 


Theorem 2  Scalable and Fault-tolerance Theory  The processing paradigm of p-DOT model is scalable and faulttolerance  Proof Since matrix multiplication satisfies the associative law and multiplying by an identity matrix I do not change anything for a matrix, we can conclude that         expression  1 2 1 1 1 1 original original p p p p p p T O D I T O T O T O D T O T O D OT D OT D p       7 And since Lemma 3.1 and 3.2 of DOT model claims that  the processing paradigm of the DOT model is scalable and fault-tolerant it is obvious that the processing paradigm of pDOT model is scalable and fault-tolerance combined with Lemma 1.1  IV  T HE P DOT COST FUNCTION  A major purpose of computational model is to give a simple standard for quantifying its efficiency on which people can agree. This section introduces a cost function of p-DOT model as a candidate for this role. To make the function effective in practice, we add several restrictions first. We present the cost function by rigorous analyses of the issues involved next, and compare it to the existing model finally A  Restrictions Memory In big data analytics, it is reasonable to assume there is no single machine that can store the entire dataset and the memory per machine is limited. Thus, we require that the input to any machine be substantially sub-linear to the size of data, so do the intermediate input to a single machine in any phase q to the size of output in phase q 1. However, if per \(intermediate\ input is still too big to fit into memory on a single machine, we have to use several times to move it from disk to memory. Since a disk cannot transfer data to memory at more than a hundred million bytes per second, no matter how that data is organized [18 t h i s I  O a c c e s s  co st  m u st b e co nsi d er ed for a dataset of a hundred gigabytes or a terabyte Machines In big data analytics, it is reasonable to assume the total number of machines is much smaller than the size of data. Thus we limit the total number of machines available to be substantially sub-linear to the size of data Time Similar to paper [1  w e do n o t r e s t ri c t t h e c o m p u tation power of a single machine, except that we require the total running time be in polynomial time without too high a degree to the size of data. Furthermore, it is important to limit the number of phases, because communication is a time consuming operation in large-scale distributed systems and large number of phases seems unnatural for a general algorithm Thus, we only consider programs that require a finite number of phases, i.e. parameter p is constant B  Cost Funciton Definition 3.1  For a big data analytics job which can be represented by p-DOT model, let n be the total number of machines used in whole execution, and n q be the number of workers in O-Layer of phase q, i.e    p q n n q  1  max    Definition 3.2  Assume that each machine has the same memory size m in order to  simple understand the cost function of a big data analytics job represented by p-DOT model. Let w i.e. w 1 be the initial input to the whole job execution, w q be the intermediate input of phase q \(q 2,p  If w q n q m, i.e per \(intermediate\ input is too big to fit into memory on a single machine, we have to use      p q m n w k q q q  1 1     times to move it from disk to memory Lemma 3.1  For a fixed big data analytics job represented by p-DOT model, the computation cost of phase q is O\(k q   Proof Consider the computation of phase q which is     q T i k i i i q q q q n n k k k n n n n q q n i d d d D and T O D D where o o o d d d d d d d d d o o o D D O D q q q q q q q q q q  1  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   2  1 1 1 1 2 1  2  1   2 2  2 1  2  1 2  1 1  1 2 1 1         8 Formula \(8\ is concluded by formula \(4\ definition 3.1 and 3.2 where n q is the number of workers in O-layer, and q D with size w q is not only the input of phase q but also the output of phase q 1. If w q n q m i.e. per \(intermediate\nput D i is too big to fit into memory on a single machine D i will be changed into a k q dimensional vector, meaning we have to use k q times to load the input D i and the n q dimensional vector q D will be changed into a k q n q matrix Thus, for theoretical aspects, the computation of phase q is multiplication between a k q n q ordinary matrix D and a n q n q  diagonal matrix O Based on matrix theory, it is easy to find that this computation contains k q n q multiplications and k q  n q 1\ additions. As both multiplications and additions are executed on n q workers in parallel, the computation cost is           q q q q q q k O n n k O n k O      1 For practical aspects, the intermediate\nput is processed by n q workers concurrently The time taken for each worker is T comp  k q  T per_load   T per_comp where T comp is the total execution time T per_load is per loading time, and T per_comp is per computation time on per loaded data. Since per loaded data has the same amount, and none of them exceeds the memory storage, it seems natural to limit both T per_load and T per_comp to a constant bound for a fixed algorithm, i.e O 1\, and T comp is      q q k O O O k    1 1  Therefore, for a fixed big data analytics job represented by p-DOT model, the computation cost of phase q is O  k q arly as desired  Lemma 3.2  For a fixed big data analytics job represented by p-DOT model, the communication cost of phase q \(q p\ is O\(max\(n q n q+1   Proof Consider the communication of phase q  q p  which is 34 


             1 1 1 1 1 1  2  1   2 2  2 1  2  1 2  1 1  1 1 1  2  1   2 2  2 1  2  1 2  1 1  1 2 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 p p p p p p q q p p p p p p q q n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n q q q t t t t t t t t t D o D o t t t t t t t t t o o o D D T O D 9 Formula \(9\ is concluded by formula \(4\ and definition 3.1 where q q O D is intermediate computation results, and operator t i,j  do message passing on result  i i D o from worker o i to worker o j  Thus, for theoretical aspects, the communication of phase q  is multiplication between a n q dimensional vector DO and a n q n q+1 ordinary matrix T Based on matrix theory, it is easy to find that the communication contains n q n q+1 multiplications and n q+1  n q 1\ additions. As multiplications and additions are respectively executed on n q and n q+1 workers in parallel almost simultaneously, the communication cost is                1 1 1 1 1  max 1             q q q q q q q q q q n n O n O n O n n n O n n n O  For practical aspects, since n q workers send message in parallel n q+1 workers receive message in parallel, and each worker can both send and receive message at the same time, the time taken for communication is T comm O  max  n q n q+1  Therefore, for a fixed big data analytics job represented by p-DOT model, the communication cost of phase q  q p s O  max  n q n q+1 clearly, as desired  Theorem 3  Performance Evaluation Theory  For a fixed big data analytics job represented by p-DOT model on a fixed workload, the cost function is T=O\(w/n + n p, where w is the size of input, n is the number of machines, and p is the phases Proof Based on Lemma 3.1 and 3.2, the cost function of all phases q  q 1 p   c a n be  e xpr e ssed a s fo l l o w s                                   p q q q t q q q q q q q q q p q q q q p q comm comp p q t per t n n w O T n O n n O and n w O k O definition to due n n and workload fixed a in is m m n w k n n O k O T T T T 1 cos 1 1 1 1 1 cos _ cos  max 1  4 max  constant  1  max 10 And since per input to any machine be substantially sublinear to the size of input in any phase q, we can conclude that     1 1   2       q q q q n w O n w O q q Otherwise, if not desired, we can adjust parameter n q i.e. increase or decrease the number of workers in phase q make the equation true. Besides, it is reasonable that O  n 1  O  n and w 1  w due to definition 3.2 thus    p n n w O p n n w O n n w O T p q q q t          1 1 1 cos 11 Therefore, for a fixed big data analytics job represented by p-DOT model on a fixed workload, the cost function is T  O  w  n  n  p as desired  Corollary 3.1  For a fixed big data analytics job represented by p-DOT model on a fixed workload, the optimal number of machines is near-linear to the square root of input size  Proof Consider the cost function certified in Theorem 3 which is T  O  w  n  n  p For a fixed input size, function T  will only relate to parameter n since parameter p is constant in a fixed big data analytics job, i.e T  n  O  w  n  n And it is easy to find the minimum, which is    min    min     2  0  0 is n T w O n when is n T n O n w O when b a if only and if holds equality ab b a b a           12 Therefore, the optimal number of machines is near-linear to the square root of input size, as desired  Corollary 3.2  For a fixed big data analytics job represented by p-DOT model on a fixed workload, if the input size is enlarged k 2 times, the corresponding optimal number of machines should be expanded O\(k\ times Proof Consider the optimal number certified in Corollary 3.2, which is   w O n  When w is enlarged k 2 times, the new optimal number is       n k O w O k O w k O w k O n        2  Therefore, the optimal number of machines would be expanded O  k times when the input size is enlarged k 2 times, as desired  C  Discussion Big data analytics, is aiming for high throughput which demands that large distributed systems ìscale outî by continuously adding computing and storage resources through networks. To describe this key feature, the cost function of p-DOT model extracts only two parameters for a fixed algorithm and workload, i.e w the size of input\ and n the number of machines\. The graph of function is an open-up curve with a vertex   w O n  at the lowest point and increases in either direction. Meaning that for a fixed input size w is constant\, the optimal number of machines is near-linear to the square root of input size, if there are not enough resources   w O n  we can add machines to reduce the execution time; but we cannot add too much machines since excessive machines   w O n   will bring large amount of communication overheads. Moreover, as the optimal number of machines would be expanded O  k imes when the input size is enlarged k 2 times, we can perform a qualitative prediction on the number of resources necessary according to the existing results 35

The operating system is Linux 2.6.15, and the programs were executed on a weekend when the CPUs, disks, and network were relatively idle The input for wordcount and terasort are generated by GridMix [2 a n d T e r a S o r t  22 be nc hm a r k r e s p ec t i v el y   And five different amounts of dataset are chosen in test, they are 0.25GB, 6.25GB, 25GB, 625GB and 2500GB \(nearly 2.5TB B  Evaluation We conduct various experiments to find the optimal number of workers to each input size of two programs. For the dataset varying from 0.25GB to 625GB, the programs use only one processor per machine to avoid I/O interference within a node; while for the 2.5TB dataset, the programs have to use two processors per machine since there are not enough physical machines available in our queue. Thus, the number of workers is actually the number of work processes Fig. 2 and Fig.3 presents how elapsed time changed with the number of workers on three different input sizes. It is obvious that all the curves are open-up with a vertex at the lowest point and increases in either direction. Meaning that there indeed exist the optimal number of workers for a fixed input size and either too much or too little workers are not the better resource utilization Table I shows the optimal number of workers to different input size of two programs, and calculates their expansion ratio using value in same row second column as a standard in Table II. For example, value 25 in the second row third column presents that 6.25GB dataset is 25 times larger than 0.25GB dataset, and value 2.5 in the fourth row third column presents that the optimal number of 6.25GB dataset on program wordcount is 2.5 times bigger than that of 0.25GB dataset Fig.4 graphs the expansion ratio of optimal number of workers to different input size according to Table 3. It shows that although there are certain deviations, the curves of both programs are with close to linear, which not only quite matches our expectations \(Corollary 3.1\but also can further perform a qualitative prediction on the number of workers needed for a larger input size  36

It reveals the basis and principles of computation and communication behavior for big data analytics jobs, and can be used as a bridging model between various big data analytics applications and different underlying software frameworks. Besides, we have certified that any processing diagram expressed in DOT model or BSP model can be represented by p-DOT model \(Theorem 1 and the processing paradigm of p-DOT model is scalable and fault-tolerance \(Theorem 2\reover, considering the I/O behavior, we have provided the cost function of p-DOT model Theorem 3\ implying that the optimal number of machines is near-linear to the square root of input size for a fixed algorithm and workload \(Corollary 3.1\ and would be expanded O  k  times when the input size is enlarged k 2 times \(Corollary 3.2 Our future work has two directions: a\ we will study the efficiency model for big data analytics by exploiting the benefits from the p-DOT model; b\ under the guidance of the p-DOT model, we will design and implement some more efficient algorithms in the area of data mining A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(Grant No.61033009, No 61133005 and No. 61303047\.

 Fig. 10. Complementarity Analysis forSMTCL and Dalian Guangyang  V. CONCLUSIONS  This paper provides a method based on text mining of patents to help extract technology intelligence to facilitate M&A. We take the NCS industry as an example. NCS is the most important part of numerical machine tools. The paper follows a technology forecasting approach and outlines a technology synergy analysis based on a multi-term Boolean search to distinguish NCS records This study has a few limitations. Some doubt remains regarding the reliability of patent data. Sometimes patent data cannot reflect the core techno logy of a company because some patent-based indicators could be obscured by strategic behavior; that is, sometimes an emerging technology is not yet permitted for patenting. Another limitation is that the latest patent data we studied are2 years old because of the 18-month patent application period. In the meantime, some changes in NCS-related technology may well have occurred Within these limitations, the paper sought to forecast developmental trends for key candidate technologies, and based on the technology trends revealed, look for technology acquisition candidates for a certain company  The technology forecasting results suggest that NCS has become a global research hotspot in the field of machine tools in recent years, and patents have reached increased significance in corporate activity. The analysis of country-topic correlation leads us to conclude that there are two research clusters in the wo rld, one centered in Japan and the USA, the other centered on Germany. While China is geographically far away from th e other countries, it has only a faint relationship with Japan and Taiwan; in this relationship the key words are ìcontrol,îìsignalî and compatibility,î which are differe nt from other countries and do not represent NCS core technology. In addition publication keywords correlation analysis also indicates that control system is a current research hotspot and focus  We then examine the top patent applicants and top publication institutions. As shown, the top patent applicants are mainly Japanese and German corporations, while top publication institutions mainly come from China and the USA. This divergence is logical since the nature of patents and publications is different in that patents focus on applications whereas literature researches theories and methods At the same time, we find that Japanese corporations are powerful in the NCS machine tool industry. Hence we choose the companies FANUC and MITS UBISHI as study targets Comparing SMTCL with them, based on IPC analysis, we observe that G05B19 is the main weaknessóincidentally this is a part of the NCS core technology Looking at SMTCLís M&A history shows us that M&A did increase their patent portfolio and business income. We also learn that SMTCL is be hind the leading NCS-related companies in patenting, although itís number 1among machine tool enterprises in the world. To make up for its weaknesses, we search for some technology acquisition candidates for SMTCL. We first download all patents related to the technology where SMTCL is lacking. Then we develop a patent filter to select a list of companies as potential targets We analyze the targetsí respective patent portfolios, filtering out all but 3 companies. Finally, we measure the technology synergy among the 3 companies, and analyze the similarity and complementarity between the targets and SMTCL In conclusion, we have grasped the development trends of some candidate technologies by patent data and find the disadvantages of SMTCL. To compensate for the disadvantages, we look for technology candidates for SMTCL M&A. In this paper, we have measured the knowledge relatedness to judge the matching degree between SMTCL and the candidates using patent data, whereas we havenít done due diligence to make sure the core researchers still work for the target company.

attention on due diligence in considering an actual acquisition. In addition, there are many other factors besides technologies to consider for M&A. Future research might well investigate historical patterns of technological, business and financial factors together as predictors of M&A success  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS  This research was undertaken at Georgia Tech and Beijing Institute of Technology drawi ng on support from the National Science Foundation \(NSF\hrough the Science of Science Policy Program ñ ìMeasuring and Tracking Research Knowledge Integrationî \(G eorgia Tech; Award No 0830207\d the National Science Foundation of China Young Funds \(Beijing Institute of Technology; Award No 71103015\.

As the thickest shielding studied in this work is 10 cm, it follows then that the lower energies of the incident trapped proton spectra are most affected Additionally, although the incident trapped proton spectra reach energies of up to approximately 600 MeV, the majority of the spectra are dominated by low energy protons and are thus strongly attenuated by the shielding Essentially, the increased shielding thickness has the effect of hardening the incident proton flux distribution. This result also helps explain the significant localized shielding dependencies observed in the TR model development Comparatively, the GCR spectrum includes heavy ions that reach well above GeV energies. Consequently, GCR ions can undergo spallation and fragmentation with the aluminum shielding resulting in the ejection of large amounts of nucleons and lighter ions. All these secondary particles will have energies lower than the primary incident ions but that are still quite large. In addition to this is the sheer abundance of heavy ions present in the primary and secondary flux distributions. With increasing wall thicknesses, the likelihood of spallation, fragmentation, and other resonance effects increases as well. These processes favor the increase in proton and alpha particle fluxes at low energies with thicker shielding. Above the transition points the various flux distributions decrease with increasing wall thickness suggesting they are populated by a combination of high-energy incident protons and alpha particles that penetrate through the shielding as well as heavy ions that release secondary protons and alpha particles. These fluxes will fall off, however, with the shielding thickness as the likelihood of penetration decreases Overall, when the GCR- and TR-induced distributions are summed together, the neutron component and proton component dominate the flux distribution at low energies At higher energies, the protons represent the dominant contributor to the total dose. Furthermore, at very high energies, alpha particles start to become more dominant than neutrons and their abundance becomes comparable to that of the protons. Table 6 and Table 7 detail the calculated ambient dose equivalent rates, effective dose equivalent rates and E/H  10\ios for trapped protons and GCR ions at solar maximum and minimum conditions, and for the four wall thicknesses As is detailed in Table 6, the simulated TR-induced daily ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates decrease with increasing wall thickness. The simulated values are also smaller at solar maximum conditions relative to solar minimum as expected. Next, it is useful to benchmark the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates against the TEPC dose equivalent measurements collected in 2000 and 2009 to verify the assumption that H TEPC  is approximately H  10\d moreover, to verify that the first order approximation provided by Eq. \(9\ is reasonable. The year 2000 coincides with solar maximum conditions and during this time, the ISS orbited at an altitude of 372 km to 396 km. In contrast, the year 2009 represents solar minimum conditions and the ISS orbited at an altitude of 340 km to 380 km. The measured TEPC daily dose equivalent rates at the location of Service Module Panel 327 SM-327\ged between 0.15 \226 0.2 mSv d 1 in 2000 and 0.2 \226 0.3 mSv d 1 in 2009. Comparatively, for solar maximum conditions, the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates were found to be as low as 0.094 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2  to as high as 0.42 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 hese simulated values are within a factor of two of the measured values Similarly, at solar minimum conditions, the simulated results ranged from 0.14 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 wall thickness\ 0.85 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 wall thickness\hich 


14   are again within the range of measured results, though the thinnest shielding results in a slightly more conservative estimate that is within a factor of 3. It is thus noted that a change in wall thickness does have a significant influence on the TR-induced doses. While it is unclear which of the results best approximates the ISS shielding, it is argued that the upper and lower limits of the shielding thicknesses used provide representative limits of the expected dose The simulated TR-induced effective dose equivalent rate determined by Sato et al 53 a t so l a r  mi ni mu m c o nd i t i o n s   for a wall thickness of 5.56 cm \(15 g cm 2 uminum, was estimated to be 0.144 mSv d 1 In that study, fluence-toeffective dose equivalent conversion factors for all heavy ions were used. To compare, at 10.8 g cm 2 in our study the simulated effective dose equivalent was determined to be 0.187 mSv d 1 For a wall thickness of 16.2 g cm 2 the effective dose equivalent rate was determined to be 0.127 mSv d 1 These simulated values are in good agreement with the values presented by Sato et al  d i n di cat e s t h at  the majority of the effective dose equivalent due to TR exposure is reasonably estimated considering only the neutron, proton, and alpha particle contributions. The simulated ratios of E  H  10\uctuate from 0.41 up to 0.51 for solar maximum conditions and 0.35 to 0.48 for solar minimum conditions. This ratio also appears to fall off with decreasing wall thickness. Overall, the latter results suggest that for TR exposures, the TEPC measured ambient dose equivalent offers a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent Unlike the daily TR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates, the predicted GCR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates increase with increasing wall thickness Table 7\This results due to the increased neutron, proton and alpha particle flux distributions at low energies. As expected, the daily ambient dose equivalent rates and effective dose equivalent rates are again smaller at solar maximum conditions as compared to solar minimum conditions. The measured GCR dose equivalent values in 2000 and 2009 are on the order of 300 to 400 \265Sv d 1 and 400 to 500 \265Sv d 1 respectively. In comparison, the simulated values range from 60 \265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 8 265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar maximum conditions and 100 265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 o 206 \265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar minimum conditions. These predicted values underestimate the measured ones by more than a factor of two. This can be attributed to the exclusion of the heavy-ion contributions Moreover, these results also suggest that as an operational quantity, the ambient dose equivalent is not well suited for high-energy heavy ions. This observation has also been previously suggested by Pelliccioni h o i n di cat ed t h a t  a depth greater than 10 mm would be more appropriate for higher-energy radiation and that no single depth is appropriate for all heavy ions Sato et al  o calcu late d th e eff ect iv e dos e equiv ale nt rate from GCR exposures \(including heavy ions\for a wall thickness of 15.0 g cm 2 Al to be 0.21 mSv d 1 At solar minimum conditions, the simulated effective dose equivalent rates in this study are found to be 0.13 mSv d 1  and 0.15 mSv d 1 for wall thicknesses of 10.8 g cm 2 and 16.2 g cm 2 respectively. As was the case earlier, there is again a slight discrepancy regards to those published by Sato et al 53 attrib u t ed to th e ex clu s io n o f th e h e a v y io n s   It was shown by Sato [53 th at th e co n t rib u tio n to t h e cumulative effective dose equivalent from both iron nuclei and pions are each nearly as much as the contribution alpha particles. Despite these underestimations, from the current simulations the ratios of effective-to-ambient dose equivalent are relatively constant between solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. Furthermore, unlike TR exposures, the ratios decrease from 1.19 to 0.84 with increasing shielding thickness. These results suggest that the ambient dose equivalent is roughly a 1:1 estimate of the effective dose equivalent for GCR exposures, depending on which wall thickness is assumed. However, it is again noted that the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates are underestimated so these ratios should fall below one These latter conclusions can also be verified in another manner. The total effective dose equivalent estimated by Sato et al 53 in sid e th e ISS at so lar m i n i m u m co n d itio n s   was determined to be 0.37 mSv d 1 The total dose equivalent from TR and GCR exposures measured with the TEPC at SM-327 during solar minimum conditions \(2009 is approximately 0.6 \226 0.8 mSv d 1 The ratio of the effective dose equivalent predicted by Sato to these measured TEPC values results in an effective-to-TEPC dose equivalent conversion factor of E  H TEPC of 0.5 to 0.6. This again shows that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent and can be used as an appropriate surrogate protection quantity. This conclusion is applicable to solar maximum conditions as it was shown in the simulation results that for TR exposures the E  H  10\ios are only slightly higher at solar maximum conditions and essentially remain unchanged for GCR exposures from solar maximum to solar minimum 4.6 \226 Complex Geometry Results The above transport simulations at solar minimum conditions and for wall thicknesses of 5.4 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2 were repeated using the complex geometry shown in Figure 16. Rather than determining the flux inside the entire SM, the flux distribution within the crew quarter \(SM-CQ was examined only. This area best approximates the location of SM-327. When compared to the simple cylinder simulations, the complex geometry is shown to have no effect on the simulated E  H  10\version ratios but does influence the observed ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates. The simulated values for trapped exposures are largely unchanged while for GCR exposures, the complex geometry results in a factor of two increase due to the build-up effect. Specifically, at a wall thickness of 5.4 g cm 2 the simulated ambient and effective 


15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
