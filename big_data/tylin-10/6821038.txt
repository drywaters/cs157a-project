1 Background 
Cloud Computing is a kind of implementation vir the Internet anytime, anywhere and on-demand access to a shared resource pool of computing model. Shared pool of resources includes computing facilities, storage devices, and applications and so on 1  NIST defines four types of cloud computing deployment models: public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud and community cloud 2  In a hybrid cloud model, basic IT resources belong to different institutions, organizations or individuals. Different 
institutions, organizations or individuals may have different resource management strategies, different types of resources and services used. In order to eliminate these isomers, the establishment of a comprehensive and complete resource management model to manage the hybrid IaaS cloud platform inside and outside of basic IT resources configuration, flow and integration, is very necessary  In recent years, compared with the use of private cloud or public cloud alone in the problems of utilizing cloud services efficiency, convenience and elasticity, people have begun to realize hybrid IaaS cloud platform has a natural advantage Hybrid IaaS cloud environment, however, there are still many problems need to be resolved, such as when basic IT resources allocate flow in different institutions, organizations or individuals ,it faces with the problem of resource scheduling 
This paper adopts AHP model to solve basic IT resource scheduling strategy problem under the hybrid cloud environment, and introduce the SLA mechanism to ensure the QoS of the user 
 
Basic resources in the cloud computing is heterogeneous geographically distributed, especially in the hybrid cloud platform, this heterogeneous degree is more deeply, but  cloud computing need to integrate these resources through virtualization technology to deliver services to outside Therefore, the mechanism on the basics of the principle of operational research is an effective solution to the scheduling problem. Such dynamic ,coordinate mechanism is appropriate for cloud resource. Resource scheduling is a NP problem, and a

operation and laws of the market, have the different roles in cloud computing deals respectively defined as cloud resource providers, consumers, and the cloud bank \(CB\ which come from one or more different cloud \(private cloud , public cloud or community cloud\under the premise that retain their own characteristics, framework by standardized or proprietary technology to bind together to form the overall, so that the best interests of all parties involved to get,  a hybrid cloud architecture. The resource transaction management model is mainly divided into the following five layers: physical resource pool, service level agreement \(SLA\l, risk resistance resource scheduling, pricing strategy. The following will mainly introduce CB-SLA pool and resource scheduling 1 9 
 
CB-SLA pool To make the cloud bank born can provide more high quality 
IT services than other cloud model, how to guarantee QoS is the most important and it urgent need a good solution. SLA is the best tool to describe QoS parameters, which involves the level of availability, service capabilities, performance, operation and other service attributes, such as bookkeeping. Cloud Bank SLA is designed using a formal way to capture service agreement in a cloud bank environment   All of the information described above can be measured and converted to the standard available information by CB-SLA system. In the cloud banks, SLA system is no longer just the traditional sense of a tool to protect the quality of service, but rather an information conversion, collection, sorting and delivery systems. CB-SLA is an essential part of the cloud bank

and supports the other components in the cloud banks properly and smoothly running  2 9 Resource allocation In the field of distributed computing, how to effectively schedule resources between computing nodes and at the same time gurantee QoS is a traditional problem. For this NP-hard problem, currently there is not a universal solution that applies to all distributed scenario. In order to meet the demand of resource consumers, this paper adopts the resource scheduling strategy based on AHP model to effectively conveniently schedule basic computing resources in the cloud bank environment Resource providers are also known as resource producers and the requestors of initiating resources and service requirements are called resource consumers in the cloud bank environment. Cloud bank model components include consumers, resource user agent \(CCA\ cloud bank \(CB\, the resource provider agent \(CRA\ producers CCA accept the resource application task from consumers upload the task to the cloud bank, and instead of consumers and cloud bank to establish the SLA agreements. These SLA agreements need to include the task ending time, QoS attributes and other parameters. CRA accept the task application that producers put its own resources into the cloud bank, and quantify and pricing, then instead of producers signed SLA agreements with the cloud bank, and utilize the SLA agreements registering resource price, resource execution efficiency and the waiting time of resource scheduling and other parameters into the cloud bank In the big environment of cloud bank, the SLA agreement is established between resource consumers and the cloud bank These SLA agreements need to include the task ending time QoS attributes and other parameters. The SLA agreement is also established between resource producers and the cloud bank utilizing the SLA agreements registering resource price resource execution efficiency and the waiting time of resource scheduling and other parameters into the cloud bank. The resources are also producers SLA agreements with cloud banks to establish and use SLA agreement will perform resource prices and resource efficiency and resource scheduling parameters such as the waiting time when registered into the cloud bank. So how to utilize these parameters, allocate the best resource for the user, to achieve the optimal combination matching, and on this basis, make the total task ending time shortest? Here we present AHP model Analytic Hierarchy Process Model \(referred AHP\ is a simple, flexible and practical multi-criteria decision making model, proposed by an American operational researcher professor T.L.Saaty in the early 1970s. The decision problem is divided into three levels: the object layer 0, criterion layer C solution layer P. Each layer has a number of elements, the relationship between the elements of each layer is connected with the straight line. Though mutual comparison we can determine the weight of each criterion to the object, and the weight of each solution to each criterion. The above two sets of weights are integrated to determine the weight of each solution to the object, to select the maximum weight value as the best solutions of the object. AHP let qualitative analysis and quantitative analysis combine to complete the above steps, the quantitative results are given to the decision problem  Below is a selection model of tourist sites: how to choose the best destination in three destinations according to scenery fees, housing, diet and other factors The AHP model can also be used for resource scheduling in cloud computing According to the SLA agreement of resource consumers and parameters of the CPU, memory, disk storage, bandwidth I/0 devices, determine the preference relationship of resource consumers to each parameter \(preference data given below is changed from qualitative into quantitative nd acco rding to the SLA agreement of resource providers, determine the preference relationship of the virtual computing node preference relationship to each parameter. Then establish AHP model Regard resource consumer demands as the object layer O Regard the parameter CPU, the memory, storage disks bandwidth, I/O device as the criterion layer C. Regard the virtual computing nodes   as the solution layer P Then for the object to find the best solution, that is scheduling the best resource for the userês needs First, according to the preference relations, conduct pairwise comparison between the elements of the criterion layer Comparing adopts the relative scale to build a pairwise comparison matrix compare the importance of each criterion    for the object O   At this point the matrix A is both a pairwise comparison matrix and a positive reciprocal matrix. The weight vector of to O is determined by matrix A The can be obtained however 7, so the matrix A is inconsistent. Solution for our re quirements, allow A inconsistent but need to meet the inconsistent allowable range Following let us investigate the case of fully consistent Suppose \002 002 002 so that 002 can be obtained

Fig.2  Tasks completion time comparision 
DataCenterBroker realize resource discovery and information interaction, is the core of the simulation scheduling, the proposed algorithm is implemented mainly in DataCenterBroker Experimental environment: utilize random simulator to get  form A, assigned tasks to five virtual computing nodes, change the number of tasks from 10 to 100, record the task completion time \(ms\ and compare with known GA algorithm Comparing two kinds of resource scheduling strategies, the results is shown as below As can be seen from figure 2, this paperês method makes the task completion time shorter. It shows that the AHP model is a good resource scheduling strategy In the cloud computing business model, the user's QoS has become extremely important, so to ensure the user's QoS, meet userês requirements, is a long-term solution of cloud computing The AHP model presented in this paper not only has the advantage of the natural ensuring userês QoS, but also has the advantage of distributed concurrent operation. Regardless of how many tasks, parameters, virtual computing nodes, task execution only can be divided into two steps under the AHP model. The first step is to calculate the weight time-consuming and the second step is the combination weights time-consuming Due to the structured paired comparison matrix is not ordinary matrix, it has great flexibility and regularity, simplifying the calculation, making the time complexity of algorithm greatly less than which will greatly reduces the task execution time. The AHP model also has the advantages of a clear structure and solving the problem of qualitative. Although maybe there are some gray reasons, causing preference relations deviation, generally speaking, the AHP model is an ideal resource scheduling strategy This paper is supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China 2010 \(No.61063044\ and by the laboratory in Software Engineering of Yunnan Province under Grant \(No.210KS05\.

partition element is written to its own separate le which allows a partition element to be ushed easily to disk as memory limitations demand     T Partition\(0, 0 Partition\(0, 1 Partition\(1, 1 Partition\(1, 0 A B C a c b         Fig 4 Splitting an unstructured 2D lattice The shaded triangles in b show the borrowed triangles within each cell group Figure 4a shows a lattice representation for a 2D dataset before it was split and gure 4b shows the same dataset after it has been split into separate partition elements The shaded triangles in 4\(b shows the borrowed triangles within each cell group B Cell Groups Each partition element corresponds to a cell group which maintains the set of cells that intersect that particular partition element Each cell group contains the vertex information and data for cells that are contained within that cell group The data for cells that span the partition boundary are treated differently C Owned and Borrowed Cells Partitioning datasets into chunks can cause difìculties when cells span partition boundaries It is desirable to make each partition self-sufìcient but duplicating data between partitions is an unattractive option for large datasets Our solution to this problem is a compromise in which the vertex coordinates for all intersecting cells is stored in each partitionês cell list but the data associated with the cell vertices is stored in only one partition This partition is called the owner of the cell All cells have exactly one owner Partitions that intersect with a cell that is owned by another partition are referred to as borrowers of the cell A cell may have any number of borrowers always one less than the number of partitions it intersects with A cell that has no borrowers is entirely contained within its owner partition Borrowed cells are represented on disk using only the vertex indices necessary for representing the cell and an identiìer that denotes the owner partition and position in the owner cell list Since all cells have exactly one owner the data associated with the cell need only be stored once Scientiìc datasets may contain a large number of attributes for each point so this can result in signiìcant space savings over a full duplication method Looking at gure 4c we see the triangular cell T overlaps cell groups A B and C The IndexSpaceID for cell group A will have the smallest coordinates in each dimension compared to B and C and is therefore chosen to be the owner of the cell All the information pertaining to T including the cell vertex and data values will be recorded in cell group A Subsequently when T is represented in B and C it is recorded as a borrowed cell so these cell groups will refer to A for complete information about T D In Memory Subgrids A subgrid is a further partitioning of each partition element stored on disk and is used to further accelerate search for cells when they are stored in memory Figure 5 shows the subgrid partitioning of a partition element The datum query can be more quickly resolved due to the much smaller number of triangles intersecting the relevant subgrid partitioning element  Partition 0, 0 0, 1 0, 2 0, 3 2, 0 2, 1 2, 3 3, 0 4, 0 3, 1 4, 1 3, 2 4, 2 3, 3 4, 3   Partition\(0,  2 Partition\(2, 3 Partition\(3,  2  Subgrid Partitioning Datum Query Point  Partition\(3, 3 Partition\(0, 3 Fig 5 A datum query showing subgrid partitioning within a partition element The extra space created is the size of the borrowed cells le and the owned and borrowed subgrid data that are written to disk E Storage Model Spatial datasets must ultimately be represented as one dimensional les on disk or a similar storage device A storage model describes how the n dimensional domain of the dataset is mapped to the one dimensional le space Some le formats can be described using the rod storage model  which views les as a collection of rods  where each rod is a sequence of elements that are contiguous in both the n dimensional data space and the one dimensional le space  F o r e xample the rasters of a r a w image le can be considered rods if the image le is stored in the usual linear order Since the elements of a rod are contiguous on disk they can be accessed with a single read operation When fulìlling a subblock query the query region can be broken into a collection of rod subsets which each conceptually represent a single read operation 223 


F Merged File Format Our previous work applies the IAP caching mechanism to les that t the rod storage model including both linear and chunked les The major moti v ation of the w ork described here is to t unstructured data to the rod storage model which allows a series of adjacent elements to be read from le in a single read transaction In doing so we can once again achieve very signiìcant gains in performance by taking advantage of prior knowledge of the access pattern Merging the data into a single le helps us take advantage of lesystem prefetching  which is only ef fecti v e when reading from a single le Merging the cell groups into a single le also improves the locality of reference in the one dimensional le space on disk Thus we merge the cell groups created from the splitting phase back into a single le We create a merged le format with a preamble that maintains meta data about the cell groups stored in the data section using the rod storage model Meta data information includes cell group offsets  cell group size  record size  number of elds and dimensionality information for each cell group The preamble can be read into memory providing the Granite system with a description of the complete dataset A future possibility during the merging process may be to use space lling curve for merging the cell groups into a single one dimensional le V P REFETCHING Prefetching has long been used to speed up execution both at the system and application level Over the years the computing community have tried to improve system throughput by integrating prefetching into hardware and software systems 5 The lesystem cache also prefetches pages following an explicitly accessed page in the hope that the prefetched page will be accessed next and reads to disk will be reduced However lesystem prefetching will increase the number of inappropriate pages loaded when the user does not proceed through the le in the manner the lesystem predicts which degrades performance Our application level caching mechanism reconciles the user access pattern with lesystem prefetching allowing it to work much more effectively to boost performance A Iteration Aware Prefetching The speed of data retrieval from disk suffers when data is accessed in a manner different from how the data is stored The underlying le structure is one dimensional and data is stored mostly contiguously on disk If the physical le is accessed sequentially the lesystem cache performs quite well When the data is not accessed sequentially performance degrades quickly Several reads may be required for portions of a le that are neighbors in the data space but not in the one dimensional le space Iterator Aware Prefetching is a prefetching approach applicable to situations in which the access pattern is not data dependent and can be known in advance An iterator describes the access pattern and also performs the iteration through the data space Because of this prior knowledge provided by the iterator we can conìgure a cache that uses n dimensional cache blocks with a shape tuned to the iteration Because of this block shape data is never loaded more than once into an IAP cache assuming the iterator is used to determine the access pattern B Access Pattern and Cache Blocks When we create a cache block for use with unstructured data we use one or more slices of the iteration space A slice is formed by cutting the space with a plane orthogonal to a speciìed slice axis  The dimensionality of the resulting slice matches the dimensionality of the dataset but has a thickness of one in the slice dimension In order to create a cache block shape that performs well when used with a particular iterator we choose a slice axis that is also the least frequently changing axis of the axis ordering associated with the iterator see section III-H The position of the iterator is monotonically increasing on this axis so the iterator is certain never to revisit a slice once it has left it Data in a cache block is therefore never loaded more than once Such a scheme cannot work with unstructured data unless we can quickly and efìciently load the cells corresponding to a slice of the iteration space Because the merged data format described in section IV-F makes this possible we can work with the index space formed by the lattice partitioning instead of slicing the geometric data space That is cache blocks will consist of collections of partition elements each containing a cell group and associated data Better yet whole sequences of partition elements can be read with a single transaction because the rod storage model applies to the merged data format Visiting or accessing partition elements in a row by row fashion is referred to as row-wise access This is synonymous with using a  0,1  axis ordering for a two dimensional iteration The overall behavior of an iterator with a column-wise ordering  1,0   is largely similar For the three dimensional case however a slice will be synonymous with a plane After the rst row of elements is loaded into the cache an iteratorês data requirements would be satisìed from the cache for several rows of the iteration assuming the spacing of the iteratorês rows is much smaller than the height of a partition element Eventually a new row of the iteration will be started which falls outside of the rst row of partition elements This triggers a cache miss which causes the second row of elements to be loaded into the cache The rst row will not be needed again during the iteration which will proceed in similar fashion until complete C Different User Ordering and Storage Ordering Consider the diagram shown in gure 6a where the userês ordering and storage ordering are similar In this case the cache prefetches data in the order it was stored and is guaranteed to satisfy datum iteration queries Moreover we can take advantage of the lesystem cache as the data is contiguous spatially and in the one dimensional le When the userês 224 


ordering is different from the storage ordering as shown in gure 6b performance will be poor for a datum iteration query that accesses the data in a column order fashion We remedy this problem by prefetching the data using the storage ordering and the cache data will be tuned to the iteration  Storage Ordering Datum Query a b Fig 6 a Access ordering of datum query and storage ordering  0,1  b Access ordering  1,0  and storage ordering  0,1  D Out of Core Prefetching The lattice layer like the datasource layer uses an out of core approach to data access loading only necessary subsets of the larger data volume This capability is made possible by the partitioning and owned and borrowed cell information Because of this we can greatly reduce the amount of memory needed at one time by only prefetching cell groups that will actually be used in satisfying user query Available memory does not limit the size of the datasets that our system can handle VI R ESULTS We perform our tests on a 64bit Linux machine running Linux version 2.6.18 with Intel Xeon R  processors with 16 cores each running at 2.4GHz The system has 24GB of memory but our system used a maximum of only 1.6GB We perform our tests using a dataset of 15GB for the two dimensional dataset and 25GB for the three dimensional dataset We generate 2D and 3D unstructured datasets using a seeded random number generator to simulate the vertex points The vertices lies within a domain space of 0.0 to 1.0 The delaunay triangulation is performed with the open source software qhull  The 2D dataset contains o v e r 3 1 million tetrahedra and over 67 million tetrahedra in the 3D dataset We clear the lesystem cache after each run to ensure fairness across runs The results presented are an average of at least three runs We perform datum query iterations using a partitioning of varying dimensions and perform the datum query tests using separate partition les the merged le and the caching mechanism on top of the merged le We use several iteration orderings for the 2D and 3D tests We use orderings  0,1  and  1,0  for the 2D partitioning and  0,1,2  and  2,1,0  for the 3D partitioning 0 1500 3000 4500 6000 Reorganized Merged Cache 100x100 Partitioning Row wise access Column wise access Seconds 0 500 1000 1500 2000 Merged Cache 100x100 Partitioning Row wise access Column wise access Seconds a b Fig 7 Datum Iteration with a step of 0.01 and 100x100 partitioning 0 5000 10000 15000 20000 Reorganized Merged Cache 300x33 Partitioning Row wise access Column wise access Seconds 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 Merged Cache 300x33 Partitioning Row wise access Column wise access Seconds a b Fig 8 Datum Iteration with a step of 0.01 and 300x33 partitioning 0 7500 15000 22500 30000 Reorganized Merged Cache 33x300 Partitioning Row wise access Column wise access Seconds 0 500 1000 1500 2000 Merged Cache 33x300 Partitioning Row wise access Column wise access Seconds a b Fig 9 Datum Iteration with a step of 0.01 and 33x300 partitioning A Datum Query Iteration over 2D Files We perform datum queries using a two dimensional le with an equal sided partitioning of 100x100 and unequal sides 300x33 and 33x300 We use an 8x8 subgrid partitioning and a sampling density of 0.01 for the iteration i.e we query the domain space at every 0.01 interval Figures 7a 8a and 9a show our results for the 100x100 300x33 and 33x300 partitioning respectively Figures 7b 8b and 9b shows only the merged and cache portion of the results We perform datum queries using the separate partition les generated from the data reorganization the resulting merged le and the cache mechanism The merged le shows signiìcant gain in performance when compared to the reorganized data les both in the orderings  0,1  and  1,0   With the row wise access it takes about 97 minutes to iterate over the reorganized les and about 31 minutes for the merged le using the 100x100 partitioning The cache performs far better as it takes about 6 minutes for 225

knowledge of the userês access pattern and leads to signiìcant gains in performance An obvious avenue for future work is to explore the effect of ordering partitions using a space lling curve rather than the linear order we currently use Though this organization will be slower for some types of iteration we expect that it will yield acceptable performance in all cases perhaps making it a good default choice for organizing the partitions Our current implementation assumes that the data resides locally but we expect to extend the system to handle remote datasets that span several geographically distributed machines Having prior information about the performance of remote servers may allow the partitioning mechanism to improve load balancing Correspondingly we would like to extend our replica location and selection mechanisms 29 28 to handle very large distributed unstructured spatial datasets The work described here will be instrumental in these future efforts VIII A

 Fig. 10. Complementarity Analysis forSMTCL and Dalian Guangyang  V. CONCLUSIONS  This paper provides a method based on text mining of patents to help extract technology intelligence to facilitate M&A. We take the NCS industry as an example. NCS is the most important part of numerical machine tools. The paper follows a technology forecasting approach and outlines a technology synergy analysis based on a multi-term Boolean search to distinguish NCS records This study has a few limitations. Some doubt remains regarding the reliability of patent data. Sometimes patent data cannot reflect the core techno logy of a company because some patent-based indicators could be obscured by strategic behavior; that is, sometimes an emerging technology is not yet permitted for patenting. Another limitation is that the latest patent data we studied are2 years old because of the 18-month patent application period. In the meantime, some changes in NCS-related technology may well have occurred Within these limitations, the paper sought to forecast developmental trends for key candidate technologies, and based on the technology trends revealed, look for technology acquisition candidates for a certain company  The technology forecasting results suggest that NCS has become a global research hotspot in the field of machine tools in recent years, and patents have reached increased significance in corporate activity. The analysis of country-topic correlation leads us to conclude that there are two research clusters in the wo rld, one centered in Japan and the USA, the other centered on Germany. While China is geographically far away from th e other countries, it has only a faint relationship with Japan and Taiwan; in this relationship the key words are ìcontrol,îìsignalî and compatibility,î which are differe nt from other countries and do not represent NCS core technology. In addition publication keywords correlation analysis also indicates that control system is a current research hotspot and focus  We then examine the top patent applicants and top publication institutions. As shown, the top patent applicants are mainly Japanese and German corporations, while top publication institutions mainly come from China and the USA. This divergence is logical since the nature of patents and publications is different in that patents focus on applications whereas literature researches theories and methods At the same time, we find that Japanese corporations are powerful in the NCS machine tool industry. Hence we choose the companies FANUC and MITS UBISHI as study targets Comparing SMTCL with them, based on IPC analysis, we observe that G05B19 is the main weaknessóincidentally this is a part of the NCS core technology Looking at SMTCLís M&A history shows us that M&A did increase their patent portfolio and business income. We also learn that SMTCL is be hind the leading NCS-related companies in patenting, although itís number 1among machine tool enterprises in the world. To make up for its weaknesses, we search for some technology acquisition candidates for SMTCL. We first download all patents related to the technology where SMTCL is lacking. Then we develop a patent filter to select a list of companies as potential targets We analyze the targetsí respective patent portfolios, filtering out all but 3 companies. Finally, we measure the technology synergy among the 3 companies, and analyze the similarity and complementarity between the targets and SMTCL In conclusion, we have grasped the development trends of some candidate technologies by patent data and find the disadvantages of SMTCL. To compensate for the disadvantages, we look for technology candidates for SMTCL M&A. In this paper, we have measured the knowledge relatedness to judge the matching degree between SMTCL and the candidates using patent data, whereas we havenít done due diligence to make sure the core researchers still work for the target company.

As the thickest shielding studied in this work is 10 cm, it follows then that the lower energies of the incident trapped proton spectra are most affected Additionally, although the incident trapped proton spectra reach energies of up to approximately 600 MeV, the majority of the spectra are dominated by low energy protons and are thus strongly attenuated by the shielding Essentially, the increased shielding thickness has the effect of hardening the incident proton flux distribution. This result also helps explain the significant localized shielding dependencies observed in the TR model development Comparatively, the GCR spectrum includes heavy ions that reach well above GeV energies. Consequently, GCR ions can undergo spallation and fragmentation with the aluminum shielding resulting in the ejection of large amounts of nucleons and lighter ions. All these secondary particles will have energies lower than the primary incident ions but that are still quite large. In addition to this is the sheer abundance of heavy ions present in the primary and secondary flux distributions. With increasing wall thicknesses, the likelihood of spallation, fragmentation, and other resonance effects increases as well. These processes favor the increase in proton and alpha particle fluxes at low energies with thicker shielding. Above the transition points the various flux distributions decrease with increasing wall thickness suggesting they are populated by a combination of high-energy incident protons and alpha particles that penetrate through the shielding as well as heavy ions that release secondary protons and alpha particles. These fluxes will fall off, however, with the shielding thickness as the likelihood of penetration decreases Overall, when the GCR- and TR-induced distributions are summed together, the neutron component and proton component dominate the flux distribution at low energies At higher energies, the protons represent the dominant contributor to the total dose. Furthermore, at very high energies, alpha particles start to become more dominant than neutrons and their abundance becomes comparable to that of the protons. Table 6 and Table 7 detail the calculated ambient dose equivalent rates, effective dose equivalent rates and E/H  10\ios for trapped protons and GCR ions at solar maximum and minimum conditions, and for the four wall thicknesses As is detailed in Table 6, the simulated TR-induced daily ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates decrease with increasing wall thickness. The simulated values are also smaller at solar maximum conditions relative to solar minimum as expected. Next, it is useful to benchmark the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates against the TEPC dose equivalent measurements collected in 2000 and 2009 to verify the assumption that H TEPC  is approximately H  10\d moreover, to verify that the first order approximation provided by Eq. \(9\ is reasonable. The year 2000 coincides with solar maximum conditions and during this time, the ISS orbited at an altitude of 372 km to 396 km. In contrast, the year 2009 represents solar minimum conditions and the ISS orbited at an altitude of 340 km to 380 km. The measured TEPC daily dose equivalent rates at the location of Service Module Panel 327 SM-327\ged between 0.15 \226 0.2 mSv d 1 in 2000 and 0.2 \226 0.3 mSv d 1 in 2009. Comparatively, for solar maximum conditions, the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates were found to be as low as 0.094 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2  to as high as 0.42 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 hese simulated values are within a factor of two of the measured values Similarly, at solar minimum conditions, the simulated results ranged from 0.14 mSv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 wall thickness\ 0.85 mSv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 wall thickness\hich 


14   are again within the range of measured results, though the thinnest shielding results in a slightly more conservative estimate that is within a factor of 3. It is thus noted that a change in wall thickness does have a significant influence on the TR-induced doses. While it is unclear which of the results best approximates the ISS shielding, it is argued that the upper and lower limits of the shielding thicknesses used provide representative limits of the expected dose The simulated TR-induced effective dose equivalent rate determined by Sato et al 53 a t so l a r  mi ni mu m c o nd i t i o n s   for a wall thickness of 5.56 cm \(15 g cm 2 uminum, was estimated to be 0.144 mSv d 1 In that study, fluence-toeffective dose equivalent conversion factors for all heavy ions were used. To compare, at 10.8 g cm 2 in our study the simulated effective dose equivalent was determined to be 0.187 mSv d 1 For a wall thickness of 16.2 g cm 2 the effective dose equivalent rate was determined to be 0.127 mSv d 1 These simulated values are in good agreement with the values presented by Sato et al  d i n di cat e s t h at  the majority of the effective dose equivalent due to TR exposure is reasonably estimated considering only the neutron, proton, and alpha particle contributions. The simulated ratios of E  H  10\uctuate from 0.41 up to 0.51 for solar maximum conditions and 0.35 to 0.48 for solar minimum conditions. This ratio also appears to fall off with decreasing wall thickness. Overall, the latter results suggest that for TR exposures, the TEPC measured ambient dose equivalent offers a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent Unlike the daily TR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates, the predicted GCR effective and ambient dose equivalent rates increase with increasing wall thickness Table 7\This results due to the increased neutron, proton and alpha particle flux distributions at low energies. As expected, the daily ambient dose equivalent rates and effective dose equivalent rates are again smaller at solar maximum conditions as compared to solar minimum conditions. The measured GCR dose equivalent values in 2000 and 2009 are on the order of 300 to 400 \265Sv d 1 and 400 to 500 \265Sv d 1 respectively. In comparison, the simulated values range from 60 \265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 8 265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar maximum conditions and 100 265Sv d 1 5.4 g cm 2 o 206 \265Sv d 1 27.0 g cm 2 or solar minimum conditions. These predicted values underestimate the measured ones by more than a factor of two. This can be attributed to the exclusion of the heavy-ion contributions Moreover, these results also suggest that as an operational quantity, the ambient dose equivalent is not well suited for high-energy heavy ions. This observation has also been previously suggested by Pelliccioni h o i n di cat ed t h a t  a depth greater than 10 mm would be more appropriate for higher-energy radiation and that no single depth is appropriate for all heavy ions Sato et al  o calcu late d th e eff ect iv e dos e equiv ale nt rate from GCR exposures \(including heavy ions\for a wall thickness of 15.0 g cm 2 Al to be 0.21 mSv d 1 At solar minimum conditions, the simulated effective dose equivalent rates in this study are found to be 0.13 mSv d 1  and 0.15 mSv d 1 for wall thicknesses of 10.8 g cm 2 and 16.2 g cm 2 respectively. As was the case earlier, there is again a slight discrepancy regards to those published by Sato et al 53 attrib u t ed to th e ex clu s io n o f th e h e a v y io n s   It was shown by Sato [53 th at th e co n t rib u tio n to t h e cumulative effective dose equivalent from both iron nuclei and pions are each nearly as much as the contribution alpha particles. Despite these underestimations, from the current simulations the ratios of effective-to-ambient dose equivalent are relatively constant between solar maximum and solar minimum conditions. Furthermore, unlike TR exposures, the ratios decrease from 1.19 to 0.84 with increasing shielding thickness. These results suggest that the ambient dose equivalent is roughly a 1:1 estimate of the effective dose equivalent for GCR exposures, depending on which wall thickness is assumed. However, it is again noted that the simulated ambient dose equivalent rates are underestimated so these ratios should fall below one These latter conclusions can also be verified in another manner. The total effective dose equivalent estimated by Sato et al 53 in sid e th e ISS at so lar m i n i m u m co n d itio n s   was determined to be 0.37 mSv d 1 The total dose equivalent from TR and GCR exposures measured with the TEPC at SM-327 during solar minimum conditions \(2009 is approximately 0.6 \226 0.8 mSv d 1 The ratio of the effective dose equivalent predicted by Sato to these measured TEPC values results in an effective-to-TEPC dose equivalent conversion factor of E  H TEPC of 0.5 to 0.6. This again shows that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the effective dose equivalent and can be used as an appropriate surrogate protection quantity. This conclusion is applicable to solar maximum conditions as it was shown in the simulation results that for TR exposures the E  H  10\ios are only slightly higher at solar maximum conditions and essentially remain unchanged for GCR exposures from solar maximum to solar minimum 4.6 \226 Complex Geometry Results The above transport simulations at solar minimum conditions and for wall thicknesses of 5.4 g cm 2 and 27.0 g cm 2 were repeated using the complex geometry shown in Figure 16. Rather than determining the flux inside the entire SM, the flux distribution within the crew quarter \(SM-CQ was examined only. This area best approximates the location of SM-327. When compared to the simple cylinder simulations, the complex geometry is shown to have no effect on the simulated E  H  10\version ratios but does influence the observed ambient dose equivalent and effective dose equivalent rates. The simulated values for trapped exposures are largely unchanged while for GCR exposures, the complex geometry results in a factor of two increase due to the build-up effect. Specifically, at a wall thickness of 5.4 g cm 2 the simulated ambient and effective 


15   daily dose equivalents due to GCR exposure is found to be 2.03\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 2.31\32710 4 Sv d 1 respectively. For a wall thickness of 27.0 g cm 2 these values were determined to be 4.27\32710 4 Sv d 1 and 3.56\32710 4 Sv d 1 These results are consistent with the previous results in the sense the build-up from the adjacent modules will act in a similar manner as the increased shielding thickness in the simple cylinder simulations. This build-up effect is less significant for TR exposures. These results demonstrate that in addition to the distribution of shielding within any module, the geometry of the ISS itself also plays an important role. This exercise illustrates the complexity associated with the modelling of the radiation environment inside the ISS 5  S UMMARY  A semi-empirical model has been developed for possible use in radiation mission planning aboard the International Space Station \(ISS\his semi-empirical model is derived from operational data obtained with a tissue equivalent proportional counter \(TEPC\that were collected aboard the ISS from 2001 and 2008 and provides estimates of the TEPC measured operational quantity of dose equivalent due to GCR and TR exposures for a given set of ISS statevectors. The GCR model provides a correlation of the TEPC dose equivalent rate to the effective vertical cutoff rigidity Influences of altitude and localized shielding dependencies on the GCR dose equivalent rate have been shown to be negligible. To account for moderate solar activity, the heliocentric potential parameter U is used to provide a linear interpolation between solar maximum and minimum conditions. The GCR model is valid for all locations inside the ISS. The TR model correlates the mean daily TEPC dose equivalent rate to the mean atmospheric density at the crossing of the South Atlantic Anomaly \(SAA\etric models were developed to specifically provide exposure estimates of the TEPC dose equivalent for all passes over the SAA and including ascending and descending components individually. The TR model is valid for the TEPC located at Zvezda Service Module Panel 327 \(SM327\d for an orientation perpendicular to the ISS velocity vector. The influence of the TEPC detector orientation on the TR dose equivalent was shown to be important. The model has been implemented into a code called ISSCREM and benchmarked against TEPC data not used in the model development. The model has successfully predicted the GCR and TR dose equivalent components to within \26110% and \26120%, respectively over periods of time ranging from daily dose estimates to a cumulative dose estimates collected over many months. A sensitivity analysis on the solar activity inputs used in the predictive models for GCR and TR exposures have demonstrated that the model behaves well given projected solar activity indices In addition to predictions of the dose equivalent, estimates of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent have been made using the Particle and Heavy Ion Transport Code System \(PHITS\ Ambient-to-effective dose equivalent conversion factors E  H  10\ have been determined for simple and complex representations of the ISS Zvezda Service Module. These conversion factors have been determined for GCR and TR exposures at solar maximum and minimum conditions and for varying wall thicknesses ranging from 5.4 g cm 2 to 27.0 g cm 2 Al. Preliminary results indicate that the TEPC dose equivalent provides a conservative estimate of the protection quantity of effective dose equivalent R EFERENCES  1  Reitz, G., Facius, R., Sandler, H. \223Radiation Protection in Space\224.
