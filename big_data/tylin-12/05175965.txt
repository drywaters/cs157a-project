Mining Multilevel Association Rules on RFID data   Younghee Kim and Ungmo Kim Department of Computer Engineering Sungkyunkwan University, 300 Chunchun-dong, Suwon Gyeonggi-Do, 440-746, Korea younghees@gmail.com, umkim@ece.skku.ac.kr   Abstract  In SCM, the problem with RFID data is that the volume increases according to time and location, thus resulting in an enormous degree of data duplication Therefore it is difficult to extract useful knowledge hidden in data using existing association rule mining techniques, or analyze data using statistical techniques or queries. However, strong associations discovered at high concept levels may represent common sense knowledge and RFID data represented as a concept hierarchy has the property that the data size at the lowest level increases in proportion to the item group This paper has two aims. Firstly, we use time generalization to eliminate data duplication Generalization is useful in data mining since they permit the discovery of knowledge at different levels of abstraction, such as multilevel association rules Secondly, to reduce the complexity of rule generation by examining association ru les limited to the level of interest of the consumer, not all concept hierarchy level on a each concept level have its own level passage threshold. As a result, rule generation time is reduced and the query speed is significantly accelerated, due to filtering of data   1. Introduction  The problem of mining association rules was introduced by Agrawal[1  A t th e p r esen t tim e, th e  mining of such rules remains one of the most popular pattern discovery methods in knowledge discovery and data mining. Algorithms such as Apriori, AprioriTid DHP, Partition, Sampling, FUP, DIC, FP-Growth are widely used to find association rule mining techniques h es e alg o rit h m s  f o cus on c h ecking  f o r strong regularity, irrespective of concept generalization of a database. On the other hand, in a database the structural complexity of data is managed through data schemas suitable for data analysis tasks also, such as multidimensional aggregations[3  4   5  Su ch d a ta  schemas represent structural or semantic concept hierarchies over the dimensions of the data. Concept hierarchies  trodu ce s e m a n tic s t r u ct u r e w h ich  can be exploited to reduce the complexity of data focusing mining on potentially interesting mining queries. Recently, large retailers such as WalMart Target, and Albertsons have implemented RFID systems in their warehouses and distribution centers They are requiring their suppliers to tag products at the pallet or case levels. This RFID data changes and shares the same location and time information, based on each item or an item group in supply chain management. In addition, each item has an inclusion relation, in the form of a box, a pallet and a container RFID data is associated with problems such as the degree of increase according to time and location and the creation of enormous volumes of duplicated data However, it is difficult to find useful knowledge hiding in data by using an existing association rule mining technique or to analyze data using a statistical technique or query. Therefore, in order to abstract a hidden pattern from RFID data, an original mining technique is required, to find a meaningful rule by using a concept hierarchy and an inclusion relation of data which cannot be found in the database itself. For RFID data in a concept hierarchy, the data size of the lowest level increases in proportion to the item group size, because RFID data generate an object identifier based on each item, differing from bar code data. This paper has two aims. Firstly, we use time generalization to eliminate data duplication. Generalization is useful in data mining since they permit the discovery of knowledge at different levels of abstraction, such as multilevel association rules. Secondly, to reduce the complexity of rule generation by examining association rules limited to the level of interest of the consumer, not all concept hierarchy level on a each concept level have its own level passage threshold. As a result, rule generation time is reduced and the query speed is significantly accelerated, due to filtering of

data. This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe RFID data and an Association Rule of a Concept Hierarchy. Then, in Section 3, we propose a method mining of multilevel association rule on RFID data. In Section 4, we evaluate the performance of the number  f rules. Finally, in Section 5, we summarize our work and present a conclusion  2. Related Work  2.1. RFID Data  For RFID data, an observational result is created dynamically and the location and inclusion relation of an object changes with time \(see Fig. 1\hus, RFID related data[8  h ou l d be ex pres s e d as an adequ a t e  data model at the stage of the related application including tracking[10 1 m o n ito rin g an d ap p licatio n  integration. The expression method of RFID data is shown below. Firstly, grouping time range as a form of  EPC, location, time_start, time_end to eliminate duplicated data by several tuple generation when data remains at the same location in the form of EPC location, time or a certain period of time. Secondly RFID data is grouped to the different location by each item and move and remain there, Thus, RFID data are composed of a grouped tuple form EPClist, location time_in, time_out uivalently, containment relation information. Therefore, storage capacities are minimized and inconsistencies generated in reading data can be eliminated. Thirdly, information can be made more compact by reducing the size of the EPClist about the grouped items moving to the same location. For example, if 50 items from an EPClist are moving into two group pallet and truck, then the query can efficiently generated by expressing it as two generalized identifier gids Fourthly, a query is generated at a high level of abstraction. In addition, if a query is associated with interesting patterns found at a high level, abstracted information which is important at a lower level can be obtained. As a consequence, a query is usually generated at the less dataset and the original data is altered only when more detailed information is required. Figure 1, shows the structure of an RFID data object having an inclusion relation which is saved in the RFID data server in the form of Object_Table  Variation_Table  Containment_Table  based on a change of time and location. The Object_Table has information about each EPC tag. The Variation_Table has location and time information about each item read by a reader. The Containment    Fig. 1 RFID Data generation Model  _Table for EPC tags about time information  2.2. Concept Hierarchy-based Rule  A concept hierarchy is used for finding knowledge at multiple levels of abstraction, and defines a sequential mapping from a low-level concept set to a high-level set, as a generalized concept. By a concept hierarchy, generalization and segmentation yields the relations of hidden data and shows many aspects of the meaning of data. Generalization is used to deal with the lowest level raw data in the higher level. In addition, it helps to clearly understand the patterns found, and the meaning of data. In addition generalization efficiently enables mining generateing by reducing IO  through data compression Hierarchical mining is a method to generate association rule form items classified into several categories and sub-categories in transaction. A hierarchy-based mining technique is expressed adapting hierarchy concept suitable for an applied application type. Fig. 2 shows a result of observation for RFID data. Figure 2 shows event information corresponding to EPC, in the form of an XML document F i gu r e 3 i s a  m a pp i n g t r e e  w h i c h i s  grouped by using an inclusion relation, and converts Fig. 2 into a tree structure wi th a hierarchy concept. In a hierarchical tree, each node existing at the same level has the same fan-out value. The fan-in of a sequential node is at the same level and the fan-in of the sequential node has the same value. However, the degree and location value of a node has been changed according to the variation of objects, and an enormous

volume of duplicated information is generated, due to the fact that the information form is not generalized by time. The association relationship between the concept hierarchy is shown in Fig. 3. An e_epc:1000 node is a   Fig. 2. XML representation of RFID data grandchild node of guid:p0012  and a child node of p_epc:100 in a tree. The table shows all inclusion information at an ancestor node and child node, about e_epc:1000 node. The EPC_list of Group id Gid  guid:p0012  is guid: p_epc:100  p_epc:200 The EPC_list of p_epc:100 is c_epc:1000  c_epc:1100  c_epc:1200 Thus, the storage efficiency can be increased because each group of information has the same time and location value. In the tree, Node p_epc:100 and node p_epc:200 an create association rule having the same parent node at the same level p_epc:100 and c_epc:1000 have the hierarchy structure a different level. In that case p_epc:100 and c_epc:2000 create a similar association rule. As a consequence, many duplicated rules can be eliminated when an association rule among items having a hierarchical concept is generated   Fig. 3.  Hierarchical tree structure of Fig. 2  3. Mining Multilevel Association Rule   3.1  Timestamp Generalization  In the multi-level concept hierarchy, the operation of mining association rule can induce a point of similarity of pattern generation by generalization about a timestamp. Fig. 4 shows the RFID hierarchy concept diagram by timestamp generalization T 1  T 2    T n  represent information about time, which is passed between each item. Items with an inclusion relation where all nodes are within the T 1 area, mean that transaction generating is performed during the same time period. The generation of an association rule about RFID data uses two concepts: A hierarchy of schema definitions, for showing similarity of pattern between data, and a rule-based hierarchy concept to show an entire concept or a partial concept defined by a rule set. Fig. 5 shows the generation type of association rule between each RFID data according to timestamp regarding Fig. 4 Let us shows Fig. 5.  A rule guid:p0012 is an ancestor of a rule c_epc:1000 if guid:p0012 can be obtained by replacing the items in c_epc:1000 by their ancestors in a concept hierarchy. And A rule guid:p0012 is an ancestor of a rule c_epc:2000 It is does not provide new information, it should be removed. Based on this case, a rule can be considered redundant if its support and confidence are close to  a similarity rule    Fig. 4 RFID hierarchy concept diagram by generalizing timestamp

 Fig. 5   Type of Association Rule generation for RFID data 3.2  Mining RFID data In order to generate an association rules based on a multilevel; Firstly, form a hypothesis about a relationship, that a user wants to test or confirm Secondly, rules corresponding to the given level are searched, and from that, an association rule limited by critical min_sup and min_conf is generated. There are two steps involved in generating an association rule  Input  RFID Database\(D\ Concept Hierarchy\(H min_sup 002 min_conf 003    Output  Association Rules   Step 1: After forming a generalized concept hierarchy about a timestamp from an RFID database find a similarity rule corresponding to each concept rule, using the given hierarchy tree. We generate four types of rules for each concept  1 T i  Parent  l  level  x  y  002  T i  Sibling   l  level  x  z   If the timestamp is T i this template finds z  x s sibling node, which has the same parent y as x at level l At this time, item z is at the same level   2 T i  Sibling  l  level  x  y  013 T i  Child  l  level  y  z  002  T i  Sibling   l+1  level  z  z   If the timestamp is T i Firstly y is found, which is a sibling node of Item x at Level l Item z is found which is a child node of item y at the next level. Finally, this template finds all z which are sibling nodes of z   3 T i  Descendant   l  level  x  y  013:\000G T i  Sibling   l+n  level  y  z  002  T j  Descendant   l  level  x  y  013:\000G T j  Sibling   l+n  level  y  z  where, n 002 0 and i<j   If the timestamp is T i Firstly y is found, which is a child node of Item x at Level l Item z is found which is a sibling node of Item y Subsequently, if the timestamp is T i  y is found, which is a child node of Item x at Level l  n Finally, this template finds z  which is a sibling node of y   4 T i  Child  l  level  x  y  013:\000G T i  Child   l+n  level  y  z  002  T i  Sibling  l+n  level  z  z  for, n=1,2, … n   If the timestamp is T i Firstly z is found, which is the child node of y by increasing the level of y the child node of x at level l If there is a child node of z then the level increases by one. Secondly z is replaced by y  Then, item z is found which the child node of y until the last level is reached. Fina lly, this template finds all z which are sibling nodes of z at the same level. The rules defined above can find rules using min_sup 002   and min_conf 003  to generate a strong association rule  Step 2 : After eliminating the duplicate rules among the rules found in step 1, a limited association rule between nodes corresponding the critical min_sup and the critical min_con f is generated, using an Apriori algorithm. For example, in Fig. 4, all association rules in time T 1 and level3 are derived by the following rules  Sibling \(C 1 C 2  013 Child\(C 2 E 3  002 Sibling \(E 3 E 4  Sibling \(C 2 C 1  013 Child\(C 1 E 1  002 Sibling \(E 1 E 2   Sibling \(C 1 C i  013 Child\(C i E j  002 Sibling \(E j-1 E j  Sibling \(C 1 C n  013 Child\(C n E 1  002 Sibling \(E 1 E 2  Sibling \(C n C 1  013 Child\(C 1 E n-1  002 Sibling \(E n-1 E n  A rule is redundant if it can be derived from a higher level rule and many redundant rules are extracted. The rules involving items from the lower level of the hierarchy are considered redundant because they can be summarized by a rule involving the ancestors items Therefore, the rules are a redundant rule. We cut down the number of rule by removing redundant rule  4. Experimental Results  In this section, we shows the number of rules which are generated after organizing a concept hierarchy tree of the data obtained by generalizing the timestamp from an RFID database to study the performance of

the proposed method are implemented and tested on a 3.2GHz Pentium PC machine with 1GB main memory running on windowXP os . The data set is a set of synthetic transaction databases genertaed using IBM generator. Fig. 6 shows the performance of the proposed method on the data sets T10KL2, T100KL2 and T10KL3, T100KL3. Two itemset T10KL2 and T100KL2 are respect to the minimum support thresholds at level 2. The minimum supports at level 1 level 3 and level 4 are fixed to 0.6, 0.45 and 0.1 for T10KL2, and 0.75, 0.5 and 0.2 for T100KL2 It means that the more the inclusion information between nodes is increasing, the more the number of rule generating by generalization is decreasing considerably. Therefore we could eliminate the duplicated rule generation and decrease the cost of rule generation by concept hierarchy at the time of the association rule generation between nodes   Fig. 6 The number of rules with respect to location   5. Conclusion  RFID database have only different time and location information differing from the transaction database. Consequently, enormous duplicated rule generation results in problems such as storage inefficiency and complexity of a query. In order to resolve such problems, we suggest generalization by timestamp and a mining technique in multilevel to limit the association rule generation of data. This paper shows that it is possible to increase the storage and search efficiency of an RFID database which generates enormous volume of data. We can reduce the complexity of rule generation by examining association rules limited to the level of interest of the consumer, not all concept hierarchy level on a each concept level have its own level passage threshold. As a result, rule generation time is reduced and the query speed is significantly accelerated, due to filtering of data References 1.
