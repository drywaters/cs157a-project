mining Fuzzy approach Graph based approach Temporal database encoding I I NTRODUCTION Knowledge discovery in databa ses KDD is often called as data mining It discovers useful information from large collections of data 1  Th e d i scov e red k n o w ledg e can be rules describing properties of the data frequently occurring patterns clusterings of the objects in the database etc The amount of data stored in database is growing rapidly Intuitively these large amounts of stored data contain valuable hidden knowledge 2  Da ta m ini ng e s pe cia lly association rule discovery tries to find interesting patterns from databases that represent the meaningful relationships between products and customers or other relationships in some other applications Because the amount of these transaction data can be very large an efficient algorithm needs to be designed for discovering useful information An association rule describes the associations among items in which when some items are purchased in a transaction the others are purchased too In order to find association rules we need to discover all large itemsets from a large database of customer transactions A large itemset is a set of items which appear often enough within the same transactions The frequent itemset and association rules mining problem has received a great deal of attention and many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem Discovering association rules in these algorithms are usually done in two phases In the first phase the frequent itemset are generated and in the second phase the interesting rules are extracted from these frequent itemset If the support and confidence of a rule is above the minimum threshold the rule will be interest The task of discovering all frequent itemset is quite challenging especially in the large database because the database may be massive containing millions of transactions A famous algorithm called Apriori was proposed in 3  wh ic h gen e r ates k 1  ida t e s by joining frequent k-itemset So all subsets of every itemset must be generated for finding superior frequent itemset although many of them may be not useful for finding association rules because some of them have no interesting antecedent or consequent in the rules This process takes a long time And it also requires thousands of times of database scan The complexity of the calculation increases exponentially Additionally the size of database is the main problem of this algorithm Some modified algorithms of Apriori AprioriTid and AprioriHybrid are proposed to solve this problem but these algorithms also have the database size problem 2  A m e t h o d to e n c o d i n g t he database and an algorithm which is called anti-Apriori algorithm is brought into focus By using this algorithm only the frequent itemset that are of interest and can be converted into association rules are generated so it has a lower complexity of time and space At the meantime the times of the database scan are also reduced 2  In real life media information has time attributes either implicitly or explicitly This kind of media data is called temporal data Temporal data exist extensively in economical financial communication and other areas such as weather forecast Unlike conventional data mining temporal data mining has its exclusive characteristics Temporal data mining can be classified into temporal schema and similarity Temporal schema mining focuses on time-series schema mining temporal causal relationship mining and association rules mining While similarity study _______________

itemset are found at first and then all of their subsets that are certainly frequent are extracted 2  I n t his t e c h n iqu e  it is supposed that any frequent itemset must be at least one time occurs in the transactions lonely without any other items that are not member of that itemset In other words if itemset I 1 I 2 I 3  is frequent the itemset at least in one transaction without any other items such as shown in table 4 Table 4 Frequent itemset presentation I 1 I 2 I 3  T id 1 1 1 0000000000 In this method for every transaction T q theGCD\(greatest common divisors between M Tq and M T corresponding to other transactions are computed and frequency of these greatest common divisors are stored in GCD-set. GCD-set is the candidate for frequent set For any GCD in GCD-set if its frequency is above the required threshold it will be selected and inserted into the FGCD-set frequent GCD itemset For every transaction maintained a set is denoted as GCD Tid  composed of GCDs and frequency of any GCD For example if GCD-set and frequency between first transaction and other transactions is equal to GCD1={\(42,3 6,8 21,2 15,4 105,1 and the required threshold for support is equal to 7 and then the set 6,8 has a frequency equal to 8 greater than 7 and then 6 is inserted into FGCDset Discovering association rules is based on all FGCD which has been found in the previous phase Measure M corresponds to any frequent itemset maintained in FGCDset Every measure M in FGCD-set is decomposed into the multiplication of prime number and each prime number corresponds to one item The itemset that corresponds to M is identical and frequent and all subset of it must be frequent Every M in FGCD-set is decomposed into a candidate head Y and a body X=M/Y This algorithm iteratively generates candidate heads C k+1 of k+1 size starting with k=1 If the head and the body are interesting and valuable the confidence C of the rule X=>Y is computed as the quotient of the supports for the itemset C Support\(M Support\(X Support\(X is computed by counting the number of M Tid that can be divided by X If any rule has a C greater than or equal to the given threshold for confidence the rule will be appended into association rules 2.3 Apriori AprioriTid and AprioriHybrid The Apriori and AprioriTid algorithms generate the candidate itemsets to be counted in a pass by using only the itemsets found large in the previous pass without considering the transactio ns in the database The basic intuition is that any subset of a large itemset must be large Therefore the candidate itemsets having k items can be generated by joining large itemsets having k-1 items and deleting those that contain any subset that is not large This procedure results in generation of a much smaller number of candidate itemsets The AprioriTid algorithm has the additional property that the database is not used at all for counting the support of candidate itemsets after the first pass 5  R a t h e r  a n e n coding o f the c and ida t e i t e m s e t s u sed i n the previous pass is employed for this purpose In later passes the size of this encoding can become much smaller than the database, thus saving much reading effort. Based on the observations of Apriori and AprioriTid a hybrid algorithm which is called as AprioriHybrid uses Apriori in the initial passes and switches to AprioriTid when the candidate itemset at the end of the pass will fit into the memory III D ISCOVERY OF TEMPORAL A SSOCIATION R ULES In this section the graph mining method for a temporal database employs the Apriori algorithm with an added feature i.e time interval expansion and mergence 6  Also a fuzzy approach to a temporal database that integrates fuzzy-set concepts and AprioriTid is discussed   A Time based extension of Apriori Temporal association rules can be viewed as a factor of derivative consideration time  when mining association rules Recently the Apriori algorithm is adapted to temporal association rules mining 4  Tim e i nte r va l e xpa ns i on a n d mergence is combined with the Apriori algorithm to association rules mining on datasets that have valid-time constraints The key implementation is to add a valid-time attribute on association patterns If a given tuple owns attribute A the problem can be decomposed into two sub problems 1 Check if the valid-time attribute of a given tuple matches another attributes 2 Check whether the tuple that does not attach any valid-time attribute has attribute  A  4  Th e l ogi cal l i n kag e b e t we en t w o sub problems is that if the sub problem 1 holds sub problem 2 must hold otherwise if sub problem 2 doesn  t sub problem 1 mustn  t hold According to the first case we can scan database to solve these two sub problems simultaneously Time complexity and space complexity of this case are almost the same as those of Apriori algorithm  B Apriori for an enc oded dynamic database In this section the graph mining algorithm is discussed 4  The a l gor it hm c o n t a i ns tw o ste p s to m i ne te m p oral da ta The sample transaction is showed in Table5 Table5 The general database model TID Itemset Valid-time 100 ACD 40, 70 200 BCE 60, 90 300 ABCE 90, 12 


400 BE 30 500 ABC 400, 50 It is found that frequent item sets do not have temporal factor. The search proc ess is listed as  First enumerate all items The numbers of A B C D E are 1 2 3 4 and 5 respectively  Second generate the frequent 1-item set according to support enough and give numbers to frequent itemset Assume that the support enough is 2 the frequent 1-item set are expressed as 1 2 3 4 and 5 Correspondingly the numbers of BV 1  BV 2 BV 3 andBV 5  are 1010 0111 1110 and 0111 respectively  Third create a relationship graph that shows the relationships among items in frequent 1-item set and then generate frequent 2item set  Fourth create a searching frequent 3item set During this process we determine the execution state of algorithm because the count of items in frequent 2-item set is 4 which is larger than 3 and the number of the node of which the degree is larger than 2 is 3 it is larger than 3 So the algorithm continues execution Finally We travel the list T of candidate frequent itemset to get the tuple 2,3,5 in which x=3 This item can be used to construct a complete graph At the same time we check out the BV 2 BV 3 BV 5  the count of number 1 in the result is less than support enough so it is a frequent itemset  Fifth the count of the element in frequent 3-item set is 1 which is less than 4 resulting in the termination of the algorithm Check out whether the valid-time attribute of all frequent items meet each other by making use of the technologies of time-interval expansion and mergence let support=2 then scan the database The checkout result is that 1 2 3 5 1,3 2,3 2,5 3,5 and 2,3,5 These all meet temporal constraints of frequent items Generate temporal rules by combining confidence enough with the frequent items obtained above performance evaluation When the Apriori algorithm searches frequent nitemset in frequent n-1 item set it firstly takes joint and pruning operations to construct candidate frequent itemset C K The joint operation will be executed C S 2 times and the pruning operation will be implemented K. C S 2 times The intermediary result S is the count of candidate frequent itemset Let the time complexity of executing comparative operation be O\(t The complexity of the algorithm is dependent upon the O\(t order frequent set Assuming that there are 10-thousand frequent 1-item set the Apriori algorithm will produce more than ten-million frequent 2item sets If we want search frequent schemas whose length is 100 it will require 1030 candidate frequent itemset which will reduce the efficiency of Apriori algorithm Also the number of the elements in the candidate frequent itemset is greatly decreased For instance the frequent 2item sets in this example are 1,3 2,3 2,5 and 3,5 From the time-space complexity point of view the performance of the algorithm is better 6  C Proposed Fuzzy AprioriTid for an encoded dynamic database Fuzzy set theory is being used more and more frequently in intelligent systems because of its simplicity and similarity to human reasoning Therefore to use fuzzy sets in data mining a mining approach that integrates fuzzy set concepts with The AprioriTid mining algorithm has been identified It finds interesting itemsets and fuzzy association rules in transaction data with quantitative values The role of fuzzy sets helps transform quantitativ e values into linguistic terms which reduces possible itemsets in the mining process They are used in the AprioriTid data mining algorithm to discover useful association rules from quantitative values The fuzzy mining algorithm first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set with linguistic terms using membership functions The algorithm then calculates the scalar cardinality of each linguistic term on all transaction data using the temporary set Each attribute uses only the linguistic term with the maximum cardinality in later mining processes which keeps the number of items the same as that of the original attributes The mining process based on fuzzy counts is then performed to find fuzzy association rules IV P ERFORMANCE AND E VALUATION The anti-Apriori algorit hm in combination with the encoding method decreases the siz e of the database and also leads to reduction in the number of passes over the static database The performance of AprioriHybrid relative to Apriori and AprioriTid for large datasets is as follows AprioriHybrid performs better than Apriori in almost all cases In general the advantage of AprioriHybrid over Apriori depends on the size of the candidate itemset that declines in the later passes If there is a gradual decline in the size AprioriTid can be used for a while after the switch and a significant improvement can be obtained in the execution time By using this encoding method the efficiency of Apriori AprioriTid and AprioriHybrid has improved significantly The use of Apriori and anti-Apriori algorithm combined with an encoding method for association rule mining in a temporal database has been experimented on complaints database The encoding method reduced the size of the database which is depicted by figure1 The use of antiApriori on databases with time constraints reduced the number of scans over a temporal database 


Figure1: Effect of encoding Database encoding has been applied to a static database before applying Apriori or anti Apriori To make it scalable the same is applied to a dynamic database which involves time constraints The fuzzy AprioriTid mining approach has been found to reduce the computational time involved Figure2 shows the performance of these approaches in terms of time Figure2 Performance comparison V C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK This paper studied the impact of the Apriori family of algorithms on an encoded database for association rule mining Each of the algorithms has a different impact and produces effective results Th e effect of Apriori and antiApriori algorithms on a temporal data base which has been encoded by an encoding method provided advantageous results in terms of lower complexities of time and space The graph mining method has been found to involve less execution time The fuzzy approach to data mining has been found to be good enough to provide reduction in computation time As future work t he discovery of association rules may be used to allow the user of a knowledge discovery system to observe the changes and fluctuations in the rules which could be considered as an enhancement It may also possible to observe the seasonal or cyclical changes and fluctuations in the rules R EFERENCES 1 A bdu lla h U z T ansel  Susan P  I m berman Discovery of Association Rules in Temporal Databases International Conference on Information Technology 2007 2 T ong W a n g Pi-Li a n H e Data b a se Encod i n g a nd an Anti-Apriori Algorithm for association Rules Mining Proceedings of the Fifth International Conference on Machine learning and Cybernetics August 2006 3 M a r ga re t H D u nha m  Da ta M i n i n g I ntr o d u c t or y and Advanced Topics Tsinghua University Press Beijing 2003 4 H u i Ning  H ai fen g Yu an Shu g ang Ch en  T e m pora l Association Rules in Mining Method Proceedings of the First International Multi-Symposiums on Computer and Computational Sciences 2006  R  A g r a w al R  S rikant Fast a l g o r ithm s for M i n in g Association Rules Proceedings of the 20 th International Conference on Very Large Databases September 1994  Show-Jane Yen Arb e e L P C hen A Graph Base d Approach for Discovering Various Types of Association Rules IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and data Engineering Vol.13 No.5 September/October 2001 7 T zungP e i Hong C h an-Sheng Kuo Shyue-Liang Wang a Fuzzy AprioriTid mining algorithm with reduced computational time Tenth International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 2004 


  41  partitions of variable sizes, each partition will be called a cluster.  Each cluster is consid ered one at a time by loading the first cluster into memory and calculating large itemsets and the corresponding support counts. Then the second cluster is considered similarly and the cumulative support count is calculated for the cumulative large itemsets. This process is continued for the entire set of clusters and finally we have the whole large itemsets and the corresponding cumulative support counts.  This approach reduces main memory requirement since it considers only a small cluster at a time and hence it is scalable for any large size of the database Experiments using two of the standard transaction databases available on the Internet, T10I4D100K and T40I10D100K, show that CGAR outperforms Apriori, a familiar and widely used association rule mining algorithm When there is a reduction in the value of the minimum support threshold, the performance gap between the algorithms becomes more evident References 1 uhJ i u a n T s ay J i un nY a n n Ch ia ng C B A R  an e f f i cie n t m e t h o d f o r  mining association rules, Knowledge-Based Systems 18 \(2005\105 2 R A g r a w a l  T   I m il ie ns ki, A  S w am i Mi ni ng as s o cia t io n r u l e s be tw e e n s e ts  of items in large databases, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, Washington, DC, 1993 pp. 207–216 3  A y s e Oz el and H  A l tay  G venir  A n A l g o r ithm f o r Mi ni ng A s s o ciati o n  Rules Using Perfect Hashing and Database Pruning, \(2000  4  A g ra w a l R  S r ik ant   M i ni n g s e q u e nt ia l pa tt ern s  P r oc eed in gs of th e 11 th  International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE\, 1995 5 F  B e rz a l  J C  C u b e ro N M a rin   J M  Se rra n o  T B A R a n e ffi c i e n t me th od for association rule mining in relational databases, Elserier Data and Knowledge, Engineering 37 \(2001\ 47–64 6   Br i n R  Mo tw an i C.

 F  To check the validity of association rules  E quatio n  1  is use d  as  it is done i n  th e  last column of  Figur e  7   G  Select one  of th e  rules which have Improvement  value more than   1     H  In case if there is another job asking to get the files  and the s e files are available in the same sites then  choose another rule to serve the new request  Otherwise  apply  Aprior i  algorithm for recent STTs  of  new replicas sites    VI I   I NTERPRETING THE  R ESULT S    This section means to explain how the association  rul e s work better than the traditional and random methods  As it is shown in  Figure 7 after applying  Aprior i  algorithm  we get  602  different rules which can be used to select the  best combination of replica sites   Let us explain Figure 7  in details    Rule #1: if Site\(s S 4  S 7  are selected then this implies  that site\(s S 3  can also be selected at the same time. This  rule has 100% confidence    In other words, it means if site  S 4   and  S 7  are selected to  work together to transfer the requested files, t h en this  implies site\(s  S 3  can also be selected to share the work at  the same time. This rule has confidence  100  This  particular rule has  confidence  of  100  meaning that  S 4  S 7   and  S 3  can be selected as a best set of replicas by  Replica  Manage r  to ge t  requested files. To compute the correlation  of this rule and see how far it is better than choosing the site  randomly, we use an Improvement equation     indicates that it has support of  26  transactions, meaning that in transaction  Single Trip  Time  Table  there are  2 6  concurrent uncongested trips of  S 4  S 7   i.e. these sites have similar network conditions in particular  time      indicates the total number of transactions  involving uncongested trips of  S 3   in  Rule 1  is equal to  174    This is a piece of a side information; it is not involved  in calculating the confidence or support for the rule itself       is the number of transactions where   S 4   S 7 as well as   S 3 has uncongested trips. In  Rule 1  it is equal  to  2 6       or   indicates how much  more likely we are to encounter  S 4  and  S 6  transaction if we  consider just those transactions where  S 3  S 5 and  S 8  have  uncongested trips. As compared to the entire population of  the transactions, it's t h e  confidenc e  divided by  support \(c   where the latter is expressed as a percentage   For  Rule 1 the  confidenc e is  100   support \(c  in  percentage   174/194\*100 = 89.6 9 So, th e    Lift ratio = 100/89.69.1 = 1.1   As it is clearly shown in  Figure 7  some r u les with  an improvement value less than one means this is an  unreliable rule. Whereas the rule with a value more than one  means this rule is better than random replica selection with  number of time equal to improvement value as it is shown in  Figure 8                   When improvement value is more than 1 it is better to use  EST to select replica sites, because it selects the sites able to  work simultaneously    I n  Figure  9  we sho w  the  comparison between EST and  traditional model using highest bandwidth a s  a criterion to  select the best replica. As we can observe our technique has  a better performance most of the times because it selects the  sites which have the stable links. In traditional method the  site which has the highest bandwidth does not always me a n  to be the best because sometimes this highest bandwidth  link can be congeste d   Let us declare more by the following  scenario  o f  Figure 1 0 suppose   S 0   be the computing site  and let   S 1  S 3   S 1 4   be replica sites  Red stars referring to  congested router s   Using traditional selection method the  file will be got from S14 since it has less number of Hops  routers\ and highest and also has highest bandwidth link         Figure 8.

               Using  ES T the replica   S 3    is selected as a best replica  because the link b etween  C S  and  R S  is uncongested     VII I   C ONCLUSIO N  In this paper we presented a dynamic replica  selection strategy that aims to adapt at ru n time its criteria to  flexible QoS binding contracts specified by the service  provider and/or the client. The adapta b ility feature  addressed by our replica selection strategy is inferred from  the observation that the basic metrics, which influence the  QoS that the user perceives when accessing a replica  depend directly on the application being replicated and on  the cli e nts\222 preferences. To reach this objective that, we  used   the concept of association rules of data mining  approach to the most stable links sites in order to reduce the  searching space the response time and network resources  consumed    A CKNOWLEDGEMENT S  Au t hors wish to express their sincere thanks to  Prof. Arun Agarwal, from GridLabs Department of  Computer and Information Sciences, University of  Hyderabad, India for providing all the infrastructural and  computational support required to carry out this work  His  academic suggestions to improve the quality of the work are  also highly appreciated and acknowledged   R EFERENCE S     M  Rashedur Rahma n   Ken Barke r   Reda Alhaj j    Replica  selection in grid environment:a dat a mining approac h    Distributed systems and grid computing \(DSGC\,pp: 695  226  700  2005    J.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
