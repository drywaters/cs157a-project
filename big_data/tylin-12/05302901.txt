Firstly, a concept lattice \(a concept hierarchy\ diagram is given, Moreover databases and selected, transform spatial data into attribute data by generalizing spatial are introduced. Then the method of build 
spatial concept lattice by using: generalize spatial relationships into attribute relationships is given. Finally, an improvement algorithm of spatial association rule mining based concept lattice is offered and the experiment results show the algorithm is effective Abstract  Keywords 
 Concept lattice; spatial association rule; data mining \(keywords I   I NTRODUCTION  Data Mining is the process of finding hidden patterns in a large data set. It can be defined   as the nontrivial extraction of 
implicit, previously unknown, and potentially useful information from data .spatial data mining can be defined as a set of exploratory computational and statistical approaches for analyzing very large spatial and spatiotemporal data sets Data mining techniques are often grouped into categories that include clustering, categorization, summarization, rulemining, and feature extraction ll of th e s e t y pes  of  techniques are generally oriented towards identifying spatial or spatio-temporal patterns in geographic observations or measurements. Challenges in spatial data mining arises because traditional data mining deals with continues and discrete variables whereas spatial data is more complex and 
rich comprising of objects like points, lines and polygons Spatial Data Mining comprises of spatial attributes like distance, spatial autocorrelation and spatial predicates like overlap that are quite implicit as compared to tradition data mining where inputs are expli  Several methods has been developed to discover spatial association rules. These are statistical analysis, generalization techniques, extension of techniques from mining association rules based on market basket transaction data and collocation rules discovery techniques. Statistical techniques handles numerical data very well and there is rich set of algorithms developed using these techniques [3 u t th e y u s u a ll y a s s u m e  
statistical independence of spatial data which proves to be unrealistic due to influence of neighboring regions. These techniques heavily depend on domain and statistical knowledge [4  G e ne r a l i z a t i o n t e c h ni q ue s e m p l o y h i g h l e ve l  concepts. These concepts describe general relation ships between spatial and non-spatial data Extension of techniques for mining association rules in transaction-based databases to mi ning spatial association rules is another solution. A transaction is artificially created in some of these techniques so support, confidence, pruning from transaction-based algorithm can be applied to spatial 
databases As mentioned in previous section Statistical algorithms to discover spatial association rules is one of the methods. These methods heavily depend on numerical data and they make unrealistic assumption in case of spatial data [5 In f l u e n ce o f  neighboring regions is an example where it becomes very challenging for these methods. These methods also deals very poorly with symbolic names like Expensive\(condo inside\(condo, downtown\area\(condo,large Generalization techniques use high level concepts. These algorithms are used for non-spatial dominant generalization and spatial-dominant generalization. These methods can not deal with the rules reflecting structure of spatial objects and 
relationships which contain spatial predicates such as adjacent_to, inside, close_to et  Moreover, spatial data has a strong auto correlation wherein different spatial variables are correlated with other whereas traditional data mining focuses on independence of variables A concept lattice is generated automatically from a relation between two sets, objects and attributes The concept or Galois\attice of a binary relation formalizes it as a concept system, dually ordered in "extension" / "intension All implications between conjunctions of properties holding in it are summarized by a canonical basis - all basis having the same cardinality i n g t h es e tools lat tices  h a v e been us ed  
to analyze binary data since the early eighties. Some procedures address more the form er direction \(lattice drawing gluing decomposition, sub-lattices while others the latter canonical basis of implications and lattice's core, box decomposition, weighted lattices This paper proposes an algorithm about spatial association rule mining which is based on concept lattice. Then conception lattice is used in mining spatial association rules by the way that used in attribute association rules. Hence, the 978-1-4244-4639-1/09/$25.00 \2512009 IEEE

It describes the implication of one or a set of features in spatial databases Extension techniques for mining association rules in transaction-based databases is used for spatial association rule mining. A spatial association rule is in the form of \223X->Y\224 where X and Y are set of predicates and some of which are spatial ones. The predicates involved in spatial association rules may represent topological relationships between spatial objects such as disjoint, intersects, inside/outside, adjacent to cover/covered by equa T h ey  m a y al s o be in f o r m of spatial orientation or ordering such as left, right, north, east etc. They may contain some distance information such as close to, faraway etc. Many spatial association rules are expressed at a relatively high concept level. Support and confidence concepts from traditional data mining are applied to discover spatial association rules. Support indicates the probability of a patterns occurrence in set of spatial objects Confidence X->Y is the occurring probability of Y whenever X occurs. Minimum support and minimum confidence threshold levels are used to eliminate the patterns that are not supposed to be interesting. This also reduces the number of the candidates and speeds up pattern discovery process. A concept hierarchy defines a sequence of mappings from a set of low-level concepts to higher-level, more general concepts. Consider a concept hierarchy for the dimension location City values for Figure 1 the diagram for the attribute concept   003 concept lattice is always a complete lattice, called the method of mining spatial association rules is reduced to the method of mining attribute association rules II  DEFINITION  OF  SPATIAL  CONCEPT  LATTICE Concept lattice, which is also named as Galois lattice, is a relatively new approach to the mathematics normalization and representation of conceptual knowledge. A concept lattice \(a concept hierarchy\ can be represented graphically using line or Hasse\rams. These structures are composed of nodes and links. Each node represents a concept with its associated intensional description. The links connecting nodes represent the sub-concept and super-concept relation among them. This relation indicates that the parent\222s extension is a superset of each child\222s intension. A node covers all of the instances covered by the union of its descendents, making the concept hierarchy a sub-graph of the partial ordering by generality More abstract or general nodes occur higher in the hierarchy whereas more specific ones occur at lower levels j e ct concepts are named with the specific object that produces the concept while attribut e concepts are labeled with the specific attribute that generates the concept. A diagram contains all the context information; an object has an attribute if and only if there is an upwards leading path from its object concept to this attribute concept \(Figure 1 shows the diagram for the attribute concept   information  status and denoted by   B ODR 003 of    T ODR   where O is a set of objects, D is a set of their attributes, and R is the binary relation between O and D. according to the inclusion relationships between extensions, there is a unique lattice structure lattice L, which defines natural groupings and relationships descriptions between the objects and their attributes in the context Corresponding, besides the set of descriptors \(attributes definition of spatial concept lattice is the same as that of concept lattice which is proposed by Wille. The set of descriptors \(attributes\efined as the set of spatial relations and other spatial attributes of objects in spatial concept lattice Spatial concept satisfies properties described as follow [9 Each node of lattice L is a pair   AB as concept, A pair   AB is called an object oriented concept, Sets A, B  are called the intension and extension of formal concept   YX respectively Definition 2: For a set AO 002  of objects and a set B P     003  2  The couple of operators   is a Galois Connection  002 of properties we define The set of properties common to the objects in A    ApPoRpforallA The set of all concepts of a context   ODR 004\003 1 The set of objects which have all properties in B   B o O oRp for all p B together with the order relation

Each city, however, can be mapped to the province or state to which it belongs. For example Wuhan can be mapped to Hubei, and Changsha to Hunan. The provinces and states can in turn be mapped to the country to which they belong, such as China or the USA. These mappings form a concept hierarchy for the dimension location mapping a set of low-level concepts \(i.e., cities\ to higher-level more general concepts \(i.e., countries\. The concept hierarchy described above is illustrated in Figure 2                             Many concept hierarchies are implicit within the database schema. For example, suppose that the dimension location is described by the attributes number, street, city, province or state, zip-code, and country. These attributes are related by a total order, forming a concept hierarchy such as "street < city province or state < country". Alternatively, the attributes of a dimension may be organized in a partial order, forming a lattice. An example of a partial order for the time dimension based on the attributes day, week, month, quarter, and year is day < {month <quarter; week} < year".2 A concept hierarchy that is a total or partial order among attributes in a database schema is called a schema hierarchy. Concept hierarchies that are common to many applications may be predefined in the data mining system, such as the concept hierarchy for time Data mining systems should provide users with the flexibility to tailor predefined hierarchies according to their particular needs. For example, users may like to define a fiscal year starting on April 1, or an academic year starting on September 1 Based on attribute values and distances, we will identify the data mining context this can be identified with a concept hierarchy, or in our model a \223partition hierarchy\224.  Concept hierarchies are commonly defined as a tree of mappings from a set of low-level concepts to more general concepts, such as city" < "province or state" < "country". This section begins by introducing two constructs that are fundamental to the framework subsequently developed. Assume we are given a spatial dataset providing information about some geospatial phenomenon and structured according to a prescribed representation. This representation will possess both extent and granularity IV  A SSOCIATION RULE MINING ALGORITHM BASED ON SPATIAL CONCEPT LATTICE  212 Association Rule Mining aims at finding rules on the basis of their relevance.. Its basic idea is to create all rules of each node without redundancy and its primary gist is the number and form of the parent node. When the graph has set of spatial concept lattice is given, the spatial association rule mining algorithm can be divided into two steps: the first step is to acquire parent nodes of all lattice nodes; the second one is to create association rule using theorem 1~3 Theorem1. If node    H XX is irredundant Theorem2. If node    H XX comes into existence So this rule should be created from parent node M If there is a descriptor    1 2  k pXYk n  212  212 then any rules\222 foreside created from H could only be a single descriptor, and for   p XY  Then rule  12 12   nn pp p X pp p    ddd M YY 003 \212       222   M YY   is redundant relative to rule  k pXY there exists a rule   p Xp without redundancy Proof: Suppose a rule created from node H is   12 12   nn p pp X ppp rule  p Xp  212  212 005\003 212  005\003  1 n  in 12  n p pp  Hence, any rules\222 foreside created from node H could only be a single descriptor  k p  212 003 in the lattice has parent nodes with the number of d ,which are  111   M YY

All programs were coded in Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The experimental dataset consists of two kinds of data , a pwer transmission lines graph and then transformed into a talbe; The two attribute table of the power pole which respectively contain five attributes. An attribute has 2~10 attribute values after generalization. During the mining of the single layer spatial association rule, these two tables are connected into a dataset of six attributes. The minimum support of each data layer is 6%, and the minimum confidence is 75%.Figure3 shows the CPU-time of the experiments with iris data set when using Apriori algorithm and this method presented in this paper. Moreover, from the Figure.4, we can see that this approach based on Concept Lattice is quite effective in reducing memory. According to the experimental results, we can see that CPU-times decreases significantly when we use this algorithm based on Concept Lattice VI  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we presented a new 


The occurrence of a pattern is assumed to consume the information associated with the primary events describing the pattern. For this reason, each input feature can support at most one rule firing, in order to maintain the assumption of statistical independence of the input featu 16 VI E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS The pattern discovery and classification modules were successfully implemented. A large sample dataset was used as input and the rules were got as output. The modules were successfully tested on various datasets and results were obtained TABLE I I NPUT DATA SET A training dataset D is used as input to the algorithm 10 D consists of six input features with five attributes Red”, “Blue”, “Green”, “Hue”, “Saturation” and a label “Texture 1500 record sets were considered A Parameters The three important parameters, which had to be decided on, are Q number of quantization bins H threshold level for statistical significance  valid significance test cut-off 1 Q value The value of Q was a tradeoff between the classification precision and the computational complexity Taking all the parameters into consideration, the value of Q was fixed as 5 2 H value The threshold level was chosen to be a standard value of 1.96 which corresponds to 95 percent confidence level which ensures a reasonable assertion to make a strong suggestion in decision support system  3 value The valid significance test cut off was decided based on the size of the database. To eliminate the spurious patterns early in pattern discovery phase, and to avoid exhaustive search of the data set, an optimum value of was chosen as 10 B Quantization The numeric data of all the 5 input features were discretized using maximum marginal entropy partitioning  Each sample space was divided into quantization bins along each margin The value of Q was chosen as 5 The input data was distributed over the 5 quantized bins in such a way that the entropy was maximized The number of sample data in each bin was equal 1 Quantized bins TABLE II Q UANTIZED BINS C Events generated After quantization the input sample space is partitioned into events each of which can be determined probabilistically Primary events are the basic building blocks A :  [a  a3 a4 a 5 B :  [b  b3 b4] [b 5 C :  [c  c3] [c 4] [c5  D  d3] [d 4] [d5 E :  [e1 e2 e3 e 4 e5 The primary events are connected to form higher order events Second order [a1 a2, b 2 Third order [a1, a2, a b1, b2 And so on D Rules generated 303 rules were generated.

This model identifies statistically significant event associations inherent in a given data set, using residual analysis to test whether or not a pattern candidate is significantly deviated from a default loglinear model. The generated rules annotated with weight of evidence are fired independently to classify the input feature vector In scenarios where labeling requires further statistical augmentation, a deterministic means of confidence could be derived. The confidence measure can be further combined with the label to supplement the decision analogous to multiple votes.

7 ForestCoverType  data is shown in Figure 6 Appendix as an example The tool takes this data as input and produces the hierarchical clusters of data by setting different clustering parameters With the help of this tool user can see  the generated hierarchy of the clusters along with the data present in each cluster. For the experiment we sele cted the row wise clustering option and the algorithm used f or this type of clustering was the Euclidean algorithm. The reason for this choice is that Euclidean distance is the m ost commonly used type of distance measure in cluster analysis It uses raw data instead of standardized data to compute the distances Using the complete linkage method the hierarchal clusters are produced, it can be seen from the Figu re 2 that 3 distinct clusters are produced where each one of them is having its specific hierarchy B Automatic Schema generation In this step the cluster results file which was ex ported using the HCE tool becomes the input of the automat ic schema builder. We developed a prototype to automat e the process of schema generation The prototype takes t he clustered data and generates the schema of any part icular type such as star snowflake or galaxy/constellatio n The prototype has been developed using the C sharp C  programming language in Microsoft Visual Studio.net 2005 Once the hierarchical clustering has been done, the  next step is to extract this hierarchical information in the form of cluster information tables which are fed into the d eveloped prototype called Automatic Schema Generator Figure  3 depicts the main interface of the Automatic Schema Generator having the clustered relationship data C luster names are the abbreviations which are formed using the first letters of each cover type for example clus ter name for C1 is PCD, which means cover types of Ponderosa pine Cottonwood and Douglas-fir PCD All other names are abbreviated by using the first alphabetical letters  After reading the cluster relationship file the bu tton of Create Schema as shown in the following diagram displays the schema selection window. Figure 4 show s the schema selection window of automatic schema builder  Using this selector window cluster name and type o f schema can be selected to build database in the dat abase server. User can select from star, snowflake and ga laxy or constellation options of schema type using the radi o button The “Generate” button on the bottom of schema selec tor window performs the following major functions 1\Generates automatic database in the database serv er 2\Creates dimension and fact tables for the schema type selected 3\Manage relationships among the tables 4\Upload data in the fact and dimension tables from the clustered file After performing the above mentioned functions the  control is passed to the schema visualization windo w which gives a glimpse of the schema created automatically  as shown in Figure 5  Fig 2: Hierarchical clusters generated by HCE tool Fig 3 User interface of automatic schema builder Fig 4 Schema Selector window 41 


Fig 5 Schema visualization window V CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we reviewed the literature regarding  the integration of OLAP with data mining and automatic generation of OLAP schema. Literature review reveal ed the fact that none of the previous works targeted at th e automatic schema generation from the mined data set  Furthermore the works in the past pose a number of limitations. The major limitation of the previous w ork was the absence of a model that can produce the three b asic types of OLAP schema star, snowflake and galaxy Based on these observations we presented the model for th e integration of data mining and OLAP along with the automatic generation of OLAP schema. We have develop ed a prototype for the automatic schema generation Th is developed prototype takes mined data and produces t he schema of user’s choice Finally we implemented the  proposed model and evaluated the results with the h elp of experiment It is evident from the result that the prototype system overcomes the manual schema design and implementation requirement in the data warehousing environment We are working on the enhancement of t he proposed model for automatic schema generation One  possible way of enhancement is the use of other dat a mining techniques along with OLAP for the schema generation. Further more, we are exploring how OLAP can be further extended and enhanced to meet the new challenges and to make it more effective efficient  and intelligent OLAP REFERENCES 1  S   C h a u d h u r i  a n d  U   D a y a l   A n  o v e r v i e w  o f  d a t a  warehousing and OLAP technology ACM SIGMOD Record  Vol 26 1997\, pp 6574 2  A   C u z z o c r e a   D   S a c c a  a n d  P   S e r a f i n o   A  h i e r a rchy driven compression technique for advanced OLAP visualizati on of multidimensional data cubes in Proc of 8th Int’l Conf on Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery \(DaWak Springer Verlag 2006\, pp. 106-119 3  S   M a n s m a n n  a n d  M   S c h o l l   E x p l o r i n g  O L A P  a g g r e gates with hierarchical visualization techniques, in Proc. of ACM Symposium on Applied Computing 2007\, pp. 1067-1073 4  F a y y a d  U  M   P i a t e s k y S h a p i n o  G    S m y t h  P   a n d  U thurusany R From datamining to knowledge discovery: An overvie w,”in Proc. of Advances in data mining and knowledge discovery MIT Press, pp. 134 5   S   G o i l  a n d  A   C h o u d h a r y    H i g h  p e r f o r m a n c e  O L AP and data mining on parallel computers Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery vol. 1, no. 4, pp. 391-417, Dec. 1997 6   S   A s g h a r   D   A l a h a k o o n  a n d  A   H s u    E n h a n c i n g  OLAP functionality using selforganizing neural networks  Neural, Parallel and Scientific Computations vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 1-20, March 2004 7   R   B   M e s s a o u d   O   B o u s s a i d  a n d  S   R a b a s e d a    A new OLAP aggregation based on the AHC technique,” in Proc. of the 7th ACM Int’l Workshop on Data Warehousing and OLAP DOLAP ACM New York, 2004, pp. 65-72 8   J   H a n    T o w a r d s  o n l i n e  a n a l y t i c a l  m i n i n g  i n  l arge databases ACM SIGMOD Record vol. 27, no. 1, pp. 97-107, March 1998 9   V   M a r k l   F   R a m a s a k  a n d  R   B a y e r    I m p r o v i n g  OLAP performance by multidimensional hierarchical clustering in Proc of the 1999 Int’l Symposium on Database Engineering and Applica tions IDEAS 1999, p. 165 10   V   M a r k l  a n d  R   B a y e r    P r o c e s s i n g  r e l a t i o n a l  OLAP queries with UB-trees and multidimensional hierarchical clusteri ng in Proc of the Int’l.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
