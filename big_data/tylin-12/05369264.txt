 Application of data mining in manufacturing enterprisesí quality manageme nt is introduced. Quality factor analysis is very important for quality control and production management. In this article, based on Rough Set theory an improved Apriori algorithm is put forward to mine quantitative relationship among different factors which in fluence product quality. The improved algorithm overcomes the traditional Apriori algorithmís limitation of qualitative analysis  1. Introduction  Data mining is successfully used in many industries 
such as in steel manufacturing industry, a data mining system named ISPA which is developed conjointly by American and Japan steel companies is applied to analyze product performance and control quality and has made great benefits 1 Generally speaking, in terms of applications of data mining in quality control and quality analysis, it  can be classified as follows 1\ality control For many quality control parameters and process parameters, there are no precise mathematical expression. it is needed to use observation or other 
methods to determine the corresponding function between independent variables and the dependent variable. Obviously there are a number of analytical expressions, but inconvenient to use, hence a simple function approximation to replace the complex functions. Regression equation and simulation is applied in such cases to analyze the expression of independent variables and the relationship between the dependent variable 2  quality  analysis The formation of quality is affected by a number of factors, but a comprehensive analysis of all factors is 
impossible, only the main factors analysis to explore the causal relationship between them and the association rules is necessary. Analysis of association rules in data mining is most commonly used method its main principle is that if two or more of the value of parameters appears simultaneously and repeatedly then it is possible that a link between them can be established. The most commonly used methods of correlation analysis is Apriori algorithm, but the traditional Apriori algorithm for mining data is suited 
for the qualitative analysis, and exploring the quantitative relationship in production quality management is more useful. In this paper, based on rough set theory an improved Apriori algorithm is proposed   3\uality inspection Quality inspection and judgment, such as the classification of quality deficiencies, grading of product quality, need classification analysis rule Common classification algorithms are Decision Tree Algorithm, Rough Sets algorithm and Bayesian algorithm 
In this paper, we propose an improved Apriori algorithm basing on rough set attribute reduction theory  to extract quality association rules, then an example of steel productsí quality rules excavation is given to show how this  algorithm is applied  2. Association knowledge acquisition based on rough set  Rough set theory \(Rough Set, RS\mathematical tool to study imprecise and uncertain knowledge, put forward by Poland scientist, Professor Z. Pawlak Relationship table of Data Mining can be used as 
information table in rough set. Rough set theory can be used to reduce high dimensional data pre-processing to remove redundant attributes so as to achieve lower dimension  In this paper, the characteristics of rough set theory is used to improve the efficiency of rule extraction Apriori algorithm is most commonly used in extraction of association rules, it is first proposed by R Agrawal in 1993 to find links between different items

 in databases to identify customer buying behavior models. The core of the Apriori algorithm is based on a two-stage frequent set    Production process is a complex uncertain process with a characteristics of highly dimensional, strongly correlated and non-linear parameters. Production quality feature is not only affected by production process, but also the   interaction effect among features for example, the mechanical properties of steel are related  not only with the rolling parameters, but also with the chemical constituents of steel. In view of this characteristic, the improved Apriori algorithm bases on rough set theory to discretize and reduce highdimensional data to improve the efficiency of Apriori algorithm; and uses Apriori algorithmí frequency set recursive thinking to search association rules between quality attributes  2.1.

IV PERFORMANCE STUDY In this section, we present a performance comparison of CIU algorithm and FP-growth algorithm The data sets that we used for our experiments are generated randomly. Figure 5 shows the results of test of run time. In our experiments, there are 50K transactions in primitive database. The run time shown in the figure is the incremental run time. Th e figure shows that the incremental run time can be reduced down by about one-half in the CIU algorithm, and the gap grows wider when the number of incremental transactions grows up Figure 5 Run time with incremental transactions V CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have investigated the problem of continuous incremental updati ng in large databases. The contributions of this paper are summarized here: 1\ We have proposed an optimization technique for reducing the database size during the update process. 2\ We have give the definition and algorithm of transaction tree T-tree The order of items in every transaction in T-tree is different from that in FP-tree  3\ We have proposed a continuous incremental algorithm, or CIU algorithm for short. 4 have implemented the CIU algorithm, and studied its performance in comparison with FP-growth algorithm in large databases A CKNOWLEDGEMENT This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China 70971004 REFERENCES 1 R  A g r a w a l  T   I m ie l i ns ki a n d A   S w am i  M i n i n g A s s o cia tio n Rul e s  between Sets of Items in Large Databases Proc.

Figure 3 Precision-recall curve in ROI-250 image dataset 5.3 Experiment 3 Mammograms-1080 image dataset This experiment employed a dataset composed by 1080 mammograms images collected in the Clinical Hospital of University of Sao Paulo at Ribeiro Preto The dataset was previously classi\002ed into 4 levels of breast tissue density 0501\051 mostly fatty 050362 images\051 0502\051 partly fatty 050446 images\051 0503\051 partly dense 050200 images\051 and 0504\051 mostly dense 05072 images\051 Figure 4 Precision-recall curve in Mammography-1080 image dataset Breast density is an important risk factor in the development of breast cancer In this experiment the images are represented by the feature set proposed in b uilding a vector of 85 features including shape and size of the breast the conditions of the breast contour nipple position and the distribution of 002broglandular tissue This dataset was divided in training set and test set The training set is composed of 720 images and test set is composed of 360 images Figure 4 shows the P&R curves over test dataset and also the number of features selected in each method Again the proposed methods reached the highest values of precision and select the smallest number of features 050a\051 050b\051 050c\051 050d\051 Figure 5 Queries in Mammography dataset 050a\051 226 is the query image 050b\051 using the features selected through 002tness function F cB  050c\051 using the features selected through classi\002cation error of C4.5 and 050d\051 using the all features extracted Results for the retrieval of the 5 most similar images from a query image are also provided in this experiment as illustrated in Figure 5 The image 5.\050a\051 is the query image taken from the mostly fatty image class Images shown in 5.\050b\051 are the 5 most similar images retrieved for the proposed 002tness function F cB  The row 050c\051 shows the results for C 4  5 classi\002er whereas 050d\051 illustrate the images resulting from all features 050no selection applied\051 In Figure 5 the images surrounded by dashed lines are false positives 050not relevant images\051 For this query the proposed method achieved the highest precision 050100%\051 when compared the results of C4.5 and the original feature vector 050precision of 40%\051 


6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
