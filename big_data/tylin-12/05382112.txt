the limits of support/con\002dence framework used in Apriori-like algorithms to mine association rules One solution to cope with this limitation is to get rid of frequent itemset mining and to focus as soon as possible on interesting rules Many works have focused on the algorithmic properties of the con\002dence In particular the all-con\002dence which is a transformation of the con\002dence  has the antimonotone property In this paper we generalize the all-con\002dence by associating to any measure its corresponding all-measure  We present a formal framework which allows us to make the link between analytic and algorithmic properties of the all-measure  We then propose the notion of all-monotony which corresponds to the monotony property of the all-measures  Our results show that although being very interesting all-monotony is a demanding property I I NTRODUCTION Rules-based data mining methods are very important approaches in machine learning and datamining They may provide a concise and potentially useful knowledge that is understandable by the end-users This last feature that allows to explain why a particular prediction is made for a particular case or why two items are related could be of strong importance in various applications like in credit scoring or medicine In unsupervised learning paradigm association rule mining is certainly the most popular method Our w ork focuses on this method so we 002rst recall its fundamentals An association rule is a rule A  B  where A and B are two sets of items 050also called itemsets\051 such that A 6    B 6   and A 134 B    meaning that given a database DB of transactions 050where each transaction is a set of items\051 whenever a transaction T contains A  then T probably contains B also W ithin the support/con\002dence framework the problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have support and con\002dence greater than an user-speci\002ed minimum support threshold and minimum con\002dence threshold respectively The support of A  B  denoted supp 050 A  B 051  is the proportion of transactions containing A and B in DB  and the con\002dence  denoted conf 050 A  B 051  is the proportion of transactions containing A and B inside the set of transactions containing A in DB  Association rule discovery is a two-step process Firstly the minimum support constraint is applied to 002nd all frequent itemsets in DB  Secondly the frequent itemsets and the minimum con\002dence constraint are used to form rules This strategy implies two major problems the 002rst one concerns complexity issue while the second one concerns the quality of extracted rules Finding all frequent itemsets in DB is computationally expensive since there are O 0502 k 051 possible itemsets where k is the number of items in DB  However the downward-closure property of support 050also called antimonotonicity allo ws to implement very ef\002cient algorithms to 002nd all frequent itemsets Interesting surveys may be found in and 3 It is important to notice that support-based approaches give an important role to the support constraint Thus mining interesting rules without the support has been identi\002ed as an important challenge It is also well known that 002nding all and only all interesting rules is a dif\002cult problem Indeed algorithms produce a huge number of rules especially within the support/con\002dence framework while the percentage of interesting rules is often only a very small fraction of the all rules A 002rst strategy to reduce the number of mined rules consists of increasing the user-speci\002ed minimum support threshold Unfortunately this strategy will miss many interesting rules especially the nuggets 050rules with low support and very high con\002dence 051 A second strategy consists of increasing the user-speci\002ed minimum con\002dence threshold This will favor rules with large consequent which may give many uninteresting rules for example in a classical market database we would extract the rule washing liquid  bread  which is due only to the fact that bread is bought by most of the consumers The use of the con\002dence only takes all its sense only when the value of the con\002dence is compared to supp 050 B 051  Thus one can use additional objective measures of interest in order to rank the rules in a post-analysis phase Objective measures are said data driven as they could be de\002ned on the basis of the contingency table of A and B  Interesting surveys and comparisons may be found in  7 Another ef\002cient approach is to apply additional constraints 9 on item appearance or to use additional interestingness measures as soon as possible to reduce both the time to mine databases and the number of founded

itemsets like in Indeed as it w as stressed in 11 interestingness measures may play different roles They can be used to prune the search space this is the case for the support to select the interesting rules this is the case for the con\002dence  or to quantify the utility of rules this is the case for a cost/bene\002t measure We are interested in objective measures that can be used for all of these roles To overcome the previous mentioned problems with the dictatorship of the support constraint different solutions were proposed at the algorithmic level and mainly for the con\002dence measure We focus here on the all-con\002dence  that mak es the con\002dence measure antimonotone This is thus a promising property The rest of the paper is organized as follows In Section II we present recent works that focus on the algorithmic properties of some measures In Section III we present our formal framework which allows us to make the link between analytic and algorithmic properties of the measures We apply in Section IV this framework and propose the allmonotony that generalizes the antimonotone property of allcon\002dence  We then demonstrate a suf\002cient condition of non-existence of the proposed generalization all-monotony  The practical application to 37 measures is discussed in Section V and we conclude in Section VI II R ELATED WORKS Many studies have shown the limits of support/con\002dence framework used in Apriori-like algorithms to mine association rules In order to 002nd nuggets  a lot of these works have focused on the algorithmic properties of the con\002dence measure These works are mainly divided into two families the 002rst one tries to reduce the number of considered items and the second one exploits the analytical properties of measures We here focus on the latter one Inspired by the support example proposed the hcon\002dence  a transformation of the con\002dence  that has the antimonotony property In addition the h-con\002dence allows to 002lter the uninteresting itemsets with the cross-support property These measures are used in HYPERCLIQUE MINER algorithm proposed by The h-con\002dence measure is mathematically identical to all-con\002dence measure introduced by So lik e the support measure the y could be used in Apriori-like algorithms Our proposal which is an extension of focusses on all-con\002dence  An itemset is considered as interesting under the all-con\002dence constraint if the con\002dence of all rules that can be generated from this itemset is greater than a 002xed threshold Based on one monotony property of the con\002dence   introduced the Universal Existential Upward Closure property This property allows to explore the itemsets lattice with a top down approach for classi\002cation rules It is thus ef\002cient in particular for nuggets discovery A generalization of this property is provided in For an associative classi\002cation task following a work by 18 introduced the C OR C LASS algorithm based on direct branch-and-bound exploration of candidates and on an antimonotonic property of convexity of the 037 2  In the author introduced the notion of optimal rule set for classi\002cation rules A rule set is optimal if it contains all rules except those with no greater interestingness than one of its more general rules Optimal rule sets allow to de\002ne an ef\002cient pruning strategy that could be applied with 13 measures as demonstrated case by case by This work is from the best of our knowledge one of the 002rst works that is applied to a large set of measures In addition an optimal rule set has similar properties as closed itemsets and nonredundant rule sets as proposed in A necessary and suf\002cient condition of applicability of the underlying pruning strategy is proposed in III A SSOCIATION RULE  S SPACE In this section we adapt the formal framework presented in  close to the formalism used by 22 which enables an analytic study of objective interestingness measures related to their algorithmic properties We will propose the allmonotony property that generalizes the monotony property of the all-con\002dence and use our framework to study the condition of existence of this property in Section IV If the size of the database is not taken into account such measures can be expressed using the contingency table of relative frequencies and consequently with only three variables a measure can be considered as a function R 3  R  f\0001   1g in fact the measures have various restricted domains in R as shown in The study of their variations with respect to these variables links the measures and their algorithmic properties It implies to describe a domain of de\002nition in order to study only real cases The 002nal goal is then to derive from the algorithmic properties founded some ef\002cient pruning strategies A Association rules  database A boolean database DB is completely described by a triplet  A  R T   where A is a set of items T is a set of attributes and R is a binary relation on A 002 T  An association rule is de\002ned by a database DB  a non-empty set A 032 A  A is an itemset called antecedent and a nonempty set B 032 A called consequent such that A  B    We denote a rule by A DB 000 B  or simply A 000 B when there is no possible confusion The support of an itemset A is the frequency of appearance of this itemset in the database We denote it by supp DB  A   or if there is no ambiguity supp  A   The support of the rule A 000 B is the support of itemset AB  B Contingency tables Let A and B be two itemsets on the database DB  The contingency table left part of Figure 1 in relative joint
