Monitoring and Modeling Simple Everyday Activities of the Elderly at Home George Papamatthaiakis, George C. Polyzos, George Xylomenos Mobile Multimedia Laboratory Department of Informatics Athens University of Economics and Business Athens 104 34, Greece papamath06, polyzos, xgeorge}@aueb.gr  Abstract We present our work on a sensor-based smart system automatically trained to recognize the activities of individuals in their home. In this paper we present and analyze a method for recognizing the indoor everyday activities of a monitored individual. This method is based on the data mining technique of association rules and Allen\222s temporal relations 
Our experimental results show that for many \(but not all activities, this method produces a recognition accuracy of nearly 100%, in contrast to other methods based on data mining classifiers. The proposed method is accurate, very flexible and adaptable to a dynamic environment such as the 223Smart Home\224 and we believe that it deserves further attention I  INTRODUCTION 
  he world population of people over the age of 65 is growing rapidly at a rate of 800,000 per month. As a consequence, the healthcare and elderly-care market already constitutes a major part of the economy and it will only 
expand in years to come. Recent advances in sensor technology, cellular networks and information technology promise to improve the well-being of the elderly by assisting them in their everyday activities and monitoring their health status, thus enabling them to lead their lives to a larger extent independently from healthcare institutions and caretakers However, the comparatively slow adoption of such systems indicates that there are certain factors prohibiting their acceptance. For example, most home-care systems monitor the health of individuals suffering from diagnosed chronic diseases \(heart disease lung disorders, diabetes etc.\ such, they depend on customized, costly, and difficult to use equipment, such as cardio graphic monitors 
often limiting patient mobility. Less attention has been given to monitoring and maintaining the personal wellness of elderly people who have not been diagnosed with any serious or chronic disease and who, therefore, wish or should be encouraged to live a normal life. The quality of life of this population depends upon, and may decline as a result of, combined and \(in some cases\ot easily measurable physical and psychological factors. Existing work in improving their lives is limited to interactive facilities for consultation with doctors, which, while simplifying regular examinations, do not take advantage of the potential offered by the advances in information and communication 
 This research has been supported in part by project ARCHANGEL through a Cell Phone as a Platform for Healthcare award from Microsoft Research technologies While sudden changes and, more generally, unexpected patterns in the everyday activities of the elderly are difficult to detect via medical data only, it is very likely that i\ch unexpected patterns can be detected by combining machine learning and input from a larger variety of sensors, and that ii\ey can be used as signs that a certain disease, illness or health condition is getting worse, or is about to occur. Of course, detecting these early signs is far from trivial especially if we consider the uniqueness of each individual\222s 
personality, routine, and the diverse effects of different diseases upon this routine. Furthermore, the quest for early detection should not come at the cost of confining the elderly to their homes or limiting their everyday activities  nor should it rely on the assumption that the elderly will have to learn to control complex equipment  Unfortunately, researchers do not currently have the tools to recognize human activities using a set of simple, easy to install ubiquitous sensors, nor do they understand what modifications are necessary in pattern recognition algorithms to achieve this  But, if it is possible to develop systems that recognize an individual\222s everyday activities 
researchers may be able to automatically detect changes in the behavioral patterns of people at home that indicate declining health The aim of our work is to create a smart system that will be adaptable to individuals will be able to recognize their activities and will improve their well being by raising alarms when a potential departure from routine or desirable behavior is detected \(for example, the individual did not eat lunch or appears to not take their medication at prescribed times\ other words, the smart system will be trained to recognize the activities of an individual inside his or her personal space. With this approach, the monitored individual plays a critical role in the system\222s training as the system 
learns to distinguish the everyday activities and habits of each person In this paper, we present and study a method of indoor everyday activity recognition based on the data mining technique of association rules and Allen\222s temporal relations 4 e also p r esen t a si m p l e activ it y reco g n itio n  m e t h o d  based on the C4.5 classification algorithm 9] an d  compare it with our method based on association rules This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communic\ations Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE CCNC 2\010 proceedings

II  D ATA S ETS  According to individual\222s actions can be characterized and grouped in certain categories based on her everyday habits. The analysis of data acquired by recording the everyday activities of individuals using \223tape on and forget\224 sensors in private spaces, presented in 3 h o w s  that we can detect and identify certain activities of the monitored individual with an accuracy of up to 89%. The identified activities can be processed to produce a useful image of the everyday habits of the monitored persons The results presented in e re bas e d on dat a  obt ai n e d from the everyday activities of two individuals, 30 and 80-year-old respectively. The set of actions recorded in their private spaces was obtained by sensors positioned in nearly 80 different locations inside their apartments. These actions were then grouped in categories, which helped make the processing of the samples easier, with the final aim being the extraction of in-home patterns of common activities. This data set has been made public by the research team and is therefore used in our study as an important input for the custom in-home models that we will produce to test the system\222s sensor-based algorithm III  D EFINITIONS  A  Association Rules An association rule finds relationships among large sets of data items. Association rules indicate the attribute value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset In association analysis, the antecedent and consequent of a rule are two sets of items \(called itemsets\ that are disjoint An association rule includes two numbers that express the degree of uncertainty about the rule. The first number is called the support for the rule. The support is simply the number of transactions that include all items in the antecedent and consequent parts of the rule; the support is sometimes expressed as a percentage of the total number of records in the database. The second number is called the confidence of the rule. The confidence is the ratio of the number of transactions that include all items in the consequent as well as the antecedent \(i.e., the support\ to the number of transactions includ ing all items in the antecedent only B  Temporal Relations Activities in a smart environment include physical activities as well as interactions \(with objects\r example activities may include walking, resting on a couch and using the coffee-machine. An important observation made in  upon which we base our approach, is that these activities are not instantaneous, but have distinct start and end times. In addition, well-defined time relations exist between the events constituting an activity. These time relations can be represented using Allen\222s temporal relations. Allen proposed describing activity scenarios with time relations and presented a set of temporal relations between events \(see Figure 1 for some examples T h es e tem poral relation s  are important in the determination of the monitored user\222s indoor activities and can be used for knowledge and pattern discovery in day-to-day activities  Figure 1: The most important temporal relations used for our method IV  A CTIVITY R ECOGNITION  A  Detecting Temporal Relations The first step in activity recognition is to process the raw data to find the temporal relations between sensor events This is achieved by using a simple algorithm which takes the timestamp of each event that occurred, using the available data [2 an d id en tify i n g th e t e m p o r al relatio n s h i p s b et w ee n  pairs of consecutive events based on the constraints formulated in Figure 1. The pseudo code for the temporal analyzer tool is described in the following algorithm In p ut sensor events, start time, end time of events Repeat While  This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communic\ations Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE CCNC 2\010 proceedings 002  Unprocessed  Event    Find Start & End time of next event  Compare Start & End times of past and next event  Identify relation type between event pair from the possible relation types \(see Figure 1  Record those 2 sensors \(IDs\e the temporal relation  Increment Event Pointer \(go to the next event  Loop Until end of Events  For example, assume that we are given as input the following consecutive events Date   Start   End   Sensor Object Room 109    13624  19148   137   5    2 109    15939  18176   109   5    9 i.e  19/4/2003 3:47:04 1:32:04 137  Door Bathroom 19/4/2003 4:25:39  0:37:17  109  'Light' 'Bathroom The output of the algorithm will be the following temporal relation between sensors 137 and 109 


 223109 DURING 137\224  The key premise of our work is that each activity can be described with such a set of temporal relations. In particular we have noticed that similar ac tivities lead to the appearance of a common set of temporal relations between specific sensors. In other words, if we can isolate the most important temporal relations characterizing activities, it would be easy to describe any activity with high prediction accuracy. The solution to this problem is based on data mining techniques and the association rules B  Mining Association Rules In order to create association rules we use the Weka tool  Us in g t h e A p riori alg o rithm 6] of th is tool, w e can identify the most important temporal relations associated with each activity. More specifically, we first provide as input to the Weka tool the temporal relations which describe a specific activity in the following format SensorID_X - SensorID_Y  Relation S_141-S_98,        DURING S_137-S_141,      AFTER S_141-S_137,      DURING S_110-S_141,      AFTER S_137-S_110,      DURING S_112-S_137,      OVERLAPBY S_106-S_112,      DURING  Based on this set of input temporal relations, the Weka tool outputs the most important association rules for the activity. In particular, the output of the Weka tool for a particular activity has the following format 1. S_141-S_141  29 ==> Relation=AFTER 29 conf:\(1 2. S_101-S_101  15 ==> Relation=AFTER 15 conf:\(1 3. S_115-S_115  4 Relation=AFTER 4 conf:\(1 4. S_100-S_141  3 Relation=AFTER 3 conf:\(1 5. S_100-S_100  3 Relation=AFTER 3 conf:\(1 6. S_137-S_137  5 Relation=AFTER 4 conf:\(0.8  For example, the events in rule 1 appeared 29 times in temporal relations in this activity, in all cases the AFTER relation, therefore the confidence of this association rule is 29/29 = 1. In contrast, for rule 6 we had 5 appearances of the events, only 4 of which were in the AFTER relation therefore this association rule has a confidence of 4/5 = 0.8 From the association rules in the Weka output, we choose those rules providing the desired support support  minsup and confidence confidence minconf as the ones that can best characterize the input activity C  Detecting Activities Using to the procedure described above, we discover the most important temporal relations between successive pairs of sensors. We can then use a simple algorithm to detect the type of the activity represented by a sequence of temporal relations between successive events by calculating the importance degree for each activity. The importance degree for an activity is the sum of confidence percentages for the association rules of the activity detected in the data set For example, assume an activity that can be described based on the association rules of the previous example above. If Rule 1 and Rule 6 appear in the input 3 times and 2 times, respectively, then the activity\222s importance degree will be  1 x 3 + 0.8 x 2 = 4.6  The activity with the highest importance degree is the most preponderant and, probably, the one actually performed V  E XPERIMENTS AND R ESULTS  For the experimental evaluation of our association rules technique we use the following scheme. Using a set of events for each activity, we initially produce the temporal relations between successive events and find the most important temporal relations, based on the association rules. Then using the most important temporal relations for each activity we try to recognize the activities that were actually executed Activity recognition is always based on the importance degree which characterizes each activity As discussed above, the available data used in our work [2 n s i s t o f acti v ities th at w ere reco rd ed in t w o  different apartments for different people. Thus, we executed our experiments for each one of the individuals and present separately the activity recognition results. It should be noted that the monitored individuals themselves indicated the activities they were performing during the monitoring process out of a given  set of activities, therefore we have a concrete benchmark against which to test our scheme It is important to notice that all these experiments were executed using variable lower bounds of support support minsup because the number of events in each activity sometimes differed from one another. For example let us assume an activity with temporal relations that are reused a maximum of three \(3\mes. If the lower bound of support is five \(5\or all the activities, it is impossible for the Apriori algorithm [6 o u tp u t te m p o r al relatio n s t h at are  reused less than five \(5\mes. Therefore, depending on the number of events in each activity, we use an appropriate lower bound for association rule support. This adaptation seems to be the key to the success of our method A  1 st Data Set \(Home #1 We initially train the system with all available data and then try to discover all the activities in the same data set. In this manner we understand if the system is well trained or not and if it can recognize the dataset that it trained for. In Table I we present the recognition precision for the most important activities. We consider as most important the activities with a large number of occurrences in the data set as these are more likely to lead to concrete conclusions. The accuracy of the method is the ratio of achieved activity recognitions to the total number of activity appearances TABLE I R ECOGNITION OF A CTIVITIES  2  W EEKS T RAINING FOR 2  W EEKS  Accuracy Activity 0.85 Bathing 0.88 Grooming 0.92 Doing laundry 1.0 Preparing lunch 0.5 Toileting This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communic\ations Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE CCNC 2\010 proceedings 


 According to these results, our method achieves good enough detection accuracy, as it approaches 100% in most cases. However, the method does not give equally good results for the Toileting activity. This is the case because of the instability of our data samples. In a large part of these traces, the events that constitute the Toileting activity follow a concrete pattern. This fact strengthens these events\222 place in the most important rules, because of their appearance many times in the samples. Nevertheless, the remaining events of this activity are less frequent, thus they do not affect the association rules. As a result, while half of the events of an activity achieve a very good accuracy rate, the remaining events achieve a pour accuracy rate. This problem reduces the total activity recognition accuracy of our system due to the Toileting activity. A solution for this problem is to also consider less important association rules, something which decreases the value of our method however, since we want to recognize activities based on the important association rules TABLE II R ECOGNITION OF A CTIVITIES  1  W EEK T RAINING FOR 1  W EEK  Accuracy Activity 0.72 Bathing 0.53 Grooming 1.00 Doing laundry 0.72 Preparing lunch 0.86 Toileting  Some researchers believe that one week is a sufficient period for training a system for a smart environment. For this reason, we also trained our system based on the data from the first week and evaluated the system\222s recognition accuracy based on the data from the second week. This time, our results were not expected to be as spectacular as before, as we tried to discover activities with events that are probably unknown, as they do not appear in the training data \226 they only appear during the second week. However, the results shown in Table II, contrary to our expectations, indicate that the recognition accuracy is actually quite good B  2 nd Data Set \(Home # 2 We next examine the quality of the method and its precision in activity recognition over the data from the second home. Again, we first train the system using all available data and then try to discover all the activities from the same data set. In Table III we present the recognition precision of our method for the most important activities TABLE III R ECOGNITION OF A CTIVITIES  2  W EEKS T RAINING FOR 2  W EEKS  Accuracy Activity 0.93 Preparing breakfast 0.53 Preparing lunch 0.55 Listening to music 0.91 Toileting 0.75 Watching TV  Based on these results, we conclude that in the second home the method behaves overall satisfactorily. However this is not the case for all the activities. In Table III, the activities Preparing Lunch and Listening to Music barely exceed an accuracy rate of 50%. An explanation for this problem is that these two activities contain events which also appear in other activities. For example, during the activity Listening to Music the monitored individual may simultaneously be preparing something to eat or visiting the bathroom. Even if these events \(actions\ of the e.g Preparing Breakfast or Toileting activities, the main activity is Listening to Music This is perhaps the major problem of our data set and unfortunately, it is not easy to overcome. The main cause of the "erroneous" event classification is the way that the events were originally classified by the monitored persons themselves. In addition the Preparing Lunch activity contains some important events, which are also included in the Preparing Breakfast activity. Since the Preparing Breakfast activity will probably be marked with a higher importance degree, the system will not give the Preparing Lunch activity such a high importance. A solution for this problem is a more careful and intelligent retrieval of association rules for activities TABLE IV R ECOGNITION OF A CTIVITIES  1  W EEK T RAINING FOR 1  W EEK  Accuracy Activity 0.10 Preparing breakfast 0.64 Preparing lunch 1.00 Listening to music 1.00 Toileting 1.00 Watching TV  The next experiment is again based on training the system with the first week\222s data and evaluating its prediction ability using the second week\222s data. In this experiment, we expect very good results, because most of the important events for the first week constitute the most important information for the complete data set. The results obtained from that experiment \(seen in Table IV\erify our predictions by presenting high event recognition accuracy. Nevertheless we observe an inversion in the accuracy for the Preparing Breakfast and Preparing Lunch activities  Contrary to the previous experiment, the Preparing Breakfast activity results in an excessively low percentage \(10%\ contrast to the high increase of the percentage for the Preparing Lunch 64%\ity. As before Preparing Lunch and Preparing Breakfast are related activities difficult to distinguish. This observation becomes very obvious with the results of this experiment, where the accuracy reduction for one activity results in an accuracy increase for the other. This is due to our choice to emphasize the most important temporal relations between events \(via the association rules\te however that if we were to group the similar activities Preparing Lunch and Preparing Breakfast into a single activity \(perhaps Preparing Meal we would end-up with a recognition accuracy of 85% for the grouped activity This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communic\ations Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE CCNC 2\010 proceedings 


VI  C LASSIFICATION METHOD  An alternative method for activity recognition is to take into account the combination between the sensors that appear in the activities and the number of their occurrences in each activity. For example, the TV sensor is activated 4 times in the activity Watching TV For this particular scheme, we consider appropriate data mining techniques and employ the corresponding classification technique We used again the Weka tool [7 o r clas s i f i cat ion purposes. We organized the input data for Weka in a file of records defining for each activity the number of times that a sensor was activated, as described in Table V. The first line shows the sensors participating in the activity, while the second line shows the number of occurrences for each sensor in the corresponding activity TABLE V I NPUT F ORMAT FOR C LASSIFICATION S CHEME  Sensor 51 ... 75 ... 141 Activity  Events 2, ..., 3 5 Watching TV  After organizing the data for all the activities using the aforementioned procedure, we applied as the classification scheme the J48 algorithm supported by Weka [10  classification algorithm C4.5  T h is alg o rit h m J48  produced the best results in our experiments among various other classification algorithms VII  C LASSIFICATION VS  ASSOCIATION RULES  In general, activity recognition using association rules produced better results than classification. Table VI supports this statement for the first dataset \(Home #1\. Note that for the classification scheme we used 60% of the dataset for training, i.e. more than one week, and 40% for testing the accuracy of the algorithm, as this provided the best accuracy TABLE VI A CCURACY F OR E ACH M ETHOD H OME 1 Association Rules Classification J48 Activity 0.72 1.00 Bathing 0.53 0.158 Grooming 1.00 0.80 Doing_laundry 0.72 0.00 Preparing_lunch 0.86 0.824 Toileting  As we can see from Table VI, association rules are superior compared to the classification method. The latter is only better in the Bathing activity, but even for this activity the association rules provided a satisfactory result. We should also add that the result of zero success for the classification method in recognizing the Preparing Lunch activity is due to the activities distribution of our data: there are not enough Preparing Lunch activities into the second 40% of the dataset for the classification experiment Association rules also produced better results for the second dataset \(Home #2\s depicted in Table VII. Note that for the classification scheme we used 70% of the dataset for training, and 30% for testing the accuracy of the algorithm, as this provided the best accuracy. We observe that the only activity where problems arise for the association rules is Preparing Breakfast This situation is again caused by our data set \(i.e Preparing Lunch and  Preparing Breakfast are related activities difficult to distinguish\d demands further special treatment in order to be addressed TABLE VII A CCURACY F OR E ACH M ETHOD H OME 2 Association Rules Classification J48 Activity 0.10 0.667 Preparing breakfast 0.64 0.571 Preparing lunch 1.00 0.667 Listening to music 1.00 0.909 Toileting 1.00 0.60 Watching_TV VIII  C ONCLUSIONS  The experimental results presented in this paper support our claim that our method based on association rules constitutes a very good choice in the field of activity recognition. For some basic activities this method produces a recognition accuracy of nearly 100%, in contrast to classification methods e d on dat a  m i ni ng cl a s s i f i er s   These classification methods gave a maximum recognition accuracy of 89% via the use of simple classifiers such as the Na\357ve Bayes classifier. In this paper we also considered another simple method for activity recognition, based on the C4.5 classifi  J48 in  th e Wek a T oolk it h is  classification technique provided good results, but not as good as the method based on association rules For certain activities, however, the association rule method met with a low rate of success. Since we do have reasonable explanations for these results, we believe that the proposed method is appropriate and one can further improve the accuracy of the system with additional manipulations In conclusion, the association rules method is more accurate, flexible and adaptable in a dynamic environment such as the \223Smart Home.\224 Therefore, it deserves further attention and related research in this direction is needed R EFERENCES  1  A.

only, and concepts with words The corpus of the PubMed abstracts that used in the experim ents is consists of 10000 biomedical abstracts with keyword search breast cancer treatments and side effects   All experim e nts are applied on the 10000 docum ents after divided them into six documentsets 50, 100, 500, 1000 5000, and all 10000 documents. The systems are implemented by using VS .Net 2005 \(C#\a nd the experiments were performed on Intel Core2 Duo, 1.8 GHz system with Windows XP and 2 Giga of RAM A large number of association rules can be extracted by sel ecting the values of minimum support and confidence in the mining process.  The D-EART system gives the best results by using low support and high confidence values Moreover, the number of concepts that entered to the mining process is fewer by using the fuzzy weighting schema. Table V shows the experiments that are applied on various documentsets by different threshol d values. It noticed that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is useful and always less than that in Apriori-concept system The reason returns to the strong effect of using the fuzzy weighting schema in D-EART system Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show that the execution time of Aprioriconcep t system is increased regular ly when the documentsets are increased compared to D-EART system. The mining process in Apriori-word system takes more time for less number of concepts in the documents. The reason is that the mining process in Apriori algor ithm depends on the size of documents rather than the number of concepts. The results show that the execution time of Apriori-concept system is about seventh fold of D-EART system. The D-EART system scans the documents only one time as the number of documents increased. Therefore the size of documents does not influence in the mining process. Finally, the results reveal that the execution time for D-EART system is much better than that of the Apriori-concept system in all cases  TABLE  V   T HE  N UMBER  OF  A SSOCIATION  R ULES  FOR  A PRIORIC ONCEPT  AND  D EART  S YSTEMS Minimum Support s  Minimum Confidence c  No. of Documents Systems s 1 c 50 3 50 7 60 10 50 500 Apriori-concept D-EART 183 71 76 31 17 5 10 2 1000 Apriori-concept D-EART 227 86 91 34 11 4 8 3 5000 Apriori-concept D-EART 239 92  75 27 20 4 15 2 10000 Apriori-concept D-EART 345 135 102 39 37 10 30 7   D5000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 9 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=5000 D10000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 10 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=10000 V  C ONCLUSIONS  AND  F UTURE  W ORK This paper presented a new text mining system for extracting ass o ciation rules based on concepts representation from online textual documents. This system overcame some of the problems in the prev ious EART system and the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by using the data structure hash table in the mining process. The results of comparing DEART and Apriori-concept syst ems reveal that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is always less than that in Apriori-concept system. Moreover, the execution time for D-EART system is mu ch better than that of Aprioriconcept system in all cases. So concept technique would be suitable to apply to any large corpus of medical text such as portions of the web.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
