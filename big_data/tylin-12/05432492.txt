To deal with the problem, data mining based intrusion detection methods have been the hot fields in intrusion detection research. An outlier mining base d adaptive intrusion detection 
framework is proposed in this paper. In the proposed framework, the outliers are firs tly detected by similarity coefficient. And then, the cluster s are built on the detected outlier data set and the improved association rule algorithm is employed on the clusters. Finally, the rules generated by association rule algorithm will be adaptively added into the current intrusion detection rule base. The experiments performed on simulated data and KDD99 from UCI data set have shown the effectiveness of proposed methods  Keywords-Artificial intelligence; Intrusion detection Outlier mining; Anomaly detection; Self -Adaptive I  INTRODUCTION 
Existing intrusion detection systems are two main categories: Signature-based misusing detection or rule-based detection such as Snort; the other is anomaly-based detection, or behaviour-based such as MADAM ID, LERAD. However, they both have limited usefulness. The misusing detection has good efficient and low false positives, but there ex ist the problem of signature update, intrusion varieties and high missing rate; Anomaly based detection have better generality, especially it can detection unknown intrusion, yet this method have high false alarm rate, itís difficulty to analysis whether the anomaly come from the intrusio n, furthermore, is the problems of concept drif ting and pseudo attack  
The anomaly detection mines the intrusion pattern by detecting the system abnormal behaviours. Although there exists much limitation in pr actical application, it will play important role in the intrusion detection if we have broken through in efficiency and accuracy. Also, as Julish decrypted in t h e a nom aly detection base d on data mining has an unpractical assu mption: the availability and quality of the train set. Because the environment of the IDS changes dynamically with the time, itís an absolute essential that the IDS model is self adaptive, and then the IDS would have a good performance for long time 
This paper builds an intelligent IDS model by using the sophisticated algorithms in machine learning Furthermore, the self-adaptive intrusion detection framework first make the anomaly detection in intrusion behaviour, and then, introducing the outlier mining clustering and association analysis to efficiently detect unknown attraction behaviour II  OUTLIER MINING IN INTRUSION DETECTION   Outlier mining is an important research branch in data mining; its task is to find small groups of data objects that are exceptional when compared with rest large amount of 
data. Outlier Mining can be decrypted two steps: \(1\given a dataset, how to define the exceptional conception and whatís it; \(2\how to dig the outliers efficiently In this paper, an algorithm for outlier detection based on similar coefficient sum is applied is decrypted as follow Given the domain 12    n X xx x for any element 12     1 2 n

Beyond that, the web data is continual and changi ng dynamically. And so, an improved algorithm based on width fixed moving window method is proposed in this paper. The window width is the fixed data packet number w, the moving unit i when new i  packets reach, the window slide a unit packets Two points are worth noting. One is the data pre-process with standardization and normalization methods. The other is that the will directly affect the quality of the outlier detection. The small will result in a high false detection rate; in contrast, the high will give a high false negative rate. The higher is set in actual use and so, system will initially have a higher false negative rate, however, with following self-adaptive algorithm, the system can learn the potential association from the detected outliers, and by applying the association, the false negative rate will reduce gradually III  SELF-ADAPTIVE IDS FRAMEWORK When the outliers of the network activity are found by outlier mining, if applying association analysis to these detected irregular outliers, not only do the threshold of association analysis algorithm set difficultly, but also this algorithm has little effect in the detection of the abnormal network data packets. Therefore cluster algorithm are applied to the detected outliers firstly, and then, the improved association analysis is employed on the clusters and extract the potential assoc iation to generate the rule  furthe rm ore, conve r t the rules int o s p ecific rul es  which the IDS can use directly, and so the system has the advantages of self adaptability finally A  Improved Apriori algorithm  The improved association rule AprioriTi is used in this paper. The whole association analysis consists of three steps: data preprocess, association rules generating and rules conversion 1  Data Pre-process: The input data maybe are log records or network data packets generated by IDS, in general they contain many attribute fields, however not all fields are suit to association analysis 2  Association Rules Generating: AprioriTid is used to find all the frequent item set and the association rules, and there are two parameters \(support and confidence\n AprioriTid. Normally, the higher support, the more frequent items generated; the higher confidence, the more accurate the association rules 3  Rules Conversion: Generally speaking, the above association rules canít be applied directly into specific IDS before rules conversion becaus e of their inconsistent rule syntax. Take for example, Snort, its detection rules consist of rule head and rule option. The rule head contains process type, protocol type, source IP address, source port etc, and the rule option contains data content and data packet option and so on. When ru les conversion, the fields in association rules which are relevant to th e Snort rule head and rule option are put together and form new rules Snort can use  B  Self-adaptive IDS Framework based on outlier mining In this work, self-adaptive IDS framework based on outlier mining is built according to the AMG \(Adaptive model generation\proposed by Eskin  And the  w h ole framework is shown in Figure-1 At first, the Sniffer captures data packet of network and supplies to the intrusion detection engine which detect whether the invasion of the activities of the packets according to the rule set. If it is intrusion, then tags the data label and adds the labelled data into the outlier mining dataset; if not, put the data into the dataset directly. Here

  the label is to indicate whether the packet is anomaly and will be used in the later cluster. And the is  used to cluster the outlier set Then, AprioriTid is employed for each cluster to discover the potential association rules in all attributes of abnormal network data packets. Finally, the discovered association rule will be converted into the rule IDS can use directly  Data captured by Sniffer Standardizatio n and normalization Anomaly detection with outlier mining Is Outlier IDS Is Abnormal Data No, unlabelled data Alert Yes No Over Association analysis with AprioriTid Yes Rule conversion Add the rule into Snort ruleset Intrusion Detection Ruleset Outlier detection data set Labelled data Outlier set Clustering the outliers with DBSCAN Is Outlier number over the threshold Yes No  Figure 1  Self-adaptive IDS Framework based on outlier mining IV  EVALUATION The experiment consists of two parts. The first is used to show the validity of the proposed outlier mining algorithm based on KDD99 of UCI dataset; in the other experiment, the platform was based on IDS Snort and IDS Informer was employed to simulate the attack and test A  Experiment of outlier mining In the KDD cup99 dataset, each record consists of 41 discrete or continuous attributes \(e.g.: connection duration protocol type, etc.\nd the class type \(normal and the detail attack type such as Probe R2L, U2R and DoS and etc.\t all the attributes are useful for the detection, Srinivas Mukkamala et al ndic a ted that the m o st im portant attributes of the KDD99 dataset are the 13 attributes such as duration, src_bytes, same_srv_rate, dst_host_count, urgent dst_host_same_src_port_rate dst_bytes, srv_count, count dst_host_srv_count, dst_host_s ame_srv_rate, protocol_type and service, where the field attributes are discrete or continuous, and this experiment is based on the 13 attributes. In the experiments, there are 4 group data set which contains 100000 normal records and 5000 intrusion records for each attack type, and the parameters are set as follows: window_width=10 00, slide_unit=10, the experiment is shown in Tab le 1. The proposed outlier mining algorithm has an excellent detection and false-alarm rates on the Dos and Probe attack types; instead, for the R2L and U2R, the result is no t satisfactory. However, in the KDD99 cup, the detection and false-alarm rates of the winnerís algorithm were 13.2% and 8.4% respectively TABLE I  Detection result on the same intrusion data with the different DR: Detection Rate; FAR: False Alarm Rate DOS R2L U2R Proble DR FAR DR FAR DR FAR DR FAR 6 100 4.2 45.1 4.2 38.1 5.52 100 4.18 7 100 4.1 40.2 3.6 33.4 4.52 100 3.0 8 100 3.9 40.1 2.46 28.7 4.49 100 2.34 9 100 2.5 35.0 1.23 19.1 3.58 100 1.63 10 95 1.5 24.5 0.2 14.3 2.04 100 0 11 0 0 12.7 0 4.76 1.43 100 0 B  Experiment of Self-Adaptive IDS  Snort was used as the platform IDS because of its lightweight open source and scalability. And the outlier mining and association analysis modules were integrated into Snort with the form of in telligent plugin so that Snort can detect the unknown intrusion activity In the experiment, 11 basic attributes\(source ip and port, destination ip and port ,p rotocol type, data field length Tcp flags \(4 fields\ \nd 5 ex tension attributes\(connection duration, connection frequency, data payload length payload mean, payload variance\were selected for the outlier mining and cluster. Because the Snort rule set only contains the basic attributions, the association analysis only based on the basic attributions. The parameters were set as follows 9, window_width=1000, slide_unit=10 support=20%, confidence=80%. Snort and IDS Informer was deployed on 192.168.10.10 and 192.168.10.20 respectively. Only parts of the re sult were listed in Figure.2 and Figure.3 for the limitation of space

   Figure 2  Two exported rules examples with outliers mining algorithm for the IDS Informer attack data  Figure 3  IDS Detection results for the variant attack of IDS Informer with the exported rules The new IDS can generate association rules by anglicizing the log records with feature generator. Further more, the rules were converted into Snort detection rules so that Snort is capable to detect the known attack variants and unknown attack V  CONCLUSION We have proposed a novel algorithm of self-adaptive intrusion detection based on outlier mining which integrates the association analysis of outlier data and intrusion detection. Experimental results show that the proposed self-adaptive IDS is able to detect unknown attack more efficiently and accurately. Our future work will focus on the improvement of outlier mining algorithm ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 60973120 and No 60903073, by the National High-Tech Research and Development Plan of China under Grant No 2007AA01Z440, by Research and Development Project on Application Technology of Sichuan under Grant No 2008GZ0009 REFERENCES    Julish K, Data mining for intrusion detection: A critical review IBM, Kluwer, Boston, MA, Res.

F k  1  found in the  k  1 th pass are used to generate the candidate ruleitems C k using the condidateGen function It then scans the database and updates various support counts of the candidates in C k  After those new frequent ruleitems have been identiìed to form Fk the algorithm then produces the rules CAR k using the genRules function Finally rule pruning is performed on these rules The candidateGen Algorithm 2 function is similar to the function Apriorigen in algorithm Apriori  Algorithm 2 Generating candidate set 1 for all itemsets c  C k do 2 for all k-1 s of c do 3 if s   F k then 4 delete c from C k 5 end if 6 end for 7 end for If for example the following set contains the set of itemsets in a 3-frequent ruleitems and it is required to generate C 4  F 3   123    124    134    135    234  After candidate generation  1234    1345  and after pruning  1234   Moreover the set containing  12 34  is pruned from the candidate set because  145  and  345  are not found in F 3  The ruleSubset function takes a set of candidate ruleitems C k and a data case d to nd all the ruleitems in C k whose condsets are supported by d  This and the operations in the next three lines are also similar to those in algorithm Apriori The dif ference is that we need to increment the support counts of the condset and the ruleitem separately whereas in algorithm Apriori only one count is updated This allows us to compute the conìdence of the ruleitem  The nal set of class association rules is in CAR s  The remaining rules after pruning are in prCAR s  Once the CAR is built the Classiìer consumes it to identify user activities The classiìer needs to have multiple passes through the CAR database To positively contribute to the efìciency of the classiìcation algorithm a number of data structures are used to contain and manipulate the database for faster access In line with this the classiìer building algorithm in is used IV P ROTOTYPE I MPLEMENTATION AND E XPERIMENT We implemented a prototype system using J2ME in order to evaluate our approach discussed for developing the pervasive end application The mobile device side application is comprised of user interface components speciìcally adapted to the device to read inputs and display formatted outputs to the users Figures 4\(a and 4\(b show the interfaces used for registering medical information and viewing medical record of patients respectively Whenever requests are sent via a Wi-Fi connection to the server the Apache web container delivers the requests to the server side application and responses to the client mobile device We used Java Servlets to implement the server side application and the Servlets are responsible to respond to the requests after communicating with the MRS i.e Medical Record Store as required The MRS is implemented using MySQL Server The underlying hardware infrastructure setup includes a Palm PDA with IEEE802.11 Wi-Fi and PalmOS3.5 operating system on the client mobile device On the server side a Wi-FI enabled PC with Microsoft Windows XP SP2 was used We used a number of data structures in order to improve the efìciency of the classiìcation The central data structures for the implementation of our algorithm are Set List and Map which are collections in Java Set collection is used to maintain collections of the datasets from the database Each entry of our Set contains a List object each representing collection of cases for each distinct attribute in the database This has great performance advantage since we can nd all the items in the Set object rather than making multiple scans of the database Map is the other important collection we have implemented for maintaining the frequent ruleitems i.e F k  and rules i.e CAR k  The key of the Map objects for F k and CAR k are Set objects representing our condset  Since it is not possible to have multiple keys the keys can simply be maintained in a Set object For constructing the class association rules we used twenty record sample noise-free dataset of a single user i.e a medical doctor The noise free dataset is required to avoid modeling wrong information When the dataset is collected from the on-spot usage environment if an abnormal usage is registered as a normal usage the model nally includes this abnormal usage as a normal usage resulting in a poisoned model that misleads the classiìer Table I shows a sample dataset that contains different requests at different time ranges to access the vital signs record Each record is tagged with either the normal or abnormal class category Table I S

rule 1 and is used as a normal usage proìle for that speciìc user Note that to generate the association rules for the normal records we run the RuleGenerator module which is a Java class of our system on demand basis 1 Note that the entire generated association rule contains over 300 records for the purpose of demonstration we only show a small subset 


a Patientês follow up data registration b Viewing patientês treatment information Figure 4 Example Pervasive Medical Application On rule ID76 for example we have the rule condition timeStamp  ntrequestT ype  readlocation  room 12 with support 15.00 and conìdence 50.00 As explained in Section III-B thus this indicates rule timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read location  room 12 normal  supt 15  00  conf d 50  00  Table II S AMPLE OF GENERATED A SSOCIATION R ULES   ID Rule Condition Support  Conìdence  1 clienName:doctor1 50 50 3 clienAddr:127.00.1 50 50 8 requestType:read 50 66.67 12 timeStamp:am 25 50 56 clientAddr:127.0.0.1 recordID:105 10 50 76 timeStamp:nt requestType:read location:room12 15 50 90 requestType:read dataSource:vital-signs timeStamp:am 25 100 Based on the noise-free sample dataset used for rule generation and the above rule we can say that 15.00 of cases in the dataset contain timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read location  room 12 and are labeled normal The support value in this case tells us that with respect to the whole dataset used for rule generation only 15.00 include the data timeStamp  ntrequestT ype  readlocation  room 12 and they belong to the normal class category By this we mean that reading patient record at night from room number 12 has only 15.00 normalcy support In addition the conìdence value indicates 50.00 of the cases in the dataset containing timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read,location  room 12 are labeled with normal class category This refers to considering only those entries in the dataset which contain timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read location  room 12 and out of these only half of them are tagged with the normal class category This simply means that only half of the cases of reading patient record at night from room number 12 is normal Considering another example on rule ID90 requestT ype  read dataSource  vital  signs timeStamp  am with support 25.00 and conìdence 100.00 This corresponds to the rule requestT ype  read,dataSource  vital  signs timeStamp  am  normal  supt 25  conf d   The rule tells us that one fourth of the data in the dataset used for rule generation contain the data requestT ype  read dataSource:vital-signs timeStamp  am and are normal Hence reading patients vital sign records in the morning has a quarter normalcy support Such a conìdence shows that 100 of the cases in the dataset contain requestT ype  read dataSource  vital  signs timeStamp  am and all of them are agged to be normal This rule means that 15.00 of cases in the dataset contain timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read location  room 12 and are labeled normal and 50.00 of the cases in the dataset that contain timeStamp  nt requestT ype  read location  room 12 are labeled with normal class category Notice that all the rules are not selected based on minimum conìdence and support For example for the precision of the classiìer which is based on the rules for normalcy conìdence percentages could be xed with values more than 90 Finally taking the rules generated our classiìer identiìes based on the proìle maintained for the speciìc user category each request received from the different users as normal or abnormal Afterwards whenever the user sends a request from the mobile device the request is also sent to the 


classiìer in order to identify the nature of the request normal or abnormal based on the normal usage proìle maintained previously Since we used a passive anomaly detector in terms of response action the result of the classiìcation is recorded in the anomaly log database using the ResponseM anager module V R ELATED W ORK A paradigmatic example for how to do host-based IDSs approach is presented in If the system call traces of normal applications are self-similar then it is straightforward to build an IDS that allows to learn the normal behavior of applications and recognizes possible attacks by looking for abnormalities For learning the IDS gathers system call traces from times when the system is not under attack extracts all sub-traces containing consecutive system calls and creates a database of these observed sub-traces which in turn are deemed anomalous if it does not appear within the database In the monitoring the abnormality of a new system call trace is measured by counting how many anomalous sub-traces it contains A process mining framework that utilizes the concept of clinical pathways to facilitate the automatic and systematic construction of an adaptable and extensible detection model is presented in The authors took a data-centric point of view and considered healthcare fraud and abuse detection as a data analysis process This automatic approach eliminates the need to manually analyze and encode behavior patterns as well as the guesswork in selecting statistics measures The proposed framework was evaluated via real-world data to demonstrate its efìciency and accuracy In the authors presented a more-rob ust anomaly detection IDS using data mining techniques The techniques are designed to dynamically model what a normal network should look like at the same time aimed to reduce the false positive and false negative alarm rates in the process Moreover the authors used classiìcation-tree techniques to accurately predict probable attack sessions Overall their goal is to model network trafìc into network sessions and identify those network sessions that have a high-probability of being an attack Various work have been going on mining audit data for IDSs In this area the work closest in spirit to ours can be found in where the authors describes a n o v e l framework name MADAM ID for mining audit data in order to construct models automatically for the intrusion detection The framework compute activity patterns from system audit data and extracts predictive features from the patterns It then applies machine learning algorithms to the audit records that are processed according to the feature deìnitions to generate detection rules Past results on the DARPA ID Evaluation showed that their ID model was one of the best performing of all the participating systems The related works described also several other works in IDSs use several techniques such as machine learning state-machine abstraction process mining and even data mining Our work is not aimed at advancing such approaches Rather it tailors host-based anomaly modeling and detection technique to pervasive healthcare systems and the use of data mining is traced back to the beauty of data mining techniques in extracting patterns from large dataset In this regard pervasive healthcare systems are immediate candidates for data intensive domain We also pointed out that there is lack of tool-support for anomaly-based intrusion detection of pervasive healthcare systems To this end the anomaly detection model and the prototype implementation could help as springboard for the attempt in alleviating tool-support for intrusion detection of pervasive healthcare systems VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we described constructing anomaly detection model based on data mining techniques in a medical pervasive environment for legitimate users Due to the sensitiveness of medical records it must protect medical records both from outsiders and insiders who try to abuse their privileges What we can conclude from this work is that maintaining user activity information for intrusion detection can enhance the role played by the proposed model in protecting a pervasive healthcare system from insider attacks Moreover we demonstrated the algorithmic detail showing the way to accomplish this through maintaining associations between selected attributes to represent normalcy which is required for classiìcation purpose Finally we described the prototype implementation of the proposed model and discussed the results of evaluation Even though we proved that the algorithms devised in the anomaly detection work in practice the evaluation of algorithmic efìciency issues are left as future work The rules generated from a limited number of dataset are very large in number In order to identify an activity as anomalous the data structures used to maintain the rules resides in memory Consequently the speed of the classiìer is boosted at a cost of more memory consumption Another line of future work is to monitor a larger data set to determine the efìciency pattern as the data set size get larger As described in the proposed anomaly detection model we only used the association rule and classiìcation based on association techniques Nevertheless for better detection capabilities it is also advisable to include the sequence

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
