strongest entity associations for each slice of the document collection

I I NTRODUCTION Millions of bloggers author in excess of 5 million blog posts daily where they comment upon a wide variety of private matters and public on-going events This collective 322discussion\323 takes place in a semi-anonymous manner as bloggers typically reveal their demographic pro\336le age gender occupation location Valuable knowledge can be extracted from such usergenerated data by identifying the stories and events currently capturing the attention of different demographics Consider an emerging crisis situation like the fatal 2008 Listeriosis outbreak in Canada It would be invaluable for both the authorities and citizens to identify active discussion about such an event before it reaches its climax As another example a new TV series targeted at 
US teenagers is launched An advertiser could compare the stories discussed by different groups of teenagers and identify surprising divergences e.g that the series is surging in popularity among female teenagers 
meta-data 
e.g blogger demographics The key observation is that related documents capturing the same story mention approximately the same group of core entities E.g blog posts discussing the Canadian 322Listeriosis\323 out break mention the disease in conjunction with 322Public Health Agency of Canada\323 and locations like 322Toronto\323 By identifying such groups of 
for each demographic segment 
 i.e groups of entities that are recurrently mentioned together we implicitly detect the underlying event of which they are the main actors Strong entity associations can be computed 
extracted 3 from t he documents\325 textual component and document 
but failing to capture the attention of males In order to provide such intuitive knowledge discovery facilities we leverage mentions of 
strongly associated entities 
and presented on demand along with additional information such as relevant

blog posts as we 322drill-down\323 to the demographic of interest or compared for different demographics 2 To support such 
browsing and exploration of a document collection we need to pre-compute and materialize strong entity associations for all meta-data value combinations that can be possibly requested We refer to the fraction of documents matching a certain meta-data restriction as a

Suppose that entities are sorted in descending order of their frequencies i.e are sorted in descending order of their frequencies the potential of pairs in a row is monotonically non-decreasing from left to right Consequently a threshold for  the corresponding pair potential is monotonically non-decreasing from left to right Figure 2\(c illustrates darker shades of gray signify higher pair potential The direction of the arrow is the direction of decreasing pair potential Note that high-potential elements are concentrated towards the matrix diagonal Lemma 2 provides a guaranteed potential ordering within each matrix row but not for the entire matrix Given two matrix elements entity pairs in different rows we can draw no conclusions about their relat ive potential Still a total pair ordering can be derived by of the corresponding documentlists potential of every pair and identify the ones with The it holds that  Then the document-list in Figure 2\(a The following lemma helps alleviate this limitation Figure 2\(b It should be noted that even among the elements whose corresponding pair potentials exceed threshold will actually be computed The techniques described

most 322\336ne-grained\323 slices all remaining ones can be expressed as the union of other disjoint slices E.g consider a slice which maintains them in descending order of their corresponding potential  We refer to the process of concatenating the document-lists from disjoint slices in order to generate the lists of a new slice as divides a row into two sections pairs on the left that do not have the potential to exceed the threshold and pairs on the right that have the potential to exceed it Figure 2\(b Now pairs that need to be computed are concentrated on the right side of the row and can be accessed using a of the document collection Assembling the relevant document-lists pairs encountered so far are the overall topand its preceding entities and heap using a frontier This is

a 322fragmented\323 image Consider Figure 2\(a Elements corresponding to pairs that have the potential to exceed the association threshold are highlighted in grey This immensely complicates matters since the ef\336cient row-at-a-time approach of computing row elements generates those elements in a well speci\336ed order either left to right or right to left Figure 1\(b Consequently we need to compute all row elements sequentially until we reach the last element that is n eeded In the worst case the entire row will be processed e.g row incrementally performs a reverse-merge and provides row

the frontier have lower potential than those computed so far i.e elements on the right of the frontier Figure 2\(d presents this frontier at three phases during the algorithm\325s execution The threshold process described above is implemented by algorithm T OP E NT  Note that the algorithm has a starting phase where the entire inverted index is populated and iterators pairs The challenge lies in reconciling the incremental descending-potential candidate generation process and the ef\336ci ent row-at-a-time approach to computing entity co-occurrences  k

in these semantic resources such as ontology are made manually In this paper we present a new approach of ontology enrichment based on data mining technics speci“cally the association rules and the use of extracted semantic information to retain relevant new concepts Our approach is based on three steps 1 Preprocessing of a textual corpora cleaning and lemmatising treetagger 2 Creating window size to promote the correlation between corpora words and concepts of the ontology then the application of the APRIORI algorithm to extract association rules according to validated parameters support con“dence 3 Automatic analysing and semantic ltering of generated rules to keep those that are relevant to the initial domain ontology The obtained enrichment results seem auspicious for the chosen domain ontology This approach is sensitive to the domain studied it is important to have a corpora that describes the subject domain accurately so there is a very rich language with nouns and adjectives available Although the company websites do not represent the ideal source for building a such corpora for the domain studied companies competency in the mechanical industry but we have had promising results R EFERENCES  G Berio and M Harzallah T o w ards an inte grating architecture for competence management in Special Issue Competence Management in Industrial Processes guest editors X Boucher E Bonjour N Matta Computers in Industry  vol V58 issue 2 2007  E Ermilo v a and H Afsarmanesh Modeling and management of pro“les and competences in vbes Journal of Intelligent Manufacturing  vol V18 pp 561…586 2007  J Hodik J V okrinek J Biba and P  Becv ar  Competences and pro“les management for virtual organizations creation CEEMAS  pp 93…102 2007  G Pepiot Modlisation des entreprises sur la base des comptences EPFL PhD Thesis   2005  K Neshatian and Hejazi T e x t cate gorization and classi“cation in terms of multi-attribute concepts for enriching existing ontologies Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Information Technology and its Disciplines  pp 43…48 2004  L D Jorio L Abrouk C Fiot D  Hrin and M T eisseire Enrichissement dontologie bas sur les motifs squentiels Actes de la Plateforme AFIA 2007 Atelier Ontologies et gestion de lhtrognit smantique  2007  A F  A and R Steinmetz Ontology enrichment with te xts from the www Proceedings of the 2nd Semantic Web Mining Workshop at ECMLI/PKDD WS02  2006  G Stumme and A H B Berendt Semantic web mining  State of the art and future directions Web Semantics  Science Services and Agents on the World Wide Web  vol 4 n 2 pp 124…143 2006  E Agirre O Ansa E Ho vy  and D Martinez Enriching very large ontologies using the www Proceedings of ECAI 2000 workshop on Ontology Learning  2002  V  P arekh and J G T  Finin Mining domain speci“c te xts and glossaries to evaluate and enrich domain ontologies Proceedings of the International Conference of Information and Knowledge Engineering  2004  R Bendaoud Construction et enrichissement dune ontologie partir dun corpus de textes Actes des Rencontres des Jeunes Chercheurs en Recherche dInformation RJCRI06 Lyon  pp 353…358 2006  A M V  Pekar and S Staab On disco v ering taxonomic relations from the web Journal of Information Retrieval Contextual Information Retrieval Systems  vol Springer Verlag pp 301…322 2002  N Hernandez J Chrisment and D Egret Modeling conte xt through domain ontologies Journal of Information Retrieval Contextual Information Retrieval Systems  vol 10 pp 143 172 2007  R Srikant and R Agra w al Mining generalized association rules Future Generation Computer Systems  vol 13 n 23 pp 161…180 1997  E Han and G Karypis Centroid based document classi“cation  Analysis and experimental results Proceedings of The 4th European Conference of Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery  pp 424…431 2000  K.Hajlaoui X.Boucher  and J J Girardot Competenc y ontology for network building 10th IFIP Working Conference on Virtual Entreprises PRO-VE09  vol Thessaloniki GREECE 2009  H Schmid Probabilistic part-of-speech tagging using decision trees Conference on New Methods in Language Processing Manchester UK  1994  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules in large databases VLDB94  1994  D Do wne y  M Broadhead and O Etzioni Locating complex named entities in Web text In Proceedings of the IJCAI07  pp 2733…2739 2007  M Roche and V  Prince  Acrodef  A quality measure for discriminating expansions of ambiguous acronyms CONTEXT  pp 411…427 2007  B B B A Isaac and R T ronc y  Semantic commitment for designing ontologies In the proceedings of 13th EKAW Conference LNAI of LN  vol Arti“cial Intelligence Springer 2473 pp 114…121 2002 1118 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
