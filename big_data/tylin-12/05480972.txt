Study on Customer Retention under Dynamic Markets Zeling Wang Laboratory of Supply Chain and Industry Engineering School of Economics and Management Tongji University Shanghai P.R.China 200092 wangzeling66@gmail.com Xinghui Lei 1  2 1 Graduate School 2 School of Economics and Management Tongji University Shanghai P.R.China 200092 leixh@online.sh.cn Abstract  Customer retention is increasingly pressing issue in todayís competitive commercial arena This is relevant and important for sales and services related industries Practicing 
customer relationship management CRM demands the ability to explore the strategy of customer retention Despite existing the importance of customer retention to CRM there is a lack of a comprehensive and effective approach to realize it under dynamic markets Identifying customer segments and tracking their change over time mining the pattern of customer segmentation are important applications for companies who need to understand what their customers expect from them now and in the future This is signi  cant for companies who operate in dynamic markets better  tthe 
needs and wants of customers who driven by new innovations and competing products In this paper we present a model for customer retention which accounts for the dynamics of todayís markets Our study provides a new road-map to guide future research concerning the application of data mining techniques in customer retention under dynamic markets Keywords  data mining association rule mining customer relationship management customer retention I I NTRODUCTION Customer retention is an important strategy in modern business to keep a companyís customers and to retain their 
revenue contribution Customer retention is the driving force behind customer relationship management CRM relationship marketing and loyalty marketing Studies across a number of industries have revealed that the cost of retaining an existing customer is only about 10  of the cost of acquiring a new customer so customer retention is essential for a company Customer retention is the central concern for CRM As such traditionally elements of customer retention include one-to-one marketing loyalty programs and complaints management One-to-one marketin g refers to personalized marketing campaigns which are supported by analyzing detect 
ing and predicting changes in customer behaviors Lo yal t y programs involve campaigns or supporting activities which aim at maintaining a long term relationship with customers References a re concerned w ith the d is co v e ry of interes t ing association relationships which are above an interesting threshold hidden in databases  Selected association rules can be used to build a model for predicting the value of a future customer The application of data mining tools in customer retention is an emerging trend in the global economy Analyzing and understanding customer behaviours and characteristics is the foundation of the development of a competitive customer 
retention strategy so as to acquire and retain potential customers and maximize customer value Appropriate data mining tools which are good at extracting and identifying useful information and knowledge from enormous customer databases are one of the best supporting tools for making different customer retention decisions As such the application of data mining techniques in customer retention is worth pursuing in a customer-centric economy When we hear about customer retention we  rstly think about customer segmentation the segmentation approach is to a large extent goal driven and static That means the data that is used has been collected with the assumption that it 
is ultimately relevant for segmentation Data or attributes not considered to be relevant are dropped from the analytical process early on to make cluster analysis feasible and aid the interpretation of detected clusters which is essential to form meaningful segments The danger of this approach is that potentially relevant features are ignored meaning certain segments may not be detected The approach is also static which means that once segments have been established change in those segments is not monitored because of the practical repercussions like regularly running expensive surveys etc This results in missing important trends threats and opportunities because segments can change in several ways New groups can appear disappear merge move shrink or 
grow S econdl y  w e t h i n k a bout as s o ci at i o n r ul es among customers the discovery of interesting changes based on the static customer segmentation In manufacturing and business processes with rising living standards and advances in production capacity the traditional static customer retention mode can no longer effectively meet the needs of customers who are looking for uniqueness innovation and novelty However there is a lack of a comprehensive and effective approach to realize it under dynamic markets

In this paper we use clustering and frequent itemset discovery for detecting interesting pattern in data on different time period We  rst propose a method to improve the reliability of customer segmentation then detect interesting changes in a customer segment by analysing the support of the itemset along the time axis The starting point of such an approach is as follows A timestamped data set is partitioned into intervals along the time axis Frequent itemset discovery is then applied to each of these subsets This yields sequences of support for each itemset which can be analyzed further They allow us to make statements about the future development of a customer segment and thus provide a basis for customer retention II R ELATED WORK A Customer Segmentation Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into homogeneous groups on the basis of common attributes In most application customer segmentation is accomplished by de  ning numerical attributes which describe a customerís value based on economical and market considerations Cluster algorithms are then commonly employed in order to discover groups of customers with similar attribute values Segmentation methods based on clustering require a user to carefully select the used attributes by hand in a tedious process Since the number of used attributes is rather low commonly only two or three the analysis of segment change can still be done manually This might be the reason why to our knowledge no automated approach has been published yet Some approaches have been proposed to analyse changes in customer behavior for instance in retail marketing in an insurance company Thes e a pproaches t ypi cal l y compare two sets of rules generated from datasets of two different periods B Association Rules In the area of association rules the discovery of interesting changes has been studied by several authors  A s s o ci ation rule mining and other methods are often used to discover the patterns of domains For instance Xu et al  emplo y ed association rule mining to  nd the interesting patterns with the help of intuitionistic fuzzy set and 002 cuts in supplier domain In the meantime in order to express the conscientious and careful of academy authors o f reference d eclared that as a poster paper included in the proceedings is not the  nal manuscript but the mistaken submission C Selection Attribute for Customer Segmentation Every customer database has many attributes usually attribute\(feature selection will be important to customer segmentation Its merit lies in the fact that each attribute selected corresponds uniquely to a instance which could become a target of interest itself There are four strategies for the ranking of attribute selection individual ranking group ranking forward selection FS  and backward elimination BE  The individual ranking scheme is the simplest to processing It only considers the individual feature rankings This happens to be one of the most popular as it is computationally most ef  cient It requires an amount of order of O  M   assuming that there are originally M features However it fails to take into account the inter-feature redundancy that abound in data For example it is very possible that the two highest-rank individual features share a great degree of similarity As a result the selection of both features would amount to a wastage of resources This problem can be solved if the exhaustive group ranking is adopted The relevance/redundancy of all the features in a group is examined collectively This of course leads to a truly optimal decision While the group ranking strategy is the only means to yield a truly optimal selection it is computationally prohibitive if not impossible More exactly in order to  nd the best combination of features an exhaustive search would entail each of the 2 M possible combinations So it is rarely adopted in practice because of its demanding com putational cost It is necessary to strike a compromise between these two extreme approaches In this sense one effective solution is the consecutive search appro ach which falls into two main categories FS and BE   Forward Selection Such a search usually begins at an empty feature set and iteratively adds features based on how much added value it brings to the existing subset A key drawback is that once a feature is admitted it cannot be discarded The selection pool is recursively updated as follows S 002 S  where S and S  denote the subsets before and after the update It recursively evaluates every candidate feature to be added into the current set on a one-by-one basis The evaluation considers fully the inter-feature dependence with respect to the current subset  Backward Elimination This approach begins with the full feature set and then eliminate those that do not make a signi  cant contribution i.e those whose absence causes the smallest negative impact in terms of the net information loss A key drawback is that once a feature is eliminated it cannot be reselected in the future The selection pool is recursively updated as follows S 002 S  where S and S  denote the subsets before and after the update It recursively evaluate every features in the current set to be eliminated on a one-by-one basis Such an approach takes into account the inter-feature dependence existing in the current subset Forward selection is usually effective when a relative small number of features from a much larger feature set are to

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
