An Efficient Algorithm for Mining Association Rules from Multiple Databases Guoling Liu, Runian Geng School of Information Science and Technology Shandong Institute of Light Industry Jinan, China maindollar@126.com Abstract The mining objects of traditional mining association rules techniques mainly focus on mono-database. With the rapid development of database technologies, multi-database mining is becoming more and more important. In order to make the synthetic result of multiple data sources more accurate, the parameter C, which indicates the number of transactions in local branch database, is proposed. We design a novel and efficient multi-databases mining algorithm using the parameter C. It can reduce the network congestion and solve the new incremental addition of transaction data effectively Experiment results demonstrate the algorithm is efficient     Keywords-association rules; data mining; multi-database incremental addition I I NTRODUCTION Data mining can be known as a knowledge discovery process in databases [1 D a t a bas e m i n i n g i s  t h e au t o m a t e d  process of extracting interesting and previously unknown patterns and correlations from large databases. Association rule mining [1 the pro c ess o f  d i s c o v e r ing i t e m s w h ic h tend to occur together in transactions based on some kind of rules. With the rapid development of database technologies multi-database mining is becoming more and more important. The mining objects of traditional mining association rules techniques mainly focus on mono-database Very little work has been done in mining association rules in multiple large databases. A di rect application of general algorithms to multiple large databases is not effective because it requires a large amount of communication overhead If the data to be mined were stored by relational models in multiple databases, we can break multiple data sources mining task down into three sub-tasks: 1\ Clear multiple data sources; 2\ Mine the knowledge of each sources; 3\ Integrate the knowledge of every branch databa   In this paper we presented a novel and efficient algorithm for mining association rules from multiple databases Incremental addition of the data set should not necessitate recomputation of rules for the entire data set. Also, the local branch databases should not necessitate moving data to the headquarters database      This work is partly supported by The Project of Shandong Province Higher Educational Science and Technology Program\(No. J09LG32 t he Project of Youth Science and Technology Star Program of Jinan \(No 20090202\ The Project of Youth Science and Technology Star Program of Jinan \(No. 20090202 II L OCAL B RANCH D ATABASES M INING The development of multi-database association rule mining is a challenging and critical task since it requires knowledge of all the data stored in different locations and the ability to combine partial results into a single result from individual RDBMS. Suppose there is a company which has several branches in different locations, and each branch having its own database. The main branch or top level within the organizational hierarchy is responsible for making development and decision of the entire company. The above situation can be presented as Fig 1 Figure 1 Multi-database environment The individual databases have to be analyzed to generate rules to make local decisions. It would be easier for the organization to make decisions based on the rules generated by the individual branches, rather than by the raw data. If the raw data from each of the individual databases were sent to a single database to generate the rules, then certain useful rules which would aid in making decisions about local branches would be lost. For example, a rule such as ç50% of the branches in some city saw a 10% increase in the purchase of digital photo frame when digital cameras and memory cards were purchased togetheré would not be generated if the raw data was transferred. If the raw data from all the databases were transferred to a single database, then each of the individual branches would not be generating the rules of its data. In this case, the organization may lose some important rules that were prominent in branches and were not found in the other branches similar to the above example. Generating such rules would aid in making decisions about specific branches Most of the algorithms for discovering association rules 5, 6 r e q u i r e m u ltip l e  sc ans abo u t the d a t a base T h e  database was read completely for each pass, which results in a large number of disk readings and places a huge burden on the I/O sub-system. Network congestion problems and poor resource utilization was common in cases where data was to be retrieved from a central database server by a network DBMS Local branch 1 DBMS Local branch 2 DBMS Local branch 3 DBMS V4-349 978-1-4244-6349-7/10/$26.00 c  2010 IEEE 


Instead of moving data from one database to another, a partitioned approach would be appropriate The patterns in multi-databases can be divided into the following classes: local and global. Local branches need consider the original raw data in their datasets so they can identify local patterns for local decisions. Global patterns are the patterns that are supported by most of the branches and are used for making global decisions Many association rules that are mined in branches only may appear in one or two companies. They have not any effect on the headquartersê decision-making. In this paper we introduce the concept of lift. The degree of lift indicates correlation in statistic. It reflects the satisfaction degree and can be used to prune noise rules. We would delete those rules whose degree of lift is less than an assigned value 1 [8,9  In order to make the synthetic result of multiple data sources more accurate, we propose the parameter C which indicates the number of transactio ns in local branch database When mining the association rules in each local branch database is done, the number of transaction rows is assigned to the parameter C. The frequent itemsets and theirs support degree are submitted to the headquarters along with the parameter C as shown in table 1. Specially, 1-itemsetês support degree is also recorded and transferred to the headquarters TABLE I ITEMSETS SUPPORT DEGREE AND C Branch Code China0532 Itemset L,R L R Support Degree 0.70 0.85 0.66 C 2800 For incremental addition of local branch databases, the mining process is similar. The new mining result is submitted to the headquarters an d merged into the table with the same branch code III T HE S YNTHETICAL M ODEL The synthetical model is formed in the headquarters. It includes two parts: the new support degree of association rules and the global association rules A The New Support Degree of Association Rules When the mining in local branch DBMS\(database management system\ is done, the mini confidence degree and the mini lift degree are used to prune the frequent itemsets in order to submit useful association rules to the headquarters. In the headquarters we could compute the new support degree of association rules by the following formula Support L Support 1  L  C 1  C 0 Suppor 2  L  C2  C 0 Support n  L  C n  C 0  1 Support R Support 1  R  C 1  C 0 Support 2  R  C 2  C 0 Support n  R  C n  C 0  2 Support LR Support 1  LR  C 1  C 0 Support 2  LR  C 2  C 0 Support n  LR  C n  C 0   3 Conf L R Support LR Support L 4 Lift L R onf L R Support R Support LR Suppo rt L Support R 5 The parameter C i is the real exact number of transaction row in local branch database. For the above formulas, the local association rules are merged into the global association rules losslessly. The parameter C 0 is the sum of all C i and represents the total number of transactions Whether the branch is large or small, they are equal in the synthetic model. Whatever the sales is, every branch plays a important role. The branch makes decision according to the local association rules individually. The organization makes decision by the global association rules. This model not only reduces the I/O burden, but also enhances the accuracy and authenticity of distributed local databases While we compute the support degree and the confidence degree of the global association rules, we could compute the lift degree by the following formula. The lift degree is used for selecting the effective global association rules The algorithm C-newSupp to calculate new global degree of support is as the following Algorithm C-newSupp Input R a association rules Ci the number of the individual database row Output: new RS the support degree of association rules in global database 1 RS 0 2 For i 1 to n each of individual data source 3 RS Support  R  C i  C  RS B The Global Association Rules The global association rules must meet the min support degree and min-confidence degree. But strong association rules may not be meaningful. The lift degree of reflects the satisfaction degree. The following algorithm G-finalRule is to generalize final meaningful association rules using the lift degree Algorithm G-finalRule Input: R 1 R 2 R k a set of association rules min-support, min-conf, min-lift Output: RS// a set of final meaningful association rules 1 For i=1 to k, //R 1 R 2 R i R k each of association rule L R 2 Support LR  Call  C-newSupp 3 Support R  Call  C-newSupp 4 Conf L R  Support LR port R  5 If  Support LR min-support and Conf L R min-conf  then 6 Lift Conf L R Support R  7 If  lift>=min-lift then 8 RS R i V4-350 2010 2nd International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology Volume 4 


IV E XPERIMENTS A ND A NALYSIS To evaluate the synthetic algorithm correctness and efficiency, we use the synthetic classification data sets of the famous site Kdnuggets in the rule synthesis. Table 2 shows the parameters of the data sets While we mined a total of 2072 association rules from these databases with Apriori algorithm, we have acquired 2105 association rules with our synthetic model. The prior 10 itemsets are same in term of support degree. The itemsets are shown in table 3. The experiment shows the synthetic algorithm is correct and effective TABLE II T HE PARAMETERS OF THE EXPERIMENT DATA SETS  Database |R| T I |r T5I2D100KN1 968 5 2 19985 T5I2D100KN2 965 5 2 20046 T10I2D100KN1 960 10 4 19774 T10I2D100KN2 967 10 4 19798 T20I6D100KN1 968 20 6 19408 TABLE III THE PRIOR 10 ITEMSETS IN TERM OF SUPPORT DEGREE Item set Support G-finalRule Support Apriori C9,E15 0.052870 0.052877 A11,C9 0.052440 0.052400 A27,B247 0.052430 0.052 A27,D103 0.052290 0.052 B247,D103 0.052290 0.052 A27,F12 0.052280 0.052 B247,F12 0.052280 0.052 D103,F12 0.052280 0.052 A27,B247,D103 0.052280 0.052 A27,B247,F12 0.052280 0.052 For multi-processors, we could divide a large database into several partitions and run the synthetic algorithm V C ONCLUSIONS In this paper, we designed a novel and efficient algorithm and proposed the parameter C as the stamp. Using lift, the noise rules are deleted in local branch mining. Our proposed algorithm also has the following features  It avoids I/O transfers and network congestion  It focuses on the number of the itemset as well as support degree, thus greatly heightening the accurate of the global association rules mining  It only scans the whole databases only one and avoids re-scanning the old databases to acquire new knowledge from incremental addition to dataset This paper only discussed the positive association rules mining over multi-databases. Negative association rule is another aspect of data mining and different from positive association rules. In future work, we will discuss the case of negative association rules mining over multi-databases R EFERENCES 1 H an J i aw e i K a m b e r M D a ta  Mi ni ng  Co nce p ts a n d T e ch ni que s  M    Morgan Kanfmann Publishers.

From the TID list of 1-itemset balance\(1000..1999 we find acct#01, acct#3 both appear twice in fact table.  This is the minimal number of target item we can delete in order to hide the specified rule.  Therefore we delete balance\(1000..1999 from acct#01 and acct#3 in the dimension table DT 1 The confidence of rule becomes 3/7  0.43 and is therefore hidden.  In addition, the updated confidence of the rule limit\(0..9999 balance\(1000..1999 becomes 4/11  0.36 and is also hidden The algorithm stops as both predictive association rules are hidden after deleting balance\(1000..1999 form acct#1 and acct#3 from dimension table Customer  V A NALYSIS In this section, we provide complexity analyses on the proposed algorithm and compare it with joining-then-mining approach Instead of calculating and hiding predictive association rules on the joined table formed by fact table and all dimension tables, the proposed algorithm find the association rules in two phases similar to [7 i rs t calculates all 1-itemsets by one scan of fact table.  It then calculates all 2-itemsets, both in-table and cross-table, by another scan of fact table, without performing join operation and materialize the join.  For each predictive association rule, it calculates the number of records that need to be modified.  The process is repeated after modification and update until all rules are hidden.  We first provide the calculation of number of modification required and then estimate the operation on itemsets required to hide the predictive association rules Lemma 1 For a predictive association rule  y  y  Y algorithm HPAR performs min  FT|*\(supp\(xy\ - min_conf supp\(x  FT|*\(supp\(xy\ - min_supp odifications to hide the rule Proof Line 2.5.2 calculates the number of records that needs to be modified so that the confidence of a given rule is either smaller than min_conf or support to be smaller than min_supp Let the confidence of a predictive association rule be xy|/|x and greater than min_conf The support count of xy is decreased by one when one transaction containing xy is modified to support x only.  Assuming it takes k 1 executions to reduce the confidence to be less than min_conf, i.e xy| Ö k 1 x min_conf.  This inequality can be rewritten as k 1  xy| - min_conf *|x  FT|*\(supp\(xy\ - min_conf * supp\(x Assuming it takes k 2 executions to reduce the support to be less than min_supp  i.e xy| Ö k 2 FT  min_supp This inequality can be rewritten as k 2  xy| - min_supp *|FT  FT|*\(supp\(xy min_supp Therefore, it would take min\(k 1 k 2  modifications to hide the rule, since either the confidence is less than the min_conf or the support is less than min_supp  T ABLE 2 V ECTOR V ATM atm A B C D E F count 6 2 3 1 1 1 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 1301 


Lemma 2 The time complexity of HPAR algorithm is O\(|FT| + |Y|*\(|FT|+\(l 2 2 logl 2 2 where FT is the number of records in fact table Y is the number of items in Y and l 2 is the maximum number of frequent 2-itemsets Proof The time complexity estimated here is based on the number of operations required on itemsets.  To find all frequent 1-itemsets in line one, it takes O\(|FT operations On line two, there are at most Y number of frequent target items.  For each of these items, the following operations are executed.  To find frequent 2-itemsets, it is line 2.2 that calculating cross-table itemsets will require most operations It takes O\(|FT operations to scan the fact table again Assuming the maximum number of frequent 2-itemset is l 2  step 2.4 and step 2.5.6 perform sorting of these frequent 2itemsets repeatedly.  It would require O l 2 2 logl 2 2 operations  In total, the estimated operation is O\(|FT Y|*\(|FT|+\(l 2 2 logl 2 2 For joining-then-mining approach, a straight forward calculation of predictive association rule is to join the fact table with all dimension tables and then perform Apriori algorithm.  Let JT = FT DT 1  DT n be the joined table.  If we apply same strategy to reduce the confidence of an association rule, then time complexity can be estimated similarly Lemma 3 The time complexity of joining-then-hiding approach is O\(|JT| + |Y|*\(|JT|+\(l 2 2 logl 2 2 where JT is the number of records in fact table Y is the number of items in Y and l 2 is the maximum number of frequent 2itemsets Proof The proof is similar to lemma 2 It can be observed that the joined table JT is much bigger than the fact table FT as JT contains attributes from all dimension tables.  The operations on joined table will be much more than operations on fact table along.  In addition the cost of joining and memory space to save the joined table must be considered VI C ONCLUSION In this work, we have studied the problem of hiding sets of predictive association rules on multiple tables of star schema.  We propose a novel technique addressing two issues Ö efficient calculation of itemsets and reduction of rule confidence. Examples illustrating the proposed approach are shown.  Analyses are given and compared to joined table approach.  Currently we have implemented the proposed technique on single table and experimenting on multiple tables.  We will continue to examine and improve the various side effects of the proposed approach.  We will also consider utilizing better data structures to reduce database scanning for better efficiency A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by the National Science Council, Taiwan, under grant NSC-98-2221-E-390-030 R EFERENCES 1 R.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
