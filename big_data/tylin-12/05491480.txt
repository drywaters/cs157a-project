Improving the Performance of a Parallel Data Mining Algorithm  using  Communication  Message  Scheduling  Nunnapus Benjamas and Putchong Uthayopas High Performance Computing and Network Center \(HPCNC Department of Computer Engineering, Kasetsart University, Bangkok 10900, Thailand g4885043, pu}@ku.ac.th   AbstractIn this paper, we propose several strategies for communication scheduling that can help increase the speed of parallel data mining algorithm The proposed method based on the smart scheduling that enable parallel data mining 
application to fully utilize the interconnection infrastructure for communication. We compare the proposed strategies with a non communication scheduling algorithm on 2 to 32 cores multicore cluster systems using simulation. The experimental results show that a significantly performance improvement can be gained when a smart communication scheduling is included in the data mining algorithm I  I NTRODUCTION AND R ELATED W ORKS  One of the key challenges that human society are facing is how to extract the meaning out of the massive amount of data 
being produced and collected every day. Data mining technique is frequently used to extract novel significant or interesting knowledge that is implicit in these large volumes of data. Association rule mining  on e of th e m o s t  important techniques in data mining. This technique is used to extract significant patterns from transaction databases and generates rules used in many decision support systems Anyway, the mining of large volumes of data is very compute intensive. Therefore, parallel computing is used to improve the performance of association rule mining applications There are three broad strategies for parallelizing association rule mining algorithms i rs tly, task parallelism \(or control parallelism\s exploited by having each process executes 
different operations on the database. Secondly, SPMD parallelism can be employed by having a set of processes executes the same algorithm in parallel on difference partitions of the database [4  6 Th ird l y  i n d ep en d en t p arallelis m is  exploited when processes are executed in parallel in an independent way; generally each process has access to the whole database  All of these strategies must be implemented on the parallel computing systems. Among the most popular is shared memory multiprocessor system [6 d d i strib u ted  m e m o ry  multicomputer system [5   Mo st o f th e w o r k s ad d r ess h o w  an association rule mining algorithm will perform on an ideal distributed system. Nevertheless, parallel data mining applications usually generates a lot of communication 
messages. Thus, a proper optimization of these communications on an infrastructure has a potential to substantially increase the performance of a parallel data mining application In this paper, we propose that the proper scheduling of communication message that consider the right sequence of message transmission, message size, and interconnection network utilization will yield a great performance enhancement to parallel data mining application. The parallel FI-growth data mining is analyzed and used to demonstrate the proposed concept. Using simulation, it can be shown that by properly schedule the communication message and interconnection switch usage in data  mining applications, substantial 
improvement in performance can be attained The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides the system model. Section 3 presents the designing the scheduling strategies. Section 4 describes the experiments and discusses the results. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper and discusses some future development II  S YSTEM M ODEL  In this paper, the parallel FI-growth program is modeled using a directed acyclic graph \(DAG\en a set of tasks T  T 0 T 1 T n to be executed, a directed acyclic graph can be defined as G= \(V, E 
where V is a set of nodes v 1  v 2 205 v n  and E is the set of directed edges e ij The edge e ij in the DAG connecting nodes v i and v j represents the communication and precedence constraints among the nodes. The weight of an edge denoted by W  e ij the communication cost of the edge See the task graph in Fig. 1\ node v i in the DAG corresponds to task T 
i Each node of the task graph has a weight W  v i at represents the computing cost In this application model, we assume that a task is an indivisible unit of computation, and that a processor executes one task at a time. When all input data to a task have arrived to it, the task can be started to execution To express resource contentions, we assume that only a limited number of communications can pass from the processor into the network and from the network into the processor at one communication in time       


                 Figure 1. The parallel FI-growth task graph \(left\ and Machine model \(right  In this work, we use a multicore cluster system as the target architecture. A multicore cluster system is a set machine M   m 1  m 2 205 m M of |M| machines and each machine m i  include a set processor P i  p 1  p 2 205 p pi of P i processor Each processor p j of machine m i has multiple core C i  c 1  c 2 205 c Cij of C ij cores In Fig. 1, multicore cluster system is a tree-structure with cores c leaves, processors p termediate nodes being a parent for cores, machines m termediate nodes combining processors and the entire machine or system S s root node. Let S  V  E  W V  W E here  V  v 1  v 2 205 v n is a set of nodes, and E is a set of undirected edges V represents the set of cores in the system, and an edge e ij  002  E represent communication link between core v i and v j  W V  v i d W E  e ij  is the computational cost of core v i and the communication cost between core v i and v j respectively In this paper, a multi-core cluster system will have a hierarchy of communication networks. First, an inter-core communication using the shared-cache between cores on the same processor. Second, an inter-processor communication using shared-memory between cores on the different processor Finally, an inter-machine communication based on message passing between machines. In this work, we assume that the bandwidth between cores is 20 GBps, bandwidth between processors is 10 GBps, and bandwidth between machines is 1 GBps. It is assumed that the number of processors and the number of tasks are static and known beforehand.  In this paper we use an all-to-all personalized communication to illustrate that a proper communication scheduling of FI-growth data mining can substantially increase the speed of the application  III  P ROPOSED C OMMUNICATION S CHEDULING C ONCEPT  In the following subsection, various scheduling strategies are proposed for parallel FI-growth data mining. Then, their impacts on application performance are studied using simulation A  Non-Bandwidth Scheduling In this work, we assume that each task will have all its communication messages queued prior to the real transmission Thus, a schedule is created for communication task by assigning them a priority. We proposed three ways of determining the priority of a node as follows L-Max The task with maximum message size or maximum communication weight, max W  e ij will be scheduled first L-Min The task with minimum message size or minimum communication weight, min W  e ij will be scheduled first L-MaxMin The task with maximum message size will be scheduled first followed by a task with minimum message size Maximum message size and minimum message size will be scheduled alternately B  Bandwidth Scheduling In order to further enhance the scheduling strategy for parallel FI-growth application, the communication bandwidth utilization of the interconnection network is considered. In general, interconnection network in a cluster usually consists of a switch fabric and a network links to computation node with a certain bandwidth such as 1Gbps. When more than one communication sessions are initiated to a single target node the switch to node link bandwidth will be shared. The bandwidth is then reduced and more latency is inserted into the computation To avoid this problem, we proposed that the communication should be schedule. In our scheme, the execution consists of two step; nodes partitioning and communication scheduling These two steps execute alternately. For each step, the execution will proceed as follows Partitioning step A set of n node is divided into two balanced partitions and then recursively divide the two partitions until the number of node of each partition is one Communication step In each partitioning step, all nodes in each partition will be scheduled to send/receive message to/from all nodes within another partition. The number of communication phases will be equal to number of nodes in the divided partition. Total of communication phases is n-1 An example of how the partitioning works is given in Fig. 2         Partition#1 0 1 2 3\  \(4  5 6 7\ Comm Sender 0 1 2 3  4  5 6 7 Phase Receiver 4 5 6 7  0  1 2 3 I  5 6 7 4  1  2 3 0 II  6 7 4 5  2  3 0 1 III  7 4 5 6  3  0 1 2 IV Partition#2 0 1\ \(2 3\  \(4  5\ \(6 7  Sender 0 1 2 3  4  5 6 7  Receiver 2 3 0 1  6  7 4 5 V  3 2 1 0  7  6 5 4 VI Partition#3 0 1 2 5 6 7  Sender 0 1 2 3  4  5 6 7  Receiver 1 0 3 2  5  4 7 6 VII  Figure 2.

From the example in Fig. 2, it is a result of bandwidth scheduling strategy of 8 nodes. In Patition#1, there are two partitions, \(0, 1, 2, 3\ and \(4, 5, 6, 7\. There are 4 nodes per partition. The number of communication phases is also equal to the number of nodes per partition. Let an order pair \(a, b denotes the communication from node a to node b Then, the 8 scheduled communication in the first communication phase Comm. Phase I\ is given by a set: {\(0,4\, \(1,5\ \(2,6\ \(3,7 4,0\ \(5,1\ \(6,2\\(7,3\ and the total number of communication in this phase is 7 The benefit of our proposed strategy is that the communication between a pair of node is contention free Hence, the full utilization of available interconnection bandwidth is ensured. The result is an improved in attainable performance and execution speed of the parallel data mining algorithm  IV  E XPERIMENTAL E VALUATION  In order to generate the test task graph, we mined a 60 million transaction database using the parallel FI-growth program [8 e u til ized th e stan d a rd 223 I B M s y n t h e tic d a ta gene y n t h e s i ze a tran s act ion databas e W e us ed  1000 unique items to create 60 million records; each has average transaction length of 10. The communication volume associated with each edge varies from 96 bytes to 768.8 Kbytes After the test graph is generated, we can run a scheduling simulator on this task graph using different scheduling strategies. To evaluate these scheduling strategies, we ran all of the proposed strategies on various kind of cluster architecture as listed in Table I TABLE I M ULTI C ORE V ARIATION A RCHITECTURE  Total number of cores of machines - # of processors per machine of cores per processor 32 1-1-32 , 1-2-16 , 1-16-2 , 1-32-1 , 2-1-16 2-2-8 , 2-4-4 , 2-8-2 , 2-16-1 , 4-2-4 4-4-2 , 8-2-2 , 16-1-2 , 16-2-1, 32-1-1 16 1-1-16 , 1-2-8 , 1-4-4 , 1-8-2 , 1-16-1 2-1-8 , 2-2-4 , 2-4-2 , 2-8-1 , 4-1-4 , 4-2-2 4-4-1 , 8-1-2 , 8-2-1 , 16-1-1 8 1-1-8 , 1-2-4 , 1-4-2 , 1-8-1 , 2-1-4 2-2-2 , 2-4-1 , 4-1-2 , 4-2-1 , 8-1-1 4 1-1-4 , 1-2-2 , 1-4-1 , 2-1-2 , 2-2-1 , 4-1-1 2 1-1-2 , 1-2-1 , 2-1-1  All the scheduling strategies in our simulator have been written in Java programming language.

The results clearly show the use of communication bandwidth scheduling \(Max, Min, and MaxMin\lt in a substantially lower execution time than the non-bandwidth scheduling \(L-Max, L-Min, and LMaxMin  Fig. 4 shows the run times for bandwidth scheduling strategies using 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 cores, respectively. The results show that run-time drops rapidly as the number of processors increase from 2 to 8, and decreases more slowly as additional processors are used. This is caused by the additional communication overhead incurred V  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we propose a set of communication scheduling strategies that helps reduce the execution time of parallel FIgrowth data mining algorithm. The results show that adding bandwidth scheduling in data  mining applications can substantially help improve the performance of the application Currently, we are working on integrating the computation and communication scheduling into a unified framework that is applicable to a broader class of knowledge discovery algorithm This will result in the potential for the development of fast scalable data mining application that can handle a massive amount of data R EFERENCES  1 R  A g ra w a l T  I m i e li n s k i and A   S w a m i  223M ini n g A s s o c i a t i o n Ru les  between Sets of Items in Large Databases\224, In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data 1993, pp 207-216 2  R.

58 


Figure 3 displays an example of a zoom over a strong coupling between several forms of the system and its main form B  Data Validation In order to build more confidence on what was being mined, a sample of the generated rules was validated by the programmers. They used the visual representation of the rules and confirmed the consistency of the main associations presented by the dependency networks  The number of original transaction records gathered throughout eight years of operation of the version control system, was 256,804. However, after a careful data analysis, we identified that of the 256,804 original records 153,288 accounted for marks on the files \(labels\nd 69,592 were directory changes. In the end, only 33,924 changes in 4.096 files were taken into account V  R ESULTS  As seen in tables 2 and 3, our results reached averages higher than the averages presented in Zimmerman et al [5   These results suggest that association rules obtained in our industrial environment are better than those obtained in the published OSS domains. In addition, low standard deviation shown in Table 5 indicates that the values do not spread too much around the averages. Our next step was to test this evidence using inferential statistics A  Analysis and interpretation The analysis started by calculating the harmonic mean for the data presented in Zimmerman et al for eight OSS projects [5  T h is d ata is s h o w n in T a bl e 2   T h ey s e rv e as  a baseline of comparison for the results we obtained in the industrial environment, shown in Table 3 For the statistical testing, we established an apriority significance level 001 0.05. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test ensured that the sample was normally distributed. As seen in Table 4, we found p-values of 0.996 and 0.982 for the Navigation and Error Prevention F-measure 000  respectively.  As the p-value is the lowest possible significance with which it is possible to reject the null hypothesis, and they are larger than 0.05, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the data is normally distributed TABLE II  R ESULTS FOR COARSE GRANULARITY IN 9 AND ITS FMEASURE R=R ECALL   P    P RECISION  Suppor t Confidence Project R 000 P 000 F 000 measure R 000 P 000 F 000 measure ECLIPSE 0.17 0.26 0.21 0.03 0.48 0.06 GCC 0.44 0.42 0.43 0.29 0.82 0.43 GIMP 0.27 0.26 0.26 0.08 0.74 0.14 JBOSS 0.25 0.37 0.30 0.05 0.44 0.09 JEDIT 0.25 0.22 0.23 0.01 0.44 0.02 KOFFICE 0.24 0.26 0.25 0.04 0.61 0.08 POSTGRES 0.23 0.24 0.23 0.05 0.59 0.09 PYNTHON 0.24 0.36 0.29 0.03 0.67 0.06 Average 0.26 0.30 0.28 0.07 0.60 0.12 Navigation Prevention 0.1 0.9 13  In order to assure that we could use the T-test for independent samples, we had to test the equality of variances for the independent samples.

We have not test for those variables   The projects that we analyzed were stable and had a few number of transactions per day \(Table 1\ Less stable or more dynamic projects may yield different results   Like in t h e  or der i ng o f  cha nge s m a y i n fl ue nc e  the results for Navigation and Error Prevention VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  This article shows that software module modification association rules derived from our stable industrial environment were more effective than those derived from the OSS projects reported in the literature. As association rules are already being successfully applied for impact analysis in this context [5  o u r  resu l t s i n d i c a tes th at th ey c a n  als o  b e  effectively applied in industrial environments such as the one we studied  We believe that this finding may stimulate further studies in the industry and, hopefully, motivate them to invest on association mining to support software maintenance and evolution activities  It is important to observe that in our analysis systems with little evolutive maintenance, such as the Marketing and the Customer Management System, yield rules with precision and recall better than the average. This was expected as more stable systems should yield better association rules Also, independent of the number of transaction per day systems with small training sets, such as the Accounting and the Web Services Systems, yield rules with precision and recall worse than the average. This was also expected, as this number training examples helps to strengthen the rules As mentioned before, we adapted the software engineering experimental process described in Wohlin et al  o so ft w a r e  r e po si t o r i e s m i ni ng e x p e r i m e nt s. We be l i e v e that the studies, applications, and tools for software repository mining can benefit from this type of approach Rigorous experimental description facilitates replication of studies and the executing of systematic reviews and other types of secondary analysis in the field [18  C o n s id e r in g th e  number of studies being done in the area, we believe that experimental formalism combined with approaches like standardization of data exchange formats among software repositories [1  can  con t ri b u t e t o f a cili tat e th e ex ecu t i o n  and replication of studies in the area As future work, we will start to look at fine granularity associations, analyzing classes and methods as opposed to files. We will also analyze relationships between coupling and the associations mined from version control systems We are currently finishing a Microsoft Visual Studio plug-in to use the mined rules to aid programmers on the fly It will work as a monitor that verifies saved files and warns programmers about unverified associated files. This will facilitate the programmers’ impact analysis effort and mitigate errors during program modification. After its completion, the plug-in will be experimentally evaluated in carefully controlled case studies. Lastly, we will use our Data Warehouse [6 o t e st s e ve ra l  o t her so ft w a r e m i ni ng  techniques over the data we have already gathered and preprocessed A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This study could only be developed due to the full support of CIAL–Brazil and its staff.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
