These antennas are matched on one the UHF RFID regulate frequency band \(860-960 MHz\ and on the ECC UWB frequency band \(6-8.5 GHz\g is composed of two antennas, one match for the RFID applications with classical RFID input impedance, one for UWB matched at 50 
Tag sizes are limited to credit card sizes \(85x54 mm\. Reader antenna is an association of a bowtie and a dipole antenna and it is matched on 50 on twice bands. There is no sizes' specification for reader antennas. The substrate is FR4 0.8 mm thick for tag antennas and 1.6 mm for reader antennas. Epoxy's relative permittivity is 4.4 and its dielectric loss tangent is 0.02.  Design rules simulations, measures and perspectives are exposed I  I NTRODUCTION  Radio Frequency Identification \(RFID\ is widely developed this last past years. One of the regulate frequency band for RFID applications is in the UHF band \(860-960MHz\The 
main application is to identify automatically and in real time several devices thank to electromagnetic waves Some applications need to id entify and localize precisely a device into a dense environment  s pos s i ble to localiz e a device with UHF RFID technology thanks to RSS signals [2  but the positioning resolution suffers from multipath. To enhance it there are actually some research which applied Ultra Wide Band \(UWB\ technologies for positioning applications[2 B sh o r t d u ratio n p u lse s p e r m it to  distinguish direct responses to multipath responses and could pass through several objects like walls, clothes, etc Moreover UWB systems are low power consumption systems and can be used close to other UHF RFID systems without suffering from interference due to the different radio spectrum

Tag is composed of two antennas, one for the UHF RFID frequency band and the other one for UWB communications Figure 1\onstraints on RFID tag antenna an UWB antenna are obviously different. Due to the RFID chip input impedance, the antenna need to be very inductive with a few resistances order t o  be perf ect l y  m a t c h e d t o t h e c h i p   the UHF RFID antenna's impedance should be 12 j 200 at 868 MHz.

Substrate sizes is equivalent to credit card sizes \(85x54mm Measurement environments are described in In th e measurement condition, the antenna must be symmetric. It allows to solder half of the antenna on a metal plate considered as ground plane. In those conditions, the antenna is feed by a SMA connector which permit to deduce input impedance after deembedding  In UHF RFID band \(860-960 MHz\measurements are close to simulations \(Figure 2.a,b\, the main difference is a resistance greater in measurement.

Tag antennas respect the specifications in term of sizes and matching. The RFID and UWB antennas are easily reconfigurable by varying the parameters previously describe On UHF band, coupling effect between antennas are negligible, radiation pattern at 915 MHZ have the classical shape for dipole without perturbations. Coupling effects between the antennas are more important in UWB frequency band as it shows on the radiation pattern at 7.25 GHz. The antennas have common directivity along Y axis III  R EADER A NTENNA  A  Design The reader is a single antenna matched on twice band \(860960 MHz and 6-8.5 GHz\with an impedance of 50 The substrate is epoxy 1.6mm thick with r  4.4 and tan 0.02.The antenna sizes are 131x18.8mm and substrate sizes are 180x60 mm \(Figure 4\Its structure is composed of planar dipoles. The reasons are: it is not necessarily to have a ground \(because dipoles are differential antennas\d it is possible to make wideband matching  The main planar dipole is a straight dipole it's a narrow band antenna easily configurable on UHF RFID band. The other dipoles are bow-tie antennas mostly used for UWB applications o n n ect i ons bet w ee n t h es e di f f e re n t di pol es are assumed by lines. These lines are as thin as possible \(100 m\n order to have impedance close to open circuit on UHF band. Thanks to that, at 915 MHz most of the current is propagate through the straight dipole. In the highest frequencies current distribution is most homogeneous on all of the dipoles. Geometrical paramete rs are summarized on figure 4            B  Simulation and Measurements In UHF band the reflection coefficient is lower than -10 dB In this frequency band measures are not perfectly closed to simulation \(Figure 5 b\e to a difference of reactance Figure 5 a\. Between 6 and 8.5 GHz reflection coefficient are lower to 14 dB in simulation and 12.5 dB on measures Figure 5 c\he radiation pattern at 915 MHz is equivalent to a classical dipole radiation pattern because most of the current is propagated through the main dipole. At 915 MHz maximum gain is 1.8 dBi \(Figure 6.a\ higher frequencies, the current distribution is homogeneous so around 7.25 GHz the antenna radiates in many directions \(Figure 6.b\The main dipole is the most fluent parameter in UHF RFID band. To enlarge or shift the UWB match band without perturb too much matching in UHF band it is advised to only vary the sizes and the angle of the bow-tie antenn                                                0,2 0,5 1,0 2,0 5,0 0,2j 0,2j 0,5j 0,5j 1,0j 1  0j 2,0j 2,0j 5,0j 5,0j  Simulation Measure G EOMETRICAL P ARAMETERS  Name L1 L2 W1 W2 Insert sep ang Value mm 70 8 5 1 1.25 1 25   6,06,57,07,58,08,5 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0 40 35 30 25 20 15 10 5 0   Reflexion Coefficient \(dB Frequency \(GHz Simulation Measure  b Figure 5:  Reader antennas: a\ impedance b\ UHF RFID band and c\ UWB band reflection coefficient 0,86 0,87 0,88 0,89 0,90 0,91 0,92 0,93 0,94 0,95 0,96 30 28 26 24 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 30 28 26 24 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0   Reflection Coefficient \(dB Frequency \(GHz  Simulation Measure  a  Figure 4: Reader antenna 180 mm 60 mm  ang insert sep L2 L2 L1 W1 W2 c  VSWR=2 circle 


Reader antenna is the summation of two dipoles antennas Each dipole is a classical antenna for the associate application They are matched on twice band and have a common radiation area on UHF and UWB frequency band. Thanks to that it is possible to communicate and feed a tag on a direction Substrate and fabrication process permit to minimize cost production                                IV  C ONCLUSION   This article presented different antenna's topologies for UHF and UWB RFID applications. Concerning tag antennas a multi-chip solution was chosen and the main difficulties consist to minimize coupling effects between UHF and UWB antenna. UHF antenna has typical impedance and it is possible to reconfigure it easily to ev ery kind of UHF RFID chip impedance. UWB antenna has a classical shape and the reflection coefficient is lower than 10 dB. Reader antenna cover twice band with an impedance of 50 It's matched in simulation and measure to all UHF RFID and European UWB bands with a reflection coefficient lower than 10 dB Perspectives are to design a reader and tag antenna matched on all UHF RFID and FCC UWB frequency band R EFERENCE  1  H.

TABLE V  E XAMPLES OF ASSOCIATION RULES         The municipality performance is not proper in handling the complaints which refer to 'asphalt settlement', 'asphalt layer', 'garbage collection' and 'installation of garbage ban subjects The probability of being satisfied is 70% in the last month of winter The unit 82 which refers to the section 2 of region 1 has the best performance in the third month of winter in comparison with the other months in handling the 'garbage collection subject The performance of municipality in handling the complaints of 'installation of garbage ban' subject in the first month of winter is very perfect and citizens feel satisfied with the probability of 100 The unit 83 which refers to the geographical section 3 of this region has the best performance and can be seen as a benchmark for the other sections Citizens feel dissatisfied with the unit 87 which refers to the section 5 of this region with the probability of 95%. This unit has a good performance just in handling the complaints which refer to the 'asphalt settlement' subject The subjects of 'asphalt layer' and 'garbage collection cause a high number of complaints in the first month of winter while the municipality performance is worse  V  C ONCLUSTION  Governments have to consider convenient channels and services to connect between the governmental managers and citizens.  Furthermore, data mining tools are needed to manage citizens' requirements and process which collect analyze, reflect, and evaluate their needs In this research, we have used clustering and association rules on the data of the urban service management system in Iran to find the subjects that cause complaint and the factors that affect the rate of satisfaction. The results show that the municipality should give top priority to the 'snow', 'garbage and waste', 'cleaning' and 'asphalt' requirements and specially to the 'asphalt settlement', 'asphalt layer', 'Garbage collection and 'Installation of garbage ban' subjects during the winter in geographical region1 Analyzing the rules, make it possible to understand the impact of factors such as time and responsible units on the rate of satisfaction. Besides, units with a perfect or worse performance in providing services and handling complaints are identified The results of the research are very beneficial in providing improved urban services and the development of citizens' satisfaction.

only, and concepts with words The corpus of the PubMed abstracts that used in the experim ents is consists of 10000 biomedical abstracts with keyword search breast cancer treatments and side effects   All experim e nts are applied on the 10000 docum ents after divided them into six documentsets 50, 100, 500, 1000 5000, and all 10000 documents. The systems are implemented by using VS .Net 2005 \(C#\a nd the experiments were performed on Intel Core2 Duo, 1.8 GHz system with Windows XP and 2 Giga of RAM A large number of association rules can be extracted by sel ecting the values of minimum support and confidence in the mining process.  The D-EART system gives the best results by using low support and high confidence values Moreover, the number of concepts that entered to the mining process is fewer by using the fuzzy weighting schema. Table V shows the experiments that are applied on various documentsets by different threshol d values. It noticed that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is useful and always less than that in Apriori-concept system The reason returns to the strong effect of using the fuzzy weighting schema in D-EART system Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show that the execution time of Aprioriconcep t system is increased regular ly when the documentsets are increased compared to D-EART system. The mining process in Apriori-word system takes more time for less number of concepts in the documents. The reason is that the mining process in Apriori algor ithm depends on the size of documents rather than the number of concepts. The results show that the execution time of Apriori-concept system is about seventh fold of D-EART system. The D-EART system scans the documents only one time as the number of documents increased. Therefore the size of documents does not influence in the mining process. Finally, the results reveal that the execution time for D-EART system is much better than that of the Apriori-concept system in all cases  TABLE  V   T HE  N UMBER  OF  A SSOCIATION  R ULES  FOR  A PRIORIC ONCEPT  AND  D EART  S YSTEMS Minimum Support s  Minimum Confidence c  No. of Documents Systems s 1 c 50 3 50 7 60 10 50 500 Apriori-concept D-EART 183 71 76 31 17 5 10 2 1000 Apriori-concept D-EART 227 86 91 34 11 4 8 3 5000 Apriori-concept D-EART 239 92  75 27 20 4 15 2 10000 Apriori-concept D-EART 345 135 102 39 37 10 30 7   D5000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 9 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=5000 D10000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 10 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=10000 V  C ONCLUSIONS  AND  F UTURE  W ORK This paper presented a new text mining system for extracting ass o ciation rules based on concepts representation from online textual documents. This system overcame some of the problems in the prev ious EART system and the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by using the data structure hash table in the mining process. The results of comparing DEART and Apriori-concept syst ems reveal that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is always less than that in Apriori-concept system. Moreover, the execution time for D-EART system is mu ch better than that of Aprioriconcept system in all cases. So concept technique would be suitable to apply to any large corpus of medical text such as portions of the web.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the data’s semantic. This step consists of TAH’s and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
