problems, one of which is the generally larger and multi-dimensional datasets, and the rapid growth of the mount of data. Singleprocessorís memory and CPU resources are very limited, which makes the algorithm performance inefficient. Recently the development of network and distributed technology makes cloud computing a reality in the implementation of association rules algorithm. In this paper we describe the improved Apriori algorithm based on MapReduce mode, which can handle massive datasets with a large number of nodes on Hadoop platform Keywords-Association rules; Apriori; Hadoop MapReduce;KDD I INTRODUCTION Known as knowledge discovery in databases \(KDD\, data mining can automatically extract useful hidden information 
from the datasets which are massive, noise, and vague. Data mining, as an efficient way to extract the knowledge, has draw attention from both the industrial and research communities Association rule is one of the important themes and essential of data mining which can find out the relationship between item sets in the database. We can use the interesting association relationships which are extracted among huge amounts of data But, the discovery of association rule is a direct mass-oriented database system that often has hundreds of properties and millions of records, contains a complex relationship between data tables, and remains a time-consuming process. This will inevitably lead to a great surge in search of dimension and 
space Traditional association rule mining algorithms encounter many difficulties when deal with massive data. For example the traditional Apriori algorithm [13  f a c e s the f o l l o w i n g  difficulties: It spends so much time dealing with particularly large number of candidate sets since candidate \(k + 1\temsets are constructed through the self-join of frequent k-itemsets. Its growth is exponential. To get all frequent sets, it needs to repeatedly scan the database. As Apriori employs an iterative approach, which incurs high I/O overhead for scanning, there are certain limitations regarding in handling of transactions in large database Considering above problems, parallel association rule algorithms with high performance are best choice. Currently 
proposed parallel algorithms are CD \(Count Distribution\ CaD Candidate Distribution\ and DD \(Data Distribution The s e  algorithms have major weaknesses at some respects of Communication and synchronization. Now MapReduce model can be used in Machine Learning on Multicore[5 w h e r e ha s many advantages to solve these problems. A key benefit of MapReduce is that it automatically handles failures, hiding the complexity of fault-tolerance from the programmer I n t h i s  paper we use the MapReduce model which provides a parallel design pattern for simplifying application developments in distributed environments to improve the Apriori algorithm as to obtain a better parallel performance. This model can split a 
large problem space into small pieces and automatically parallelize the execution of small tasks on the smaller space  We use it to reduce the communication overhead without having to take into account the synchronization operations between nodes. The contribution of this paper includes  An improved parallel Apriori was proposed. We calculate the count of the candidate items based on Mapreduce framework to achieve parallelism which significantly improved the efficiency. After the redesign of map and reduce function, through the iterations of invoking map and reduce function, then gets frequent itemsets  Using Apacheís MapReduce implementation ñHadoop we have compared the performance of the improved 
parallel Apriori algorithm on the Hadoop platform using different nodes II B ACKGROUND  ASSOCIATION RULES M AP R EDUCE AND H ADOOP A Association Rules Let 1 2 m     III I  be a set of items Let 1 2     tn DB t t 
 be a database of transactions, where each transaction i t is a set of items such that i tI   Given an item set XI   a transaction T 


contains X if and only if XT   An association rule is an implication of the form X=>Y, where XI   YI  and XY   The Support and Confidence are common indicators to measure strength of association rules. To select interesting rules from the sets of all possible rules, constraints on various measures of significance and interest can be used. The best-known constraints are minimum thresholds on support and confidence. The support supp\(X\ of an itemset X is defined as the proportion of transactions in the dataset which contain the itemset. The confidence of a rule is defined as   sup    sup   conf X Y p X Y p X   4 A user-specified minimum support and a user-specified minimum confidence are needed in the Association rules at the same time. It consists of two steps. First, minimum support is used in order to find all frequent itemsets in a database. In a second step, applying the minimum confidence and these frequent itemsets, we can form rules. The first step should be played more attention to improving as the second step is straight forward. Apriori is applied to count the support of itemsets with a breadth-first search strategy and generate candidate itemsets to accomplish the first step B MapReduce As a data parallel model, MapReduce is a patented software framework introduced by Google to support distributed computing on large datasets on clusters of computers [1   Known as a simple parallel processing mode, Map-reduce has many advantages: such as, it is easy to do parallel computation to distribute data to the processors and to load balance between them, and provides an interface that is independent of the backend technology [1 Red u c e is d e si g n e d  t o  d e scr ibe t h e  process of parallel as Map and Reduce. The user of the MapReduce library expresses the computation as two functions Map and Reduce [2 Map, written by the user, takes an input pair and produces a set of intermediate key/value pairs. The MapReduce library groups together all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key I and passes them to the Reduce function The Reduce function, also written by the user, accepts an intermediate key I and a set of values for that key. It merges together these values to form a possibly smaller set of values Typically just zero or one output value is produced per Reduce invocation. The intermediate values are supplied to the user's reduce function via iterator. This allows us to handle lists of values that are too large to fit in memory The Map and Reduce functions are both defined with respect to data structured in \(key, value\pairs. MapReduce provides an abstraction that involves the programmer defining a ìmapperî and a ìreducerî, with the following signatures [9   Map::\(key1  list\(key2,value2 Reduce::\(key2,list\(value2  list\(value2 C Hadoop Hadoop is a popular open source implementation of MapReduce, a powerful tool designed for deep analysis and transformation of very large data sets which is inspired by Googleís MapReduce and Google File System [2 I t  en abl e s  applications to work with thousands of nodes and petabytes of data. Hadoop uses a distributed file system called Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS\ which creates multiple replicas of data blocks and distributes them on compute nodes throughout a cluster to enable reliable, and has extremely rapid computations to store data as well as the intermediate results 6 H a d o o p s c h e d u l es m ap a nd re d u c e ta sks to di stri b u t e d  resources, which handles many tough problems, including parallelization, concurrency control, network communication and fault tolerance [8 u r t h erm ore it p e r f o r m s se v e ra l optimizations to decrease overhead involved in the scheduling network communication and intermediate grouping of results III MAPREDUCE FOR APRIORI A Description of the traditional Apriori Apriori is a traditional algorithm for association rule and designed to operate on database containing transactions. The main idea of Apriori is producing candidate items, and then scanning the database so as to decide whether they meet the count. It use a "bottom up" approach, frequent subsets are extended one item at a time \(a step known as candidate generation\and groups of candidates are tested against the data The algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found. It can be shown as follows Input: D, \(Database of transactions\, min_sup \(minimum support threshold Output: L, \(frequent itemsets Method 1 1 L find_frequt_1-itemsets\(D 2\or\(k=2 1 k L    k 3 k C Apriori_gen 1 k L  min_sup 4\or each transaction t  D{//scan D for counts 5 t C subset k C t\/get the subsets of t 6\    for each candidate c  t C 7\  c.count 8 9 k L c  k C c.count>min_sup 10 11\turn L=L k  k L  The function of Apriori_gen 1 k L  min_sup\presented in the paper [7   


B MapReduce for Apriori The Apriori consists of two steps: the first is generating all frequent itemsets, the second is generating confident association rule from the frequent itemsets. We deploy MapReduce to parallel the first step and have the data stored in the file in order to deal with in the Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS We use Hadoop components to perform job execution, file staging and workflow information storage and use the files replace the database to store datasets. In the files each line can be seen as a transaction, each item is separated with white space \(a space or Tab\The datasets in files are split into smaller segments automatically after stored in HDFS and the map function is executed on each of these data segments. At first, the candidate sub item are put out with the counts number after the execution of map function, then the frequent itemsets are found after the execution of map function Input/output Map function Reduce function Input key/value pairs Key:Line No Value  one row of data Key: candidate item sets Value:1 Output key/value pairs Key: candidate itemsets Value:1 Key frequent subitems Value support Fig.1. key/value pairs for map function and reduce function  Fig.2. Dataflow of parallel Apriori The definition of key/value is the first step to implement the function of MapReduce. The pairs of key/value are shown in Fig.1, using the key/value pairs, we can deign the simple map function and reduce function   Th e m a p  f unc ti on m a i n l y  collects the count of every item in candidate itemsets and the reduce function prunes the candidate itemsets which have an infrequent sub pattern. Each frequent item is generated through one execution of map and reduce function. After stored in HDFS, the datasets are split into smaller segments and then transformed to datanodes. Map function is executed on these data segments and produces <key, value> pairs for every records it encounters. The framework groups all the pairs which have the same item and invokes the reduce function passing the list of values for candidate items. The reduce function adds up all the values and produce a count for the candidate item as a one-time synchronization. This algorithmís advantage is that it doesnít exchange data between data nodes it only exchanges the counts. In every scan, each map function generates its local candidate items, then the reduce function gets global counts by adding local counts. Fig.2 shows the data flow and the phases of the MapReduce framework for the improved Apriori algorithm. Multiple iterations of MapReduce computations are necessary for the overall computation. An iteration of the MapReduce produces a frequent itemset. The iteration continues until there arenít frequent itemsets further Parallel Apriori algorithm is shown as follows Input: D\(data in HDFS\in_sup\(minimum support threshold Output: L, frequent itemsets Method 1 1 L find_frequt_1-itemsets\(D 2\or\(k=2 1 k L    k 3 k C candidate_gen 1 k L  min_sup 4\or each row of data t  D{//scan D for counts 5 t C map\(\//get the subset of the candidate itemsets 6 7 k L Reduce\(\ get the subset of the frequent itemsets 8 9\eturn L=L k  k L  IV EXPERIMENTS In our experiments, we used Hadoop version 0.20.0 running on a cluster with 9 machines \(1 master, 8 slaves\ Each machine has two single-core processors \(running at 2.60GH and 4GB memory. The experiments datasets generated by IBM Data Generator are changed in the form of transactions as in the database We use speedup as criterion to measure our algorithmís superiority. When more than one node is used, computation and transfer is performed in parallel, and the speedup is over one. In the case of more than one data node, speedup increases with the increase of number of data in certain circumstances which can prove the high efficiency of the parallel Apriori based on MapReduce. Dataset also mainly determines the performance of the parallel algorithm. If we experiment with the small datasets, its performance turned out to be lower for the reasons; extra communication time occupying a large proportion compared to the total execution time. This is easily predicted from experiments where we noticed that the more data a node processes, the less significant proportion becomes 


the communication time. The opposite effect is simply seen here, larger datasets would have shown even better speed up characteristics. Clearly the parallel algorithm scales very well being able to keep speedup almost larger as the datasets and data nodes sizes increase as show in Fig1. Like the CD algorithm, the algorithm's communication overhead is O \(|C| ∑n at each phase, where |C| and n are the size of candidate itemsets and number of data sets, respectively [3    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Number of datanode Speed up Fig 3.  speedup of parallel Apriori \(Blue:100,000 transactions Green:1000,000 transactions,\support = 1 V C ONCLUSION In this paper, we mainly address the challenge of using the MapReduce model to parallelize Apriori. Hadoop, the underlying cloud computing framework, can handle many tough problems, including parallelization, concurrency control network communication and fault tolerance. The novelty of the algorithm lies in the ability of parallel Apriori to take full advantage of what Hadoop can provide. It can be easily applied to many commodity machines to deal with mass data without consider the synchronization problem A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(60903073 R EFERENCES 1 A p a c he H adoo p   h t t p h a doo p  a pac he or g   2 J D ean  a n d S  G h e m a w at  Map r e d uce  Simpli f i e d  data  pro ce s s i n g  on large clusters, ACM Commun, vol. 51, Jan. 2008, pp. 107-113 3 Ashr a f i  M.Z a m a n  T  D a vid, S Kate   O D AM  An optimiz ed di str i b u t e d  association rule mining algorithm.

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
