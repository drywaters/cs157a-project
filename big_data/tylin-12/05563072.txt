   Abstract Presently, in the data mining scenario clustering of large dataset is one of the very important techniques widely applied to many applications including social network analysis. Applying more specific pre-processing method to prepare the data for clustering algorithms is considered to be a significant step for generating meaningful segments. In this paper we propose an innovative clustering technique called the Rapid Clustering Method \(RCM which uses Subtractive Clustering combined with Fuzzy CMeans clustering along with a histogram sampling 
technique to provide quick and effective results for large sized datasets. Rapid Clustering Method can be used to cluster the dataset and analyze the characteristics in a social network. It can also be used to enhance the cross-selling practices using quantitative association rule mining I  INTRODUCTION Analysis of social networks is heavily dependent on clustering algorithms. The existing clustering algorithms such as K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means \(FCM\ etc have their own pros and cons. K-Means is very fast but its center value is dependent on the initial assumptions. We obtain different centers for different initial conditions. FCM is much more 
consistent than K-Means and is independent of initial assumptions [1 m o re o f a p r o b a b ilistic ap p r o ach b u t  its convergence rate to a center is very slow. Though Subtractive Clustering Method \(SCM\ used to speed up the process [2 e ti m e ta k e n b y th e co m b i n ed alg o rit h m s  is much higher than K-Means. We have proposed a novel method for sampling the dataset during the process of applying SCM and FCM methods together to reduce the time complexity. The following section explains how Histogram Sampling s appl i e d al on g  w i t h S C M-F C M   The Histogram sampling technique is preferred as it takes lesser time for computation and also maintains the density 
of the original datase T h en a ti m e co m p aris o n bet w ee n K-Means, SCM-FCM and RCM is shown. For applying this method in telecom industry can improve the cross-selling of customer services which is explained with an example to the voice counts of a particular telecom network. The crossselling efficiency is improved when quantitative association rule mining is applied to clustered data rather than the full dataset, which helps us identify the potential customers more accurately. Moreover the use of RCM effectively in identifying overlapping nodes in social network structures is also discussed subsequently 
II  RAPID CLUSTERING METHOD The Rapid Clustering Method \(RCM\ consists of three different parts. First the dataset is sampled to obtain a smaller dataset using histogram sampling technique, then SCM-FCM is applied to the sampled dataset and the cluster centers are obtained. These cluster centers are used in SCM implementation and finally FCM is applied to the larger dataset  The purpose of reducing the dataset is that the order of execution of SCM is n 2 thus larger the dataset more time it consumes to find the cluster centers. The histogram sampling technique is applied so as to maintain 
the density values similar to that of the original dataset so that we obtain the same cluster centers for the sample dataset  Figure 1  Example of Histogram Sampling technique  Figure.1 illustrates the results of histogram sampling method for five ranges varies from 1 to 50. The novelty of this work is to use the sampling method to speed up cluster initialization for fuzzy c-means. On appending this technique to existing SCM-FCM produces rapid results. The original dataset is segmented into various smaller intervals 
and equal proportion of the data points from each interval is taken and a smaller dataset is constructed. The interval size is determined based on the data distribution. If the distribution is uniform then data can be split into larger intervals. Otherwise smaller intervals can be used to increase the accuracy level of prediction. When data is concentrated more in a particular interval compared to other intervals then that interval is subdivided into smaller intervals and equal proportion of data is taken from those smaller intervals

SCM is applied on a sample dataset to obtain the initial cluster centers. This is further iterated to obtain consistent cluster centers. Using these cluster centers, FCM is applied to the original larger dataset to obtain the required cluster groups III  EVALUATION  The proposed method is applied to a dataset of 1208473 entries of voice counts for each subscriber in a huge telecom network and the time taken for clustering is calculated Similarly SCM-FCM and K-Means are also applied to the same dataset and their respective time of execution is noted for comparison. The cluster centers C1 and C2 obtained by both SCM-FCM and RCM are given below C 1 40.64427 and C 2 206.3012  Figure 2. Execution Time Comparison Figure.2 shows the comparison between the three algorithms. RCM obtains the same result as SCM-FCM but in a much quicker time, which is even faster than the KMeans method. Thus RCM rectifies the initial conditions dependency of K-Means and also increased the execution speed of SCM-FCM. Moreover, we have observed the improvement in the level of accuracy  IV  APPLICATIONS OF RAPID CLUSTERING METHOD  A  Cross selling using Association Rule Mining In the current scenario of cross-selling high and low usage clusters provide optimum results with minimum complexity or overheads T h e R a pid clu s tering algorithm is applied to cluster a given set of voice usage counts into two clusters namely high and low usage clusters Rapid Clustering is not used only to obtain two clusters; it can be used to obtain as many clusters as required by the user. Each cluster consists of the service usage counts and the optimum time to advertise the services apart from customer ID and MSISDN of the subscriber. The crossselling efficiency is determined by three parameters support, confidence and lift; these parameters describe the association strength and the increase in success rates for a combination of services. Quantitative Association Rule mining is the process of applying association rules and identifying the lift for clustered results [5 th i s case t h e lift values for the High and Low usage Clusters are identified and the services to be cross-sold are identified. A single service is used to check for the association strength with all the other services within the reach of usage counts B  Identifying community structures in Social Network Analysis  The application of RCM in social network analysis comes in the form of clustering the modularity values of nodes in two different networks and identify whether the nodes are over lapping or not. When the probabilistic analysis is made for clustering, the nodes are said to overlap if the probability pair is like \(0.6, 0.4\ for the two communities. In other words, if the values are one sided say 0.9, 0.1\ the nodes are not allowed to overlap. This kind of analysis is very important when a subscriber is to be labeled based on the communities available in the network. RCM can also be used at regular intervals to identify the changes occurring in community structures with respect to time Identifying change in community structure is a very important task in social network analysis. With the help of RCM we can obtain rapid results and identify structural changes much more quickly V  CONCLUSION  We considered the problem of clustering data over time and proposed a rapid clustering technique so that it can be used to generate quicker results for social network analysis 037 We have proved that rapid clustering algorithm works better than K-Means and SCM-FCM in a lesser time period and also by maintaining the level of accuracy. This proves that RCM is a good alternative method for segmenting large dataset on a telecom domain. RCM saves the time in clustering and is useful for identifying the changes occurring in community structures in the network very quickly and also helps in labeling the customers based on the communities they belong  REFERENCES 1 i v a s a K G  Si n gh A   T h o m a s  A  O  Ven u gopa l K R a n d P a tn ai k  L.M., “Generic Feature Extraction for Classification using Fuzzy CMeans Clustering”, 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Sensing and Information Processing  2005, pp.33-38 2 huF e n F a ng S t udy o n co m b i n i n g S u btr a ct iv e Cl us te r i ng w ith Fuzzy c-Means clustering  Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics, Wan 2-5 November 2003 pp.2659-2662 3 K o tsia nt is, S K a ne l l o po ul o s D an d P i n t e l as, P   D at a P r e p r o ce ssing  for Supervised Learning International Journal of Computer Science  2006, Vol 1 N. 2, pp 111-117 4  K o le n, J  F  H u tche s o n, T  R e duc i n g the tim e co m p l e x i ty  o f the fuzzy c-means algorithm", Fuzzy Systems,IEEE Transactions, Apr 2002, pp.263-267 5  Qi L i   A n  A l g o ri t h m of Qu ant i ta tive A s s o c i a t i o n  Ru le on F u zz y Clustering with Application to Cross-selling in  Telecom Industry International Joint Conference on  Computational Sciences and Optimization, 2009, pp.759-762

The competences at the bottom of the list indicate the smallest gap between importance and level of development indicating that their development is closely matched to need Interestingly all gaps are positive indicating rated importance is higher than level of development \(on the same rating scale\ in all cases There is some variation in the ranking of the gap across Europe. For example, in Bulgaria the top 5 ranked gaps are  1  Planning and time management 2  Ability to work in an interdisciplinary team 3  Knowledge of a second language 4  Initiative and entrepreneurial spirit 5  Oral and written communications in your native language  For French academics Capacity for generating new ideas creativity\ is top with Knowledge of a second language second. Irish academics rank Capacity to adapt to new situationsŽ top  C  The employer view of generic competences The 112 completed questionnaires returned by employers show a slightly different view to students and academics.  In the top 5 ranking of importance of the generic competences are Problem SolvingŽ, Team workingŽ and Capacity for applying knowledge in practiceŽ in common with students and academics but also Concern for qualityŽ and Capacity to learnŽ.  Both understandable from an industrial perspective Employers, like students rated Elementary computing skillsŽ first in terms of level of development followed by Capacity to learnŽ, an encouraging result for HEIs.  Oral and written communications in your native languageŽ came third followed by Will to succeedŽ and Basic general technical knowledge of the profession of your work ar eaŽ.  Surprisingly Planning and time managementŽ can in the bottom 5 … this should be a concern for HEIs as most of us expect good demonstration of this competence in examination preparation individual and group projects and general assignment work Table 6 shows the employers rating of the gap in the generic competences Top of the list overall is Concern for qualityŽ. This is dominated by a clear difference at the Masters level. At the Bachelor level the greatest gap is in TeamworkingŽ. Planning and time managementŽ is second overall, again principally because of the Master level res ponses, it is ranked 6 th for Bachelor students. It is clear from the top few in the list where employers feel the academic programmes their graduate recruits have taken are falling short of their needŽ in the generic competences  TABLE VI  A LL EMPLOYER RATING OF THE  GAP  IN THE GENERIC COMPETENCES  Rank Generic competence Mean 1 Concern for quality 0.79 2 Planning and time management 0.75 3 Capacity for applying knowledge in practice 0.74 4 Problem solving 0.72 5 Team working 0.72   28 Research skills 0.33 29 Grounding in basic knowledge of the profession of your area 0.26 30 Appreciation of diversity and multiculturality 0.26 31 Understanding of cultures and customs of other countries 0.14 32 Elementary computing sk ills 0.09  Encouragingly at the bottom of the list there appears to be no issue with Elementary computing skills alt hough the academics who feel that this is not a core com ponent of their degree programme will gain little comfort from this outcome The other competences at the bottom of the Table 6 are generic competences employers feel are being developed in line with their rating of its importance There is variation in the way employers in different countries rate the gap between importance and level of development of the generic competences. The top ranked gap is   Bulgaria: Capacity for applying knowledge in practiceŽ, Decision makingŽ, LeadershipŽ \(equal top   France: Capacity to adapt to new situations TeamworkingŽ \(equal top   Germany: Planning and time management   Ireland: Teamworking   Poland: Planning and time management   Slovak Republic: Ability to work aut onomously IV  HOW THE GENERIC COMPETENCES GROUP  Factorial analysis was used to group the generic competences.  Across all the responses the 32 generic competences factored into 5 groups 1   Internationalisation Understanding of cultures and customs of other countries.Ž Appreciation of ethical issues.Ž Appreciation of diversity and multiculturality International relations and collaborationsŽ, Ability to work in an international context 2   Entrepreneurship Patents and IPRŽ, Creativity Initiative and entrepreneurial spirit 3   Professional skills Grounding in basic knowledge of the professionŽ, Basic general technical knowledge 72 


Capacity for analysis and synthesisŽ, Research skills Capacity to learn 4   Interpersonal skills LeadershipŽ, Interpersonal skillsŽ, Ability to communicate with non-expertsŽ, Oral and written communications in native languageŽ, Critical and self-critical capabilityŽ, Teamworking 5   Personal skills Ability to work autonomously Problem solvingŽ, Capacity to adapt to new situations Knowledge of a second languageŽ, Concern for qualityŽ, Will to succeedŽ, Elementary computing skillsŽ, Capacity for applying knowledge in practice Decision makingŽ, Project design and management Information management skills Table 7 shows the mean importance of each gr oup of competences by stakeholder group for the First Cycle Degree respondents. For the employers the personal skills are the most importance group followed by professional skills and interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of them more strongly important than employers. Students also rank the competence groups in the same order but rate internationalisation slightly higher than employers and entrepreneurship very slightly lower Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the rated importance and level of development of these groups in that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the generic competences is quite well aligned V  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment between the views of the importance and level of development of sets of competences between students, academics and employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these subjects  TABLE VII  MEAN IMPORTANCE OF EACH GROUP BY STAKEHOLDER  Competence Group Academic Employer Student Internationalization 2.86 2.63 2.79 Entrepreneurship 3.07 3.05 3.02 Interpersonal skills 3.23 3.09 3.06 Professional skills 3.36 3.29 3.13 Personal skills 3.44 3.30 3.29  In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The number of responses from each c ountry is variable and a full by country analysis is not possible with the responses currently available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all countries show that there are country differences in some analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering problems. This too is a topic of further investigation The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn from the analyses presented Consistent top of importance of the generic competences for all stakeholders is Problem solvingŽ. Second in the ranking for students is Elementary computing skillsŽ. Comparatively students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is taken for granted in students than in academics and employers The results show employers value it more than students and this message could be communicated to students A number of gaps exist between the importance and level of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is Knowledge of a second languageŽ and the evidence from the languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at English The generic competences group into 5 sets with Personal skillsŽ rated consistently as the most important set. This is followed, in descending order of importance, by Professional skillsŽ, Interpersonal skillsŽ, InternationalisationŽ and EntrepreneurshipŽ. The smallest mean Internationalisation is just over midway between weakŽ and considerableŽ. Given the European Unions desire to see greater student and employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by curriculum designers Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in the finding that Professional skillsŽ are the best developed of the skill gr oups followed by Personal sk illsŽ and Interpersonal skillsŽ. This not only aligns with the views of employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and level of development on average differently. This difference has been taken into account in the conclusions drawn. The general unevenness in ranking reflects different perspectives and is, in itself not considered a major issue, of concern are the relative positions of competences and the relative gaps. In general and even allowing for this employers and academics tend to rate competences higher in importance than students and graduates a number of specific instances of differences are drawn out in section 8 73
