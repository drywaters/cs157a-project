commodities can be looked as a prerequisite for getting association rules. By using the knowledge reduction theory the associated commodities can be drown as a minimum set of commodities and we can get the association rules from the set We have designed a more efficient algorithm for mining association rules and the algorithm is also described in detail by example  Keywords-electronic commerce; rough set; association rules attribute reduction I  INTRODUCTION The use of association rules to carry out excavation on web commodities information in electronic commerce can find the 
user's buying patterns, access mode and visit frequency[1  Association rules is a trade statistics database in which we can obtain the purchase relation of the commodity A and B and more. The use of mining association rules is to discover this pattern, which can tell merchant how to recommend users some higher correlation commodities, and it can increase sales  Rough set is a new mathematical tool to deal with incomplete and uncertain knowledge, which main feature is that would not require certain characteristics or properties in advance. From the given classification knowledge we can obtain the knowledge reduction and deduce association rules by its indiscernibility relation and classification[3  
II   A LGORITHM ANALYSIS  It is used the positive domain, negative domain and the domain boundaries to describe the definition extent in rough set. The given problem domain will be divided and determined their support level to certain concept. It includes three support levels: certain support, not support and possible support. In commodities association rules mining, the commodity is defined as property and commodities characteristic is defined as domain elements  A set of commodities M = \(U, T\ U is the feature set of non-empty and finite. T is non-empty set of commodities 
Suppose Va is the value of a and a T, U Va is a single map, so any one element of U in the properties of Va is an unique value. If the T include condition attribute set C and decision attribute set D, and C D = T, C D that the system S is associated with commodities. While inspecting the association rules, you can choose key objectives of commodities as decision attributes, analyze other commodities dependence to the target commodities, on this basis, the rational proportion of commodities can be distributed[4     In a set of commodities M = \(U, C 
D\, the correlation and interest-degree of certain commodities in C are not high on the conditions of maintaining the same association rules of key commodities, you can delete these redundant commodities. Through the commodities reduction can get minimal and correct association rules. If ind  B\d B-{a}\, B  C, a C, then B is redundant. A set of commodities may exist many reductions, the intersection of these reductions is defined as the core of high relativity and concerns[5   III   A LGORITHM REALIZATION  Algorithm realization is shown as follows  
1\The collection of commodities must be divided into commodity set to be associated and target commodity set  2\y the use of discernibility matrix and discernibility function can obtain reduction set of commodities  Discernibility matrix:M \(T\ = \(m \(i, j\ | n \327 n, 1 i, j n m \(i, j\ = \(a T | a \(i a \(j\and d \(i d \(j\\, n = | U |[6    Discernibility function as follows    on behalf of  on behalf of  
004 
 3\ Association rules can be derived by the reduction set of commodities. We can get the attribute reduction set and core from the minimal disjunctive of the discernibility function, and the resulting association rules can be deduced 4\ To retain the rules which certainty factor is 1  Eleventh Five-Year Planning Project of Jiangxi Province\(No.08tw05 978-1-4244-5143-2/10/$26.00 \2512010 IEEE

For rule r ij: des \(X i des \(Y j\ Y j X i   Certainty factor is  X i, Y j\ = | Y j X i | / | X i |, 0  X i, Y j 1  5 Correlation analysis  In the rule C1 C2 C3  Cn => D1 D2  D3  Dm, the correlation formula is shown as follows  corr \(C1 C2  Cn\, \(D1 D2  Dm    If corr <1, then the antecedent and consequent are negatively correlated  If corr> 1, then the antecedent and consequent are positively correlated  If corr = 1, then the antecedent and consequent are independent of each other  The association rules can be deleted or retained according to the corr values. For the negative correlation rules, the antecedent and consequent are mutually inverse, and should be deleted. For corr = 1 rules, antecedent and consequent are independent of each other, such rules are also uninteresting. As for the positive correlation rules, the antecedent contains emergence of the consequent, such rules are the higher interest rules IV   E XAMPLE ANALYSIS  We use a two-dimensional table shown in table 1 to describe the commodities set. Domain U is characteristic value of commodities and described as rows. Column property is described as commodities set and target commodity is M 5 The discernibility matrix is shown in Table 2  The discernibility matrix can be derived as table 2 according to table 1 The discernibility function shown as follows can be derived from table 2 T ABLE 1 COMMODITIES SET  U M 1 M 2 M 3 M 4 M 5  T 1  0.211 0.131 0.332 0.235 0.436 T 2  0.211 0.131 0.242 0.245 0.257 T 3  0.211 0.280 0.332 0.245 0.291 T 4  0.243 0.280 0.197 0.534 0.431 T 5  0.243 0.631 0.250 0.235 0.222 T 6  0.211 0.331 0.332 0.235 0.316 T 7  0.434 0.546 0.257 0.626 0.706 T 8  0.211 0.280 0.352 0.245 0.618 T 9  0.243 0.380 0.197 0.534 0.553 T 10 0.311 0.131 0.242 0.245 0.422 T 11 0.243 0.280 0.197 0.614 0.513 T 12 0.145 0.380 0.197 0.475 0.441  M3 M4 M2 M4 M2 M3 M1 M2 M1 M2 M3 M4  M1 M3 M4 M1 M2 M3 M2 M3 M4 M2 M3 M1 M3 M4 M4 M1 M3 M1 M4 M1 M2 M4  M2 M3 M4 M3 M4 M2 M4 M2 M3 M1 M2 M1 M2 M3 M4 M1 M3 M4 M1 M2 M3 M2 M3 M4 M2 M3 M1 M3 M4 M4 M1 M3 M1 M4 M1 M2 M4 M3 M4  According to the value of commodities reduction set can be deduced as {M2, M3, M4} and the core is also {M2, M3 M4}.

The association rules mining techniques based on rough set can deal with such information efficiently. Through data classification and reduction, and restricted by correlation value and corr, we can get a higher accuracy commodity association rules set. Under the conditions of strict equivalence relation and professional commodities, rough set algorithm on mining commodities association rules may result in omissions and bias. The algorithm can be combined with other mining algorithms and professional commodities knowledge to eliminate noise data interference, further enhance the accuracy and robustness of the algorithm on commodities association rule mining  R EFERENCES  1  Meziane F,Kasiran MK.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
