China Abstract: Expression and definition of spatial relationship are crucial for spatial data mining. A new method of spatial relationship expression based on DE-9IM theory is proposed The accurate spatial topology relationship between different objects can be expressed when this method is used in multi-level association rules discovery. The corresponding algorithm is also implemented and efficiency is enhanced by the MBR test and meta-rule. Experimental results show that the algorithm is valid and efficient Key words: Spatial Data Mining Spatial Association Rule DE-9IM; meta rule;MBR  I 
  Association rule discovery, as one of the important component of data mining, already has a deep and extensive research. Now it is used in spatial data mining after expansion and improvement by some researchers, and corresponding discovery algorithms of spatial association rules and even multi-level spatial association rules have been proposed Association rules in geo-database are similar to those in transaction database, such as A B[s%,c  w h e re  A a n d B are predicates set, s% is the support of the rule, and c% is the confidence of the rule 1 In A or B there are not only nonspatial predicates but spatial predicates as well, which are used to describe relationship between spatial objects like 
topological relationship \(intersect, overlap, disjoint\stance relationship\(close-to, far-away, distance interval\cative relationship\(left, west\d so on. And many researches of the spatial association rules are based on the hierarchy of spatial predicates defined as Figure.1 Figure 1  The hierarchy of spatial predicates Spatial predicates definition and concept hierarchy are discussed in this paper base on the dimension-extend 9 intersect matrix model \(DE-9IM\The hierarchy has some difference with Figure.1 but the DE-9IM from all the hierarchy has been described by regular expression. And corresponding discovery algorithm of multi-level spatial association rules is designed and has been tested with 
farmland geo-database of Hongta district in Yuxi city in Yunnan province. The algorithm is proved to be valid and efficient by experiment II  D IMENSION EXTEND 9  I NTERSECT M ATRIX Dimension-extend 9 intersect matrix is a extension from 9 intersect matrix by Clementini and etc 6][7  dim  dim  dim     dim  dim  dim  dim  dim  dim  oo o o o o ab a b ab M ab a b a b a b

And -1 in the function dim\(a\,p 001\031 1,0,1,2 means empty set of the geometry, 0,1,2 respectively represents that a is 0 dimension\(point\mension\(line 2 dimension\(polygon The range of dim\(x\ is {-1,0,1,2} and in dimensionextend 9 intersect matrix there are 4 9 262144 kinds of relationships theoretically. However, not so many relationship types are meaningful to the discovery of spatial association rules and thus they have a reduction in this paper. Firstly a symbol set{T, F, *} is introduced which makes dim\(x 001\031 1,0,1,2,T,F,*},where T denotes p 001\031 0,1,2} and geometry ‘a exists, F denotes p=-1 and geometry ‘a’ is an empty set\(not existed\, * denotes p 001\031 1,0,1,2} and geometry ‘a’ can be an empty set or not The dimension-extend 9 intersect matrix discussed above has 4 9 kinds of relationship theoretically and can finely define and distinguish the topology of the spatial objects However, large amount of spatial relationship is too much detailed in data mining especially in macro data mining and many of them can not be even described in nature language 2  Presented as Table 1, a macro spatial predicates concept hierarchy model is built based on dimension-extend 9 intersect matrix and topology names and the row priority matrix are given below TABLE I  SOME KINDS OF TOPOLOGY AND CORRESPONDING 000'\000\(\000\020\000\034\000,\0000  Spatial Topology Polygon Dimension 000'\000\(\000\020\000\034\000,\0000  Equals All    TF F FF 000§\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000©\000  Disjoint All    FF FF 000§\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000©\000  Touches P/L, P/A L/L, L/A A/A          FT F F TT 000§\000·\000§\000·\000§\000 000¨\000¸\000¨\000¸\000¨\000 004\004 000¨\000¸\000¨\000¸\000¨\000 000¨\000¸\000¨\000¸\000¨\000 000©\000¹\000©\000¹\000©\000  Touches P/P invalid Crosses P/L, P/A, L/A    TT 000§\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000©\000  Crosses L/L 0   000§\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000©\000  Crosses P/P, A/A invalid Within All    TF F 000§\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000©\000  Overlaps P/P, A/A    TT T 000§\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000©\000  Overlaps L/L 1   T T 000§\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000¨\000 000©\000  Overlaps P/L, P/A, L/A invalid Intersects  A.intersects\(B\ = !

The confidence of the rule 0013 P 001 Q/S\e radio of 0011 P 001 Q/ S\d  0011 P/S  Definition 2 If the support of predicates set ‘P’ is greater than or equal the least support threshold value 0011 min from k level, then ‘P’ is frequent in set ‘S’ with k levels and all its ancestors in concept tree are frequent on their corresponding levels. If the support of the rule P 001 Q/ S is greater than or equal the least support threshold value 0011 min from k level, then the ‘k’ level include the high rule Definition 3 If predicates ‘P 001 Q’ is frequent in set ‘S’ and the support of the rule ‘P 001 Q/S’ is high, then the rule ‘P 001 Q/S’ is a strong rule A conclusion from the above definitions shows that spatial association rules are still the multi-dimension association rules within the confidence-support framework. There are some problems existing in multi-dimension association rules mining: 1\hen the support set is very high, the rules from mining are less and lack of representative. 2\hen the support set is too low, the mining results would have an explosive growth and it was proved to be an significant appearance in practice. In order to enhance mining work efficiency, the concept ‘meta-rule’ was introduced in this paper Definition 4 The following rule form is a meta-rule 


PP PQ Q Q 1k m1 k n 005ƒ\005 005ƒ\005 006 005ƒ\005 005ƒ\005  Where P i I= 1, …,m \d Q j j= 1, …, n\ are example predicates or predicate variables Definition 5 If R is consistent with Mp, then spatial association rule ‘R’ obeys the meta-rule ‘Mp’. It is assumed that there is a metarule as is-a\(X,land 001 S\(Y,X 001 P\(Y,M 001 Q\(Z,C Then the following rule obeys the meta-rule is-a\(X,land 001 Crosses\(Y,X 001 is_a \(Y,highway 001 income \(X,high B  Algorithm design and implementation The multi-level spatial association rule algorithm proposed in the paper is as follows TABLE II  SPATIAL ASSOCIATION RULE ALGORITHM BASED ON 000'\000\(\000\020\000\034\000,\0000  Input 000\003 SDB 002 geo-database Ref_Obj_Set 002 reference object set TaskRel_Obj_Set 002 task-related object set Sp_CH 002 spatial predicate c oncept hierarchy Mp: meta-rule min_sup[l  t h e l eas t su pport t h resh ol d v a l u e i n  corresponding concept hierarchy min_conf h e leas t co n f ide n ce th res h old v a l u e i n  corresponding concept hierarchy Output 000\003 Strong spatial association rule Algorithm  1 Relevant_SDB:=extract_task_relevant_objects\(SDB Ref_Obj_Set, TaskRel_Obj_Set 2 MBR_Relevant_DB:=MBR_Test\(Relevant_SDB 3 DE-9IM _Predicate_DB := extract_DE9IM_Predicate\(MBR_Relevan_DB 4 for \(Level=1; Level <= Sp_CH .Level Predicate_DB !=Nullˆ; Level  5 SpatialPredicate_DB := ensure_ SpatialPredicate\(Sp_CH [L 9 IM _Predicate_DB 6 mine_association_rules\(SpatialPredicate_DB,Mp min_sup[Level  m i n_ c o nf L e v e l      eo for  Procedure  mine_association_rules\(SpatialPredicate_DB,Mp min_sup, min_conf get frequence1- spatial predicate set L1=find_frequent_1-itemsets\(SpatialPredicate_DB for\(k:=2;Lk-1 000\001;k get Ck from frequence \(k-1\ table Ck:=get_candidate_set\(L[k-1 foreach s in SpatialPredicate_DB  get candidate Ps from Ck  Ps := get_subsets\(Ck ,s  for each candidate p 001\031 Ps    calculate support of each candidate item in Ps p.support  eo foreach  L[k p 001\031 Ck | p.support 000 minsup test frequence K-predicates set up to the total number of meta-rule or not  if \(k= length \(Mp   output association rules from L[k accordin g  m e ta r ule    000\003  output generate_association_rules \(L[k eo if eo for eo for eo Procedure “mine_association_rules SDB from the input in the table is the geo-database composed of spatial data and attribute data.SDB is a geodatabase like ESRI ArcSDE, Oracle Spatial 001 Postgis and so no Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set are reference object set and task-related object set. Because of the huge number of data during the spatial association rule mining and calculation time consumption, object in SDB are divided into two parts Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set  Reference object is the subject for problem description and task-related object which is from spatial query has a spatial association relationship with reference object  For example, Ref_Obj_Set={farmland block 001 farmland income},TaskRel_Obj_Set={resident zone 001 traffic network 001 water resources},Sp_CH is spatial predicates concept hierarchy.It is assumed that the Ref_Obj_Set in current mining task is farmland block \(2 dimension polygon, A\in SDB,TaskRel_Obj_Set is resident zone \(2 dimension polygon A\, traffic network \(1 dimension line, L\, water resources\(1 dimension line, L\.According to table 001\011 the spatial predicates concept hierarchy is built as follows  Figure 2  spatial predicates concept hierarchy As it shows in Figure.2 the spatial predicates concept hierarchy is divided into 4 levels\(0 003\032 3\.The number before the spatial predicate is serial number of the level and the brace under the predicate shows the row priority string model for 0.G-Close to 1.Intersects  002 A.disjoint\(B  1.Disjoints  FF*FF  2.Within  T  F  F   2.Crosses  T  T   2.Touches FT*******} or F**T or{F***T 2.Contains A.contains\(B B ithi A  3.Equal  T  F  FFF   3.Overlaps  T  T  T   3.Equal  T  F  FFF

Data mining task always begins from the 1 st level min_sup[l an d m i n _ conf l are res p ect i v el y t h e l east su ppor t  and least confidence in the first level in Sp_CH Now, the algorithm subject is explained in detail according to the serial number before each statement as follows   1\xport Relevant_SDB  from geodatabase according to the input Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set   2\ test the reference object and task-related object in Relevant_SDB by using MBR method \(Minimal Bounding Rectangle\. MBR method is always used as the geometric solution of spatial object and is defined such rectangle that completely contains the object 4  The inherent defect of MBR lies in the inconsistency between the MBR relationship and practical topology relationship from objects. For example, if the two objects are overlap but the actual topology might be separated. However, because of the superset coverage character and less time consuming compared with DE9IM String determination, MBR method is fit for the spatial association rules mining in this paper. And after MBR test in 2 nd step, the spatial predicates of Ref_Obj_Set and TaskRel_Obj_Set in Relevant_SDB is roughly divided into two types: one passed the MBR test and the other not passed. For the MBR test allows Positive Testing but not Negative Testing, then the spatial predicates not passing the MBR test are considered as disjoints \(Disjoints , FF*FF****\in the following calculation and only those passed ones need further determination. The divided Relevant_SD is denoted as MBR_Relevant_DB   3\ export spatial predicates table of reference object and task-related object that denoted by DE-9IM String from MBR_Relevant_DB\(DE-9IM _Predicate_DB\he table contains detailed topology relationship of reference object and task-related object and its form will be expressed in the latter table 001\014  Divided information is used during the export process   4\ make a recursion of each spatial predicates concept hierarchy and discover the corresponding spatial association rules   5\ According to Figure.1, generalize the spatial predicates in E-9IM _Predicate_DB which means making each detailed DE-9IM String generalized to current concept hierarchy spatial predicates. As showed in table 3, the DE-9IM String generalization in the paper used regular expression.And in this step, the DE-9IM String using regular expression in DE-9IM _Predicate_DB will be generalized to corresponding spatial predicates TABLE III  REGULAR EXPRESSION OF 000'\000\(\000\020\000\034\000,\0000 000\003 0006 0007\0005\000,\0001\000  Level Predicate s DE-9IM String Regular expression 1 Disjoints FF*FF  4    1 Intersects 002 A.disjoint\(B       4    2 Within  T*F**F    F[F01 2 3  2 Crosses T*T F|0|1|2 2 Touches FT 001 F**T F***T     F[F0 12]{2  012][F012 5     3   012][F012]{4    Contains  A.contains\(B B.within\(A    FF[F012  3 Equal  T*F**FFF    F{3 F012  3 Overlaps  T*T***T     012][F012]{2     6\ discover association rules by using Apriori property and the detailed process is shown in mine_association_rules. And the algorithm uses metarule when exports the strong association rules Awaiting discovery rule form is defined in meta-rule including logic relationship, the number of example predicates and so on. The introduction of meta-rule enhanced the effectiveness of strong association rule Moreover  heuristic information in original rule is used in mining process and candidate frequence k-predicate table will be straightly generated from frequence 1predicate table not using the gradually deduction method in the paper. Then after scaning DE-9IM _Predicate_DB, the support of each candidate kpredicate table is calculated and the candidate kpredicate which is no less than the least support in corresponding concept hierarchy will be chosen to built frequence k-predicate table. After that, according meta-rule and the least support of corresponding concept hierarchy, strong spatial association rules will be created from frequence k-predicate table  IV  E XPERIMENT  Algorithm of spatial association rules based on DE-9IM is implemented by java language and the API class library of JTS\(JAVA Topology Suite\ used to built the 9 intersect matrix of polygons The following spatial association rules mining process used farmland spatial data of Hongta area in Yuxi city in Yunnan province and the algorithm proposed in this paper is also explained SDB in this example is farmland decide-grade spatial database in Yunnan province which includes farmland blocks altitude, water resources, area network, residential area 


markets, central towns and other FeatureClass in most counties in Yunnan province. And each feature contains corresponding spatial information and attributes data Ref_Obj_Set={farmland block 001 farmland incoming TaskRel_Obj_Set={traffic resources The farmland block in Ref_Obj_Set is a feature class, the farmland incoming is a field of the feature class and the attribute table is as follows ObjcetID Geometry annual earnings Where the value of “annual earnings” has five different standards as ‘high’, ‘relatively high’, ‘medium’, ‘relatively low’ and ‘low’ after it has been discretization The attribute table of traffic network feature class in TaskRel_Obj_Set is as follows ObjcetID Geometry Road type Where its type coding range is VillageRoad,highway,RailRoad The buffer method is used to make close-to relationship to Intersects and Far-away relationship to Disjoints. In this test, a ten meters buffer area of traffic network which is original polyline in spatial database is formed before data mining which made the traffic network buffer area \(task-related object\as an A/A relationship with farmland block\(reference object \Then they can be described by the spatial predicates hierarchy in Figure.2 Meta-rule: P\(t,x 001 Q\(t,y 001\027 R\(t,z\ order to simplified the least support and confidence of each level had been set as 20% and 75 TABLE IV  SPATIAL PREDICATE SEGMENTS  Farmland profit DE-9IM String Traffic resources low FF2FF1212 Highway relatively low FF2FF1212 RailRoad low 212101212 VillageRoad high 212101212 Highway high 212101212 RailRoad  The results of spatial association rule is shown as follows Rule 1  Is_a\(X,”farmland block 001 Disjoints\(X,Highway 001 farmland incoming\(X,low Explanation: The annual profit of farmland block away from the highway is ‘low Rule 2  Is_a\(X,”farmland block 001 Crosses\(X,VillageRoad 001 farmland incoming \(X,”medium Explanation: The annual profit of farmland block passed through by country road is ‘medium Rule 3 Is_a\(X,” farmland block 001 Touches\(X,Highway 001 farmland incoming \(X,”medium Explanation: The annual profit of farmland block near by the highway is ‘medium According to the informatio n from the land and resource expert, farmland profit is effected by the traffic status. The spatial association rules from this experiment can be applied in local farmland decide-grade work such as the weight decision of farmland grade affected by traffic factors V  C ONCLUSION  Expression and definition of spatial relationship are important contents in spatial data mining algorithm. A new method used for multi-level spatial association rules discovery is proposed in the paper to express and define spatial predicate and classify concept hierarchy based on DE-9IM theory. And the corresponding algorithm using MBR test and meta-rule is also put forward to enhance the efficiency of the rule discovery process. The advantage of the new algorithm is the use of precise spatial topology between reference object and task-related object to discover rules. Finally the algorithm is tested in farmland decide-grade spatial association rules mining of Hongta district in Yuxi city in Yunnan province and proved to be efficient and valid. In the future, we will make research on the micro spatial data mining based on DE-9IM A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work has been supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Yunnan Province \(2007G079M R EFERENCES  1  Miller, H.,& Han, J.Geographic data mining and knowledge discovery Geographic data mining and knowledge discovery .CRC Press, Taylor and Francis Group.2009 2  Clementini E, Di Felice P, Koperski K.

 Fuzzy rules Fuzzy rules mfs Fuzzy rules Fuzzy rules mfs  Fig.6  mfs and Fuzzy rules in Traditional algorithms Table 10 and Figure 7 reflect the relationship between the minimum correlation coefficient \(min_corr\d fuzzy positive and negative association rules \(FPNAR\where the former is used to remove those frequent fuzzy itemsets of weak correlation. Table 10 presents the number of fuzzy positive and negative association rules, which are generated with min_corr varying from 1 to 2.8 under such preconditions as mfs = [0.3, 0.2, 0.16, 0.12, 0.1, 0.08 d  m f c  0.6.As can be seen from Figure 7, with the min_corr increasing, the number of fuzzy association rules attained shows an obvious decreasing trend, as the minimum correlation coefficient can eliminate the rules which are generated by frequent itemsets of weak correlation, leaving more meaningful rules. So, the minimum correlation coefficient can effectively remove those meaningless or less meaningful rules to ensure that the final mined fuzzy rules are meaningful TABLE X  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MIN _ CORR AND FPNAR mfs\(k\=[0.3,0.2,0.16,0.12,0.1,0  m fc 0 6  min_corr= 1.0 1.3 1.5 1.7 2.0 2.3 2.5 2.8 PAR 326 292 249 192 133 106 72 44 NAR 604 522 435 322 193 130 80 48 TotalRules 930 814 684 514 326 236 152 92  Fig.7  relationship between min_corr and FPNAR According to the above analysis, the algorithm is adopted to mine rules from the rock sample data set.

Compared with the traditional fuzzy association rules mining algorithm, this algorithm solves the problem about the selection of fuzzy support, and generates more accurate and effective fuzzy positive and negative association rules VI  CONCLUSION There are broad development space and prospects for the mining fuzzy positive and negative association rules however, there are still many drawbacks in the selection of the membership function and minimum support, and the accuracy of selected parameters directly affects the result of the final mining rules. This paper proposes a novel fuzzy positive and negative association rules algorithm for the first time, and utilize k-means clustering method to determine the membership function, avoiding uncertainty problems which may be brought about in current existed related algorithms that need to identify the membership function subjectively Meanwhile, the multi-level fuzzy support and the correlation coefficient criterion are introduced based on fuzzy positive and negative association rules. In the end, the proposed algorithm is proved to be more effective and accurate in comparison with the traditional algorithm through an experiment REFERENCES 000>\000\024\000  R. Agrawal, T.
