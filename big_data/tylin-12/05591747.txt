is the number of transactions that support itemset X in D  denoted as sup  X   Given a transaction database D and a support threshold min supp  a itemset is called frequent itemset or frequent pattern  if and only if sup  X  025 min supp  De\002nition 1 Let D be a transaction database over a set of items I  and min supp a minimal support threshold The collection of frequent itemsets in D with respect to min supp is denoted by F  D  min supp   f X 022 Ij

by the APT algorithm is 4 n  where n is the number of entry in APT structure Of the 4 n memory space 3 n is used to store the APT structure n is used to store the conditional database The exact number of entry is unknown before the APT structure is constructed but it is less than the total transaction dat abase item count Comparing with other frequent item set mining method the ef\002ciency of APT algorithm comes from the following aspects First APT algorithm adopts the frequent pattern gro wth method and depth-\002rst traversal strategy Second APT algo rithm uses pesudo-construct strategy to build the conditio nal database and the total memory consumption is determined by the APT structure which is unlike other frequent pattern growth algorithms Third APT algorithm uses array to build APT structure so the transaction traversal is faster than o ther methods such as link list III C OMPUTATION E XPERIMENTALS In this section we study the performances of APT FPGrowth and AFOPT algorithms on various real-world and arti\002cial data sets A Experimental Setup In our experiments to make it easier to bridge our benchmarks with previously published experimental results we u se three real-world data sets and one arti\002cal data set whose general characteristics are summarized in Table I TABLE I S OME CHARACTERISTICS OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA SETS  Data set Item Record Avg Length Source Retail 16470 88162 10.3 Belgian Retail store T10I4D100K 870 100000 10.1 IBM Almaden Wap 8460 1560 141.3 WebACE La1 29714 3204 151.1 LA Times TREC These data sets were obtained from various application domains Retail contains the retail market basket data from an anonymous Belgian retail store 1  T10I4D100K was generated using a data generator obtained from IBM Almaden which is often used in the association rule research community 2  Wap was from the WebACE project Each document corresponds to a web page listed in the subject hierarchy of Yahoo Finally  La1 was obtained from articles of the Los Angeles Times that was used in TREC-5 3  The FPGrowth and AFOPT algorithm are different implementations of FP-growth algorithm The former uses a novel array-based technique to reduces the need to traverse FP-tr ees and the later uses ascending frequency ordered pre\002x-tree and a top-down strategy The source code can found from http://\002mi.cs.helsinki.\002/src All the algorithms were coded in C and C build with Microsoft Visual C 2008 and run on a Microsoft Windows 7 Ultimate platform The experimental PC is installed a Inte l 1 Available at http://\002mi.cs.helsinki.\002/data 2 Available at http://\002mi.cs.helsinki.\002/data 3 Available at http://www.daviddlewis.com 2 4 6 8 10 12 x 10 3 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5   support Execution time\(millisecond   APT FPGrowth  AFOPT  a Retail 2 4 6 8 10 12 x 10 3 10 2 10 3 10 4   support Execution time\(millisecond   APT FPGrowth  AFOPT  b T10I4D100K 5 10 15 20 25 30 10 0 10 5   support Execution time\(millisecond   APT FPGrowth  AFOPT  c Wap 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 10 7   support Execution time\(millisecond   APT FPGrowth  AFOPT  d La1 Fig 4 Computational times of APT FPGrowth and AFOPT Q9550 CPU 4 GB DDRIII 1066 MHz RAM and Seagate Barracuda 7200.11 500GB Hard Disk B Experimental Result First We would like to compare the performance of the APT FPGrowth and AFOPT Fig 4 shows the results of data sets Retail  T10I4D100K  Wap and La12  We can see that the APT has the best performance For Retail  we set the minimum support from 0.002

faster than the others and when the minimum support gets higher the executing time is close d to others For T10I4D100K  the minimum support is from 0.002 to 0.0012 and the absolute support is from 2 to 12 When the minimum support is 0.002 there are 869 frequent items and 19561714 frequent item sets When the min support is 0.012 there are 866 frequent items and 286023 frequent item sets For Wap  because the number of transactions is small we set the minimum support from 2 to 12 with corresponding absolute support from 31 to 187 For La1  the minimum support is from 0.5 to 3 with corresponding absolute support from 16 to 96 When the minimum support is higher the executing times are closed because there are little frequent item sets However when the minimum suppor t decreases the frequent item sets increase substantially and computational times go up to 4661s and 3298s for FPGrowth and AFOPT respectively Second We compare the impact of item order for the performance of the APT Generally the descending order means more sharing entries and less memory usage But for traversal process the ascending means less depth and more performance Fig 5 shows the results of data sets Retail  T10I4D100K for APT with ascending and descending order Generally the execution time with ascen ding order is less than with descending order but the former need s more space than the later For Retail  there is obvious difference between ascending order and descending order B ut for T10I4D100K  there is little difference This is related to the property of transaction dataset IV C ONCLUSION In this paper we have proposed a new Array-based Pre\002x Tree data structure named APT structure which is a compact representation of transaction database and need less stora ge space than that of FP-Tree APT structure is used in our novel algorithm named APT algorithm for mining all frequent item sets The APT algorithm traverses the search space from top to down and store the conditional database using pseudoconstruct in the mining process Performance comparisons of APT algorithm against other well-known algorithms including FPGrowth and AFOPT have been done The results shows that the APT algorithm outperforms the others at all support levels in computational times The APT algorithm is simple and has a distinct feature that the space requirement is predictable in advance which has a linear relationship with the number of entries In the further we will study the performance on very large databases A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research is supported by the National Natural Science

Moreover we have conformed to the Zipfís law to generate the block reference within a particular file. The Zipf's law states that the product of rank number and frequency make up a constant; that is, while only a few blocks within a file are used very often, many or most are used rarely B  Experimental results In our experiment, we have evaluated our proposed method in three aspects. First, it is necessary to determine optimal amounts of training data to develop sequential patterns. Second, in case of using synthetic data, we will investigate how much the locality of reference affects the system performance. Lastly, we need to check the effect which results from adjusting the threshold of pattern weight In principle, we need to check effect which results from changing the size of data block, where the data block means a unit of data transfer; a file consists of a set of data blocks In case of MPEG data, a data block corresponds to GOP Group of Pictures\, whose size is not fixed. However, we have found that the processing time is not greatly dependent upon the size of data block, which implies that our proposed method does not need to have any regard for some special issues depending upon a particular file format 1  Effect of changes in the size of training data We expect that extracted patterns can get more salient as the size of training data get larger. For example, given an extracted pattern F 2 001\027 F 1 for 2,000 training files, one of its related patterns may be F 2 001\027 F 3 001\027 F 5 001\027 F 1 for 3,000 training files This section describes how much the size of training data can affect on performance of prefetching. In general, when developing a prediction model with machine learning algorithms, a larger training data always does not result in developing a better model [6  Fig. 3 shows changes in the processing time as the training data gets larger in size in case of using SYN and UCC data. In this figure, we can see that in order for prefetching to reduce the overall process time, the size of training data had better be greater than some threshold, but excessive amounts of training data causes an increase in process time; this is because excessive amounts of many training data cause pattern over-fitting which leads to prefetch too many files onto flash memory space. In our experiment, the optimal size of training data is 3,500 and 40,000 I/O requests for SYN and UCC data, respectively 2  Effect of changes in locality with the synthetic data This section describes how much the degree of reference of locality can influence on performance of prefetching for SYN data. In our experiment, we have generated the SYN data with three kinds of locality of reference; 2:8, 3:7, 4:6 Fig. 4 shows the processing time according to changes in reference of locality, it shows that our proposed method outperforms the conventional one for all types of locality and 2:8 of locality shows the best performance. On the whole, the processing time decreases as the degree of locality increases  3  Effect of changes in threshold of pattern weight As stated before, lower \(or higher\ threshold value of pattern weight can incur excessive prefetching operations. It is thus important to find the optimal threshold for the best performance   a\In case of SYN data  b\In case of SYN data Figure 3.Changes of processing time from varying the size of training data   Figure 4.

Fig. 5 shows the execution time according to changes in the threshold value of weight when using SYN and UCC data. From this figure, we can see that the execution time is greatly influenced by the threshold values. In contrast, in case of file-level prefetching, the change in threshold value of weight does not give a great effect on the execution time For both SYN and UCC data, when the threshold value is set to 2, the proposed method shows the shortest execution time In case of less than 3 \(i.e., prefetching all \(or most of\e objects belonging to the generated sequential patterns excessive prefetching causes a big increase in the execution time. Conversely, as the threshold value becomes higher than the optimal value, the favorable effect from prefetching decreases gradually V  S UMMARY  In this paper, we have proposed an intelligent two-level prefetching method in which sequential pattern mining is incorporated into the FAST-aware hybrid flash-disk storage system. In our work, the hybrid storage uses the flash memory as a cache space, and we focus on prefetching file or block\objects onto prefetch \(or sequential\og blocks to be accessed in the near future through sequential pattern mining. To achieve the best performance, it is very important to determine optimal values in terms of threshold of pattern weight and the size of training data. To be noted is that the proposed method works at the level of file and block objects   b\In case of SYN data   b\In case of SYN data Figure 5: Effect of changes in weight threshold In contrast, previous studies focused on prefetching block-level objects [1 i t h si m p l e he u r i s t i c s e v e n t h o ugh they cannot be applied to hybrid storage systems. On the whole, the proposed two-level prefetching is more effective than file-level prefetching in UCC and the synthetic data Empirical results show that in terms of the execution time the proposed method improves the I/O performance of hybrid storage by about 16% and 18% for UCC and SYN data, respectively, compared to the Top-N prefetching under the FAST scheme. We submit that two-level prefetching can help to significantly enhance the future commercial hybrid storage products. In the future, we plan to study a way of semi-automatically adjusting several parameters such as the weight threshold and the size of training data for sequential pattern mining A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported by the Basic Research Program through the Korea Science and Engineering Foundation funded by the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology \(Grant Number: R01-2007-000-206490  R EFERENCES  1  Hybrid drive: Wikipedia, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_drive 2  S.

After the decision table is constru cted through collecting WSDL interface information, composition process specification, and testing execution information rule extraction algorithm in rough set reasoning is used to find the rules associated with system or service failures. In a ddition, the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach are validated by two examples and experiments. At present, we onl y consider the debugging problem for the common Web service system, the fault location for semantic Web services should be further explored in the on-going research A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC\under Grant No 60803046, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under Grant No.2007041 0946, the Science Fo undation of Jiangxi Educational Committee under Grant No. GJJ10433, and the Youth Foundation of Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
