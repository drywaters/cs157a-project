Optimal synaptic learning in non-linear associative memory Andre as Knoblauch Abstract 227 Neural associative memories are single layer perceptrons with fast synaptic learning typically storing discrete associations between pairs of neural activity patterns For linear learning such as employed in Hop\002eld-type networks it is well known that the so-called covariance rule is optimal resulting in minimal output noise and maximal storage capacity On the other hand numerical simulations suggest that nonlinear rules such as clipped Hebbian learning in Willshaw-type networks perform better at least for sparse neural activity and 002nite network size Here I show that the Willshaw and Hop\002eld models are only limit cases of a general optimal model where synaptic learning is determined by probabilistic Bayesian 
considerations Asymptotically for large networks and very sparse neuron activity the Bayesian model becomes identical to an inhibitory implementation of the Willshaw model Similarly for less sparse patterns the Bayesian model becomes identical to the Hop\002eld network employing the covariance rule For intermediate sparseness or 002nite networks the optimal Bayesian rule differs from both the Willshaw and Hop\002eld models and can signi\002cantly improve memory performance I I NTRODUCTION A neural associative memory is a single layer perceptron with fast typically 223one-shot\224 learning corresponding to the storage of M associations between pairs of binary memory vectors f  u 026  v 026   026  1   M g  They exist both in 
a hetero-associative feed-forward form storing the mapping between the address memories u 026 and the associated content memories v 026  but also in an auto-associative recurrent form where address and content memories are identical where typical tasks include denoising and pattern completion Neural associative memories have close relationships to Hebbian cell assemblies 1 a n d a r e w i d e l y u s e d i n n e u r o science as models of neural computation for various brain structures for example neocortex 2   3    4    5    6   hippocampus 7   8   p e r i r h i n a l c o r t e x  9   c e r e b e l l u m  1 0   11   1 2   a n d m u s h r o o m b o d y  1 3   I n a d d i t i o n  n e u r a l a s s o ciative memories are potentially useful in technical applications such as cluster analysis speech and object recognition or information retrieval in large databases 14   1 5    1 6

example by the number of stored memories or the stored Shannon information per synapse e.g see 22   One of the earliest and simplest one-shot learning model is the so-called Steinbuch or Willshaw model with binary synapses and clipped Hebbian learning 23   2 4    2 5    2 6   27   2 8    2 9   H e r e a s i n g l e c o i n c i d e n c e o f p r e s y n a p t i c and postsynaptic activity increases the synaptic weight from 0 to 1 while additional coincidences do not cause further changes In contrast linear learning models of the Hop\002eldtype 30   3 1    3 2    3 3    3 4    3 5    3 6    3 7  a d d t h e contributions of each pattern pair For binary memory patterns the general linear learning rule can be described by four values 013  f  r  and 016 specifying the weight increments

achieve only a slightly higher capacity of C  0  72 bits per real-valued synapse However closer investigations reveal that the Willshaw model can achieve non-zero capacity only for very sparse patterns where the number of active units per pattern vector scales logarithmic with the vector size In contrast the linear model achieves the maximum C  0  72 for almost arbitrary sparseness Only for linearly or nonsparse patterns performance drops to the capacity of the original Hop\002eld network e.g C  0  14 bps 30   3 5  o r rather C  0  33 bps for 223hetero-associative\224 feed-forward networks considered here 44   I n a n y c a s e  t h e l i n e a r learning model achieves maximal storage capacity only for

storage capacity by activating neurons based on Bayesian maximumlikelihood decisions The corresponding neural interpretation of the Bayesian associative memory corresponds in general to a novel non-linear learning rule A signal-to-noise analysis allows to compute the storage capacity and to compare optimal Bayesian learning to the previous model types Speci\002cally it turns out that the previous models are only special limit cases of the general optimal Bayesian model Asymptotically for large networks and very sparse memory patterns the Bayesian model becomes essentially identical to the binary Willshaw model but implemented with inhibitory rather than excitatory synapses 48   S i m i l a r l y  f o r l e s s sparse patterns the Bayesian model becomes identical to the linear model employing the optimal covariance rule For intermediate sparseness and 002nite networks the optimal Bayesian learning rule performs signi\002cantly better than the previous learning models II M EMORY STORAGE The task is to store M associations between address patterns u 026 and content patterns v 026 where 026  1    M  We assume that all memory patterns are binary vectors Address patterns u 026 have dimension m and content patterns v 026 dimension n  Then we assume that each address neuron i and each content neuron j can memorize its unit usage M 1  j    f 026  v 026 j  1 g 1 M 0  j    f 026  v 026 j  0 g  M 000 M 1  j  2 M 0 1  i    f 026  u 026 i  1 g 3 M 0 0  i    f 026  u 026 i  0 g  M 000 M 0 1  i   4 Similarly each synapse ij can memorize its synapse usage M 11  ij    f 026  u 026 i  1  v 026 j  1 g 5 M 01  ij    f 026  u 026 i  0  v 026 j  1 g  M 1 000 M 11 6 M 00  ij    f 026  u 026 i  0  v 026 j  0 g  M 0 0 000 M 01 7 M 10  ij    f 026  u 026 i  1  v 026 j  0 g  M 0 000 M 00 8 for i  1      m and j  1      n  Note that it is suf\002cient to memorize M  M 1  M 0 1  and M 11  Thus an implementation on a digital computer requires only about  mn  m  n  1\ld M memory bits Note also that the synaptic weights of the Willshaw network and the linear models can be expressed in terms of the synapse usages The weights of the Willshaw network are w ij  1 if M 11 025 1 and w ij  0 otherwise The weights of the linear models are w ij  013M 00  fM 01  rM 10  016M 11  III O PTIMAL RETRIEVAL Given a query pattern u the memory task is to 002nd the 223most similar\224 address pattern u 026 and return a reconstruction v of the associated content v 026  In general the query u is a noisy version of one of the address patterns u 026  For clarity the following analysis considers only zero query noise assuming u  u 026  For the general case see a technical report 44  Now the content neurons j have to decide independently of each other whether to be activated or to remain silent Given the query u  the optimal maximum-likelihood decision  v j   1  pr v 026 j 1 j u  pr v 026 j 0 j u  025 1 0  o therwise 9 minimizes the expected Hamming distance d H  v 026  v   P n j 1 j v 026 j 000  v j j between original and reconstructed content If the query pattern components are conditional independent given the activity of content neuron j  e.g assuming independently generated address pattern components we have for a 2 f 0  1 g pr u j v 026 j  a   m Y i 1 pr u i j v 026 j  a   m Y i 1 M  u i a  ij  M a  j   10  With pr v 026 j  a j u   p r   u j v 026 j  a  p r  v 026 j  a   pr u  the Bayes formula we obtain pr v 026 j  1 j u  pr v 026 j  0 j u   022 M 0  j  M 1  j  023 m 000 1 m Y i 1 M  u i 1  ij  M  u i 0  ij   1 1 For a neural formulation we can take logarithms of the probabilities and obtain synaptic weights w ij and dendritic potentials x j  log\(pr v 026 j  1 j u   pr v 026 j  0 j u    w ij  log M 11 M 00 M 10 M 01  12 x j   m 000 1 log M 0 M 1  m X i 1 lo g M 01 M 00  m X i 0 w i j  u i 13 such that pr v 026 j  1 j u   1  1  e 000 x j  writes as a sigmoid function of x j  and a content neuron 002res  v j  1  iff the dendritic potential is non-negative x j 025 0  Note that indices of M 0  j   M 1  j   M 00  ij   M 01  ij   M 10  ij   and M 11  ij  are skipped for brevity Thus the generally optimal Bayesian learning rule is non-linear and differs from both the Willshaw and linear models Evaluating eq 13 is much cheaper than eq 11 in particular for sparse queries having only a small number of active components with  u i  1  However the synaptic weights eq 12 may not yet satisfy Dale's law that a neuron is either excitatory or inhibitory To be more consistent with biology we may add a suf\002ciently large constant c  000 min ij w ij to each weight Then all synapses have non-negative weights w 0 ij  w ij  c and the dendritic potentials remain unchanged if we replace the last sum in eq 13 by m X i 0 w ij  u i  m X i 0 w 0 ij  u i 000 c m X i 0  u i  14 


Here the negative sum could be realized for example by fee dforward inhibition with a strength proportional to the query pattern activity e.g 49   IV A NALYSIS OF SIGNAL TO NOISE RATIO AND STORAGE CAPACITY To build a memory system with high retrieval quality we have to minimize the expected Hamming distance d H  v 026  v   The expected Hamming distance E  d H   nqp 10  n 1 000 q  p 01 can be computed from the component output error probabilities p 01  pr v j  1 j v 026 j  0  p r  x j 025 002 j j v 026 j  0 15 p 10  pr v j  0 j v 026 j  1  p r  x j  002 j j v 026 j  1 16 where nq is the mean activity of a content pattern and 002 j is the 002ring threshold e.g 002 j  0 for dendritic potentials x j as in eq 13 Intuitively retrieval quality will be high if the 223high potential distribution\224 pr x j j v 026 j  1 and the 223low potential distribution\224 pr x j j v 026 j  0 are well separated i.e if the signal-to-noise ratio SNR r  SNR 026 lo  033 lo  026 hi  033 hi   026 hi 000 026 lo max 033 lo  033 h i  17 is large see 31   3 3    3 5    3 7    H e r e 026 lo  E  x j j v 026 j  0 and 033 2 lo  Var x j j v 026 j  0 are expectation and variance of the low-potential distribution and 026 hi  E  x j j v 026 j  1 and 033 2 hi  Var x j j v 026 j  1 are expectation and variance of the high-potential distribution In the following we compute the SNR assuming that each address unit is one with the same probability p  pr u 026 i  1 independently of other units For the content patterns it is suf\002cient to assume q  pr v 026 j  1  Then let u  u 026 be a noise-free query pattern having k one-entries Without loss of generality we assume further that  u i is one for i  1      k and zero for i  k  1      m  Equivalently to eq 13 but replacing m 000 1 by m for brevity a content neuron j will be activated if the dendritic potential x j exceeds the threshold 002 j  log M 0 M 1  instead of 002 j  0  where x j  m log M 0 M 1  k X i 1 lo g M 11 M 10  m X i  k 1 l og M 01 M 00 1 8  m log M 0 M 1  k X i 1 lo g M 11 M 0 000 M 00  m X i  k 1 l og M 1 000 M 11 M 00  1 9 For given M 1  M 0 the remaining variables are binomially distributed M 00 030 B M 0  1 000 p and M 11 030 B M 1 p  where pr B N;P  z   000 N z 001 P z 1 000 P  N 000 z  For large N P 1 000 P  the binomial B N;P can be approximated by a Gaussian G 026;\033 with mean 026  N P and variance 033 2  N P 1 000 P   Given u 026 i and v 026 j we have then M 11 030 8           G M 1 p p M 1 p 1 000 p  u 026 i  v 026 j  0  0 G M 1 p p M 1 p 1 000 p  u 026 i  v 026 j  1  0 G  M 1 000 1 p p  M 1 000 1 p 1 000 p   u 026 i v 026 j  0  1 G 1 M 1 000 1 p p  M 1 000 1 p 1 000 p   u 026 i v 026 j  1  1 20 M 00 030 8           G 1 M 0 000 1\\(1 000 p   p  M 0 000 1 p 1 000 p   u 026 i v 026 j  0  0 G  M 0 000 1\\(1 000 p   p  M 0 000 1 p 1 000 p   u 026 i v 026 j  1  0 G M 0 1 000 p   p M 0 p 1 000 p  u 026 i  v 026 j  0  1 G M 0 1 000 p   p M 0 p 1 000 p  u 026 i  v 026 j  1  1 21 From this we can approximate the distribution of the potential x j for low units and high units respectively For large k and m 000 k the sums of logarithms are approximately Gaussian distributed For Gaussian random variables X 030 G 026;\033 it is E log X   log 026 000 1 X i 1 1 001 3 001 001 001 2 i 000 1 2 i  033=\026  2 i 031 log 026 22 Var\(log X  031  033 026  2 23  which can be proved using the Newton-Mercator series for a detailed proof see 44  a p p  C   H e r e a p p r o x i m a t i o n s a r e valid for 033 034 026 and tight for 033=\026  0 if 026 6 1  From this we can compute the exact mean dendritic potentials 026 lo  026 hi and variances 033 2 lo  033 2 hi for low-units and high-units Fortunately it turns out that the mean potential difference 001 026  026 hi 000 026 lo can be well approximated by using only the 002rst order term in eq 22 while all higherorder terms become virtually identical for 026 hi and 026 lo  for more details see 44  a p p s  D  F   T h e n t h e 002 r s t o r d e r approximations 026 0 lo  026 0 hi of 026 lo  026 hi are 026 0 lo  m log M 0 M 1  k log M 1 p M 0 000  M 0 000 1 1 000 p   m 000 k  log M 1 000 M 1 p 1   M 0 000 1 1 000 p   000 k log\(1  1 000 p M 0 p  000  m 000 k  lo g\(1  p M 0 1 000 p   031 000 k  1 000 p  M 0 p 000  m 000 k  p M 0 1 000 p   2 4

Bayesian learning becomes equivalent to the covariance rule of linear learning models see Fig 1 VI R ELATION TO THE W ILLSHAW MODEL AND INHIBITORY ASSOCIATIVE MEMORY The Willshaw or Steinbuch model is one of the simplest models for distributed associative memory employing synapses with binary weights w ij  min\(1  M 11  ij  2 f 0  1 g  40 The dendritic potentials of the content neurons are simply x j  P m i 0 w ij  u i  The Willshaw model works particular good for 223pattern part retrieval\224 i.e if the query pattern  u contains a subset of the one-entries of an address pattern u 026  Then the optimal threshold is maximal i.e equal to the query pattern activity 002 j  P m i 0  u i  This implies that a single 223missing\224 input i.e  u i  1 but w ij  0  excludes activation of content neuron j  This observation suggests that the Willshaw model should be interpreted as an essentially inhibitory network where zero weights become negative active weights zero and the optimal threshold zero In particular for a diluted network with low connectivity the inhibitory interpretation of the Willshaw model with optimal threshold control seems to be much more realistic than an excitatory interpretation e.g compare 48 v s   5 4    Under some conditions the optimal Bayesian model behaves quite similar Obviously the synaptic weight eq 12 becomes plus or minus in\002nity if one of the synapse usages M xy is zero Since memory patterns are typically sparse it is most likely that only the synapse usage M 11 030 B M;pq remains zero Then the optimal synaptic weight is w ij  0001 such that similar as for the Willshaw model with maximal threshold a single inhibitory input  u i  1 and w ij  0001  can silence the postsynaptic content neuron j  In fact for suf\002ciently sparse memory patterns with M pq 034 1 but still M p  1 and M q  1 the synapse usages M 00 031 M 1 000 p 1 000 q   M 01 031 M 1 000 p  q  and M 10 031 M p 1 000 q  will be close to their large mean values whereas the synapse usage M 11 remains small and occasionally even may assume zero Thus the synaptic weights up to an essentially constant offset are dominated by the in\002nitely negative weights due to the M 11  0 events Therefore in such a regime the Bayesian model becomes equivalent to the Willshaw model Fig 1 Note also that this regime offers novel functional interpretations for strongly inhibitory circuits for example involving basket or chandelier cells 55   4 8

pattern activity parameters p and q  In the limit M pq  1 of moderately sparse and non-sparse memory patterns the optimal Bayesian model becomes equivalent to the linear network employing the covariance rule and thus achieves a maximal network storage capacity of C  0  72 bits per synapse In the limit M pq 034 1 of very sparse patterns the optimal Bayesian model becomes equivalent to the Willshaw network and thus achieves C  0  69 bits per synapse For a large range of intermediate sparseness and 002nite network size the optimal Bayesian model can perform signi\002cantly better than the previous models These theoretical results have been veri\002ed by numerical experiments illustrated by Fig 1 see also a related technical report 44   4 7    Note that this paper shows that even the best method of Hebbian-type synaptic plasticity modifying synaptic weights based on presynaptic and postsynaptic activity can store signi\002cantly less than one bit per real-valued synapse By contrast we have shown elsewhere that storing memories in similar network models by structural plasticity meaning the elimination and generation of synapses 60  y i e l d s a m u c h higher diverging synaptic capacity where the information that a binary synapse can store scales with the logarithm of the network size n 61   6 2    6 3    6 4    2 9    6 5   A CKNOWLEDGMENT The author is grateful to

   Table 4. Normalized Criteria Comparison Table In AHP   Reusability Meeting Operational Requirements Meeting project Deadline Reusability 0.157 0.148 0.272 Meeting Operational Requirements 0.789 0.744 0.636 Meeting Project Deadline 0.052 0.106 0.090  Table 3 and Table 4 show the weight values of the three criterions as compared to each other using the AHP process. These weights have been decided by the stakeholders after discussions among themselves Average weights can be derived from Table 4 as follows Reusability- 0.193 Meeting Operational Requirements- 0.724 Meeting Project Deadline- 0.083 These weights represent the priority of each criterion on a scale of 0 to 1  5.3. Argumentation Tree  We develop argumentation tree for each and every alternative separately. The ar guments are stated by stake holders and assembled under the alternative but they target a specific cr iterion. These arguments can either be supporting or attacking each other or their respective alternative nodes. We present three figures, where each figure represents the argumentation hierarchy for one alternative. Rectangular boxes represent the alternatives with the name of the alternative under it. Ovals represent the criteria with their descr iption. The arguments are specified by labels èAê, èBê, èCê for alternative çAdobe flashé, çAdobe Directoré and çOpen GLé respectively Along with the labels, the arguments also have indexes associated with them. Beneath the labels are two boxes The box on left shows the weight of the argument whereas the box on right shows the priority of the stakeholder who specifies the argument  Once the argument has been sp ecified, the user enters its weight. We first reassess the weights of the arguments using priority reassessment discussed in h e n us ing the techniques specified in [11 w e red u ce t h e arg u m e n t s  to a single level. Finally, the weighted summation of the arguments with the criteria weights helps us evaluate the final weights for the decision matrix. It is important to note here that, the aggregation method used for calculating the favorability is a weighted summation  The three argumentation hierarchies for the three alternatives are presented in the Figures 7, 8, and 9. The diagrams contain arguments, their weights and the stakeholderês priorities     Figure 7. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Flash   Figure 8. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Director 150 


     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
