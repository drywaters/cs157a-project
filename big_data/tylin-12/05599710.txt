To solve the above issues, text knowledge representation model is proposed based on the concept algebra of human concept learning.

Therefore, the power series representation of text denotes text association rul es, which contain the relationships among denotes adding      to distinguish these different web pages and represent the relationships among them. After studying the feat ure of concepts and that of web pages, we find that the power series representation of concepts can describe discrete featured patte rn of concepts and the relationships among them. Consi dering that there are some similarities between the concepts and the web page, we have tried to study the representation of text eywords from text now that the representation method of concept algebra can describe defined over a language of size nowledge, a sentence or paragrap h as an object, so a text which consists of many sentences and paragraphs can be regarded as a concept.

The greater the deg ree of text association rule is, the more complicated th e text association rule is; vice verse. For instance, there are two text association rules in the field of web service nowledge.

Ontology based models can express rich semantics, but the reasoning rules of these models are too strict, wh ich cannot meet with the diversity and irregularity of web resources. Probability topic models are based on probability and statistic, where many mathematical assumptions are given.

From summary comparisons of different models, PSR, PLSA, LDA, and OWL are all of semantic richness, but only PSR can be constructed automatically. VSM, EFCM, and PSR can be constructed automatically, but EFCM and PSR contain richer semantics than VSM.
