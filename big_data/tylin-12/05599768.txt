Its main fun ction is to achieve target file generated, target tracking and track management of multitarget. Bearing-only tracking with a single station is high nonlinear in substance. For th e certain constraints of target observability, real-time and hidden feature, traditional algorithms are difficult to p erform well. As yet, resolving method of this issue has been difficult in maneuvering target tracking doma fe rence [6-9], som e target track ing approaches are presented directly based on bearing-only measurements in polar plane on the assumption that bearingonly target movement is linear The base of the assumption is that sampling time of passive sensor is shorter and target confirming accuracy is high enough. There is always an application example with JPDA-IMM algorithm in reference [6  But, so m e key proble m s still exist in engineering application. And the stability of th is fusion strategy n eeds to be further improved.  In order to track the target with a large range the bearing-only measurements will be obtained by constructing infrared sensor array. This sensor system imitates compound eye of insect where every infrared sensor is a small eye in a single passive sensor system.

For the distribution of dense clutter, feasible event fro m clustering matrix will expand out of control. It leads to long running time. Especially system collapse potentially occurs in course of target tracking Aiming at the problem, specify a decision approach for total number. It is depicted as compe lling program to end the splitting of clustering matrix when feasible event number j t k m tj t j k m tt jt j j E N  E max P E 1/n w  JPDA\222s computational cost is high because the association hypothesis event number betw een target and measurement is exponential expanded. It is very disadvantage to the bearingonly tracking system. For s hortage of distance information threatening target is hardly to id entify quickly. So, the real-time of tracking processing is very crucial. At present, the problem which is harmonizing the contradiction bet ween computational precision and computational cost, hasn\222t been resolved Moreover, if the distance between the two targets is very near it is still possible to bring est imation bias and track aggregation Its radical reason is that the association measurement has made greater contributions to state estimation of all targets when this measurement falls into their association gates at the same time As a result, the state estimation of every target intends to be identical.  In engineering application, some approach are presented as follow kk X kk 025 P E In theory, the sum of all feasi ble event probability from a clustering matrix is 1. And the probability of every feasible event First, resolve to get eigen value of the matrix. Then verdict if its certain eigenvalueis is close to zero. If existing the matrix is ill-posed, or else operation goes on. In this tracking processing system, the diagonal elements of the matrix will plus an appropriate number X, where X j According to the co ndition of positiv e definite, first compel the matrix to symmetry. Th en, resolve to get its eigenvalue and determine if positive or negative. When all eigenvalues are positive, do nothing and go on. If there is a negative eigenvalue, the matrix isn\222t a positive definite. Under the circumstance, all diag onal elements of the matrix will plus an appropriate positive number The process will go on till the matrix is positive definite where r\017\004 2 Elimination of ill-posed matrix 3 Anomaly  processing of the probability of false event 1 Positive definite guarantee  D ESIGN OF TRACK MANAGEMENT MODULE Track management exists throu ghout the tracking process Its performance also directly determintes tracking effect. In J t   M ODIFIED BEARING ONLY DATA ASSOCIATION BASED ON JPDA ALGORITHM  P OSITIVE DEFINITE GUARANTEE OF INVERSE MATRIX AND ELIMINATION OF ILL POSED MATRIX In course of target tracking, many inverse matrixes such as filtering covariance matrix need to solve inverse. These matrixes are positive definite in theory. However, for the reason of finite word length of computer, error is accumulated with time going so that the filtering covariance matrixes lost the feature of positive definite and symmetry. Obviously filtering divergence will appear and it will lead to tracking missed. Moreover, ill-posed matrix might appear. When solving its inverse, the results are very unstable. Filtering divergence also will appear Solution in the engineering application is shown as follow here is defined as upper limit number of feasible event Then, the target in the cl ustering is treated as missing in the current cycle. And subs titute one-step prediction for filtering state of the next cycle Where 1  1 n is total number of feasible event. By analysis this approximation has little affected the actual tracking effect  The probability of invalid measurement originating from target 20  21 mt T k According to the splitting ru les of JPDA algorithm, the first feasible event is false event. The fist column elements of its matrix are all 1, which ind icates that all measurements come from false target. However the probability under this circumstance is very small in target tracking phase with dense clutter. Therefore, the engineering system treats it as anomaly and compels the event proba bility to averagely process is 0 1 1   1  1   som e calculated probabili ties wouldn\222t satisfy this condition for m achine\222s miscalculation. It leads to target missed because of subsequent false association probability. Aim at this Anom aly, the probabilities of all feasible events are compelled to averagely process. That is When the confirmed measurement number is more than one, the association probability between the certain measurement and the tracked target is large so that the probability is close to 1 The tracking system treats it as Anomaly. If the some false measurement exists in the association gate of the target and it is closer to the tracking target than real measurement in dense clutter, the anomaly will occur which is that false measurement has bigger association probability than the real one Under the circumstance, false measurement contributes more to state estimation so that target missed is inevitably Aim at this anomaly, this system still adopts averagely processing 


C  1 Design track logo  ck Threatening level: 0-threat, 1ordinate is settings for threatening level If the target state isn\222t renewed by filter, namely nothing of measurements fall into the association gate of the target, in the three consecutive sampling cycles, regard it as missing Obviously, if track initiation is completed within the three cycles, target track will be not intermittent when viewing track map of target TABLE I Design of Track Logo is bearing-only position vector in sample time target[i].state State of target is target number 45 67 t 67 67 89 r\017\005  T matrix for model 1 and model 2.

Model 3 is chosen as CA model whose state noise coefficient is 0.01 Initial model probability matrix 0 1/3 1/3 1/3 i k r k r k k Q P It is important to estimation of threatening level. So, target state devides into threatening target and ordinary target.  And track devides into new, old, missed and deleted. Considering the necessary to record th e historical infmations of the target tracks, design the track logo as structure body array shown in tab.1. The difference of the target state is used to provide the guidance  of  logo change for ta rget tracking. Its value is defined as array shown in tab.2, where tracking phase,  the establishment and management of the target file is a key indicator fo r tracking system. Good track management will effectively recognize varieties of targets and help to reduce computational compl exity. More important, it provides a base for the posterior situation assessment and threat estimation. Tracking management is realized by a globally unique track number and track logo.  Since these processes such as formation of new target and deletion of missing target all exist in tracking phase all the time, considering that economize  resource of system, tr aver every existing target number at the current moment before numbering new target. If old target is missing, its number is replaced by new target Then modify old target logo of track property. Or else continue to number based on old to tal targrt number with order and create new target logo If the target displacement of radial position is little namely satisfy formula 5, in the three consecutive sampling cycles, regard it as threatening target 11T  is bearing-only positio n vector at time 2 Some approaches of track management 24 where is threatening decision a ngle given by system Moreover, confidence measure based on this decision is not high.

On the other hand, the approaches with candidate rule addition and ge netic lateral tuning \(i.e., EC and ECW*\kept good ranking in almost all cases. This observation may indicate that the proposed extensions are effective especially for the high imbalanced data sets V   C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed two extensions of our genetic fuzzy rule selection for designi ng more accurate classifiers One extension is to add compatible rules with misclassified patterns into candidate rules for genetic fuzzy rule selection The other extension is to tune membership functions by genetic lateral tuning after genetic fuzzy rule selection Experimental results showed that the candidate rule addition can improve the training data accuracy. This is because the possibility that the misclassified training patterns are classified by additional rules becomes high. Experimental results also showed that the genetic lateral tuning can improve the test data accuracy as well as the training data accuracy, since fuzzy membersh ip functions are properly adjusted according to the pattern distributions. The combination of the proposed two extensions would be the best choice As a future study, we will examine the effects of the proposed extensions using a large number of data sets TABLE  VI A DJUSTED P VALUES OBTAINED BY N EMENYI 222 S T EST   H OLM 222 S T EST   S HAFFER 222 S T EST  AND B ERGMANN H OMMEL P ROCEDURE FOR THE T EST D ATA A CCURACY OBTAINED IN OUR C OMPUTATIONAL E XPERIMENTS  i Hypothesis Unadjusted p  p Neme  p Holm  p Shaf  p Berg  1 Pareto vs. ECW 3.1 x 10 10 4.8 x 10 9 4.8 x 10 9 4.8 x 10 9 4.9 x 10 9  2 Pareto vs. EC 1.6 x 10 7 2.4 x 10 6 2.2 x 10 6 1.6 x 10 6 1.6 x 10 6  3 EC vs. ECW 1.6 x 10 4 0.0024 0.0021 0.0016 0.0016 4 Pareto vs. ECW 8.0 x 10 4 0.0119 0.0095 0.0080 0.0056 5 Pareto* vs. ECW 0.0012 0.0173 0 0127 0.0116 0.0081 6 Pareto vs. Pareto 0.0024 0.0355 0 0237 0.0237 0.0142 7 ECW vs. ECW 0 0033 0.0500 0.0300 0.0237 0.0142 8 EC vs. EC 0.0064 0.0963 0.0514 0.0449 0.0385 9 Pareto vs. EC 0 0119 0.1781 0.0831 0.0831 0.0475 10 Pareto* vs. EC 0 0277 0.4156 0.1662 0.1662 0.0831 11 ECW vs. EC 0.0592 0.8876 0.2959 0.2367 0.1183 12 EC* vs. ECW 0 2945 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 13 EC vs. ECW 0.4017 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 14 EC vs. Pareto 0 6002 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 15 ECW vs. Pareto 0 7532 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000 1.0000

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
