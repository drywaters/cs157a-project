SICE Annual Conference 2010 August 18-21, 2010, The Grand Hotel, Taipei, Taiwan   400 © 2010 SICE Analysis of Various Interestingness Measures in Classiìcation Rule Mining for Trafìc Prediction Xianneng Li Shingo Mabu Huiyu Zhou Kaoru Shimada and Kotaro Hirasawa Graduate School of Information Production and Systems Waseda University Hibikino 2-7 Wakamatsu-ku Kitakyushu 808-0135 Japan Email sennou@asagi.waseda.jp mabu@aoni.waseda.jp zhy836@toki.waseda.jp k.shimada@fuji.waseda.jp and hirasawa@waseda.jp Abstract Recently an evolutionary algorithm named Genetic Network Programming with Estimation of Distribution Algorithm GNP-EDA has been proposed and applied to extract 
classiìcation rules for solving trafìc prediction problems The measures such as the support conìdence and  2 value are adopted to evaluate the interestingness of a large number of rules extracted from trafìc databases in the above data mining method In data mining many other measures have been proposed to evaluate the interestingness of association patterns These measures usually provide different and conîicting results Many studies investigate that the effects of different measures depend on the concrete applications We rarely know what measures are the appropriate ones for the trafìc prediction application Therefore a novel approach to select the right measure for the classiìcation rule mining has been proposed in this paper The 
simulation results show that the proposed interestingness measure selection approach is a powerful tool to select the right measure for the trafìc prediction application leading to the increase of the classiìcation accuracy Keywords Interestingness Measure Classiìcation Rule Mining Genetic Network Programming Estimation of Distribution Algorithm Trafìc Prediction I I NTRODUCTION Generally association rule mining and classiìcation rule mining are the tw o most popular techniques in data mining Both of association rules and classiìcation rules are represented as if-then type rules However there are some differences between them Association rules are generally used as descriptive tools which give the association relationships 
to the speciìc application experts while classiìcation rules are used for predicting the unseen testing data Therefore the evaluations of the two type of rules are different Association rules are typically evaluated by the application experts while classiìcation rules are evaluated by the classiìcation accuracy of testing data In order to discover the strongly correlated rules many kinds of measures have been proposed to evaluate the interestingness of patterns such as famous support and conìdence  Ho we v e r  there are so man y measures proposed and different measures have different properties which usually lead to different and conîicting results Some studies investigate that there is no optimal measure which is better than others in all applications  Therefore gi v e n a speciìc application 
nding the appropriate measure becomes the essential problem in data mining Some authors have studied intensively to analyze different interestingness measures used by data mining and select the appropriate one for given applications As one of the most famous approaches Tan et al proposed a method to help the selection of right measure from the list of 21 measures Moreover Lenca et al proposed a different approach which uses an Multiple Criteria Decision Aid MCDA method on 20 classical interestingness measures with users objectives However both of them focus on selecting the right measure for association rule mining in which the users need the speciìc application experts to provide the expected results or 
objectives In Tan et al s paper the proposed method is based on the hypothesis that the expected ranking of rules is provided by  coefìcient Lenca et al assume two scenarios where the experts accept or refuse the appearance of a certain number of count-examples 1 to nd appropriate measures However in classiìcation rule mining the most important point to evaluate the quality of rules is the classiìcation accuracy Therefore there usually is not expert which could provide the expected results For classiìcation rule mining given a speciìc application the interestingness measure which can provide the highest classiìcation accuracy would be the 
appropriate measure Recently as an extension of Genetic Network Programming GNP   a n o v e l e v olutionary algorithm called GNP with Estimation of Distribution Algorithm GNP-EDA has been proposed and applied to classiìcation rule mining to nd time-related classiìcation rules for solving trafìc prediction problems   In this algorithm three measures lik e support conìdence and  2 value cooperate to evaluate the interestingness of classiìcation rules Support and conìdence are the two most frequently used measures in data mining However we rarely know what measures are the appropriate ones for the trafìc prediction application Therefore the appropriate measure is necessary to be found In this paper a novel interestingness measures selection ap 
proach is proposed for classiìcation rule mining The proposed approach is studied in the speciìc trafìc prediction application With the right selection of interestingness measures the better rules could be discovered from the trafìc databases 1 Given two attributes X and Y  the count-examples denote the count of itemsets that if X is true then Y is false PR0001/10/0000-1969 1969

Measures can be used to discover the interesting patterns and rank/ìlter them according to the scores of interestingness For a given rule X  Y  various measures are usually deìned using the frequency

conìdence are the most two famous and frequently used measures in data mining Support is useful to prune the uninteresting rules  while conìdence is often used to measure the accuracy of extracted rules and estimate the classiìcation results Ho we v e r  the major drawback of support and conìdence is that they usually tend to generate a large quantity of rules Some studies have investigated that both generality and reliability should be included in a good measure where support and conìdence are generally used to represent them respectively F o r e xample Bayardo et al  pro v e d t hat many well-known measures such as laplace conviction gini and lift are monotone functions of support and conìdence In this paper we restrict the list and select the most widely used laplace  con

normal in large databases Allconìdence is emer ging as a k ind of such measures with respect to null-transaction Another widely-used measure is cosine also called IS measure Another category of measures have been proposed for measuring deviation from statistical independence such as  2 value and Pearson s correlation coef cient   coefìcient  Ho we v e r  since  2   2 N and it is easier for  2 value to set the signiìcance level  2 value is selected to study as the representative of such measures III T HE PROPOSED APPROACH This subsection describe the proposed approach for selecting the appropriate interestingness measure for the trafìc prediction application A Time-related classiìcation rules for trafìc prediction A novel algorithm called Genetic Network Programming with Estimation of Distribution Algorithm GNP-EDA based classiìcation rule mining has been proposed   The effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed algorithm have been proved in a trafìc prediction system The GNP-EDA is used to extract time-related classiìcation rules from the trafìc databases The average trafìc ow of each section is discretized to Low  Mid or High and saved in the trafìc databases The form of attributes saved in the trafìc database can be denoted as A i     where A i represents the road section and    Low M id High   represents the class of the trafìc ow The time-related classiìcation rules can be discovered with the following form A i     t  t a     A j     t  t b   A c     t  t c   Here t a  t b and t c are the time points which satisfy the condition t a    t b  t c  This kind of time-related classiìcation rules can represent the relationships between different attributes with different time points which can be used to do the classiìcation for trafìc prediction   B Roles of interestingness measures In the GNP-EDA based classiìcation rule mining algorithm interestingness measures play important roles where various measures are used for discovering evaluating and ranking rules In the previous research support conìdence and  2 value measures are combined for rule extraction However we rarely know whether such measures are the appropriate ones for the trafìc prediction problem Therefore various measures are necessary to be considered in the algorithm To solve the above problem we propose an approach for selecting the appropriate measure in this paper The owchart of the appropriate interestingness measure selection approach is shown in Fig 1 In this approach the interestingness measures 2 Null-transaction denotes the transactions that do not contain any of the object itemsets In Table I n X Y represents the number of null-transaction 1970

prediction result Since there are many rules in the subset of rules R  c     multiple rules are used for classiìcation To decide which label a testing data should have an average matching degree mechanism is adopted in this paper Let m  M denote the interestingness measure used for ranking the rules and m  r  denotes the value of rule r by measure m  Num    denotes the number of rules in R  c     R  cm    indicates the set of sufìxes of the rules in R  c    whose antecedent part matches with the testing data For given testing data d  the average matching degree of data d with rules in R  c    is calculated as follows M atch   d   r  R  cm    m  r   Num     3 The values of M atch   d  of three classes  are compared where the class with the highest average matching degree is the classiìcation result The classiìcation results are compared with the actual testing data for calculating the classiìcation accuracy Different selection of the interestingness measures would lead to different classiìcation accuracies After the comparison the appropriate measure for the trafìc prediction application could be found IV S IMULATIONS In this section the interestingness measures shown in Table II are studied in the trafìc prediction application The proposed approach is adopted to nd the appropriate measure from the 10 famous measures in the list for the trafìc prediction application The evolutionary algorithm GNP-EDA is carried out to mine the classiìcation rules from the trafìc databases Two simulations are carried out based on different settings of N f 4  i.e 200 and 300 The thresholds of support and conìdence in rule extraction are deìned as follows support min 0  03  conf idence min  0  8  The structure of the rules is time-related where there exist time differences between different attributes of the rules 1step prediction  L 1  is carried out for trafìc prediction The classiìcation accuracy is calculated by checking whether the classiìed results satisìed the actual results as shown in Eq 4 The classiìcation accuracy is composed of training accuracy and testing accuracy where testing accuracy would guide us to nd the appropriate measure Accuracy  Number of testing examples correctly classiìed Total number of testing examples  4 10 interestingness measures in Table II are used to rank the extracted rules and make a comparative study As a result the appropriate measure for the trafìc prediction application could be obtained 4 For target road section A c wemine N f classiìcation rules for each set of R c  Low   R c  Mid  or R c  High  whose consequent attribute is A c  Low   A c  Mid  or A c  High   A Simulation results We start by analyzing various measures with different coverage thresholds    The role of the analysis is to rank the rules using each selected measure The classiìcation accuracy of the interestingness measures with different values of coverage threshold    are shown in Fig 2 and 3 which are the average over 10 different trials of rule extraction Moreover the ranking of testing accuracies of the measures listed in Table II is shown in Table III B Simulation analysis Results showed that different measures provide different classiìcation accuracies for the same set of rules and the classiìcation accuracies would also be different for different coverage thresholds Summarizing the two simulations with different N f  we could nd that Laplace could provide the highest classiìcation accuracy in testing data which means that Laplace is the appropriate interestingness measure for the trafìc prediction application presented in this paper Conìdence conviction lift and CF provide similar accuracies in both training and testing since conviction lift and CF are the functions of conìdence On the other hand we could nd that  2 value used in the previous research   is not the appropriate measure for the trafìc prediction application since it can not obtain the highest accuracy The rest measures provide much worse results because of the misleading ranks On the other hand an extended analysis is done between the training accuracy and testing accuracy Based on these comparison we could nd that the ranking of Laplace in the training data is just in the fth but it achieves the best performance in the testing data while some other measures such as conìdence conviction lift and CF could get the higher accuracy than Laplace in the training data but achieve worse accuracy in the testing data The reason for such a phenomenon is that Laplace could extract more general rules using the training data which could provide better performance in the testing data Some other measures pay much more attentions to the speciìc rules which causes the overìtting problem Moreover the values of interestingness evaluated by measures play another important role in our model for the trafìc prediction problem The accuracies by different measures may be different in the testing even if the same rankings of rules are achieved in the training Such phenomenon could be found from the comparison among conìdence conviction lift and CF in Fig 2\(a and 2\(b The training accuracies of them are the same but the testing accuracies are different Analyzing all measures listed in Table II as a whole we introduce four properties of interestingness measures that should be considered in classiìcation rule mining P1 Measure m could help to discover the rules with high classiìcation accuracy on the training data P2 The rules evaluated by m should not be too speciìc to cause overìtting which makes the low classiìcation accuracy on the testing data 1972

Capacity for analysis and synthesisé, çResearch skills Capacity to learn 4   Interpersonal skills Leadershipé, çInterpersonal skillsé, çAbility to communicate with non-expertsé, çOral and written communications in native languageé, çCritical and self-critical capabilityé, çTeamworking 5   Personal skills Ability to work autonomously Problem solvingé, çCapacity to adapt to new situations Knowledge of a second languageé, çConcern for qualityé, çWill to succeedé, çElementary computing skillsé, çCapacity for applying knowledge in practice Decision makingé, çProject design and management Information management skills Table 7 shows the mean importance of each gr oup of competences by stakeholder group for the First Cycle Degree respondents. For the employers the personal skills are the most importance group followed by professional skills and interpersonal skills. The table confirms that employers rank internationalisation and entrepreneurship lowest. Academics agree with the order of the competence groups but rate all of them more strongly important than employers. Students also rank the competence groups in the same order but rate internationalisation slightly higher than employers and entrepreneurship very slightly lower Analysis of the level of development of the competenceas shows that there is good agreement that Professional skills are the best developed of the skill groups followed by Personal skills and Interpersonal skills. As with importance the Entrepreneurship and Internationalisation skill groups are developed the least. There is clearly a difference between the rated importance and level of development of these groups in that the Personal skills group is rated most important but the Professional skills group is developed the most. Other than that the general structure of the supply demand balance of the generic competences is quite well aligned V  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  The objective of this study was to apply the Tuning Methodology to the EIE discipline set to test the alignment between the views of the importance and level of development of sets of competences between students, academics and employers. The results of this study show that the Tuning Methodology is a useful tool for assessing alignment in these subjects  TABLE VII  MEAN IMPORTANCE OF EACH GROUP BY STAKEHOLDER  Competence Group Academic Employer Student Internationalization 2.86 2.63 2.79 Entrepreneurship 3.07 3.05 3.02 Interpersonal skills 3.23 3.09 3.06 Professional skills 3.36 3.29 3.13 Personal skills 3.44 3.30 3.29  In total 3,275 questionnaires have been collected from the stakeholder groups from a range of European countries. The number of responses from each c ountry is variable and a full by country analysis is not possible with the responses currently available, that said a range of analyses have been carried out Tests of the homogeneity of the responses across all countries show that there are country differences in some analyses and some of these are explored, others merit further investigation. Many of the analyses presented in this paper are aggregated results and therefore potentially suffer clustering problems. This too is a topic of further investigation The following is a summary of the key conclusions drawn from the analyses presented Consistent top of importance of the generic competences for all stakeholders is çProblem solvingé. Second in the ranking for students is çElementary computing skillsé. Comparatively students under rate the importance of this skill, perhaps it is taken for granted in students than in academics and employers The results show employers value it more than students and this message could be communicated to students A number of gaps exist between the importance and level of development between the stakeholders. The largest gap is Knowledge of a second languageé and the evidence from the languages section suggests this view is strongly aimed at English The generic competences group into 5 sets with çPersonal skillsé rated consistently as the most important set. This is followed, in descending order of importance, by çProfessional skillsé, çInterpersonal skillsé, çInternationalisationé and Entrepreneurshipé. The smallest mean çInternationalisation is just over midway between çweaké and çconsiderableé. Given the European Unionês desire to see greater student and employee mobility across Europe, it is clear there is scope for scope for improvement in the value placed in this skill set by curriculum designers Curriculum designers and academics can take comfort in the finding that çProfessional skillsé are the best developed of the skill gr oups followed by çPersonal sk illsé and Interpersonal skillsé. This not only aligns with the views of employers but aligns with anecdotal evidence on the real purpose of EIE education programmes. That said there is a trend in a number of countries across Europe away from large firm employment towards a Small to Medium Sized Enterprise culture. Curriculum designers may wish to reflect on the fact that entrepreneurial skills are very low in the list and perhaps merit more attention and emphasis in the curricula In general the different stakeholders rate the importance and level of development on average differently.
