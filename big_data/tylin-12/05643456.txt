There are many data mining tasks, such as classification, clustering, association rule mining and sequential pattern mining. Many frequent sequential traversal pattern mining algorithms have been developed which mine the set of frequent subsequences traversal pattern satisfying a minimum support constraint in a session database. However, previous frequent sequential traversal pattern mining algorithms give equal weightage to sequential traversal patterns while the pages in sequential traversal patterns have different importance and have different weightage. Another main problem in most of the frequent sequential traversal pattern mining algorithms is that they produce a large number of sequential traversal patterns when a minimum support is lowered and they do not provide alternative ways to adjust the number of sequential traversal patterns other than increasing the minimum support. In this paper, we propose a frequent sequential traversal pattern mining with weights constraint. Our main approach is to add the weight constraints into the sequential traversal pattern while maintaining the downward closure property. A weight range is defined to maintain the downward closure property and pages are given different weights and traversal sequences assign a minimum and maximum weight In scanning a session database, a maximum and minimum weight in the session database is used to prune infrequent sequential traversal subsequence by doing downward closure property can be maintained. Our method produces a few but important sequential traversal patterns in session databases with a low minimum support, by adjusting a weight range of pages and sequence Keywords- Sequential traversal Pattern Mining; Periodic Pattern; Weight constraint; Web usage mining; Data mining I I NTRODUCTION Sequences are an important kind of data which occur frequently in many fields such as medical, business financial, customer behavior, educations, security, and other applications. In these applications, the analysis of the data needs to be carried out in different ways to satisfy different application requirements, and it needs to be carried out in an efficient manner It is obvious that time stamp is an important attribute of each dataset, and it can give us more accurate and useful information and rules. A database consists of sequences of values or events that change with time are called a time series database. This type of database is widely used to store historical data in a diversity of areas. One of the data mining techniques which have been designed for mining time series data is sequential pattern mining Sequential pattern mining is trying to find the relationships between occurrences of sequential events for looking for any specific order of the occurrences. In the other words, sequential pattern mining is aiming at finding the frequently occurred sequences to describe the data or predict future data or mining periodical patterns To gain a better understanding of sequential pattern  a shopping store database, we can find frequent sequential  bought the TV typically bought the DVD player and then  conceivable that achieving this pattern has great impact to better advertisement and better management of shopping store Interestingness measures play an important role in data mining methods, regardless of the kind of patterns being mined. These measures are intended for selecting and ranking patterns according to their potential interest to the user. Choosing interestingness parameters that reflect real human interest remains an open issue Sequential pattern mining methods often use the support which is the criterion to evaluate frequency but this parameter is not efficient to discover some patterns Regardless of a great diversity of models for sequential pattern mining, from one perspective, the problem of mining sequential pattern can be partitioned into three categories periodic patterns, statistically patterns, and approximate patterns. Due to the huge increase in data volume and also quite large search space, efficient solutions for finding patterns in sequence data are nowadays very important. For this reason, using some pruning technique is necessary to optimize the algorithms. They aim to improve performance and reduce response time to find patterns in sequence data 518 978-1-4244-7818-7/10/$26.00 c  2010 IEEE 


To overcome problems of Apriori based sequential pattern mining algorithms, prefix projected sequential pattern growth based approaches have been developed Sequential pattern growth methods mine the complete set of frequent patterns using a divide and conquer method to reduce the search space without generating all the candidates. There are many limitations exist in the previous sequential traversal pattern mining algorithms. Some are given below  First, in the real world, some traversal sequences are more important and others are less important. However previous sequential traversal pattern mining approaches do not consider this characteristic of real datasets. In other words, all pages and traversal sequences are treated uniformly  Second, most sequential traversal pattern mining algorithms use a support constraint to prune the combinatorial search space. This strategy provides for basic pruning. However, support based pruning is not enough when considering the characteristics of real datasets. In previous mining approaches, after mining datasets to obtain the sequential traversal patterns, there is no way to adjust the number of sequential patterns through user feedback without changing the minimum support. Sequential pattern mining algorithms such as have better performance when a minimum support is high, the database is sparse and the length of the maximum sequential pattern is short Meanwhile, the main problem with these algorithms is that they can still generate an exponentially large number of sequential patterns and the runtime increases dramatically when a minimum support is lowered. Although closed sequential pattern mining approaches have been used, many sequential patterns are still generated in large dense databases  We propose an efficient method for sequential traversal pattern mining with weight constraint to tackle these problems of previous traversal pattern mining. Our main goal in this framework is to add weight constraints into the traversal pattern algorithm while keeping the downward closure property. In our approach, a weight range is defined, pages are given different weights to reflect characteristics of the real dataset, and the weights of sequences are calculated. The weight range is used to generate a reasonable number of frequent sequential traversal patterns even in a dense database with a low minimum support. Additionally, both the weight and support of each page are considered separately for pruning the search space. An extensive performance study shows that the number of sequential traversal patterns can be easily adjusted by setting a weight range and the runtime is efficient The main contributions of this paper are: 1\ Introduction of the concept of frequent sequential traversal patterns with weight constraint, 2\ Classification and incorporation of two key features, a weight and a support, 3\ Description of periodic patterns, 4\ Dynamic Significant Patterns, 5 Analysis and performance evaluation; frequent traversal pattern mining by using a weight constraint, and experimental study to compare the performance of our algorithm with a recently developed algorithm, WSpan II P ROPOSED W ORK This In this section, we suggest an efficient sequential traversal pattern mining algorithm in which the main approach is to apply weight constraints into the frequent sequential traversal tree while maintaining the downward  closure property We discuss our algorithm in detail and show actual examples for sequential traversal pattern mining with weight constraint  Definition 2.1 Weight Range A weight of a web page is a non-negative real number that shows the importance of each web page. The weight of each web page is assigned to reflect the importance of each web page in the session database Definition 2.2 Traversal sequence with weight We can use the term, traversal sequence with weight to represent a set of sequential traversal patterns with weight Definition 2.3 Average Weight of traversal We can use the term; average weight of subsequence is the sum of weight all pages in traversal divided by total number of pages in sequence Definition 2.4 Minimum and Maximum weight of subsequence Here we define the maximum and minimum weight of traversal is average weight. If the weight of sequence come under the maximum and minimum weight range than given sequence is frequent otherwise infrequent A. Sequential traversal pattern with weight constraint In this paper, pages of traversals are assigned with weights to show their importance. For example, when users traverse web site, they may have different interest in each page, and therefore stay for different times. Web pages can be assigned with a weight standing for the user stay time frequency of pages, content of pages and type of web site This paper generalizes the mining problem to the case where pages of traversals are given such weights showing their importance. The weights are taken into account in the measurement of support, the ratio of traversals which contains a candidate pattern. If a page of traversal has a  removed from session of user and treated as an outlier, and can not consider for the support. For example, when users visit web site, they may traverse through a page very fast to another page, or do another work for a long time during web site visit. This type of page visit is not useful and consider as an outlier because the page is not attentively read by the user 2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications CISIM 519

The weight range for P 2 is from 0.45 to 0.67 So, when we construct the frequent sequential traversal pattern tree P 2 is eliminated from session B.  Frequent Sequential Traversal Pattern Tree with weight constraint In this section, a data structure called FSTP-tree is constructed. FSTP-Tree is a data structure, which must satisfy the following conditions. Firstly it consists one root  root, and a frequent-page head table. Secondly every page in the page prefix subtree contains three fields: the name of the page, the support of the page, and a link to the next same page. Thirdly every page in the frequent-page table contains three fields: the name of the page, the weight range and a link to the first node in the tree which denotes this page. The following algorithm to build the FSTP-tree Algorithm 1 FSTP-tree Building: Building a FSTP-tree of the SDB Input A session database SDB, weights of pages and a minimum support Output corresponding FSTP-tree Method 1. Scan the whole SDB and find frequent pages from SDB based on support and weight range assign to the page Here we add only those pages that come under the weight range and contribute to the support and those not come in given range consider as outlier and not contribute to support 2. Create the root of the FSTP-tree, and label it NULL 3. Scan the whole SDB for the second time. For each session in the SDB, we only preserve the pages which are frequent and have a weight in given weight range, and hold the traversal sequences of pages. The different branches of same prefix can be merged C. FSTPMW Algorithm The divide-and-conquer strategy is used for finding frequent sequential traversal patterns To handle the ordered problem, the FSTPMW uses a merging method. Each frequent ordered pattern whose first page is P 1 must be contained in one or more session. The merging process in fact is rebuilding a smaller FSTP-tree This time, the relative sessions all contains P 1 as the first web page The complete algorithm given as Algorithm-2 FSTPMW: Mining frequent sequential traversal pattern Input FSTP-tree  Output frequent sequential traversal pattern Method call FSTPMW \( Weight range for each page support, Minimum & Maximum  Weight Range Procedure FSTPMW \(FSTPtreeRootNode node,String prefix  for each node x in the corresponding     page head table do if x.support  less than minimum support  then calculate the average weight of prefix if minimum weight<=average weight<=maximum weight  output prefix  return else if i.subs.count == 0 then prefix = prefix + i.content calculate the average weight of prefix if  minimum weight<=average weight<=maximum weight  output prefix  return else call CombineTree\(i for each node j in i.subs do call FSTPMW \(j, prefix+i end for end if end for  520 2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications CISIM 


III P ERIODIC P ATTERNS This model of pattern is quite rigid and it fails to find patterns whose occurrences are asynchronous. Periodicity detection on time series database is an important data mining   mentioned above, this model is often too restrictive since we may fail to detect some interesting pattern if some of its occurrences are misaligned due to inserted noise events. A pattern can be partially filled to enable a more flexible model. For instance, pattern length three \(I 1 is a partial pattern showing that the first symbol must be I 1 The system behavior may change over time and some patterns may not be present all the time Two parameters, namely min-rep and max-dist are used to specify the minimum number of occurrences that is required within each subsequences and the maximum disturbance between any two successive subsequences. The rationale behind this is that a pattern needs to repeat itself at least a certain number of times to demonstrate its significance and periodicity Couple of algorithms in this area focused on patterns for some pre-specified period length and several models can discover all periodic patterns regardless of the period length Notice that period usually is apart of what we would like to mine from data. Let us look at an example to explain some definitions Fig. 1 Example of symbol sequence Figure 1 shows matches of partial pattern \(I 1 that is a 1-pattern of period 3. In this Figure, P 1 P 2  10 are ten matches of pattern \(I 1 nd S 1 S 2 and S 3 are three segments which each one forms a list of N consecutive matches of \(I 1 For example, segment S 2 is consist of 5 successive matches of this pattern. S 1 and S 3 are disjoint segments and S 1 and S 2 are overlapped segments. In many applications, overlapped segments often are not considered If the value of min-rep is set to 3, then S 1 and S 2 qualify as valid segments and S 3 is not a valid segment. Two or more than two contiguous and disjoint segments can construct a valid subsequence provided that distance between any two successive valid segments does not ex ceed the parameter max-dist For example, if the value of min-rep and max-dist are set to 2 and 3 respectively, both S 1 and S 3 recognized as valid subsequence whose overall number of repetition is 5 Given a sequence S, the parameters min-rep and maxdist and the maximum period length L max in three phases we can discover the valid subsequences that have the most repetitions for each valid pattern whose period length does not exceed L max When parameters are not set properly noise may be qualified as a pattern. Though, parameter maxdist is employed to recognize the noises between segments of perfect repetition of a pattern. The following three phases outline algorithm for mining periodic patterns in brief The first phase For each symbol I the distance between any two occurrences of I are examined and then for each period l the set of symbols whose number of times are at least min-rep are sent to the next phase. Since there are a huge number of candidates, a pruning method is needed to reduce it The second phase In this phase, the single patterns \(1pattern\ are generated. For each period l and each symbol I a  symbol * is l 1 The third phase After discovering the single patterns in previous phase, i-patterns are generated from the set of valid i-1\-patterns and then these patterns are validated. In this phase, we can apply some heuristics. For example, it is obvious that if a pattern is valid, then all of its generalizations are valid. Pattern \(I 1 I 2 is a generalization of pattern \(I 1 I 2 I 3  IV D YNAMIC S IGNIFICANT P ATTERNS The support and confidence are the most popular measures for sequential patterns. The support evaluates frequencies of the patterns and the confidence evaluates frequencies of patterns in the case that sub-patterns are given. These parameters are meaningful and important for some applications. However, in other applications, the number of occurrences \(support\may not always represent the significance of a pattern. Sometimes, a large number of occurrences of an expected frequent pattern may not be as interesting as few occurrences of an expected rare pattern This pattern called surprising pattern instead of frequent pattern. The information gain metric which is widely used in the information theory field, may be useful to evaluate the degree of surprise of the pattern. Target is finding set of patterns that have information gain higher than minimum information gain threshold. Experiments show that the support threshold has to be set very low to discover a small number of patterns with high information gain Note that surprising patterns are anti-monotonic. It means advantage of standard pruning techniques such as Apriori property can not be used. For example, the pattern \(I 1 I 2 may have enough information gain while neither \(I 1 or \(*,I 2  does Given a pattern P=\(I 1 I 2  l and an information gain threshold min-gain the goal is to discover all patterns whose information gain in the sequence S exceed the min-gain 2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications CISIM 521 


value. Similar to other parameters in data mining algorithms the appropriate value of the min-gain is application dependent and may be defined by a domain expert. There are some heuristics and methods that user can set the value of this threshold Information gain of pattern P is defined as follows Info-gain\(P\=Info\(P\*Support\(P\   \(1  Info\(P\=Info\(I 1 Info\(I 2  l  2  Info\(I k log I prob\(I k    3 where prob\(I k  is probability that symbol I k occurs and I is number of events in S For example, the sequence in Figure 1 contains 4 different events I 1 I 2 I 3 and I 4 Their probabilities and information gains are shown in Table 1 Table 3: Probability of occurrence and information gain Event Probab ility Information Information gain  I 1 10/20=0.50 log 4 50\=0.50 0.50*10=5.0 I 2 4/20=0.20 log 4 20\=1.16 1.16*4=4.64 I 3 3/20=0.15 log 4 15\=1.37 1.37*3=4.11 I 4 3/20=0.15 log 4 15\=1.37 1.37*3=4.11 The main strategy to tackle the problem of mining statistically significant patterns is a recursive method which at the i th level of recursion, the patterns with i events are examined In some applications, users may want to find the k most surprising patterns. On the other words, users may want to discover top k patterns that their information gain is greater than a threshold. However, the major limitation of information gain value is that it does not recognize location of the occurrences of the patterns  1 and S 2 in Figure 2 The pattern \(I 1 I 2 has the same information gain in the two sequences, it scatter in S 1 but repeats consecutive in S 2 As a result, it is beneficial if a parameter to evaluate this situation can be specified Fig. 2 Two examples of symbol sequence V  A NALYSIS AND P ERFORMANCE E VALUATION In this section, we present our performance study over various datasets. We report our experimental results on the performance of FSTPMW in comparison with a recently developed algorithm; WSpan, which is the fastest algorithm for mining sequential patterns. The main purpose of this experiment is to demonstrate how effectively the sequential traversal patterns with weight constraint can be generated by incorporating a weight page, weight of sequence with a support. First, we show how the number of sequential traversal patterns can be adjusted through user assign weights, the efficiency in terms of runtime of the FSTPMW algorithm, and the quality of sequential traversal patterns Second, we show that FSTPMW has good scalability against the number of sequence transactions in the datasets All the experiments are performed on a 1.4GHz Celeron CPU with 512 megabytes main memory, running on Dot Net 2008. In our experiments, a random generation function was used to generate weights for each page 5.1 Environmental results. Comparison of FSTPMW and WSpan In this performance test, we focused on the efficiency of using a weight range. Our experiment shows that in most cases, FSTPMW outperforms WSpan. First, we evaluate the performance on the kosarak dataset Figure 3. Scalability with number of frequent sequential traversal patterns Figure 4. Runtime 5.2 Further Extension FSTPMW basically focuses on sequential pattern mining with weight constraint uses a weight range to adjust the number of sequential traversal patterns. Frequent sequential traversal pattern mining can be extended by considering levels of support and/or weight of sequential traversal patterns. There are many areas in which items have different importance and patterns with a similar level of support and/or weight are more meaningful. For example, the 522 2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications CISIM 


concept of strong support and/or weight affinity can be applied in DNA analysis. We can give importance to specific DNA p atterns and find interesting DNA p atterns Our algorithm can be extended by considering the levels of support and/or weight of sequential traversal patterns. By not only giving a balance between the two measures of support and/or weight, but also considering both support and/or weight affinity between items within patterns, more valuable sequential traversal patterns can be generated VI  C ONCLUSION In this work, we provide a brief overview of models of sequential patterns. Many studies exist on mining sequential frequent patterns. One of the main limitations of the traditional approach for mining sequential traversal patterns is that all items are treated uniformly, while each page of web site has different importance. Moreover, previous sequential traversal pattern mining generates a very large number of subsequence as the minimum support becomes lower. In this paper, we developed FSTPMW which focused on frequent sequential traversal pattern mining with weight constraint. A weight range is used to adjust the number of sequential patterns. The extensive performance analysis shows that FSTPMW is efficient and scalable in mining sequential traversal patterns This models fall into two classes are called periodic pattern and dynamic significant pattern. Periodicity can be full periodicity or partial periodicity. In former, every time point contributes to the cyclic behavior of a time series. In contrast, in partial periodicity, some time points contribute to the cyclic behavior of a time series. This model of pattern is so rigid. In many applications, the occurrences of symbols in a sequence may follow a skewed distribution. Using the information gain, as a new metric, help us to discover surprising patterns. In fact, this is still an active research area with many unsolved challenges. Much more remains to be discovered in this young research field, regarding general concepts, techniques, and applications VII  R EFERENCES 1  D o n g G   a n d P e i J  Sequence Data Mining Springer 2007 2  Ag r a wa l R a n d S r i k a n t R   F a s t A l g o r i t h ms fo r M i n i n g  Association Rules", 20 th Int.
