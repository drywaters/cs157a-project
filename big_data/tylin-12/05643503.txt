Using Association Rules for Discovering Tag Bundles in Social Tagging Data Walter Christian Kammergruber Institut f¸r Informatik Technische Universit‰t M¸nchen Boltzmannstr 3 85748 Garching Germany walter.kammergruber@gmail.com Maximilian Viermetz Siemens AG Corporate Technology Otto-Hahn-Ring 6 81739 M¸nchen Germany maximilian.viermetz@acm.org Karsten Ehms Siemens AG Corporate Technology Otto-Hahn-Ring 6 81739 M¸nchen Germany karsten.ehms@siemens.com Manfred Langen Siemens AG Corporate Technology Otto-Hahn-Ring 6 81739 M¸nchen Germany manfred.langen@siemens.com Abstract Social tagging has become very popular with the rise of Web 2.0 making it an important piece of the puzzle that makes up the web phenomenon In contrast to more elaborate ways of organizing resources such as taxonomies or ontologies tagging is very easy to use and understand Because of its simplicity tagging does not create explicit formalized structures By applying a well-established data mining algorithm we show how common structures in form of tag bundles a set of related tags can automatically be derived from a bag of tags Based on these computed tag bundles tagging applications can assist users with improved user interfaces by introducing user based semantic labelling For navigating and searching his or her tagged information space there are certainly better user interface elements possible than a tag cloud or a plain list of tags ordered by frequency We propose that combining frequently associated tags into a tag bundle is such a way We have tested our approach on a data set gained from Delicious and evaluated it by utilizing the Normalized Google Distance Keywords social tagging data mining association rule mining folksonomy tag bundle personal information management I I NTRODUCTION Fueled by the wild growth of social media an increasing amount of information can be found online This results in an increasingly fragmented and inhomogeneous body of data being offered by social media sites In this context social tagging has become a very popular tool for categorizing knowledge items over the last few years  2 By allo wing indi viduals to cate gorize and mark their own data as well as data of others an overview of content with some personal relevance can be won One of the rst social tagging applications was Delicious 1  a social bookmarking platform Many other Internet services such as Flickr Last.fm 43things Citeulike or Bibsonomy 2  make 1 http://www.delicious.com 2 http://www.îickr.com http://www.last.fm http://www.43things.com http://www.bibsonomy.org use of tagging for structuring their content But since the information is being categorized by many individuals who do not necessarily share a common understanding of all or even a part of the subject matter the challenge of interpreting tags in large group or corporate contexts has been of developing interest First of all social tagging follows very heterogeneous and individual usage patterns Each user and each application has different characteristics In general one can observe a long tail distribution of tag frequencies This means that users tend to emplo y some tags very frequently and a huge number of tags very infrequently Having many different tags leads to information scattering and therefore navigational interfaces based on unìltered tags quickly become very inefìcient This applies both to simple lists of tags that are either in an alphabetical order or sorted based on the frequency of a tag Tag clouds as alternative representation display only an excerpt of the more commonly used tags A related challenge is presented by the variety of reasons motivating tagging in an information system Golder and Huberman identify se v e n possible functions i Identifying what or who a document is about ii Identifying what the document itself is iii Identifying who owns the document iv Reìning documents or other tags v Identifying qualities or characteristics vi Self reference and vii Task organising Similar Marlow et al describe incenti v e s and motivations for users to annotate resources with tags i Future retrieval ii Contribution and sharing iii Attract Attention iv Play and Competition v Self Presentation and vi Opinion Expression From these enumerations one can see that the usage of tagging is manifold The personal information aspects are easily recognized by taking the individual nature of social tagging into account especially the motivation Future retrieval For a lot of cases a user wants to organize his or her personal information items 414 978-1-4244-7818-7/10/$26.00 c  2010 IEEE 


bookmarks pictures books bibliography notes etc Additionally with the advent of social software as knowledge management tools in companies  sometimes referred to as enterprise 2.0  o r g anizing tagged information on a larger scale and also in a professional working environment has become an important issue Organizing in this context means creating some structures which provide a certain degree of stability to tagging activities Technically this translates into the need to derive structures from tag sets We believe that it is nearly impossible to automatically generate complex formalizations such as ontologies or even elaborated taxonomies from social tagging data Therefore we direct our efforts towards simpler structures and use tag bundles as a starting point In Delicious tag bundles are a way to group tags This helps to aggregate resources tagged with the individual tags contained in the corresponding tag bundle But since a user has to deìne these bundles manually the average user typically does not make use of this feature The approach presented in this paper is focused on the extraction of semantic commonalities in tagging behavior and draws on parallels used to discover item sets of interest in a grab bag environment precisely the mentioned tag bundles II R ELATED W ORK Finding structures in social tagging data has received quite some attention in recent work Begelman et al describe a method for clustering social tagging data based on the co-occurrence values of tags The co-occurrence values meaning that two tags have been used together in a tag assignment is used as a similarity measure in the applied clustering algorithm Brooks et al follo w a n analogous approach Additionally they apply an agglomerative clustering for computing a hierarchy of tag clusters Other examples for clustering tag sets can be found in 8  10 Xu et al 11 describe a goodness measure for tag suggestions Heymann et al use association rule mining based in combinations with other measures for link prediction on social tags In contrast to our approach they perform association rule mining based on tag assignments for a certain URL without distinguishing between different users We consider tag assignments on a individual basis targeting the organization of personal tag spaces Schmitz et al describe the idea of using association rules to determine hypernymy and hyponymy relations between tags in social tagging data They have a strong emphasis on formal concept analysis and its usage in context of social tagging data Although we are following a similar initial thought of utilizing classical data mining techniques for discovering structures in folksonomies our focus is on structuring tags in a less formal and sharp-edged manner Our aim is to suggest to the user tag bundles for organizing tagged information objects The idea is that tag assignments assigned by any given user are a reîection of his understanding and taxonomy of the subject at hand By using the tags occurring in common sets an accurate picture of relationships between tags and their user perceived taxonomy can be gained By constructing tag bundles with a common root tag a subject grouping can be seen III D ISCOVERING T AG B UNDLES Tagging behavior as opposed to keyword extraction from text is geared towards the complete and succinct description of content and the organization of documents for a keyword based search A user will distribute tags on several granularities for instance java to describe more general concepts and bean for speciìc uses By discovering the usage of such broadly descriptive terms in combination with other more speciìc terms a tag bundle can be created which gathers all speciìcs to a general term into a set This set reîects the conceptual taxonomy and associated documents from a user perspective Tag bundles stem from personal information  e.g used when or ganizing a blog can consist of many posts when used as a notepad or bookmarks This creates an individual tag space associated with every user which is dependant on his or her own viewpoint While general concepts are easy to reconcile across worldviews speciìcs tend to be perceived in a slightly different light Tag bundles can help to reconcile concepts with each other by offering the general terms as a bridge between user perceptions Conversely the same tag can appear in different tag bundles of a single user reîecting the different meanings of a term Such overlapping bundles shows tags used in different contexts e.g java can be placed in a bundle books together with other book related tags such as tutorial or toread as well as in a bundle programming together with tags such as tools or tips Additionally the problem of ambiguous meanings of tags such as challenge presented by acronyms and homonyms 3  must be considered Depending on the context a tag with several meanings can occur in several tag bundles each representing different topical collections of resources A Social Tagging In most current work social tagging data is also referred to as a folksonomy A folksonomy is a portmanteau consisting of the words taxonomy and the word folk The term refers to the implicit structures therefore taxonomy 4  between entities emerging from the individual tagging behaviour therefore folk 3 Acronyms GIS can stand e.g for Geographic information system Greenland ice sheet or Gruppo di Intervento Speciale homonyms java can e.g stand for the programming language or the island 4 Taxonomy actually can be considered as the wrong expression since there are no real hierarchical structures present 2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications CISIM 415 


We deìne a folksonomy similar to the deìnition given by Hotho et al Deìnition 1 A folksonomy is a tuple F   U T R Y  where  U  T and R are nite sets whose elements are called users  tags and resources  resp  Y is a ternary relation between them i e Y  U  T  R  called tag assignments In general a folksonomy contains n-ary relations between user tags and resources Additionally sometimes the system meaning the tagging application in which the individual tag assignment occurred is also considered F o r the sake of simplicity we intentionally exclude the system as a participant in this paper B Tag Bundles The goal of this paper is to distill tag bundles B consisting of tags for a user A tag bundle consists of a head with the most important tag being the common denominator for the linked resources Additionally there is a set with sub-tags which are more speciìc and can reîect different aspects of the resources in question An example can be seen in gure 2 By using the relationship between tags associated with a resource we seek to discover tag bundles in user tagging Not only do tags elucidate the content of a document but the same tags are also in a semantic relationship with each other simply by being used to describe the same source of information C Association Rule Mining for Bundle Discovery Association Rule Mining ARM is a popular data mining method Association rules have been extensively studied in the literature However most widely used algorithms are based on the original a-priori algorithm proposed by Agrawal et al A typical application of ARM is the analysis of transaction data recorded by point-of-sale POS systems in supermarkets The results are e.g integrated in the decision process of how to arrange items in a supermarket This sometimes leads to surprising results Observations in a grocery store show that people who buy diapers also buy beer Based on that insight diapers can then be placed together with beer In analogy to grouping items that are bought together frequently we are trying to group frequently used tags together so that the represented resources bookmarks documents etc can be more easily accessed Association rules are in general of the form X  Y Support  Conìdence Support is the number of transactions containing both X and Y  A transaction for the super market example consists of the items a customer has bought together at exactly one visit Conìdence stands for P Y  X  meaning how likely Y is given X  Given a minimum support association rules can be computed with the algorithm described by Agrawal A tagging  meaning a user has tagged an entity with several tags is our special type of transaction Based on these tagging transaction rules of the form  x i 1 x ik  y i Support  Conìdence where x ij  T and y i  T are computed By restricting the set of generated association rules with thresholds for support  minSup  and minimum conìdence  minConìdence  only a selection of rules is considered as input for the target bundles In a nal step the rules are joined into bundles if they share the same head y i  Computed association rules have the following form for example  management  crisis  failure  nance  0  5  60 or  history  trust  nance  0  7  20 In this example both rules have the same head and are therefore merged into a bundle  management  crisis  failure  history  trust  nance Depending on the individual tagging behaviour and the parameter thresholds there are a number of tag bundles discovered The resulting tag bundles can function as a suggestion for a user on how to organize his or her personal tags IV E VALUATION We have applied our approach on social tagging data extracted from internal knowledge management tools at Siemens a blogging platform and a wiki 21 These applications are widely used within Siemens The results are very promising but since the amount of available data does not nearly reach the numbers obtained in Internet usage we decided to evaluate our approach on data collected from Delicious A Dataset During a period of about eight weeks end January March 2009 we periodically fetched the RSS feeds for the bookmarks of 2300 randomly chosen users of the popular bookmarking service Delicious During this time period three accounts where removed and 27 users did not assign any tags which leads to a total number of 2270 investigated users The total number of resources for all users aggregate to 462,415 with duplicates of which 345,674 unique resources form R  The number of resources tagged by a user range from a single resource three users to over 1,000 different resources eight users Surprisingly these eight users were not spam and we could also not detect any spam resources in our sample set In average there were 201 resources per user For some more details about the data set see 416 2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications CISIM 


       Figure 1 Histogram Number of distinct tags vs number of user There where 2,942,633 tags in total and 97,522 uniquely different tags forming our tag set T  While 27 users did not display any tagging activity the average number of different tags per user was 201 The median of different tags per user was 165 One hyperactive user registered 3328 distinct tags For a graphical representation of the number of distinct tags against the number of users having used the corresponding number of distinct tags see gure 1 We observed a typical long tail distribution of tags B Preprocessing For cleaning the social tagging data we applied only a conversion to lower case We did not apply stemming since it depends on the language used and rst tests have shown that language detection on tags remains inconclusive This may be because tags are typically very speciìc and often just a simple phrase We did not utilize a thesaurus because the overlap of tags and a thesaurus such as WordNet is expected to be low When it comes to mapping tags to concepts in WordNet Laniado et al state that only 8 of the different tags in their data sample 480,000 different tags collected from 30,000 Delicious users nd a corresponding concept in WordNet C Association Rule mining We have used three different parameter threshold 0.5 8 0.7 4 and 0.9 3 conìdence and minimum support We selected these parameter thresholds based on preliminary experiments where we tried to get a feeling for which thresholds are practical D Bundles Depending on the characteristics of the individual tagging data we compute users with bundles For 0.5 8 825 0.7 4 1207 and 0.9 3 1330 It was not possible to derive tag bundles for users if they did not repeatedly use more than one or two tags per resource or if they used many different tags Association rule mining can not be utilized to derive tag bundles in these cases Table I shows the statistics for the generated tag bundles For 0.5 8 there tend to be less tags per bundle since the threshold for the minimum support is rather high There are less rules created but rules are more easily accepted as a finance systems uk belief trust confidence learning business risk history politics cognitive failure psychology money wealth economics crisis management growth Figure 2 Example Tag Bundle for nance From the test run with Conìdence  0  7 and MinSupport  4  base for a bundle Also there are less users whose bundles could be computed 0.7 4 and 0.9 3 have more tags per bundle and the number of users with derived tag bundles is higher In Figure 2 an example of a tag bundle is shown In this bundle all computed rules with the head nance are merged together Contained in the tag bundle are tags such as failure risk economics or crisis indicating that the user for whom this bundle was created seemed to be interested in resources related to the current nancial crisis the data was collected in early 2009 E Normalized Google Distance In order to determine if the derived tag bundles provide useful grouping of tags we use the Normalized Google Distance NGD as measurement for the semantic relatedness of two terms NGD takes advantage of the number of hits returned by Google to compute the semantic 2010 International Conference on Computer Information Systems and Industrial Management Applications CISIM 417

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
