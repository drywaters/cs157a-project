I I NTRODUCTION As we all know, geographic Information Databases is an important style of spatial database in spatial data mining mining spatial association rules from Geographic Information Databases is one important part of spatial data mining and knowledge discovery \(SDMKD\, which is also known as spatial co-location pattern as in [1  S p at ial c o l oc ati on  pa tte rn  are some implicit rules expressing construct and association of spatial objects in Geographic Information Databases, and also expressing hierarchy and correlation of different subsets of spatial association or spatial data in Geographic Information Databases as in [2 N o w a d a y s in  res ea rch o f sp ati al  d a ta  mining, there are mainly three kinds approaches of mining 
spatial association rules as in [3 s u ch as l a y e r c o v e re d bas e d  on clustering as in [3 i n i ng app ro ac h ba sed o n s p at i a l  transaction as in [2, 4, 5, and 6  a n d  m i ni ng a ppro a c h b a sed o n  non-spatial transaction as in [3  T h e  f i rst tw o  m e th o d s  m a y b e  also used to mining frequent neighboring class set, The spatial association as in [4, 5, and  i s qu ite  s i n g l e be cau s e  th ey on ly  express spatial association among these objects which are all close to objective. However, neighboring class set expresses another spatial association among these objects which are close to each other. MFNCS as in us e s t h e s i m i l a r m e t hod o f  Apriori to search frequent neighboring class set, which gains some right instance of \(k+1\-neighboring class set only through connecting right instance of k-neighboring class set according 
to down-top strategy, and so this algorithm is only suitable for mining short frequent neighboring class set according to character of Apriori. Hence, this paper proposes an algorithm of complementation mining frequent neighboring class set denoted by CMFNCS, which is suitable for mining any frequent neighboring class set according to top-down search and complementation mining strategy II PRELIMINARY KNOWLEDGE According to these representations as in [2   ev e r y ob ject in  spatial domain forms a spatial data set, which is expressed as this data structure, denoted by <Object Identify, Class Identify and Spatial Location>. Here, identify of different class in spatial data set is denoted by Class Identify, identify of different object instance in the same class is denoted by Object 
Identify, location coordinate of object is denoted by Spatial Location. We regard an object as an instance of corresponding class, and so spatial data set is made up of these instances of spatial Class Identify. Sets of Class Identify are thought as spatial class set, denoted by C = {C 1 C 2 203C m means there are m different classes 
Neighboring Class Set, it is a subset of spatial class set in spatial data set, which is expressed as {C t1 C t2 203C tk  t k

Definition 4 Right Instance of Neighboring Class Set, let I i t1 i t2 i tk be an instance of NCS, if  i p and i q i p i q  I and distance \(i p i q  d, and then we think I be an right instance of NCS. Here, d is the minimal distance used by deciding two spatial objects are close to each other, Euclidean distance is expressed as distance \(i p i q  Definition 5 Neighboring Class Set Support, it is equal to the sum of right instance of neighboring class set, which is denoted by support \(NCS Definition 6 Frequent Neighboring Class Set, its support is not less than the minimal support given by user Property 1 Let k-NCS is not frequent neighboring class sets, and \(k+1\-NCS is not also frequent neighboring class set Here, k-NCS  k+1\NCS Property 2 Let \(k+1\-NCS is frequent neighboring class set, and k-NCS is also frequent neighboring class set. Here, kNCS  k+1\NCS B Problem Description According to above definition, property and these representations as in [2 e de scr i b e freq ue nt ne i ghbor i ng class set mining as follows Input 1\ Class set is denoted by C = {C 1 C 2 C m instance set is denoted by I = {i 1 i 2 i n each i k i k  I\ is expressed as above defined data structure 2\Minimal distance is denoted by d 3\inimal support is denoted by s Output Frequent neighboring class set III THE ALGORITHM OF COMPLEMENTATION MINING FREQUENT NEIGHBORING CLASS SET A Building  Digital NCS Database In order to build digital database of neighboring class set we need find corresponding NCS of every right instance, and turn NCS into a digit. The course of turning used by the algorithm is expressed as follows Step1, we define the order of class as C = {C 1 C 2  C j C m and so each class existing in right instance has order denoted by No j  Step2, and then, we use weight denote every class, if the order of this class is denoted by No j and then 1 2  j No is defined as weight of class Step3, we let 1 1 2  No  1 2 2  No  1 2  L No be defined as weight sets, here L is equal to Neighboring Class Set Length and namely, it is the sum of class existing in this neighboring class set. We compute this expression   L j No j 1 1 2 to gain a digit We use this method to gain a digit by scanning every right instance and this digit also expresses this corresponding NCS of right instance In order to save these digits, we use this data structure expressed as follows Structure neighboring class set Int Digit; // saving digit expressed as NCS of right instance Int Count; // saving the sum of same digit expressed as NCS} NCS Example, here class set is expressed as C = {V, W, X, Y Z}, the first three right instances are express as I 1 W 1 X 3  Y 4 Z 2 I 2 V 3 W 4 Y 5 I 3 W 2 X 4 Y 2 Z 1  Now we use the above introductive method to build digital NCS database, this course is expressed as follows NCS of I 1 is expressed as {W, X, Y, Z}, and these orders are expressed as {2, 3, 4, 5}, weight sets is expressed as {2 2-1  2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 and then, we will gain this digit 30, NCS [0   Digit =30, NCS [0 Co unt  1  NCS of I 2 is expressed as {V, W, Y}, and these orders are expressed as {1, 2, 4}, weight sets is expressed as {2 1-1 2 2-1  2 4-1 and then, we will gain this digit 11, NCS [1  Dig i t   1 1   NC  C o unt 1  NCS of I 3 is expressed as {W, X, Y, Z}, weight sets is expressed as {2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 and then, we will gain this digit 30, because NC s a l r e a d y sa ved t h i s  information, and only NC Co unt N C S 0  C o unt   1 2   B The method of generating candidate frequent NCS The algorithm generates candidate frequent neighboring class set according to top-down search and complementation mining strategy. Hence, this course includes two parts as follows Firstly, it uses digit logical operation to generate kcandidate frequent item sets of digit formed by \(k+1\-digit nonfrequent item sets. The algorithm adopts search strategy which is similar to B_UDMA as in a nd IT D A S N a s i n  8   Secondly, it uses computing complementary set of above kcandidate frequent item sets to generate candidate frequent item sets of digit. The strategy is similar to ATCM as in [4  The example of generating is expressed as follows Suppose spatial class set is expressed as C = {V, W, X, Y Z}, and it is Neighboring Class Universal Set according to definition 2, here it is not frequent neighboring class set Step1, the algorithm generates 4-candidate frequent item sets according to top-down search strategy, and then computes their support There are three non-frequent neighboring class sets as follows 1\NCS 1 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 5-1 23 


2\NCS 2 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 15 3\NCS 3 2 1-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 29 There are two frequent neighboring class sets as follows 1\S 1 2 2-1 2 3-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 30 2\S 2 2 1-1 2 2-1 2 4-1 2 5-1 27 Step2, the algorithm computes these complementary sets of 4-candidate frequent item sets according to complementation mining strategy as follows Complementary set of NFNCS 1 is 2 4-1 8 Complementary set of NFNCS 2 is 2 5-1 16 Complementary set of NFNCS 3 is 2 2-1 2 Complementary set of FNCS 1 is 2 1-1 1 Complementary set of FNCS 2 is 2 3-1 4 These complementary sets are all subsets of frequent neighboring class sets FNCS 1 or FNCS 2 and so the algorithm need not compute their support Step3, the algorithm generates 3-candidate frequent neighboring class set, and gains frequent neighboring class set as step1 Step4, the algorithm computes these complementary sets of 3-candidate frequent item sets as step2  C The method of computing support Accordingly to chapter A of III and digit logical operation we may gain this property as follows Property Let digit p and q express two right instances, let C p be a NCS denoted by p, let C q be a NCS denoted by q, then C p  C q  p & q=p This algorithm uses logical operation to compute support according to this property. The process is expressed as follows Suppose class set is expressed as C = {V, W, X, Y, Z there are 5 instances of neighboring class sets as follows No.1 right instance of NCS = {V 1 X 2 Y 3 Z 4  No.2 right instance of NCS = {V 2 X 3 Z 5  No.3 right instance of NCS = {W 1 X 5 Y 4 Z 3  No.4 right instance of NCS = {V 5 Y 2 Z 2  No.5 right instance of NCS = {X 4 Y 3 Z 1  Their digits denoting neighboring class set of right instance are expressed as {29, 21, 30, 25 and 28}. Suppose a candidate is 24 which is denoted by C-NCS = {Y, Z}, and then 29&24 24, 21&24  24, 30&24=24, 25&24=24, 28&24=24. Because of this, we write 4 to support \(C-NCS D The process of mining frequent neighboring class set Input 1\patial class set is denoted by C = {C 1 C 2  C m  2\ Instance set is denoted by I = {i 1 i 2  i n  3\The minimal distance is denoted by d 4\The minimal support is denoted by s Output: Frequent neighboring class set Step1, firstly, the algorithm computes the entire right instances denoted by Iê from instance set in spatial database as I by the minimal distance as d Step2, and then, building neighboring class set database as NCS after scanning once right instance set as Iê via the introductory method in chapter A of III Step3, using top-down search and complementation mining strategy to generate candidate frequent NCS according to this chapter B of III. Namely, there are two parts as follows Firstly, if a k-candidate is not subset of FNCS which saves frequent neighboring class set, and it is not superset of NFNCS which saves non-frequent neighboring class set, the algorithm will compute its support. If it is frequent neighboring class set and it is written to FNCS, otherwise, the algorithm will compute \(k-1\subset of k-candidate Secondly, the algorithm computes complementary set of kcandidate, if the complementary set is not subset of FNCS, and it is not superset of NFNCS, the algorithm will compute its support. If it is frequent neighboring class set, and it is written to FNCS, otherwise, it will be written to NFNCS Step4, repeating to execute step3 until search all frequent neighboring class set Step5, the algorithm outputs FNCS according to chapter A of III IV T HE A NALYSIS AND C OMPARING OF C APABILITY At present, there are very little documents of research frequent neighboring class set. Here we compare MFNCS as with CMFNCS which is introduced by this paper as follows A The Analysis of Capability MFNCS: this algorithm uses idea of Apriori to find frequent neighboring class set, which is made of three stages firstly, computing all the frequent 1-NCS, secondly, generating all the 2-NCS by range query, and generating all the k-NCS k>2\by iteration. The algorithm has some repeated computing and superfluous candidate frequent neighboring class set which gains some right instance of \(k+1\-neighboring class set only through connecting right instance of k-neighboring class set. As this algorithm adopts down-top strategy to generate candidate frequent neighboring class set, it is only suitable for mining short frequent neighboring class set CMFNCS: this algorithm uses top-down search and complementation mining strategy, which is suitable for mining not only short frequent neighboring class set, but also long frequent neighboring class set. The algorithm gains candidate frequent item sets not only by computing k-subset of \(k+1\-non 


frequent neighboring class set, but also by computing their complementary set. The mining algorithm computes support of candidate frequent neighboring class set by digit logical çand operation. The algorithm improves mining efficiency through these methods B The comparing of experimental result Now we use experiment to testify above analyses and comparison. Two mining algorithms are used to generate frequent neighboring class set from 12267 right instances whose class sets are expressed as digit from 3 to 8191 neighboring class set does not include any simple class, namely it has two classes at least, the number of spatial class set is denoted by m=13, the number of right instance included by these neighboring class set observe the discipline which is expressed as follows NCS of digit denoted by 8191 has one right instance NCS of digit denoted by 8190 has two right instances NCS of digit denoted by 8189 has one right instance NCS of digit denoted by 8188 has two right instances  Our experimental circumstances are expressed as follow Intel\(R\ Celeron\(R\ M CPU 420 1.60 GHz, 1GB, language of the procedure is Visual C# 2005.NET, OS is Windows XP Professional The experimental result of two algorithms is expressed as Fig.1, where support is absolute. The runtime of two algorithms is expressed as Fig.2 as support and length of neighboring class set change Figure 1 The experimental result      Figure 2 The comparing of runtime V C ONCLUSION This paper proposes an algorithm of complementation mining frequent neighboring class set, which is suitable for mining any frequent neighboring class set according to topdown search and complementation mining strategy. The result of experiment indicates that the algorithm is faster and more efficient than present algorithms when mining frequent neighboring class set in large spatial data A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was fully supported by science and technology research projects of Chongqing Education Commission Project No. KJ091108\nd it was also fully supported by science and technology research projects of Chongqing Three Gorges University \(Project No. 10QN-22, 24 and 30 R EFERENCES 1 M A  R.H P U Y  X  M a X  D   G I S S p at ial A sso ciat io n P a tte r n M i ng   Science Press, 2007 Beijing 2 M A  R.H H E Z  Y   Mi ni ng Co m p l e te and Co r r e c t F r e que nt  Neighboring Class Sets from Spatial Databases.

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
