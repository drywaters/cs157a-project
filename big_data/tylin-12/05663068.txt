Such detection methods for known intrusion patterns and system defects can accurately identify Detection process is simple fast high accuracy and low false positive rate It can be made to reflect different patterns depending on the attack However due to a wide range of means and methods of attack and in the growing technological complexity and misuse detection rely mainly on existing attack pattern database it can not cover all invasive methods and not detect unknown the system attacks Thus it is easy to generate the false negative How to construct a sufficiently general and accurate intrusion methods that can be updated frequently to represent the known intrusion methods how to improve the efficiency of misuse detection it is the misuse detection of the main probl=s facing the current Anomaly detection is also known as behavior-based detection It determines whether there is invasion based on user behavior and the use of system and network resources whether it has deviated from the normal For example it defmes the variables for the r subject resources and object i.e user workstation server file and so on and by observing the historical data establishes the base value for each variable When the system activities using the degree of agreement of variable and the base value to determine abnormal This method has the advantage of versatile widely recognized type of attack It can even detect the system unknown intrusion patterns The disadvantage is that algorithm complexity and high rate of false negative and false positives In addition because the rule base must be constantly updated if the attacker knows a system is under the surveillance of intrusion detection systems their intrusion are recognized by the system if an attacker is on the intrusion detection system for long-term training III DATA MrNING A The Definitions of data mining Data Mining is that extract implicit unknown in advance but potentially useful information and knowledge from extensive incomplete noisy ambiguous random practical application data Simply data mining is to extract or excavate knowledge form extensive data Data mining is an application-oriented technology It combines the multidisciplinary field of knowledge including database technology artificial intelligence machine learning neural networks statistics pattern recognition knowledge base systems knowledge acquisition information retrieval high performance computing data visualization and so on E Data mining process For the data mining process the experts basically reached a consensus summarized as the following five steps First the defmition We define the business area clearly and determine the goal of data mining Second data preparation Data preparation includes the selection of data that extract the target data set from large databases and data warehouse data preprocessing and data reprocessing that check data integrity and data consistency eliminate noise fill the missing fields remove the

data Fourth the fmal analysis We interpret and evaluate the results of data mining convert into the knowledge of the user to understand Fifth the use of knowledge We integrate the knowledge analyzed into the organizational fabric of business information systems N ASSOCIATION RULES A Definitions Association rule induction is one of the most well-known approaches in data mining techniques This technique was initially applied to the so-called market basket analysis which aims at finding regularities in shopping behavior of customers of supermarkets In particular these kinds of rules which are called Boolean association rules try to identify sets of products items that are frequently bought together in a transaction A discovered rule can tell for example people who buy butter and milk will also buy bread Association rule mining is to find the interesting connections between items of a given data set Database T is a collection of n transactions T T 2   Tn and I is the set of all items i i 2    im where each of the transactions TiCl 000 j 000 n in the database T represents a set of items Tj c 1 An item set is defmed as a non-empty subset of 1 An association rule can be represented as X+Y\(c s where Xc;I YCI and X n Y  1  In this association rule s is called support and c is confidence of the association rule The support is the percentage of the transactions in which both X and Y appear in the same transaction and the confidence is the ratio of the number of transactions that contain both X and Y to the number of transactions that contain only X It can be described as follows Support X  Y  P X U Y Confidence X  Y  P y IX B Apriori algorithm Apriori algorithm is an influential frequent itemset algorithm in Boolean association rules It was designed by R Agrawal in 1993 This algorithm proposed follows all non empty subset of frequent itemset must also be frequent If the itemset I does not meet the minimum support I was not frequent If the itemsets J is added to I the itemset IUJ can not be more frequent than 1 So illJ is not frequent This feature is called anti-monotone It means that if a collection is not frequent all of his super-set also can not be frequent The basic Apriori algorithm works in two steps First it finds frequent itemsets for Boolean association rules receiving as input a database T of transactions and the minimum support for the rules In the second step association rules are generated from the frequent itemsets found in the first step Usually the first step is more important because it accounts for the greater part of the processing time It exploits the Apriori property which is based on the simple observation that no superset of an infrequent itemset i.e an itemset not having minimum support can be frequent can have enough support Apriori algorithm uses the iterative method of layer search itemset kfor the exploration itemset k  1  First find out a set 1of the itemsets The set denoted by Ll Ll is used to find the set L2 of frequent set 2 and L2 look for L3 it goes on until the can not find frequent itemset k Each Lk need to find a database scan Such detection methods for known intrusion patterns and

phase the system train and analyze data provided firstly The existing rules of the training data are generalized and summarized and security model is established for the system In the detection phase using a security mode established in the training phase as the standard model the system analyzes the actual testing data and alarms and records the data security models which do not meet the standard The accuracy and security model established the learning stage with security model have direct relationship So the data analysis is the core of the intrusion detection system Here intrusion detection framework is designed based on fuzzy association rules Figure 2 depicts a schematic view of different modules involved cc Figure 2 Intrusion Detection Framework REFERENCES  R Agrawal  T.Imielinski

system train and analyze data provided firstly The existing rules of the training data are generalized and summarized and security model is established for the system In the detection phase using a security mode established in the training phase as the standard model the system analyzes the actual testing data and alarms and records the data security models which do not meet the standard The accuracy and security model established the learning stage with security model have direct relationship So the data analysis is the core of the intrusion detection system Here intrusion detection framework is designed based on fuzzy association rules Figure 2 depicts a schematic view of different modules involved cc Figure 2 Intrusion Detection Framework

only, and concepts with words The corpus of the PubMed abstracts that used in the experim ents is consists of 10000 biomedical abstracts with keyword search breast cancer treatments and side effects   All experim e nts are applied on the 10000 docum ents after divided them into six documentsets 50, 100, 500, 1000 5000, and all 10000 documents. The systems are implemented by using VS .Net 2005 \(C#\a nd the experiments were performed on Intel Core2 Duo, 1.8 GHz system with Windows XP and 2 Giga of RAM A large number of association rules can be extracted by sel ecting the values of minimum support and confidence in the mining process.  The D-EART system gives the best results by using low support and high confidence values Moreover, the number of concepts that entered to the mining process is fewer by using the fuzzy weighting schema. Table V shows the experiments that are applied on various documentsets by different threshol d values. It noticed that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is useful and always less than that in Apriori-concept system The reason returns to the strong effect of using the fuzzy weighting schema in D-EART system Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 show that the execution time of Aprioriconcep t system is increased regular ly when the documentsets are increased compared to D-EART system. The mining process in Apriori-word system takes more time for less number of concepts in the documents. The reason is that the mining process in Apriori algor ithm depends on the size of documents rather than the number of concepts. The results show that the execution time of Apriori-concept system is about seventh fold of D-EART system. The D-EART system scans the documents only one time as the number of documents increased. Therefore the size of documents does not influence in the mining process. Finally, the results reveal that the execution time for D-EART system is much better than that of the Apriori-concept system in all cases  TABLE  V   T HE  N UMBER  OF  A SSOCIATION  R ULES  FOR  A PRIORIC ONCEPT  AND  D EART  S YSTEMS Minimum Support s  Minimum Confidence c  No. of Documents Systems s 1 c 50 3 50 7 60 10 50 500 Apriori-concept D-EART 183 71 76 31 17 5 10 2 1000 Apriori-concept D-EART 227 86 91 34 11 4 8 3 5000 Apriori-concept D-EART 239 92  75 27 20 4 15 2 10000 Apriori-concept D-EART 345 135 102 39 37 10 30 7   D5000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 9 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=5000 D10000 0,00 5,00 10,00 15,00 20,00 25,00 30,00 35,00 40,00 Apriori-concept D-EART Time in minutes s=1, c=50 s=3, c=50 s=7, c=60 s=10, c=50 Fig. 10 Execution time of Apriori-concept and D-EART systems at D=10000 V  C ONCLUSIONS  AND  F UTURE  W ORK This paper presented a new text mining system for extracting ass o ciation rules based on concepts representation from online textual documents. This system overcame some of the problems in the prev ious EART system and the drawbacks of the Apriori algorithm by using the data structure hash table in the mining process. The results of comparing DEART and Apriori-concept syst ems reveal that the number of extracted association rules in D-EART system is always less than that in Apriori-concept system. Moreover, the execution time for D-EART system is mu ch better than that of Aprioriconcept system in all cases. So concept technique would be suitable to apply to any large corpus of medical text such as portions of the web. The future work will apply D-EART on PDF full text document with figures and images instead of using only the abstract part R EFERENCES  Fast algorithms for mining association rules,î In Jorge B Bocca, Matthias Jarke, and Carlo Zaniolo, editors Proc. 20 th Int. conf. of very Large Data Bases, VLDB Santigo, Chile 1994, pp. 487-499  T.

To resolve this problem, we proposed a new KDD model. It consists of two steps: the first organizes the database records in homogeneous clusters having common properties which permit to deduce the dataís semantic. This step consists of TAHís and MTAH generation of relieving attributes. The second permits to Discovering Knowledge. It consists to deduce the Fuzzy  Cluster Lattice corresponding to MTAH lattice generated in the first step, then traverse this lattice to extract the Meta Knowledge \( Set of fuzzy associations meta-rules on the clusters \, and in end deduce the rules modeling the Knowledge \(Set of fuzzy associations rules on the attributes\While basing on the hierarchical structure offered by the lattices, we proceed to discover the Knowledge in a hierarchical way. Thus, according to the degree of detail required by the user, this approach proposes a level of knowledge and different views of this knowledge Moreover, this solution is extensible; the user is able to choose the fuzzy method of classification according to the domain of his data and his needs This solution reduced considerably the number of generated rules, offered a better interpretation of the data and optimized both the space memory and the execution time As futures perspectives of this work, we mention 1\o test our approach on several the large data set, and 2\ to define a new intelligent method of evaluation of requests which takes into account the Meta knowledge and/or the knowledge base generated by our KDD model XI  R EFERENCES  1  P.
