This algorithm generates candidate frequent topological item sets via up search strategy similar to Apriori which is suitable for mining short spatial topological frequent 
item sets with constraint condition. This algorithm compresses storage structure of spatial topo logical relation to create an integer. Via this method, firstl y, the algorithm may efficiently reduce some storage space of mining database. Secondly, the algorithm is effortless to distinguish topological relation of two spatial objects, namely, it may fast compute support of candidate item sets. Finally, the algorithm is fast to connect \(k+1\andidate item sets of k-frequent item set by up search strategy. The result of experiment indicates that the algorithm of mining spatial topology association rules with constraint condition based on Apriori is able to extract spatia l multilayer transverse association rules with constraint condition from spatial database via efficient 
data store, and it is very efficient to extract short frequent topology association rules with constraint condition Keywords-spatial data mining; co nstraint condition; topology association rules; multilayer tran sverse associatio n; up search I   I NTRODUCTION  The research and application of spatial data mining have become more and more important for people. Spatial association rules is one of important part of spatial data mining which mainly extracts these interactions, spatial dependency and spatial symbiosis patterns with spatial objects as in [1   Nowadays, traditional association rules is expanded to spatial data mining, there are mainly three kinds methods of mining 
spatial association rules as in [2 s u ch as l a y e r c o v e re d bas e d  on clustering as in [2 i n i ng app r o a c h ba sed o n s p at i a l  transaction as in [3, 4 an n d m i ni ng a ppr oa c h  b a s e d o n  non-spatial transaction as in [2 Mi ni ng ap pro a c h ba sed  o n  spatial transaction uses spatial overlying and buffer analysis to search spatial predicate of spatial objectives and other objects in spatial database, and extracts Boolean association rules from spatial transaction database formed by these spatial predicate This method is used to mining monolayer transverse association rules and multilayer transverse association rules which is one of wide applied techniques. Spatial topological relation is one of typical and important multilayer spatial 
relation. And so, this paper uses mining approach based on spatial transaction to introduce an algorithm of mining spatial topology association rules with constraint condition based on Apriori, denoted by MSTARCC, which uses spatial topological relation as example to present multilayer spatial association rules mining with constraint condition II  RUDIMENTARY KNOWLEDGE  As we all know this rudimentary knowledge as in [1 rudimentary knowledge of spatial topology association rules with constraint condition is expressed as follows Spatial association rules mainly contain three parts as follows, spatial association among properties of the same 
objects in the same spatial relation pattern, spatial association among different objects in the same spatial relation pattern and spatial association among different objects in the different spatial relation pattern. The first part is known as spatial lengthwise association, the second and third parts are known as spatial transverse association. Association rules expressing as the second spatial relation is known as monolayer transverse spatial association rules. Association rules expressing as the third spatial relation is known as multilayer transverse spatial association rules. According to mining approach based on spatial transaction, this algorithm uses spatial topological relation as example to extract multilayer spatial association 
rules with constraint condition, and so we only thick seven kinds of spatial topology association as table I Definition 1 Spatial Transaction to Binary Digit, a spatial transaction expressing topological relation is denoted by binary digit The course of turning spatial transaction into binary digit is expressed as follows Step1, we define target object class and non-target object class, target object class is denoted by O t There are m nontarget objects classes, which are denoted by i k  k 1\205 m  Step2, we use 3 non-zero binary digits to denote a kind of 
topological relation that expresses sole spatial topological relation between target object and non-target object Step3, the number of bit is 3 times the number of classes in non-target objects of spatial transaction database This work was fully supported by science and technology research projects of Chongqing Education Commission \(Project No. KJ061101 and KJ091108\, and it was also fully supported by science and technology research projects of Chongqing Three Gorges University \(Project No. 10QN22, 24 and 30 978-1-4244-7941-2/10/$26.00 \2512010 IEEE 


Step4, spatial topological relation is denoted by binary digit as following table I TABLE I  SPATIAL TOPOLOGICAL RELATION  No Topological relation Spatial Predicate Binary Digit 1 disjoint disjoint O t  i k 001 2 2 touch touch O t  i k 010 2  3 overlap overlap O t  i k 011 2  4 cover cover O t  i k 100 2  5 contain contain O t  i k 101 2  6 covered covered O t  i k 110 2  7 inside inside O t  i k 111 2  Here, we let \(000 2 express this spatial relation that there are no non-target objects in buffer of target objects Example, item sets of spatial non-target objects class is expressed as I  i 1  i 2  i 3  i 4  i 5 we also define the order of binary digit according to the order of item sets Suppose here is an entity of target object class denoted by O t  O t is inside of an entity of non-target object class as i 2  spatial predicate is denoted by inside O t  i 2 namely, binary digit is expressed as \(111 2  O t touches an entity of non-target object class as i 3 spatial predicate is denoted by touch O t  i 3  namely, binary digit is expressed as \(010 2  O t contains an entity of non-target object class as i 4 spatial predicate is denoted by contain O t  i 4 ely, binary digit is expressed as 101 2   All the entities of two non-target objects class as i 1 and i 5 are not in the buffer of the entity of target object class as O t  The spatial topological relation may be expressed as Fig. 1, we also may use \(000, 111, 010, 101, 000 2 express the spatial topological relation  Figure 1  The spatial topological relation Definition 2 Topological Relation Bit, it is a binary digit with 3 bit, which expresses a kind of topological relation between two entities of target object class and non-target object class Example, if a spatial transaction is denoted as a binary digit 000, 111, 010, 101, 000 2 we think \(111 2 010 2 and \(101 2  as Topological Relation Bit Definition 3 Spatial Transaction to Integer, a spatial transaction expressing spatial topological relation is denoted by an integer Example, if a spatial transaction is denoted by this binary digit \(000, 111, 010, 101, 000 2 we will use this integer 3752 to express this spatial transaction Definition 4 Spatial Transaction Length, which is denoted as STL Its value equals the number of non-target objects class in buffer of entity of target object class. Namely, it also equals the number of spatial topological relation between two entities of target object class and non-target object class Example, the spatial transaction as Fig.1 is expressed as inside O t  i 2 touch O t  i 3 contain O t  i 4 which is expressed as binary digit p 000, 111, 010, 101, 000 2 its length equals to 3, namely STL  p  Definition 5 Transaction Relation to Integer Relation, a spatial transaction ST 1 is expressed as integer I 1 another ST 2 is expressed as integer I 2 if ST 1 002 ST 2 and we will define I 1 002 I 2  Example, item sets of non-target spatial object class is expressed as I  i 1  i 2  i 3  i 4  i 5 Let ST 1 be {inside O t  i 2  touch O t  i 3 contain O t  i 4 denoted by 3752, let ST 2 be inside O t  i 2 contain O t  i 4 denoted by 3624. Obviously ST 2 003 ST 1 and then we record 3624 003 3752 Definition 6 Constraint Condition, denoted by CC it is made of some non-target objects classes given by user, and it is also pure subset of spatial non-target objects class sets Example, item sets of non-target spatial object class is expressed as I  i 1  i 2  i 3  i 4  i 5  CC  003 I such as i 2  i 5  Property  1 There are two binary digits p and q with m  Topological Relation Bits p is used to express a spatial transaction ST p  q is used to express a spatial transaction ST q  The necessary and sufficient condition for ST p 002 ST q is p  001  q   p and STL  q 001  p  STL  q  STL  p  Proving of sufficient condition is expressed as follows We use TRB i express value of No i Topological Relation Bit in a binary digit Suppose TRB i 004 0 i  j 1  j 2  j k  k  m in this binary digit p  and others are 0. In these Topological Relation Bits, we let No b s  s 1, 2 t  t  000 3 m binary bit be 1, and others are 0. For p  001  q  p and so in these Topological Relation Bits of q these No b s s =1, 2Öt, t 000 3 m nary bits are all equal to 1 otherwise p  001  q  004  p and others are 0 or 1 And for STL  q 001  p  STL  q  STL  p and so TRB i  004 0  i  j 1  j 2  j k  k  m in this binary digit q are all equal to the same Topological Relation Bit in this binary digit p otherwise STL  q 001  p  004  STL  q  STL  p and others are 0 or 1. As definition 1 and 5, we know ST p  002  ST q  Proving of necessary condition is expressed as follows Suppose TRB i 004 0 i  j 1  j 2  j k  k  m in this binary digit p  and others are 0. In these Topological Relation Bits, we let No b s  s 1, 2 t  t  000 3 m binary bit be 1, and others are 0. For ST p 002 ST q according to definition 1 and 5, and so TRB i  004 0 i   j 1  j 2  j k  k  m in this binary digit q are all equal to the same Topological Relation Bit in this binary digit p otherwise, here is No j k spatial topological relation, it belongs to ST p but it doesnít belong to ST q this contradicts with ST p 002 ST q and so in these Topological Relation Bits of binary digit q these No b s   s 1, 2 t  t  000 3 m ary bits are all 1, and others are 0. And so the rest of binary bits in binary digit q are 0 or 1. Hence p  001  q  p and STL  q 001  p  STL  q  STL  p  


Deduction 1 There are two binary digits p and q If p is turned into integer I p  q is turned into integer I q and p  001  q  p  and I p  000  I q  Deduction 2 Let integer I p express a spatial transaction ST p  and let integer I q express a spatial transaction ST q If I q  000  I p and ST p 005 ST q  Property  2 Let binary digit p express spatial transaction ST p and let binary digit q express spatial transaction ST q And p  001  q  p and STL  q 001  p  STL  q  STL  p  If ST q is a frequent item set, and ST p is also a frequent item set If ST p is not a frequent item set, and ST q is not also a frequent item set III  MINING SPATIAL TOPOLOGY ASSOCIATION RULES W ITH CONSTRAINT CONDIOTION  A  Forming Transaction Database In order to form mining database of spatial topology association rules, from original spatial database, we need make each spatial transaction turn into an integer. The course of turning used by the algorithm is expressed as follows Firstly, we define target object class O and non-target object class i k  k 1 m and then define the order of nontarget object class as I  i 1  i 2  i m  Secondly, each non-target objects class I k existing in spatial transaction has an order denoted by N k If there is a kind of spatial topological relation as table I between entities of target object class and non-target object class I k obviously, according to definition 1 and 2 this spatial topological relation is able to be denoted by some Topological Relation Bit as table I Thirdly, then we will put this Topological Relation Bit into No k location Finally, we will gain a binary digit with 3 m bit, and then turn the binary digit into integer According to this way, the algorithm will gain an integer by scanning each spatial transaction, and mining database is formed of these integers Now we save these integers by this data structure expressed as follows Structure spatial transaction Int Digit; // saving integer expressed as spatial transaction Int Count; // saving the sum of same integer expressed as spatial transaction} ST Example, here is three entities of target objects class as O 1  O 2 and O 3 and non-target object class I  i 1  i 2  i 3  i 4  i 5  No.1 spatial transaction ST 1 is expressed as {overlap   O 1  i 2  contain O 1  i 3 covered O 1  i 4 we use binary digit p 000 011, 101, 110, 000 2 to express this spatial transaction, namely this integer 1904 may express ST 1  ST 1 D i gi t  19 04  ST   C o u n t  1 No.2 spatial transaction ST 2 is expressed as {overlap   O 2  i 3  inside O 2  i 4 we use binary digit p 000, 000, 011, 111 000 2 to express this spatial transaction, namely, this integer 31 may express ST 2  ST 2 Di gi t  31  ST 2 C o unt  1  No.3 spatial transaction ST 3 is expressed as {overlap   O 3  i 2  contain O 3  i 3 covered O 3  i 4 we use binary digit p 000 011, 101, 110, 000 2 to express this spatial transaction, namely this integer 1904 may express ST 3 As this information has been saved, we only add 1 to Count ST 1 D i gi t  19 04  ST   C o u n t  2  B  Generating frequent topological item sets with constraint condition The course of generating frequent topological item sets with constraint condition is similar to Apriori, namely according to up search strategy, the algorithm uses three stages to generate frequent topological item sets with constraint condition, which is expressed as follows Firstly, the algorithm computes all these 1-topological item sets, and gains all the 1-frequent topological item sets Secondly, the algorithm connects 1-frequent topological item sets to generate these entire 2-candidate frequent topological item sets Finally, the algorithm computes k 1\candidate frequent topological item sets with constraint condition k 1\, and generates all these k 1\frequent topological item sets with constraint condition by iteration connecting C  The method of computing support According to the principle of property 1 we know that the method of computing support includes two steps as follows Let an integer I q express a spatial transaction ST q let another I p express a candidate frequent item sets CST p with constraint condition Step1, the algorithm computes this expression I p  001  I q if I p  001  I q  004  I p we will know that CST p 005 ST q namely, the spatial transaction ST q does not support candidate frequent item sets CST p and stop computing support. If I p  001  I q  I p then going to step2 Step2, if STL  I q 001  I p  STL  I q  STL  I p and CST p 003 ST q  And so we will know that the spatial transaction ST q supports candidate frequent item sets CST p Otherwise, the spatial transaction ST q does not support candidate frequent item sets CST p  D  The process of mining topology association rules with constraint condition According to the up search strategy similar to Apriori, the process of mining topology rules with constraint condition is expressed as follows 


Step1, the algorithm computes all these 1-topological item sets, and gains all the 1-frequent topological item sets Step2, the algorithm connects 1-frequent topological item sets to generate these entire 2-candidate frequent topological item sets Step3, the algorithm computes k 1\candidate frequent topological item sets with constraint condition, and generates all these k 1\-frequent topological item sets k 1\ by iteration connecting Step4, the algorithm outputs all frequent topological item sets with constraint condition Step5, according to confidence given by user, the algorithm computes all topology association rules with constraint condition IV  T HE A NALYSIS AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULT OF ALGORITHM  Nowadays, there are very little documents of research spatial topology association rules with constraint condition Here we only present the capability and experimental result of the algorithm A  The Analysis of Capability The algorithm is suitable for mining short frequent topological item sets with constraint condition because it adopts up search strategy to generate candidate frequent topological item sets with constraint condition. The algorithm realizes fast mining spatial multilayer transverse association rules with constraint condition from spatial database because it compresses a kind of spatial topological relation to create an integer, namely, it adopts an efficient data store of spatial topological relation compressing B  The experimental result of the algorithm Now we use experiment to prove above analyses. The mining algorithms \(MSTARCC\ is used to generate frequent topological item sets with constraint condition from 71650 spatial transactions, which are denoted by integer from 1 to 4095, the constraint condition is expressed as CC 1  5, which expresses {contain O 002 D the another is expressed as CC 2   10, which expresses {disjoint O 002 C  002 touch O 002 D  O is target object class C is the third non-target object class, and D  is the fourth non-target object class. The number of spatial nontarget object class is denoted by m 4 These spatial transactions observe the discipline which is expressed as follows Spatial transaction denoted by 4095 has five instances Spatial transaction denoted by 4094 has thirty instances Spatial transaction denoted by 4093 has five instances Spatial transaction denoted by 4092 has thirty instances  The runtime of the algorithms is expressed as Fig.2 as support changes for CC 5 and CC 10 Our experimental circumstances are expressed as follows Intel\(R\ Celeron\(R\ M CPU 420 002 1.60 GHz, 1GB, language of the procedure is Visual C# 2005.NET, OS is Windows XP Professional 0000\0006\0007\000$\0005\000&\000 000\023 000\025\000\023\000\023\000\023 000\027\000\023\000\023\000\023 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023 000\033\000\023\000\023\000\023 000\024\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\023 000\024\000\025\000\023\000\023\000\023 000\023\000\021\000\027\000\024\000\034 000\023\000\021\000\025\000\032\000\034 000\023\000\021\000\024\000\027\000\023 000\023\000\021\000\023\000\032\000\023 000\023\000\021\000\023\000\025\000\033 000\023\000\021\000\023\000\024\000\027 000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023\000\032 000\023\000\021\000\023\000\023\000\027 0006\000X 000S\000S 000R\000U\000W\000\013\000\010\000\014 0005\000X\000Q\000W\000L\000P\000H\000\013\0000\000L\000O\000O\000L\000V\000H\000F\000R\000Q\000G\000\014 000&\000&\000 \000\030 000&\000&\000 \000\024\000\023  Figure 2  The runtime of the algorithms for CC 5 and CC 10 V  C ONCLUSION  This paper introduces an algorithm of mining spatial topology association rules with constraint condition based on Apriori, which uses spatial topological relation as example to present multilayer spatial association rules mining with constraint condition A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was fully supported by science and technology research projects of Chongqing Education Commission Project No. KJ061101 and KJ091108\nd it was also fully supported by science and technology research projects of Chongqing Three Gorges University \(Project No. 10QN-22, 24 and 30 R EFERENCES  1  MA, R.H., PU, Y.X., Ma, X.D.: GIS Spatial Association Pattern Ming Science Press, 2007 Beijing.\(in Chinese 2  ZHANG X.W., SU, F.Z., SHI, Y.S., ZHANG, D.D.: Research on Progress of Spatial Association Rule Mining.

Figure 3 Precision-recall curve in ROI-250 image dataset 5.3 Experiment 3 Mammograms-1080 image dataset This experiment employed a dataset composed by 1080 mammograms images collected in the Clinical Hospital of University of Sao Paulo at Ribeiro Preto The dataset was previously classi\002ed into 4 levels of breast tissue density 0501\051 mostly fatty 050362 images\051 0502\051 partly fatty 050446 images\051 0503\051 partly dense 050200 images\051 and 0504\051 mostly dense 05072 images\051 Figure 4 Precision-recall curve in Mammography-1080 image dataset Breast density is an important risk factor in the development of breast cancer In this experiment the images are represented by the feature set proposed in b uilding a vector of 85 features including shape and size of the breast the conditions of the breast contour nipple position and the distribution of 002broglandular tissue This dataset was divided in training set and test set The training set is composed of 720 images and test set is composed of 360 images Figure 4 shows the P&R curves over test dataset and also the number of features selected in each method Again the proposed methods reached the highest values of precision and select the smallest number of features 050a\051 050b\051 050c\051 050d\051 Figure 5 Queries in Mammography dataset 050a\051 226 is the query image 050b\051 using the features selected through 002tness function F cB  050c\051 using the features selected through classi\002cation error of C4.5 and 050d\051 using the all features extracted Results for the retrieval of the 5 most similar images from a query image are also provided in this experiment as illustrated in Figure 5 The image 5.\050a\051 is the query image taken from the mostly fatty image class Images shown in 5.\050b\051 are the 5 most similar images retrieved for the proposed 002tness function F cB  The row 050c\051 shows the results for C 4  5 classi\002er whereas 050d\051 illustrate the images resulting from all features 050no selection applied\051 In Figure 5 the images surrounded by dashed lines are false positives 050not relevant images\051 For this query the proposed method achieved the highest precision 050100%\051 when compared the results of C4.5 and the original feature vector 050precision of 40%\051 


6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
