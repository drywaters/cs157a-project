227A critical problem to P2P VoD systems is to provide ef\036cient user interactivity support In this paper we study intraand inter-video operations separately and aim to reduce the latency of these VoD operations by exploiting the locality of reference in user access patterns With a relaxed de\036nition of data chunk holder intra-video locality can facilitate a high likelihood of a peer seeking within a video to 036nd a holder of the requested

data among its neighbors Tapping on this property an aggressive cached publish scheme is designed to build shortcut over the DHT network so as to reduce the lookup delay Inter-video locality is exploited via learning association rules from the collective viewing history A fast association rule learning algorithm is proposed to infer the relations between videos in a distributed manner based on partial knowledge Both search and content prefetch are incorporated to achieve low inter-video jump delay with minimal overhead Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed schemes can reduce the lookup delay for seeking within a video and provide an ef\036cient prediction-based prefetch scheme for inter-video access 
I I NTRODUCTION Video streaming services have been very popular and the 
growth of video traf\336c over Internet is still accelerating Video-on-Demand VoD is one of such kind of services where videos are streamed to end users with provisioning for user interactivity Due to its large amount of data and real time requirement providing VoD service with client/server technique is extremely costly For example In March 2008 YouTube\325s bandwidth costs were estimated at approximately US$1 million a day Recently  Peer to-Peer P2P mechansim has been recognized as a promising cost effective technique for internet-scale VoD systems As opposed to P2P live streaming systems where only sequential access is allowed P2P VoD systems support user interactivity We have identi\336ed two kinds of user interactivity 
seeking within a video and jumping to a different video Seek allows users to change their viewing positions when the current part is not of interest Frequent seek behavior has been observed by PPLive J ump occurs when users ha v e 336nished or gave up the current video Usually for long movies jump operation is not as frequent as seek operation but it would also be very common when videos are short clips or TV dramas User interactivity support imposes a stringent requirement on P2P VoD systems in terms of delay Many solutions have been proposed to improve the streaming continuity after user intervention Generally such solutions can be classi\336ed into two categories The 336rst is to construct an additional structured overlay to help peers to locate video content over the P2P 
network ef\336ciently 5 Although structured o v erlay seems to be appealing the performance may degrade signi\336cantly in dynamic environment For example a study of the Bittorrent systems sho ws that a DHT lookup may e xperience a delay of over 1 minute VMesh b uilds pre vious/current/ne xt segment lists on top of DHT to accelerate the lookup which can be very helpful when the segment size is large and a seek usually only skips less than 2 segments However large segment size will reduce the data sharing among peers and is not 337exible for data scheduling The second category of solutions is to enable non-sequential prefetch 8 Theoretically prefetching schemes can reduce seek delay to zero if a prefetch hits Nevertheless the risk of prefetching is

partial holder complete holder 
as it only stores a part of a data chunk The intra-video locality of reference is that when a peer seeks within a video there is a high probability that a holder of the requested data either or 
relatively high due to the large volume of video data Lastly the solutions discussed above are only designed to reduce seek delay jump delay is not considered by existing studies In this paper we propose two schemes to reduce seek and jump delay separately by exploring the locality of reference of user access patterns We 336rst introduce the concept of partial holder partial 
is different from a 
 exists among the peers\325 neighbors We then design a 
cached publish 
scheme to build shortcut via the holders in the neighbors so that the seek delay can be reduced Furthermore in order to reduce the jump delay we utilize association rules learning to discover the locality of reference in inter-video access patterns Association rules can help to predict the videos that are likely to be watched next so that we can search or download in advance Although association rules learning has been used by VOVO our method is different in the following aspects 1 we use association rule learning for inter-video prediction while in VOVO it is for intra-video prediction 2 we propose a fast association rule learning which can discover relations with partial knowledge 
3 our method combines both search and data prefetch which strikes a balance on the trade-off between cost and bene\336t This paper 336rst describes the basic setup of our schemes in Section II Section III and IV present the locality of reference for both intra and inter-video access and the proposed algorithms to reduce seek and jump delay Section V demonstrates the performance results We conclude our paper in Section VI This full text paper was peer reviewed at the direction of IEEE Communic\ations Society subject matter experts for publication in the IEEE Globec\om 2010 proceedings

denoted by II B ASIC SETUP OF THE P2P V O D SYSTEM We implement a P2P VoD system in NS2 for per formance evaluation DHT is used for content location in the system However applying the proposed methods to other distributed content location P2P VoD systems is quite straightforward The Kademlia protocol is implemented to construct a DHT network The original Kademlia design is slightly modi\336ed to provide lookup service in P2P VoD system The protocol mainly consists of three operations FIND  0 1 003 As aforementioned when a peer starts to download a chunk it will retrieve the blocks in the chunk During downloading the blocks cannot be shared with other peers until the whole chunk is 336nished Given a peer with download bandwidth of 1Mbps it takes 0.125 seconds to download a block and 16 seconds to 336nish an entire chunk which means that after the 336rst block in a chunk is downloaded the peer has to wait at least for as follows If the seek duration is exponentially distributed and the seek distance follows a Pareto distribution there exists an integer 16 125  15 875 1 1 thewatch probability of NODE to locate the closest nodes to a key PUBLISH to insert an entry to the DHT network and FIND  peers whose IDs are the closest to the hash of that chunk Videos are broken into blocks for transmission However DHT does not provide block level lookup service since meta data at this granularity will incur a high overhead traf\336c Instead a set of continuous blocks are grouped into a chunk In our simulation a block is of size 16 Kbytes and a chunk consists of 128 pieces as per the setting used in PPLive If a peer stores a chunk it invokes PUBLISH periodically to insert an entry to the DHT network so that other peers can locate the chunk by FIND  seconds to notify the DHT network This is obviously a waste of resource More importantly requiring a full copy of a chunk to share also weakens the relations among peers that is the locality of reference which we will discuss in the rest part of this section For this reason we 336rst give a relaxed de\336nition of chunk holder as follows The locality of reference presented in Theorem 1 can be proven by theoretical analysis To understand the locality of reference in P2P VoD we 336rst analyze user behavior when viewing a video In a P2P VoD system with seek operation support a user may seek forward or backward during viewing For simpli\336cation we only consider seek forward here A peer watches a video and seeks forward when the content is boring The viewing continues till the end of the video The lengths of the watched and skipped parts are denoted by seek duration and seek distance respectively We let denote the blocks in the video where is the total number of blocks and each block is of equal length A chunk consists of  Here we study the watch probability WP of each block The watch probability is the probability that a block is visited by a peer during a viewing process Then we have the following proposition blocks then each block is accessed by users with equal probability denoted by  Here we do not consider data replacement due to limited local cache and neither do we consider a system with proactive caching in which a peer may fetch some data only for replication instead of for viewing In P2P VoD system a peer usually connects to a set of neighbor peers to exchange data availability information and retrieve data We further identify a subset of neighbor peers as Clearly a peer watching a video has at least one by using different values of is small enough the probability of 336nding the requested block among its neighbors is nearly one when a peer seeks within a video This seems to be good news as once the block is located on the neighbors it can be downloaded without invoking additional search schemes However only ensuring is not practical for HOLDERS to 336nd the peers that stores a data chunk An entry indicates which peers hold a speci\336c chunk and is stored on can be achieved for any value of If peer blocks thus there are The proof of Proposition 1 is omitted here due to page limit Proposition 1 shows that if we ignore the 336rst  The 336rst few blocks usually have higher value of as users often start from the beginning This also conforms to the results observed by PPLive Ob viously  a peer has to download a block before watching it Therefore if a peer has watched  from which it downloaded the previously watched data The following lemma derived from Proposition 1 describes the probability of 336nding holders of chunks and blocks among bene\336cial neighbors

routing table and shortcut routing In Fig 1\(a a lookup is resolved in three hops The initiator contacts 3 intermediate nodes iteratively and the lookup delay is 6 times end-to-end delay When a shortcut is discovered as shown in Fig 1\(b the number of intermediate nodes is 2 and lookup delay is reduced to 3 times end-to-end delay In addition note that the 336rst hop over the shortcut is between the initiator and its neighbor and this path has already been connected for data transmission it is less likely to fail than contacting a normal peer in the routing table Lastly according to Theorem 1 the probability of 336nding a shortcut is very high Hence cached publish can reduce the lookup delay to a constant and improve the reliability in most cases Apparently aggressive publish may incur additional delay as peers have to ask for buffer map from partial holders This impression however is false Partial holders are only tried when downloading from complete holders have failed In traditional design where aggressive publish is not applied the user will experience a service disruption Aggressive publish actually increases the chance that a request would be ful\336lled In addition downloading data from partial holders is usually not slower than from complete holders The requests for buffer map from partial holders are sent at the same time when trying the complete holders thus the interaction delay is eliminated IV S UPPORTING JUMPS AMONG VIDEOS In this section we discover the locality of reference in inter-video access patterns by association rule learning A

3 When a peer wants to download a block it 336rst gets a bunch of chunk holders via DHT If there are complete holders available a request is sent to one of them Meanwhile it connects to some partial holders and asks for buffer map of the requested chunk If retrieving data from complete holders has failed send request to a partial holder who currently has the block Aggressive publish not only improves the data availability in the DHT network but also increases the spatial locality of reference as discussed in Section III-A We therefore provide a 006 1 i t X Y  h n m  I set The locality of reference is highly dependent on De\336nition 1 Unfortunately existing DHT networks do not support partial holders In order to take advantage of the locality of reference we propose an aggressive publish scheme for partial holder indexing Each holder either partial or complete will insert an entry to the DHT network In other words when a peer starts to request a chunk a PUBLISH message will be sent once a block in the chunk is 336nished A peer that wants to download a block can get a set of holders including both complete and partial holders through the DHT network It 336rst tries to request data blocks from complete holders If it fails a gossip protocol is employed to locate blocks on partial holders and then the requested data is downloaded By using aggressive publish any downloaded blocks can be located and shared with other peers The implementation of aggressive publish is elaborated as follows 1 When a peer receives a block of a new chunk it sends a PUBLISH message with a 337ag  set  we can see that even for a video with c Y 002 1 and and constraint is introduced to specify the would be very large to achieve is a common case in P2P VoD systems for small set to

information to holds a chunk  When a lookup request for chunk  where each contains a subset of items in  which increases the maintenance overhead linearly secondly with only one available source for a block is not 337exible for transmission algorithm design A good transmission algorithm may need several source candidates to choose so as to improve the aggregate throughput Nevertheless with the de\336nition of partial holder we can conclude P2P VoD systems 336rstly for a cold video that is a video with low is nearly 1 This proves the locality of reference stated in Theorem 1 In the next section we will show how locality of reference helps to build shortcut and reduce the DHT search delay nodes which are responsible for that Thus if peer In data mining association rule learning is a

more records which can be learnt from the DHT network The requested peer will scan through its and return the records containing is always set to records Second as the videos in a record are kept in

record records are collected the denoting the current video and to compute the con\336dence Only the rules with con\336dence de\336nitions the is the jump con\336dence The relations between videos indicate the spatial locality of reference in inter-video access patterns Consider a space consisting of all videos and the distance between two videos has played videos  the subrecord  Traditionally a server is deployed to collect all records and compute the rules However the collecting and learning tasks are both bandwidth and CPU intensive considering a P2P network with millions of users Y He et al designed a gossip protocol to g ather intra-video watching history but for inter-video records the number of records is so large that it would incur huge amount of traf\336c to transmit them via gossip information exchange In addition it is also impossible for a peer to store all the records locally and mine rules out of such a large database To solve this problem we propose a fast association rule learning algorithm according to the following facts Firstly we only need to predict the next video so for a rule  let  Algorithm 1 shows the pseudo code of statistical signi\336cance of a rule There are two  Usually the latter is used as it represents the statistical signi\336cance of a rule over the whole database Here we consider the jump behaviors in VoD When a peer jumps to a different video the locality of reference described in Theorem 1 is not applicable as no bene\336cial neighbors connected If we are able to predict 323the next video\323 in advance then the holder information and even the content data can be prefetched to reduce the waiting time before watching a video Although the videos watched by different users vary a lot it is obvious that the viewing sequence of a user is not a pure random process but user interest dependent For example a user who is watching 323Transformers\323 may probably watch 323Transformers The Revenge of the Fallen\323 or the 323Terminator\323 series Such relations between videos can be represented as association rules If after  if a video is played by a user then it is likely that the user will play the nearby videos in the near future This locality of reference implies that it is possible to design ef\336cient prefetch algorithm if the relations can be discovered  To further simplify the problem we assume the inter-video jumping pattern is a Markov process hence is only interested in those records which also contain  Thus it is unnecessary to exchange all records among peers Thirdly the computation of records must be collected to produce rules for a video As there is no centralized server records must be stored by peers Each peer employs a to cache its own record and other peers\325 records collected recently Therefore for a video  that is their own watch history Moreover probably they may store more records as they also want to discover or have already discovered the association rules of and wants to 336nd the association rules it 336rst asks bene\336cial neighbors to request records If the records from bene\336cial neighbors cannot satisfy the support threshold then it will contact other holders of have little connection to will be extracted Other items are abandoned to save bandwidth As soon as more than storing the collected records Here for a speci\336c

users will jump from one to another in the near future With the locality of reference a prefetch scheme will de\336nitely help to reduce the jump delay However even the users with similar interest may have a wide range of videos to choose so it is impossible to predict which video will be the next with high probability in most cases For this reason prefetching content for every predicted video is not feasible which may waste a large amount of bandwidth To reduce the jump delay with acceptable overhead we combine two kinds of prefetch content prefetch and search prefetch Given a rule mine   in

reference in user access patterns in P2P VoD systems and aim to provide better user interactivity support The main contribution of this paper is i with a relaxed de\336nition of chunk holder we discover that it is likely for a peer seeking within a video to 336nd a holder of the requested chunk among its neighbors An aggressive cached publish scheme is proposed by utilizing this property to reduce the lookup delay ii we propose a fast association rule learning algorithm to infer the locality of reference in intervideo access pattern With the association rules search and content prefech are incorporated to reduce inter-video jump delay with minimal overhead Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed schemes can reduce the lookup delay for seeking within a video and provide an ef\336cient predictionbased prefetch scheme for inter-video access R EFERENCES  322Cisco visual netw orking inde x F orecast and methodology  2008-2013 323

   for overlooking the overall software development process and playing a crucial role in making important decisions  5.1.3. The Criterion Set As stated earlier, criterion is the attribute for which favorability of an alternativ e is calculated. The criterion set defined for this case study comprises of Reusability  Meeting Operational Requirements and Meeting Project Deadline By reusability, we mean, the amount of reuse of different functionalities that ca n be achieved from the previously developed system on Mine detection training tool. Meeting operational requirements implies how effectively a desired operational capability can be satisfied by an alternative. For example, some alternative might lack a certain operational capability like database support whereas another may support it with enhanced features. Meeting project deadline stresses on the fact whether the project requirements can be satisfactorily achieved within the stipulated deadline which in our case was around one year  5.1.4. The Alternatives To resolve the concerned issu e, the stakeholders decided to choose one software platfor m for developing the mine detection training tool among the three stated alternatives Adobe Director  Adobe Flash  Open GL were chosen as the three possible alternatives along with some justifications. Adobe Flash was chosen as one of the alternatives because; the stakeholders already had a previous developed system for mine detection developed using Adobe Flash    Figure 6. Mine Detection System Along With Three Alternatives One of the considerations involved here was to enhance this system rather than develop a new system from scratch. Same reason applied to choosing Adobe Director as one of the other alternatives. Open GL was picked up as one of the three alternatives in the case when a new development had to be started Open GL is an advanced software development platform and it could have served as a good platform for the mine detection training system  Figure 6 summarizes the pro ject and its three alternatives positions available  5.2. Prioritizing The Criteria  For an effective decision making, we had to weigh the criteria according to their im portance in the decision making process. For this, we choose Analytic Hierarchy process because of its effectiveness in performing pair wise comparison of elements .Table 2 shows the ranking table used for comparing the two criteria  Table 2. Criteria Comp arison Table For AHP  Value a ij  Comparison Description 1 Criteria i and j are of equal importance 3 Criteria i is weakly more important than j 5 Criteria i is strongly more important than j 7 Criteria i is very strongly more important than j 9 Criteria i is absolutely more important than j   Table 3. Comparison Values For Prioritizing Different Criteria   Reusability Meeting Operational Requirements Meeting project Deadline Reusability 1 1/5 3 Meeting Operational Requirements 5  1  7 Meeting Project Deadline  1/3 1/7  1   149 


   Table 4. Normalized Criteria Comparison Table In AHP   Reusability Meeting Operational Requirements Meeting project Deadline Reusability 0.157 0.148 0.272 Meeting Operational Requirements 0.789 0.744 0.636 Meeting Project Deadline 0.052 0.106 0.090  Table 3 and Table 4 show the weight values of the three criterions as compared to each other using the AHP process. These weights have been decided by the stakeholders after discussions among themselves Average weights can be derived from Table 4 as follows Reusability- 0.193 Meeting Operational Requirements- 0.724 Meeting Project Deadline- 0.083 These weights represent the priority of each criterion on a scale of 0 to 1  5.3. Argumentation Tree  We develop argumentation tree for each and every alternative separately. The ar guments are stated by stake holders and assembled under the alternative but they target a specific cr iterion. These arguments can either be supporting or attacking each other or their respective alternative nodes. We present three figures, where each figure represents the argumentation hierarchy for one alternative. Rectangular boxes represent the alternatives with the name of the alternative under it. Ovals represent the criteria with their descr iption. The arguments are specified by labels èAê, èBê, èCê for alternative çAdobe flashé, çAdobe Directoré and çOpen GLé respectively Along with the labels, the arguments also have indexes associated with them. Beneath the labels are two boxes The box on left shows the weight of the argument whereas the box on right shows the priority of the stakeholder who specifies the argument  Once the argument has been sp ecified, the user enters its weight. We first reassess the weights of the arguments using priority reassessment discussed in h e n us ing the techniques specified in [11 w e red u ce t h e arg u m e n t s  to a single level. Finally, the weighted summation of the arguments with the criteria weights helps us evaluate the final weights for the decision matrix. It is important to note here that, the aggregation method used for calculating the favorability is a weighted summation  The three argumentation hierarchies for the three alternatives are presented in the Figures 7, 8, and 9. The diagrams contain arguments, their weights and the stakeholderês priorities     Figure 7. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Flash   Figure 8. Argumentation Tree For Adobe Director 150 


     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
