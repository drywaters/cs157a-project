Associative Prediction Model and Clustering for Product Forecast Data Ruhaizan Ismail, Zalinda Othman and Azuraliza Abu Bakar Centre for Artificial Intelligence Technology Faculty of Information Science and Technology Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor Malaysia ruhaizanismail@yahoo.com, {zalinda & aab}@ftsm.ukm.my Abstract Association rules are adopted to discover the interesting relationship and knowledge in a large dataset Knowledge may appear in terms of a frequent pattern discovered in a large number of production data. This knowledge can improve or solve production problems to achieve low cost production. To obtain knowledge and quality information, data mining can be applied to the manufacturing industry. In this study, we used one of the association rule approach, i.e. Apriori algorithm to build an associative prediction model for product forecast data. Also, we adopt the simplest method in clustering, k-means algorithm to attain the link between patterns. The real industrial product forecast data for one year duration is used in the experiment. This data consists of 42 products with two important attributes, i.e. time in the week and required quantity. Since the data mining processes need a large amount of data, we simulated these data by using the Monte Carlo technique to obtain another 15 years of simulated forecast data.  There are two main experiments for the association rules mining and clustering. As a result, we obtain an associative prediction model and clustering for the forecasting data. The extracted model provides the prediction knowledge about the range of production in a certain period Keywords-associative; association rules; prediction clustering; manufacturing I I NTRODUCTION Currently, the data in manufacturing industry is really huge and consists of various stages. However, because of the insufficient information many problems especially in the operation management could not be solved efficiently Company needs reliable knowledge to make the right decision particularly in forecasting or planning a system. It is necessary for a company to get an accurate demand forecasting for it to produce the required quantity at the right time. One way to get useful information is by using the data mining approach. Data mining is an analytic process designed to explore data in search for consistent pattern and relationshi T y picall y  data m i n i ng techn iqu e s are already used in business, medical and various domains In production operation, there are some important decisions to make during the early planning stage such as the production planning, customer demands and selection of an appropriate manufacturing process t h e  manufacturing domain, data mining can be used to provide information for preventive maintenance, machine failure prediction or quality cont This research employed an association rule that can identify interesting relationship, knowledge and frequent pattern. The discovered knowledge or frequent pattern can improve or assist in solving production problems in order to achieve low cost production. On the other hand, the decision quality can be improved to encourage a positive impact to the company. In order to obtain good knowledge and predict the outcomes, we proposed an associative prediction model After that, we applied the clustering techniques to group the similarity and dissimilarity of the relationship and pattern This paper is organized as follows: Section II is about the related work and previous research of associative prediction model, clustering and manufacturing productivity. In Section III, we present the methodology that comprises of the step of data collection and how we conduct the pre-processing, experiments and in section IV, the results. In that section, results obtained from the two techniques will be compared and discussed. Meanwhile the Section V discloses the conclusions II R ELATED W ORK Traditionally, the statistical techniques are used in order to discover the patterns in manufacturing data such as linear quadratic and logistic discriminate analyses e v e r these statistical techniques face a problem when dealing with massive data from a huge database or multiple databases. According h ere are t w o m a in w eakn e s s e s  of the local methods when dealing with the huge data. First it is difficult to scale the high dimension data and second is the lack of interpretability of the model data. Therefore, data mining techniques can help to improve and solve the problems especially in the manufacturing domain. This is due to the fact that the manufacturing data consists of large records and many attributes Associative prediction is a combination of two data mining function that are the association rules and prediction 6 sso ciatio n ru le m i n i n g ARM s ed to id en tify an y  interesting relationships between a set of items in a database especially for market basket analysis R M ca n al s o  be defined as the discovery of association rules showing the attribute-value conditions that occur frequently together in a given set of data [10  In A R M, A p rio ri alg o rith m is k n o wn  1459 978-1-4244-8136-1/10/$26.00 c  2010 IEEE 


to be the standard algorithm to the mine association rules and it has been chosen for this study. The Apriori algorithm uses prior knowledge to generate frequent patterns from the dataset containing transactions 8], th ere are a few works done using the association rules in the manufacturing domain. They focused on the product design manufacturing process and decision support. The association rule mining is used in past sales and product records to discover the associations among the customer needs, marketing employees and designers [9   P r od uc tio n data can be categorized as a time series data because the sequences of values change with time. Association rules can discover the temporal relationships that are hidden in these data [20  In this study, the proposed model is built using the association rules to associate attribute values in order to generate predictions or to estimate the expected outcomes Meanwhile, the prediction is a technique to predict a future model of continuous-valued function. In predictive techniques, some examples of the predictive data mining are bagging, boosting, stacking and meta-learning. Usually prediction techniques are used for numerical and continuous data. There are models generated from prediction techniques that are linear, nonlinear and generalized linear model of regression  However to obtain good results, data mining should provide multiple and/or integrated functionalities and techniques s e of th at w e prop os ed an as s o ciativ e prediction model for product forecast data. In this research we used the Apriori algorithm. Apriori is a technique for mining frequent itemsets for the Boolean association rules  T h e alg orithm i s s u itable f o r th e m i n i ng  m a nuf actu ri ng data due to the continuous change of the customers demands. Apriori algorithms can be used to provide sufficient critical information and improve the manufacturing productivity  The third technique that we also applied is clustering Clustering is a method used to group similar items and dissimilar items in clusters. It can also be used in certain fields in manufacturing to group a set of items into classes of similar objects. Generally, clustering is an unsupervised learning 8], th ere are already a f e w pas t re s earch es  about clustering in manufacturing. It is a review based on the application area in manufacturing like yield manufacturing process, design, defect detection, fault diagnosis and supply chain. In clustering techniques, there are five categories that can be classified; partitioning methods, hierarchical methods, density-based methods grid-based methods and model-based methods In this study, we are applying the k-means method to attain the link between the frequent patterns obtained from the previous associative model. The k-means algorithm is one of the simplest clustering techniques in partitioning categories. This algorithm aims to partition n objects into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. Mean also represents the clusters centre of gravity h e k m eans al g o rithm can  h a n d le a mixture of categorical and numerical attributes. This algorithm does a distance computation by normalizing the numerical attributes. It uses the Euclidean distance measure to compute distances between the instances and clusters The method is relatively scalable and efficient in processing large data sets. Thus, we are able to obtain the relevant link between patterns in the associative prediction model Usually, it is computed using a fast, heuristic method that generally produces good solutions  III M ETHODOLOGY A Data Collection and Pre-processing There are four stages in data pre-processing phase; data cleaning, data integration, data transformation and data reduction T h e data is clean ed in s u ch a w a y t h at the missing values are handled and the noises are smoothened in order to obtain a more consistent dataset for mining. Data integration merges data from multiple sources of data Several attributes are transformed to categorical values and reduced to limit categories to ensure the efficiency of the mining process. Data reduction is the main challenge in preprocessing because it needs to reduce the data size. It involves aggregating the data to identify several attributes to be removed and eliminate the redundant features The data were collected from a plastic component manufacturer in Malaysia. The data consists of 42 product parts which is represented by 42 files. After various considerations, two important attributes were taken into account in predicting the pattern for this forecast data. The attributes were A1; days and A2; required quantity. Each file contains 362 records that represent the required quantity in days. After that, the records are reduced to 49 that represent the required quantity in weeks. All 42 files were combined to produce one large dataset. This step is necessary in order to get the forecast pattern of one year for all components Because the data mining needs a huge data to produce a more accurate pattern we have to simulate the data of 15 years. In this study the Monte-Carlo simulation approach have been used to simulate the 15 years forecast data. The Monte-Carlo approach is based on the generation of multiple trials to determine the expected value of a random variable. This method using the RAND\(\ction to generate random numbers in interval \(0, 1\d multiply these by the range of each variable. The range is the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value [12, 13 q u a tio n 1  a s b een u s ed in th i s si m u lat io n  for generating the required quantity in weeks. The simulation produced 735 records for each product \(i.e. 49 records in 15 years Random values = RAND \(\*\(max … min\ + min 1 1460 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 


In data transformation process, the market basket analysis is applied to the dataset. The value of attribute A2 was converted into range and combined with other parts of the product to produce p1r0  p1r1 and etc. We transform the data into a range in order to get the dependencies that will give the information on the frequency of the required quantity T h e p1r1 notation can be defined as product 1 product latch noise eliminator\d r1 is range 1 that is within the required quantity of 500 … 1499. Attribute A1 only exists between attribute week1 until week49. The data were mined to get the rules We conducted two main experiments that are the ARM and Clustering. In ARM, there are two experiments using the Apriori algorithms. First, we used four datasets because of the limitations of the association approach. It is because there is a great possibility to find many spurious associations when involving a massive number of possible associations in large dataset [18, 19 T h is is al so d o n e t o  select the important attributes in the 49 attributes. Then the second experiment was conducted by using the best attributes obtained from the first experiment. It is shown in Table II. In clustering, we conducted the second stage of experiment by applying the k-means method IV R ESULT A ARM In ARM, two measurable parameters are used to measure the importance of a rule; confidence measure and support measur  T h e m i n i m u m co n f iden ce m i n _conf   minimum support \(min_supp\predetermined to control the quality and the amount of generated rule In the first experiment, the first dataset consisted data from the attribute week01 to week10. This dataset was measured by using min_supp of 0.25 and min_conf of 0.9 0.8, 0.7 and 0.60 respectively. A thousand association rules were generated from that experiment. The second dataset was formed from the attribute week11 to week20, the third dataset from the attribute week21 to week35 and the fourth dataset contained the attribute of week36 to week49 The best model from each datasets were chosen and compared to each other. The rightmost column is the number of rules generated after applying different min_supp and min_conf From the result in Table I, it shown that the generated number of rules was constant at the confidence value of 0.6 because the number of rules does not increase even when min_conf was changed to 0.5 to 0.1. Therefore at the first dataset, we get 1000 association rules and after that 4 rules, 10 rules and lastly 8 rules. So overall, we get 1022 association rules with the min_conf value at 0.60 TABLE I R ESULT F IRST E XPERIMENTS Attributes Apriori Number of Rules  min_supp min_conf week010.25 0.90 1000 week10 0.25 0.80 1000 0.25 0.70 1000 0.25 0.60 1000 week11week20 0.10 0.90 0 0.10 0.80 2 0.10 0.70 2 0.10 0.60 4 week21week35 0.10 0.90 0 0.10 0.80 3 0.10 0.70 10 0.10 0.60 10 week36week49 0.10 0.90 1 0.10 0.80 2 0.10 0.70 2 0.10 0.60 8 From the four datasets, we get 14 important attributes and 1022 association rules. The attributes shall be applied in the second experiment that also uses the Apriori algorithm Table II shows the number of rules generated for the values of min_conf from 0.9 to 0.1. Based on these results, the same observation can be conducted, as at the confidence value of 0.6 the generated number of rules has stopped increasing. The results shown in Table II involved all attributes from week01 to week49 These results were obtained after we used the generated rules from the earlier four datasets. Table II also shows that the decreasing min_conf does not improve the number of rules generated. We evaluated the rules and chose the rules that have min_conf value higher from 0.6. In addition, the value of min_supp was set to 0.1 only. This is because if we use another value of min_supp no rules will be generated TABLE II.

The first rule was represented in week33 that is within the period of 06 th September to 12 th September product 4 \(retaining ring\ have been produced in the range of r1 0 - 21999\d frequently associated with week19 in 31 st May to 06 th June\ and in the same production range of product 4 \(retaining ring r1 i.e. 0 … 21999\ever, the 13th rule showed otherwise that week19 is associated with week33 but with an unequal min_conf i.e. 0.70 B Clustering Based on the result obtained from the associative modelling as shown in Table II, we used k-means method for the second experiments. We used 6 for the number of clusters and 10 for value of seed with 30 association rules from Table II. The seed value is used for generating a random number. This number will be used in making the initial assignment of instances to clusters. In general, the kmeans is quite sensitive on how clusters are initially assigned. Thus, it is often necessary to try different values and evaluate the results. We used 6 as the number of cluster because it depends on the choice of distance measures with only 14 attributes involved After the experiment was completed, the results show that there were overlapping clusters with the same attributes Table IV shows all the attributes involved in the six clusters C is represented to cluster and it started with 0 until 5, i.e C0, C1, C2, C3, C4 and C5. Object in each cluster, such as w14:p4r4 was represented in week 14, product 4 and range production 4. In six clusters, we can see that there are same objects in different clusters. For example, in C1, C2 and C5 there are w21:p3r2 and w34:p3r1 Other than that, we can also conclude for each cluster that possesses the same characteristics in the objects Criteria in C0 has only object related with product 4 retaining ring, C3 related with product 2; insulator AB, C4 related with product 1; latch noise eliminator. Then, C1, C2 and C5 are related with only product 3; housing C Knowledge Analysis Fig. 1 denotes the comparison between the association and the clustering that occurred in 14 important attributes out of 49 attributes\hese are the 30 final rules obtained from Table 3. From the result, the knowledge obtained is the frequent products discovered to be p3 and p4 \(i.e. housing and retaining ring\sing component frequently appeared in two ranges, r2 that represents the required quantity within 0 to 999, and r3, the required quantity range of 1000 to 1999. Meanwhile, retaining the ring frequently occurred in three ranges \(i.e. r1, r2 and r4\ These ranges represent values between 0 to 21999, 22000 to 41999 and 62000 to 81999 There are relationships between the particular association rules as some rules imply to others \(Witten and Frank 2005\in the 14 discovered attributes, all attributes have association with each other.

If week33 is associated with week19, the product retaining ring produced is in the range of 21999, it has min_conf of 1.0 and for another association rule; if week19 is associated with week33 \(with product retaining ring with the same range\it only has min_conf 0.7 Attribute week33 is also associated with week34 and week21. In this dataset, at least one attribute is associated with another attribute once and the most association that may possessed by one attribute is four associations 1462 2010 10th International Conference on Inte lligent Systems Design and Applications 


From Table IV, we attempt to relate the links between the association rules in Table III. From two tables, we gain knowledge that is displayed in Fig. 1. From that figure, it showed only four clusters. This is because in the 30 association rules, association only occurred in C0, C1, C2 and C5. In C3 and C4, association does not happen between the objects Figure 1 Association and clustering between attributes V C ONCLUSIONS In manufacturing the environments, numerous factors contribute to the productivity. These factors such as the personnel, machine capacity or material are conditionally dependent on one another. Due to this, the data mining techniques can be applied on manufacturing data to assist the manufacturer in getting an interesting and valuable knowledge. In this paper, we used the Apriori algorithm to obtain association rules and predict when the most frequent production occurs in the plastic company. Also, we use the k-means algorithm to uncover the link between the observed frequent patterns. From the experiments, we obtained the association prediction model and found two most produced products, i.e. housing and retaining ring. Also, week 19 and week 33 are the frequent weeks  so it can be concluded that the production is massive in week 19 and week 33 Further analysis can be done using other techniques in association rules or clustering. Data in manufacturing possess the characteristics of imbalance and fluctuate. This will be an interesting challenge to the data mining researchers to obtain interesting and valuable information This study can also be viewed from other angle to solve another issue that might be raised in the plastic industry such as the cycle time production, capacity, maintenance or quality control R EFERENCES 1 Hi ll T   L e w i c k i P   20 10 I n t r odu ct i o n  t o  d a t a m i ni n g    STATISTICA Data Mining. http://www.statsoft.com/textbook/datamining-techniques/ [06 June 2  2  Rav iw o n g s e  R  A l l a da V   S a nd idg e J r  T   20 0 0  P l as t i c  Manufacturing Process Selection Methodology Using SelfOrganising Map \(SOM\/Fuzzy Analysis Int.

with the Alignment and NQueens benchmarks Results are similar with both versions Although a deeper analysis will be needed the results suggest two main hypothesis 017 The Intel Compiler does not implement thread switching and thus untied tasks cannot bene\002t from this feature which should avoid imbalances This is particularly evident in the Alignment benchmark which has been reported to scale 017 Task scheduling constraints do not seem to impact signi\002cantly the performance results at most there is a 4 difference between the versions The other applications show a similar behavior D Other opportunities for analysis The Intel Compiler does not implement mechanisms that allow the user choose among different task scheduling policies but other OpenMP compilers e 16 that have such capabilities One interesting study is to 002nd how task scheduling policies and how they can mantain locality across tasks can affect the performance results of the benchmarks of the suite In previous sections we have discussed how implementing a cut-off mechanism can affect application performance but we have not discussed due to space limitations how the different cut-off values i.e at which point in the recursion we cut relate with the creation of parallelism and the overall performance Choosing a low cut-off value can restrict parallelism opportunities but choosing a high cut-off value can saturate the system with a large amount of tasks which have no thread available to execute them The right choice depends many times of the input data set Comparing the application behaviour using different cut-off values or testing runtime features which allow to modify dynamically the cut-off can also be interesting analyses The quality of implementations for different task generation schemes e.g in the SparseLU benchmark which can use a single or multiple generator scheme taskwait constructs or other task related implementation details could also be analyzed with our benchmark suite proposal V C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE WORK We have presented BOTS  Barcelona OpenMP Task Suite  built with the double motivation of coping with the great characteristics of the multicore processors and offer a set of benchmarks to evaluate OpenMP tasking We think that BOTS will help implementors and programmers to have a better understanding of the OpenMP tasking model and its performance implications Each of these benchmarks comes also with different versions to test different aspects of the tasking model For example they can be used to evaluate task scheduling alternatives tiedness   Also a number of input sets are provided so that benchmarks can be used as tests or really stress the processors and memory system in your machine It is interesting to note that we have tried to select benchmarks with diverse characteristics In this paper we have highlighted the differences and we have shown their evaluation on an SGI Altix machine with up to 32 processors and we report some of their characteristics per task e.g operations memory writes    Their evaluation also shows that there is plenty of work to do at all levels  architecture compiler runtime system programming model to improve certain benchmarks given that their current scalability is very limited This suite can be used to obtain useful data of the strenghts and weaknesses of an OpenMP implementation that can help developers to improve it Currently we are working to add new benchmarks to the suite to cover more problem domains and scenarios We are as well planning to do a full cross-vendor evaluation to 002nd which is the current state of the OpenMP tasking implementations A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation contracts no TIN2007-60625 and CSD2007-00050 the European Commission in the context of the SARC project contract no 27648 the HiPEAC Network of Excellence contract no IST-004408 the IBM CAS Program and the Mare Incognito project under the BSC-IBM collaboration agreement R EFERENCES  O ARB OpenMP Applicati on Program Interf ace v  3.0  May 2008  J M Bull Measuring Synchronizati on and Scheduling Ov er heads in OpenMP in First European Workshop on OpenMP  September 1999  LLNL OpenMP Performance Suite Description 2001 A v ailable https://computation.llnl.gov/casc/RTS Report/openmp perf.html  A Dorta C Rodriguez F  de Sande and A Gonzalez The OpenMP Source Code Repository Euromicro Conference on Parallel Distributed and Network-Based Processing  vol 0 pp 244–250 2005  C Bienia S K umar  J P  Singh and K Li The P ARSEC Benchmark Suite Characterization and Architectural Implications in Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Parallel Architectures and Compilation Techniques  2008 pp 72–81  H Jin M Frumkin and J Y an The OpenMP Implementation of NAS Parallel Benchmarks and Its Performance NASA Ames Research Center Technical Report NAS-99-011 1999 A v ailable citeseer.ist.psu.edu/408248.html
