  Recommendation Strategies Analysis in E-commerce Wengxing Wang Economics and Management College, Zhongyuan University of Technology Zhengzhou, Henan, China Wwx222@126.com   Abstract 227 With the development of personalized recommendation research, it has become increasingly important that how to select proper technology to set up recommendation system. In this paper, a few familiar personalized recommendation technologies are introduced briefly at first, while their characters are also analyzed Then, corresponding strategies are put forward according to 
characteristics of products and guests. Structures of personalized recommendation system are suggested and their work principles are analyzed  Keywords-E-commerce, Recommendation strategy Collaborative filtering,  Association rule I   I NTRODUCTION  The advantage of E-commerce recommendation system is that it can automatically analyze user\222s materials so as to find guest purchase trend and give suggests accordingly. Internet surfers can get information and purchase suggestions when they visit E-commerce Website. Their purchase decisions are 
made with the help of the recommendation system attached Website. So personalized recommendation system in an Ecommerce website simulates a salesman in the business process. A well worked personalized recommendation system enables business website three advantages 
200  Turn a website visitor to a purchaser 200  Improve e-business website cross-selling ability 200  Improve user\222s loyalty of an e-business website Recently, researchers have down a great deal studies in personalized recommendation field. There are lots of scientific research results. In a certain condition, this recommendation 
algorithm may get ideal recommendations. However, so fast the development of internet based e-business and so complicated of recommendation system as to the available recommendation algorithm has its inaccuracy, delay, etc Therefore, to analyze various recommendation algorithm has great significance to set up an e-commerce recommendation system II   FAMILIAR  E-COMMERCE  RECOMMENDATION  ALGORITHMS Generally speaking, personalized recommendation has three stages. They are data gathering, data analyzing and forming recommendation result. Among which, the date 
analyzing is key stage to find knowled  A  User Bbehavior Based Product Recommendation Algorithm The custom\222s purchase behavior can be evaluated by whether their demands are met. When they are doing shopping actually, they are going through a cognition process. While they evaluate all characters of available products they know these products and thereby make decision of purchase Customs may gather widely information of all kinds of products at beginning to know them generally. Gradually, the range they focus is shrunk, they will move their attention to the products in which they are interested. Therefore, we can learn 
custom\222s demands according to their online behaviors We can get product recommendation algorithm under two assumptions as below[2   
200  Custom only clicks those items in which they have interesting, so as to learn further information about those products 200  Custom stay at a page for a long time means he or she pay more attention on products in this page User behavior based product recommendation method obtains custom\222s information through analyzing their online behaviors without additional custom inputs. With this method 
the custom\222s information can be update in time. On the other hand, because system need dynamically track every custom record their behaviors and analyze them, it will consume a great deal of computer resource B  Recommendation Based on Association Rules Association rules is a statistical result which indicates how many customs bought product X and therefore bought product Y. This algorithm recommends products to customer by the rule and what he or she has bought. Association rule data mining technique can find products\222 relativity. So it is used well in retail trade C 
 Collaborative filter recommendation algorithm Collaborative filter recommendation algorithm built a model according to user\222s information, such as registration data, product marks, and purchased items  Us in g th e m odel   the system gives recommendations to custom. There are two kinds of this algorithm 
200  User-based Collaborative filter recommendation algorithm 978-1-4244- 7618-3 /10/$26.00 \2512010 IEEE 


  It gives recommended list by custom purchase records. It works under an assumption, that is, if two customs have same purchase recorders they will also select same product. It finds some aim custom\222s neighbor first. Then, the aim customer will give scores to the unmarked product referring to his or her neighbor\222s doing. The recommendation results are at the top of the mark list 200  Item-based Collaborative filter recommendation algorithm It is based on similar items scores for the user to predict the scores of aim item. It is also based on an assumption: If the majority of users are quite similar to the scores of some items then, user at present, will give the same scores to the item Items-based Collaborative filtering recommendation system uses statistical techniques to find certain items nearest neighbors. Because the present user and his nearest neighbors tend to give same scores to target item, therefore, the item scores predicted by current user can be get from his close neighbors. The algorithm choices a number of high scores as recommendation result to feedback to the user Collaborative filtering algorithm recommendation is currently get studied in depth, and it is also get widely used as we  How e v e r i t  als o f a ces m a ny ch allen g e s  Th ey ar e  200  Product scores data is extreme sparsity. With the development of e-commerce, the number of users and product items increase rapidly, therefore resulting in extremely sparse score data. In the circumstances of extreme sparse score data, the quality of the recommendation will be significantly decreased sometimes may have not any results 200  Automation recommendation. At present, most of the collaborative filtering system asks users input requirements at first. Users must explicitly provide product scores. This may bring accuracy recommendation, but also causing inconvenience to users III  CHOOSE  STRATEGY  BASED  ON  CUSTOMER  CHARACTERISTICS The purpose of personalized products recommendation is to meet the individual needs. Then personalized recommendation system design and strategies should highlight the needs of the customers. Different customer Characteristics should use different strategy and recommendation system. Customers can be divided into familiar Customer and unfamiliar customers by the amount of his information A  Strategy to Unfamiliar Customers Such customer includes all non-registered customers, and registered but inactive customers. Some of these clients might be potential customer. At beginning of his or her visiting, if system provides a consistent recommendation, these potential customers are likely permanent consumers. As system does not have these customer\222s history information, it is necessary collect such customers\222 online information and make recommendations User behavior based product recommendation algorithm is applicable to such customer. System should catch those information include visiting path, sequential pattern and viewing time. Pay attention to exclude circuity time. The too short visits tend to reflect customer have no interest on the content, it could be excluded from the click-stream. Then classify the pattern sequence to identify the types of customer want products. The key of this system is to optimize algorithm to enhance system real-time ability B  Strategy to Familiar Customers Familiar customers frequently visit website, they are loyal customers of the e-commerce website and the main serve objects of recommendation system. As such customer\222s information can easily get, so the collaborative filtering based recommendation algorithm is fit for using here On the One hand, based on product attributes model system recommends products by customer\222s purchase history recorders, on the other hand, based on relations between products, system recommend products which has close relations for customers. Association rule algorithm can reveal the intrinsic relationship between the products. Some of them are ignored by people or difficult to find. Therefore the recommended result is creative. As a matter of fact, not only is it a recommendation, but often can help clients choose complementary products, such as clothes match User-based collaborative filtering algorithms and itembased collaborative filtering algorithm cooperate with each other and complement each other. Thus, the recommendation can avoid duplication and singleness IV  CHOOSE STRATEGY BASED ON PRODUCT  CHARACTERISTICS Different types of products should be recommended by different systems. According to being purchased frequency products can be classified frequently purchased products and less frequently-purchased purchased products A  Frequently Purchased Products Being quickly consumed products, such as food, daily necessities and cosmetics frequently purchased products, such as books, CD, VCD, clothes, etc. are belong to this kind. To form recommendation of these products, the system analyzes the customer's personal information, their previous record of online shopping and browsing records to infer his personal parameters. The core of such kind of recommended system is to learn parameter which represents customer purchase trend and to make proper adjusts because of customer interest changes In the information-gathering phase, users may be given a form in which they can clearly indicate their interest. This is the most efficient method to obtain new customer\222s parameters Modularization system construction is suitable used to process these products. Each module independently carries out their respective mandates first, then recommend products in cooperation Fig u r e 1 is  th e s y s t e m  arch it ectu re  


  In figure 1, Information Module and Monitoring Module are charged of collecting customer information. Information module submits a form enables users to show his interest Monitoring module records what product pages, contents customers have browsed and classifies them in the background Information Management module is the core of the whole system. It establishes and keeps maintaining personal profile for each customer. A personal profile consists of two parts: a personal forecasting model and a group of product items which attaches figures indicate the extent of custom prefer. System pre-defines some modules which can represent the most characteristic types of products, and keep analyzing these modules. When customer changes the parameters, client profile will be adjusted Learning module establishes prediction model on the basis of its client profile. Those products can reflect custom character included in personal profile will be treated as eigenvector. Through training eigenvector, classifier can be established. Classification result is different degrees of preference on product parameters. Learning module always work passively, when new client register or custom parameters changes cause to system quality decline, it can be activated by information management module at any time Performance module begins to work from customer entering the system. It decides whether or not to recommend a product to the corresponding customer through analyzing customer model. Performance module charge of tracking recommendations, and send feedback information to the Information Management module. Performance module will notice information management module to build a new forecasting model, when system quality decline to a certain extend B  Less Frequently-Purchased Purchased Products Products such as appliances, durable goods, etc., they are not purchased frequently. So infer customers parameters will be very difficult because of lacking of history recording information. There little correlation between purchases Moreover, the requirements are different for each purchase. So deducing the former parameters is not necessary any more. In such case, customers often have no corresponding knowledge to evaluate such a product, so expert\222s recommendation become extremely important. Recommendation system must have a special knowledge in the field and can interact with customers at real time Such a recommendation system is not built on the model of analyzing past clients, but access and analyze customer\222s demand at the time so as to help him find a most suitable product. Of course, customers need to simply identify the product he needs first, describe the specific product characteristics or functions he wants. Comparing the description and products available to find the similarities recommendation system selects products closing to his wants Then, customer may revise his selects. Recommendation system will make out new recommendations based on the adjustment. This process may be repeated several times Finally, customers will be gradually found his really wants Helping with such system, customer can quickly approach to information he want. The system will enable customers chose products in their unfamiliar field or make their fuzzy demand became clear  Fi gur e 2 sho w s t he sy st e m  architecture of this recommendation[10  Interactive module is responsible for collecting customer's chose. Since most customers do not have sufficient knowledge of related fields to answer professional question or give quantitative description, interactive modules are usually give qualitative questions to their customer. For example, instead of asking custom how many pixel value of monitor he want interactive modules will ask customers how about the clarity extent he prefer, which can be divided into five grades. The next step, interactive module passes his collects, customer\222s qualitative demands to analysis module Analysis module searches database to find proper products to meet the want according to the requirement. The key of this part lies in the similarity calculation. It is often get by calculate character value with a power. Here, the power is defined in advance by experts and customers The expert module has two main functions, the one is translating quantitative characteristics of the products into qualitative features in advance, the other is correcting product items generated by analysis module. Because customer may give mutual contradictions requirements, in this case, it may cause system unable to work or poor performance without taking manual intervention Personal Profile Learning Module Information Managemen t  Module Performanc e Module Monito r ing Module Interface Information Module Customer Figure1.

  V  CONCLUSIONS  Personalized Product Recommendation System plays an important role in e-commerce. However, the current system still has many deficiencies. Many factors constrain its development, such as rapid increase amount of product, client and trade. All these elements may cause data sparse scalability, real-time and accuracy problems. Other factors may also affect recommendation strategy. For instance, customers may have different product requirements when he shops for himself and select gifts for his friend R EFERENCES  1  Z.

58 


Figure 3 displays an example of a zoom over a strong coupling between several forms of the system and its main form B  Data Validation In order to build more confidence on what was being mined, a sample of the generated rules was validated by the programmers. They used the visual representation of the rules and confirmed the consistency of the main associations presented by the dependency networks  The number of original transaction records gathered throughout eight years of operation of the version control system, was 256,804. However, after a careful data analysis, we identified that of the 256,804 original records 153,288 accounted for marks on the files \(labels\nd 69,592 were directory changes. In the end, only 33,924 changes in 4.096 files were taken into account V  R ESULTS  As seen in tables 2 and 3, our results reached averages higher than the averages presented in Zimmerman et al [5   These results suggest that association rules obtained in our industrial environment are better than those obtained in the published OSS domains. In addition, low standard deviation shown in Table 5 indicates that the values do not spread too much around the averages. Our next step was to test this evidence using inferential statistics A  Analysis and interpretation The analysis started by calculating the harmonic mean for the data presented in Zimmerman et al for eight OSS projects [5  T h is d ata is s h o w n in T a bl e 2   T h ey s e rv e as  a baseline of comparison for the results we obtained in the industrial environment, shown in Table 3 For the statistical testing, we established an apriority significance level 001 0.05. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test ensured that the sample was normally distributed. As seen in Table 4, we found p-values of 0.996 and 0.982 for the Navigation and Error Prevention F-measure 000  respectively.  As the p-value is the lowest possible significance with which it is possible to reject the null hypothesis, and they are larger than 0.05, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the data is normally distributed TABLE II  R ESULTS FOR COARSE GRANULARITY IN 9 AND ITS FMEASURE R=R ECALL   P    P RECISION  Suppor t Confidence Project R 000 P 000 F 000 measure R 000 P 000 F 000 measure ECLIPSE 0.17 0.26 0.21 0.03 0.48 0.06 GCC 0.44 0.42 0.43 0.29 0.82 0.43 GIMP 0.27 0.26 0.26 0.08 0.74 0.14 JBOSS 0.25 0.37 0.30 0.05 0.44 0.09 JEDIT 0.25 0.22 0.23 0.01 0.44 0.02 KOFFICE 0.24 0.26 0.25 0.04 0.61 0.08 POSTGRES 0.23 0.24 0.23 0.05 0.59 0.09 PYNTHON 0.24 0.36 0.29 0.03 0.67 0.06 Average 0.26 0.30 0.28 0.07 0.60 0.12 Navigation Prevention 0.1 0.9 13  In order to assure that we could use the T-test for independent samples, we had to test the equality of variances for the independent samples.

We have not test for those variables   The projects that we analyzed were stable and had a few number of transactions per day \(Table 1\ Less stable or more dynamic projects may yield different results   Like in t h e  or der i ng o f  cha nge s m a y i n fl ue nc e  the results for Navigation and Error Prevention VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK  This article shows that software module modification association rules derived from our stable industrial environment were more effective than those derived from the OSS projects reported in the literature. As association rules are already being successfully applied for impact analysis in this context [5  o u r  resu l t s i n d i c a tes th at th ey c a n  als o  b e  effectively applied in industrial environments such as the one we studied  We believe that this finding may stimulate further studies in the industry and, hopefully, motivate them to invest on association mining to support software maintenance and evolution activities  It is important to observe that in our analysis systems with little evolutive maintenance, such as the Marketing and the Customer Management System, yield rules with precision and recall better than the average. This was expected as more stable systems should yield better association rules Also, independent of the number of transaction per day systems with small training sets, such as the Accounting and the Web Services Systems, yield rules with precision and recall worse than the average. This was also expected, as this number training examples helps to strengthen the rules As mentioned before, we adapted the software engineering experimental process described in Wohlin et al  o so ft w a r e  r e po si t o r i e s m i ni ng e x p e r i m e nt s. We be l i e v e that the studies, applications, and tools for software repository mining can benefit from this type of approach Rigorous experimental description facilitates replication of studies and the executing of systematic reviews and other types of secondary analysis in the field [18  C o n s id e r in g th e  number of studies being done in the area, we believe that experimental formalism combined with approaches like standardization of data exchange formats among software repositories [1  can  con t ri b u t e t o f a cili tat e th e ex ecu t i o n  and replication of studies in the area As future work, we will start to look at fine granularity associations, analyzing classes and methods as opposed to files. We will also analyze relationships between coupling and the associations mined from version control systems We are currently finishing a Microsoft Visual Studio plug-in to use the mined rules to aid programmers on the fly It will work as a monitor that verifies saved files and warns programmers about unverified associated files. This will facilitate the programmers’ impact analysis effort and mitigate errors during program modification. After its completion, the plug-in will be experimentally evaluated in carefully controlled case studies. Lastly, we will use our Data Warehouse [6 o t e st s e ve ra l  o t her so ft w a r e m i ni ng  techniques over the data we have already gathered and preprocessed A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This study could only be developed due to the full support of CIAL–Brazil and its staff.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
