I I NTRODUCTION While medications in western medicine often strive to avoid drug interaction, Traditional Chinese Medicine \(TCM works in the opposite way by exploiting the useful interaction among multiple herbs in a formula \(prescription The efficacy of a TCM medication comes from the interaction of these herbs. Although there are standard formulae, a practitioner will only pick a subset of formulae as templates and personalize them for the patients. Since a doctor can add or remove or replace herbs in the template\(s the preparation of a prescription is a science as well as an art As a result, it is not an easy task to determine the true interacting herbs that contribute to the efficacy of a treatment. Association rule mining \(ARM\ is a potential candidate to find the co-occurrence of items \(which will be herbs in our case\er this method suffers from two aspects. This algorithm requires the definition of thresholds e.g support count\ prior to execution. The results are sensitive to these thresholds \(as parameters\. A different set of parameter values will give a very different result. Also there is no scientific way to determine the correct threshold value; it is largely a trial-and-error exercise. A threshold with high value will severely reduce the number of results produced, whereas a small threshold will offer too many answers to be useful. Another issue is that ARM is not goaloriented. There is no proof or support that co-occurrence of herbs indicate their interaction, hence, it cannot help a person with a specific question The aim of this work is to propose complementarity as a surrogate of herbs interaction. A new algorithm is introduced to discover all the possible sets of interacting herbs, and it does not rely on any threshold value \(parameter-free Related work will be described in Section 2, while Section 3 gives an overview of our proposal method. An insomnia dataset will be described in Section 4. Experimental results will be presented in Section 5. Section 6 is the discussion Conclusion and future work can be found in Section 7 II R ELATED W ORK Association rule mining is considered to be the cornerstone of data mining research. The objective of this Abstract 227 The efficacy of a TCM medication derives from the herb-herb interaction in a formula. Although there are standard formulae, a practitioner will only pick a subset of formulas as templates and personalize them for the patients. It is not easy to determine the true interacting herbs to contribute to the effectiveness of a treat ment. Association rule mining is an approach to find the co-occurrence of some items, however it is not goal-oriented, and the generated results are very sensitive to the given parameters, i.e. support count. The aim of this paper is to introduce a new framework to systematically generate a set of combinations of interacting herbs that leads to good outcome. This algorithm was tested with a dataset of treatment of insomnia to understand the effectiveness of combination of herbs.

In a more general way, when a vector of numbers in k-dimension, a function of f: Rk x technique is to find dependencies between different variables called items\ in a large database. Unlike a standard statistical approach to test for correlation between variables association rule mining casts the problem as a search for dependencies \(called association rules\. Support and confidence are two measurements to guide the search process. The earlier research in association rule mining has focused on algorithms for discovery d m o re r ece n t ly on  pruning [2   However, it is also well known that the standard measures of support and confidence are not objective enough for generating rules \(need to rewrite\mprove objectivity, one approach is based on some interestingness measures to guide the selection process. Several other statistical measures of interestingness have been proposed  pro vid ed an e xt e nsi v e anal y sis of  t h e p r o p er ties of the different measures. Other approaches have also been proposed to determine the interestingness of a set of frequent itemsets using background knowledge in the form of prior beliefs of the user  Ther e ar e s ev er al ad v ant a g es o f  u s i n g  interestingness measures. One advantage is to allow users to compare rules objectively. Another one is the provision of statistical significance, e.g. Brin [1 su gg es t ed u s i n g a Ch i  Squared statistic that takes advantage of the upward closure property. Essentially this means the statistic is strictly increasing with the itemset size and the number of variables  oin t o u t th eir ap pr oa ch has t h e f la w th a t th is is n o t  true with increasing item set size as the degrees of freedom are not constant One other way to address the interaction is to create a network [1 f r o m  t h e prescr ip t io n s  a nd select i m p or t a n t  herbs for further analysis. The authors applied MDR to the reduced feature set to find the nonlinear relationship among the herbs and to generate the sets of herbs that are useful III C OMPLEMENTARITY S UPERMODULAR F UNCTION Many existing works consider interaction as additive interaction, while we want to pursue interaction that is more than additive. If we are using two variables as an example then our aim is to identify those factors have the property of f \(a 001 001 002 003 004 003 002 y where \(x y\he component-wise minimum of x and y. In other words, the heuristic is to measure the marginal gain over the baseline and the separate effect due to each individual variable. Figure 1 is the pseudo code which incrementally finds all the interactionsets, i.e. sets of interacting variables. Each interactionsets must meet two conditions: the necessary and sufficient conditions  It will not be possible to calculate the supermodular value of a pattern \(herbs\if the dataset does not contain all the possible combinations of the pattern. The existence of all the permutations is the necessary condition which is related to lines 11-15 in the algorithm \(Figure 1\. Once the necessary condition is satisfied, a pattern can go through the sufficient condition testing by calculating its supermodular value \(lines 16-22\ pattern is considered complementary or interacting\ when a positive value is derived IV D ATASET Insomnia is a \223nightmare\224 to many people. It refers to the poor quality of sleep or insufficient sleep duration, it can lead to adverse daytime consequences. Studies have shown that rates of insomnia with associated daytime dysfunction in attendees of general medical practices range from 10% to as high as 34% [13  T h er ef or e, inso m n ia is a pop u la r important and vital disorder that needs to be addressed We have selected and labeled 460 insomnia outpatient encounters from a TCM hospital in Beijing. The outcome of each encounter was annotated by TCM clinical experts who went through the changes of the insomnia-related variables over consecutive visits; these include the sleep time per day sleep quality and difficulty in falling asleep. The outcomes are then classified into two categories: good and bad. When a treatment was effective, which means that if the patient recovered completely or partly from insomnia in the next R is said to be supermodular if f \(x f \(a\ f \(b where a b b indicates the interaction effect of two factors The concept of complementarities is a surrogate for interaction. It offers a useful perspective to study the complex relationships between inter-related variables. This concept was first introduced by Edgeworth in which he defined factors as complements if doing \(more of\ one of them increases the returns to doing \(more of\ the others. The notion of complementarity requires only that some ordering of the objects under consideration is in place. This observation has led to the actual formalization of the concept in the mathematical theory of lattices, which is the basis for the development of monotone optimization problems pioneered by Donald Topkis By d r aw in g o n l at t ic e theory and supermodularity, Milgrom and Roberts [8, 9  proposed the \223web of complementarities\224 theory which marked an important new direction for research in the economics research discipline. They argued that some of the organizational activities and practices are mutually complementary and so tend to be adopted together, with each enhancing the contribution of the other. The 223supermodularity\224 of a function will be used to identify the complementar  Sup er m o d u lar i ty dict ates t h a t t h e su m  of the increases in the value of a function. If complementarities among activities exist, then the gains from increasing every feature are larger than the sum of the individual increases. In other words, a test for complementarities must consider performance data on some function that is hypothesized to be supermodular Suppose there are two herbs H1 and H2. Each herb can be used in a formula \(H1=1\r not \(H1=0\ and \(H2=1\ or not \(H2=0\. The function f\(H1,H2\ is supermodular and H1 and H2 are complements only if: f\(1,1\+ f\(0,0 y\denotes the component-wise maximum and \(x

The average good outcome rate \(GOR\f the whole data set is 392/460=85.21%. There are 261 distinct herbs in the dataset and there are on average 14 herbs in a formula. In current stage, we ignored the dosage of each herb but only recorded whether an herb is used, i.e. it is represented in binary format. Each encounter has an entry for each herb, while the zeros and ones indicate the herbs actually prescribed in the current formula 1 Also, 1 is added to both the numerator and denominator to overcome the potential problem of having zero occurrence of bad_outcome of the pattern each data record value > 0 20 germinated\002barley szechwan\002 chinaberry\002fruit danshen\002root fourleaf\002ladybell\002 root  There were 3,724 2-way interactionsets obtained for the necessary condition and 3,513 of them finally satisfied the sufficient condition.

1 It  also became obvious from the discussion with the TCM doctors that herb-herb interaction without any associated knowledge on symptoms and/or syndromes is a major handicap. The search for symptom-herb is also an important direction. Lastly, unlike ARM that uses anti-monotonic property to do the pruning, the computation performance of the new algorithm is a worthwhile direction to proceed, i.e parallel or cloud computing A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work is partially supported by China Key Technologies R&D Programme \(2007BA110B06-01 R EFERENCES 1 R  Agra wal a n d R Srikan t Fa st Alg orith ms f o r Minin g As s o c i ation Rules," in 20th International Conference on Very Large Databases VLDB-94\94, pp. 487-498 2 M.

The question is whether the existing herb-set theory has already been so well established that we modeled the computational approach to re-confirm the TCM theory, or we should explore new functions to enable the discovery of seemingly uninspiring herbs combination VII C ONCLUSION To identify the herbs that truly interact in a formula is an important research in TCM. This paper has proposed the use of complementarity to explain the interaction effect, which is indicated by the value of a supermodular function. A new parameter-free algorithm was designed to incrementally search for all the herbs combination. The algorithm was applied to a clinical dataset on insomnia treatment from a Beijing TCM hospital. Generated results were commented by TCM practitioners. It is encouraging that interesting and new discoveries were found. Having said that the algorithm is free from the worry of determining the parameter values, it is not completely trouble-free; another problem has shown up. Three different functions were used in our experiments and different results were reported. Hence, one of the future works is to identify the most appropriate function to be used in the TCM context. Another future direction is to explore if the herb-herb interaction is stronger under existence of other herbs, i.e. to look for computational approach to support the theory of master-deputy-assistant-envoy   The resulting single pair and two triplet in Experiment 3 are the herbs used in Suanzaoren Tang. In other words, the process rediscovered the core herbs in a well known formula The results in Table 2 from Experiment 3 were interesting though some of them are out specifically used to address insomnia. For example, according to the TCM doctor, the first pair of <Chinese date, fresh ginger> has the function to harmonize the qi and blood, yingfen and weifen, spleen and stomach, but it is mainly used as an assistant rather than as master herbs. The second and third pairs are not typical relevant to insomnia as well. The pair-5,6 and 10 are typical herb-pairs for Liuwei Dihuang Pill  ine date in pair-4 and -7 is for nourishing the heart and tranquillization, while the purpose of the second herb in both cases is to nourish spleen and kidney yin. Pair-8 and -9 are considered interesting discovery in this list. For example cassia bark in the 9th pair, traditionally teams up with golden thread in Jiaotai Wan  fresh\002ginger chinese\002thorowax\002root  indian\002bread cassia\002bark

6 Conclusions This work proposed a novel genetic feature selection framework for CBIRs It employs a wrapper strategy that searches for the best reduced feature set while optimizing 050or preserving\051 the quality of the solution From a ranking evaluation function three new 002tness functions namely F cA  F cB and F c have been proposed and evaluated in three experiments The proposed genetic feature selection approach which encompasses F cA  F cB and F c  has been compared with 050a\051 traditional methods found in the literature 050b\051 the StARMiner feature selector and 050c\051 the whole feature vector and signi\002cantly outperformed them The proposed approach has been able to optimize the accuracy of similarity queries while selecting a signi\002catively reduced number of features Additionally the proposal of combining the quality of the query results with the criterion of minimizing the number of selected features F cA and F cB  led to high accurate query answers while reducing the number of features more than the 002tness function F c  Therefore the 002nal processing cost of the queries is also reduced References  P  M d Aze v edo-Marques N A Rosa A J

     Figure 9. Argumentation Tree For Open GL  A1 The current system in flash does not have the functionality of dynamic allocation of particles like mine or clutter. It places them randomly  A1.1 That is not of much importance because it still gives a new position to mine and clutter particles A2 Current system in flash has faster response time as compared to system in Adobe Director A3 The current system doesnêt satisfy many of the features required for the new system like database A4 Adobe Flash cannot communicate with database A4.1 Flash doesnêt support database but database support is very important and critical A4.1.1 The system should be able to generate evaluation reports for trainee based on pr evious records stored in the database A5 Flash doesnêt create sound clips  A5.1 We donêt need sound creating features as the sys tem has to generate sound. We can play externally recorded sound files using Adobe Flash A6 Flash can provide good visual effects as compared to Adobe Director A7 The developer has good knowledge in development using Flash so the system can be developed quickly B1 We could reuse the system already developed for sound generation, as it is developed using Adobe Audition for analysis which is somehow related to Adobe Director B1.1 The current system is better synthesized in terms of sound production and the sound produced is also instantaneous rather than discrete B1.2 That current system has certain performance issues like slow response time B1.3 The current system in Adobe Director has the feature of producing dynamic coloring scheme on approaching a mine. This kind of scheme is highly preferable and is not present in Adobe Flash system B2 Adobe Director can provide more functionality as compared to the current flash system. E.g. Multiple sounds while detecting mines   B2.1 Adobe Director can provide better visual effects as compared to flash e.g. in case of GUIês   B2.2 A modified version of the current system in flash can also provide the same functionality B2.2.1 We cannot integrate code developed in other platforms with Flash, but Flash can be integrated in Adobe Director B3 The interface provided by flash is not professional enough. It is too simple and straight forward for doing more things in future   B4 Easily available plug-ins can help integrate the tracking system developed in C# with Adobe Director  B4.1 Code developed in Open GL/AL can also be integrated using Adobe Director using suitable stubs   B5 A new sound recognition algorithm is being developed in Adobe Audition which can be integrated with Adobe Director but not with Open GL or Flash Evidence supported B6 If the current system is reused; the project deadline can be met easily B7 The developer has very little experience in development using Adobe Director   B7.1 The developer can take help from the already developed system in Adobe Director C1 The tracking software already developed is coded in C#/NX5. We could reuse that and develop our system in Open GL/AL C1.1 Open GL has C# libraries which can be used to develop the system C2 Because the platform used is for high end application development, it can provide good GUI and database support C2.1 Open GL/AL can help us generate dynamic surfaces for mine detection and training which the original system in flash does not have C4 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C3 Open GL does not support connectivity with Adobe Audition. Adobe Audition is required for creating sound recognition algorithm C4 The time taken for developing the project using open GL will be comparatively more as the whole system would have to be developed from scratch C4.1 If Open GL has support for C# libraries, and then the system could be develope d faster as developer is quite familiar with programming languages like C 151 


   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
