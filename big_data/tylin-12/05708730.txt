the Public Free-Bicycle System There are many and many technology problems in the decision of intelligent dispatch In this paper we investigate the busy line of Hangzhou Public FreeBicycle System with association rules mining algorithm Actually nding association rules is an important data mining problem and can be derived based on mining large frequent candidate sets In this paper a new procedure is proposed for efìcient generating busy lines candidate set At rst by passing over the cruel database only once a rent-return database with entries 1 or 0 are set up Then the busy locations and busy lines candidate sets 
are obtained from the rent-return database Finally busy lines are mined from the busy lines candidate sets Practice examples and comparison with the Apriori Algorithm are made on 4 rentreturn databases with small middle and large sizes from the West Lake Scenic Zone It is observed from the experiments that the proposed algorithm is efìcient and robust Keywords ssociation rules data mining busy line Public Free-Bicycle System Apriori algorithmssociation rules data mining busy line Public Free-Bicycle System Apriori algorithma I I NTRODUCTION

transactions containing itemset Z and the total number of transactions in the database.First all itemsets whose supports are not less than the user-speci.ed minimum support are identiìed Each such itemset is referred to as a large itemset.Second  the association rules whose conìdences are not less than the user-speciìed minimum conìdence are generated from these large itemsets.For example let Z be a large itemset.The conìdence of a rule X 002 Y is the ratio of the supports of itemset X 003 Y and itemset X All rules of the form X 002 Y satisfying X 003 Y  Z X 004 Y  and the minimum conìdence constraint are generated.Once all large itemsets are discovered the desired association rules can be obtained in a straightforward manner An algorithm for nding all association rules referred to as the AIS algorithm was rst explored in The AIS algorithm requires to repeatedly scan the database It uses the large itemsets discovered in the previous pass as the basis to generate new potentially large itemsets called candidate itemsets and counts their supports during the pass over the data Speciìcally after reading a transaction it is determined which of the large itemsets found in the previous pass are contained in the transaction New candidate itemsets are generated by extending these large itemsets with other items in the transaction However the performance study in sho ws that AIS is not efìcient since it generates too many candidate itemsets that are found not to be large itemsets nally In the a priori algorithm w as proposed for ef ciently mining association rules Different from the AIS algorithm the algorithm generate the candidate itemsets by using only the large itemsets found in the previous pass For example at the  k  1 th iteration all large itemsets containing  k  1 items called large  k  1 itemsets are generated In the next iteration the candidate itemsets containing k items are generated by joining large  k  1 itemsets The heuristic is that any subset of a large itemset must be large By the heuristic the a priori algorithm can generate a much smaller number of candidate itemsets than the AIS algorithm Another effective algorithm for the candidate set generation called DHP was proposed in By utilizing a hash technique DHP can efìciently generate all the large itemsets and effectively reduce the size of the transaction database.The performance study in sho ws that the number of candidate 2-itemsets generated by DHP is smaller than that by the a priori algorithm Moreover the transaction database size is trimmed at a much earlier stage of the iterations As a result the total execution time can be reduced signiìcantly by DHP In the PSI and PSI seq algorithms were proposed for efìcient large itemsets generation and large sequences generation respectively The two algorithms use prestored information to minimize the numbers of candidate itemsets and candidate sequences counted in each database scan.The prestored informations for PSI and PSI seq include the itemsets and the sequences along with their support counts found in the last mining respectively.Empirical results show that only using little storage space for the prestored information the total computation time can be reduced effectively In  an ef cient graph-based algorithm to disco v er interesting association rules embedded in the transaction database and the customer database is presented The notion of mining multiple-level association rules was introduced in man y applications association rules discovered at multiple concept levels are useful.Usually the association relationship expressed at a lower concept level provides more speciìc information than that expressed at a higher concept level.The approach is to rst nd large items at the top-most level and then progressively deepen the mining process into their descendants at lower levels A similar idea of extracting generalized association rules using a taxonomy was presented in The issue of mining quantitative association rules in large relational databases was investigated in The attrib utes considered in a relation are quantitative or categorical.The values of the attribute are partitioned using an equi  depth approach that is each interval resulted from the partition contains roughly the same number of tuples and then adjacent intervals are combined as necessary A related problem is clustering association rules which combines similar adjacent association rules to form a few general rules proposed a geometric-based algorithm to perform the clustering and applied the minimum description length principle as a means of evaluating clusters Previous researches on mining association rules focus on discovering the relationships among items in the transaction database Lots of papers are mentioned on algorithms for mining association rules such as In this paper a new algorithm for nding association rules is used to analysis busy line for Hangzhou free bicycle system By passing over the database once we can get the training database The frequent itemsets can then be obtained from the operations of rows on this matrix see in section 3 The rest of these paper is organized as follows In section 2 we give a review of the Apriori algorithm for association rule mining and present the limitations of Apriori algorithm In section 3 we present the new proposed algorithm for nding association rules called Matrix Algorithm\(SA  In section 4 we discuss the concrete experiments using the new algorithm Conclusions are given in section 5 II B USY L INE M INING BASED ON R ENT R ETURN M ATRIX We rst generate a matrix with only entries either 0 or 1 after one pass over the rent-return database We call it rentreturn matrix Then we can derive association rules from the matrix The process of generating the matrix is as follows We set the locations in I as columns and the rent-return transactions as rows of the matrix Let the set of locations be I   p 1 p 2   p n   and the set of the rent-return records be D   t 1 t 2   t m   Then the rent-return matrix G   g ij    i 1  2   m  j  1  2   n  is an m  n matrix where g ij 0 or 1 is

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
