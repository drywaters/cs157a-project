MILO classification technique is a new rule-based classification technique, which is different from traditional rule-based technique such as 
decision tree and association rule. MILO-based classification technique further analyzes the content structure of documents and classifies them by finding underlying term that links across paragraphs. The previous research based on MILO extracted the classification rules from a single document at a time, and these extracted rules are locally associated with the documentís subject and independent with the rules that are extracted from other documents. Hence, this paper presents a tree structure which stores local rules from each document and then through three tree: traversals, pre-order, post-order and breath-first-search order to transform local rules into global rules for text categorization. The experimental results have shown that our method has comparable accuracy against other techniques Keywords-Rule-based; pattern matching; text categorizaton term distribution I 
  I NTRODUCTION  Text categorization is the task to assign unlabeled documents into predefined categories according to its content. In recent years, thanks to the fast development of Internet technology, there are enormous amounts of information available every day. Hence it is extremely important to efficiently organize this large amount of information. Now the text categorization is focusing on using a lot of automatic techniques. There are many well-known automatic techniques such as SVM [1 de cis i on tr ee 2   an d Bayes classifier [3  T h es e  te ch n i qu es  c a n qu ick l y  an d  accurately classify documents. Among all kinds of classifiers, the rule-based classifiers do provide an interesting advantage. The classification rules are easy to understand and thus they can be added, deleted, and modified through human knowledge. There are many representative techniques 
such as decision tree [2  Ole x   4   an d  as s o ci ati o n ru le   5    Generally speaking, the rule-based classifiers construct the classification rules by finding valuable patterns from training documents. Then, the document can be classified by performing pattern matching between rules and documents For decision tree, a document is classified through checking the presence or absence of important terms, and the original content structures of the documents are ignored. To focus on this issue, previous MILO research [6  le arn e d th e  rules by observing the distribution of terms in document paragraphs, and these classification rules are related with the topic of a certain document. But, usually the topic is not included in a single document. Therefore, these documents with related topic may conceal valuable classification rules 
To establish these rules, this paper uses pre-order, post-order and the breath-first-search order to convert local rules that are learning from single documents into global rules to classify documents The structure of this paper is arranged as follows: Section 2 describes the concept of our categorization method Section 3 illustrates the experimental results, and Section 4 provides the conclusions II  B UILDING AN MILO  C LASSIFIER  A  Basic Concepts In general, a document should have the basic structure that can roughly be separated into three paragraphs, the beginning, the middle, and the end. We named these 3 paragraph as P1  P2 and P3 respectively 
P1 usually is the beginning part of a document P2 is the main body in a document; and P3 draws the conclusion. Whereas between terms in different paragraphs should have the relation of special meaning, this reflected the semantics of language We defined the relationship between terms as meaningful inner link objects, abbreviated as MILO. The MILO example diagram is shown as Figure1  
 
         Figure 1  The concept of MILO In Figure 1, the first paragraph illustrates origin of National Basketball Association \(NBA\ and its history of

development in the past; the second paragraph describes the NBAís 100th celebration of anniversary, including the names of retired basketball players at the ceremony; the third paragraph records the reflections of players on this celebration. In between the paragraphs, the relation of link constituted by terms is MILO, shown in Figure 1, and the dotted line represents different MILO patterns between the paragraphs. There are 3 kinds of MILOs with lengths of 1, 2 3 respectively. According to the example of MILO in Figure 1, we can illustrate the composition of MILO as Table \037 TABLE I  E XTRACTED MILOS FROM DOCUMENT  MILO Content Direction pattern m0 league 001 retire 001 player  P1 001 P2 001 P3  m1 league 001 celebrate 001 player  P1 001 P2 001 P3  m2 league 001 retire  P1 001 P2  m3 league 001 celebrate  P1 001 P2  m4 retire 001 player  P2 001 P3  m5 celebrate 001 player  P2 001 P3  m6 league 001 player  P1 001 P3  m7 leagu  P1  m8 retir  P2  m9 celebrate  P2  m10 player  P3  By Table \037, we know that MILO has 7 kinds of direction patterns, so we will illustrate how to use MILO to build the classifier and to classify documents. Figure 2 contains the concept diagram of text categorization  Figure 2  Construction for MILO classifier First, according to pre-defined proportion, data set are divided into training sets and testing sets, and the training set is used to train classifier while the testing set is used for measuring classifier and producing accurate ratio. Each document in the training set initially went through paragraph normalization, and then the chi-square function was used to extract those terms considered important from training set When all documents have been preprocessed, the documents are stored into a database accordingly with the category of the document. Then through the proposed categorization algorithm, the MILO patterns are extracted from database of each category, and stored into a tree structure, called MILO tree, which completed the construction of the classifier When we want to classify the unlabeled document, we need to extract all MILOs in the unlabeled document, and then match them with the MILO classifier. Lastly, we assign one or more categories to the unlabeled document, and the process of text categorization is completed B  Preliminaries and Notations To simply illustrate the detailed algorithm, we have defined some notations shown as follows c a category d c a training document of c D c a set of training documents in c P n the nth paragraph of d c  n 1, 2, 3 in this paper t ni an arbitrary term in P n   DB Pn the database which stores all P n of each d c in D c  T the number of selected distinct terms with highest chisquared value TS  DB Pn  T a reduced term set from DB Pn  consisting with selected T terms Tree c a tree structure which stores the MILOs of c  C  Data Set Preprocessing We must normalize each document and divide them into three paragraphs before finding MILO patterns. Initially the number of distinct terms in a document would be counted After that, depending on the appearing sequence of these terms in the document, they would be separated into P1  P2  and P3 such that these three paragraphs have the same number of distinct terms. If the number of distinct terms cannot be divided by three, then P2 would have the greatest number of terms. After all documents have been preprocessed P1  P2 and P3 in all documents are stored into DB P1  DB P2 and DB P3 respectively. Referred on Stopwords   so m e c o mm o n ly us e d w o r d s f r o m thr e e da ta ba s e  DB P1  DB P2 and DB P3 are deleted, after that, let TS  DB Pn  presents the reducing set of database DB Pn However, we need to consider the weightiness of term in each paragraph thus finding out great weightiness of terms in each paragraph is required. Then we calculate weightiness of each term by using the chi-square function with TS  DB P1  TS  DB P2  TS  DB P3 or measuring the relationship between term t i and category c the formula of chi-square function is developed as shown below              2 2 D C B A D B C A C B D A N c t i       002  1

A: occurrences of term t i in category c  B: occurrences of other terms in category c  C: occurrences of term t i in other categories D: occurrences of other terms in other categories N: A+B+C+D, total occurrences of all terms in all categories Through Formula \(1\, we could calculate the weightiness of terms with TS  DB P1  TS  DB P2 and TS  DB P3  respectively. The selected T terms, that have greatest chisquare value, are used to compose the set of important terms from each paragraph D  Construction of MILO Classifier Algorithm of extracted MILOs in a document d c is shown as follows M c is a set of MILOs in category c  OM c is a set of number of occurrences with respect to each MILO in M  DM c is direction of MILOs in category c  Algorithm Extract MILOs Input P1  P2 and P3 of d c  TS  D B P1  T  TS  D B P2  T  TS  D B P 3  T  Output M c  D M c  O M c  Methods 1 t 1i  t 2j and t 3k represent the arbitrary terms in P1  P2  and P3 respectively 2 o 1i  o 2j and o 3k represent the occurrences of t 1i  t 2j and t 3k in P1  P2 and P3 respectively 3\  For each distinct t 1 i in P1 and t 1 i  003 TS  D B P 1  T 4\    For each distinct t 2 j in P2 and t 2 j  003 TS  DB P 2  T  5\      For each distinct t 3 k in P3 and t 3 k  003 TS  D B P 3  T 6\        If d c has length 3 MILO 7 M c 0018 M c  004  t 1 i 001 t 2 j 001 t 3 k   8 D M c 0018 D M c  004  P1 001 P2 001 P3   9 OM c 0018 OM c  004  o 1 i  o 2 j  o 3 k 3 Steps\(3\-\(5\ delete unimportant terms from each paragraph, for example, Step\(3\ould delete those terms that do not belong to TS  DB P1  T Step\(6\ checks whether has length 3 MILO in d c if so, then steps\(7\\(9\ would be executed; otherwise, do not extract MILO from d c Step\(7 stores the content of a MILO into M c and Step\(8\ores the direction of a MILO into DM c Step\(9\tores the occurrences of a MILO in d c into OM c  MILOs would be stored into Tree c while extracted MILOs by Algorithm Extract MILOs from documents in D c  and the concept diagram is shown as Figure 3. For example referred to Figure 3, if a length 3 MILO league 001 retire 001 player  d c leagueî would be stored into Level 2 that is the node of ìrootî; ìretireî would be stored into Level 3; ìplayerî would be stored into Level 4. In Level 5, the square cell would be stored with the occurrence of MILO in category c so if a MILO [against 001 star 001 retire  extracted from a document, the occurrence is 8, and if the same MILO is extracted from another document, then the content of square cell in Level 5 would be 15. In this paper only length 3 MILO was taken to construct Tree c because length 3 MILO is the most integrated and the most diversified across the whole content of document, and it also has the greatest relationship with the topic of a document and the content includes the contents of length 2 and length 1 MILO, but other length MILO are still used in next section After all the MILOs are extracted from documents in D c the construction of Tree c is then finished. Now, for controlling the quality of the MILO classifier, we must filter out some of the non-representative MILOs, so we let 002\027 presents one of the MILOs in Tree c If support of 002\027 is less than threshold 002\035 then we delete 002\027 from Tree c The formula for calculating support is shown as follows c  in  MILOs ll a  of  occurences  The c  in   of  occurences  The 005 2 The above process is used to construct a MILO tree of category c After all of the MILO trees have been dealt with by the above process, the MILO classifier is then finished  Figure 3  MILO tree of Category c  E  Docunemt Categorization with MILO When an unlabeled document performs paragraph normalization and filters out common words depending on Stopwords List, and then we have to use all the terms to construct MILOs from unlabeled documents. Difference from the construction of classifier is that we only uses length 3 MILO in this section, thus we will take all kinds of length to match the MILO patterns. The algorithm of categorization is shown as follows Algorithm Categorizatio n Input: classifier d unlabeled document 0011 a categorization factor C a set of categories Output: classification results Method 1\ Choose a type of traversal 2\or each MILO 002\027 003 d 3\   For each c 003 C  4 Trace Tree c b y the selected type of traversal and store the result into S c  5 Matched_time  c  001\025  002\027 s matched times in S c  6\   For each c 003 C  Total 001\025 Total  Matched_time  c  7 Total is used to store the total matched times  8\  For each c 003 C  Decision array  c  001\025  Decision array  c   M atched_time  c   Total  9 Find the max total co n fidence value in D ecision array and store into M axDecideConf  10\ For each c 003 C if Decision array  c  006 MaxDecideConf  0011  t hen assign c to d In Step\(1\ we first choose a type of traversal for trace Tree c all of three types traversal can be chosen and Step\(4

Steps\(6\-\(8\ would then calculate the confidence value in each category and store it into Decision array Step\(9\ould pick the greatest confidence value from Decision array and present MaxDecideConf and Step\(10 determines whether the confidence value of category c in Decision array  c  n o t less t h an th at o f  MaxDecideConf  0011 if so, then the category c would be assigned to the unlabeled document d  TABLE II  RESULTS OF CATEGORIZATION TAKING ON THE WHOLE TRAINING SET T=100   0.000053  007   0.75    Preorder Postorder Breadth-First Search Naive Bayes Bayes Nets C4.5 Rocchioís method Rullo et al Pietramala et al HARMONY acq 93.0 93.6 93.1 91.5 88.3 85.3 92.1 87.0 87.2 95.3 corn 66.7 69.2 67.7 47.3 76.4 87.7 86.2 87.9 90.8 78.2 crude 79.9 80.0 79.2 81.0 79.6 75.5 81.5 80.1 77.0 85.7 earn 96.0 95.9 95.7 95.9 95.8 96.1 96.1 96.1 95.3 98.1 grain 36.1 36.1 35.5 72.5 81.4 89.1 79.5 90.8 91.6 91.8 interest 72.4 73.2 71.4 58.0 71.3 49.1 72.5 82.2 64.2 77.3 money-fx 79.1 76.6 77.8 62.9 58.8 69.4 67.6 69.3 66.5 80.5 ship 87.3 87.4 87.4 78.7 84.4 80.9 83.1 78.2 74.1 86.9 trade 80.9 82.8 81.3 50.0 69.0 59.2 77.4 52.6 61.8 88.4 wheat 71.0 67.1 68.8 60.6 82.7 85.5 79.4 91.4 87.5 62.8 Micro F 87.5 87.6 87.1 84.2 85.0 85.2 87.2 86.5 86.4 92.0 III  E XIPERMTNTAL R ESULTS  We have employed micro F1 in the survey of F Sebastiani  f o r c l a s s i fi er eva l ua t i o n T a b l e 004 shows the experimental results.

Step 4 Identify the error estimate by running the remaining one-third of dataset through the tree and compute the correctness Algorithm Decision tree classifier Decision classifier consists of a collection of individual tree classifier. The general concept has been given below 1 Select N the number of trees to grow, and m a number no larger then the number of variables 2 for i=1 to N Call Train set 3 Draw a bootstrap sample from the data, term those not in the bootstrap sample as out-of-bag data 4 Grow a random tree, where at each node the best set is chosen among m randomly selected variables. The tree is grown to a maximum size and it should not be pruned 5 Use the tree to predict out-of-bag data 6 In the end use the predictions on out-of-bag data to form majority votes 7 Prediction of test data is done by majority votes from predictions from the ensemble of trees By applying the concept of decision tree classifier a three class classifier to classify the transactional database objects as normal, benign and malignant IV R ESULTS AND D ISCUSSION A Classification Figure 7. Represents segmented output image of shape prior technique created image which is segmented from binary output image \(figure 6 then Classification involves segregating the data into segments which are non-overlapping Any approach to classification assumes some knowledge about the data termed as training. Performance of classification assignment has been measured in terms of classification accuracy. The outcome of classification can be described as  True positive TP\: A row t i predicted to be in class C j and is actually in it  False positive FP\: A row t i predicted to be in class C j but is actually not in it  True negative TN\: A row t i not predicted to be in class C j but is actually not in it  False negative FN\: A row t i not predicted to be in class C j but is actually in it  The precision and recall are used to determine the accuracy of the classifier Fig. 6 Binary output image Fig.7.

When the system contains s number of matrix, the confusion matrix is in the form of sxs matrix. If there exists any entry for example C j means it represents the number of rows assigned to a class C j instead of the classification C i The general form of the confusion matrix is given in the following table I. The proposed system consists of three classes for classification like Normal, Benign and Malignant. The confusion matrix that represents the association rule 3 under the decision tree classification is a 3x3 matrix. This association rule consists of 200 rules for instances means then 151 are normal, 27 are malignant and 22 are benign TABLE I GENERAL TWO CLASS CONFUSION MATRIX Human provision Category Yes No Yes TP FP Classifier provision No FN TN

Precision and Recall An important truth to be notices is that both the association rule mining and the decision tree classifier performs relatively well on the transactional database. Using the equation \(3\ and 4\ precision and recall values are computed for the data stored in the database. The following graph gives the precision and recall value for the proposed system compared with the neural network and associative classifier. Figure 8 represents the precision and recall graph D. Classifier efficiency Using the TP, TN, FP, FN values the classifier efficiency can be determined in the form of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity.

The new technique called Shape priori algorithm for pre-processing of images has given the efficient features to be stored in the transactional database. The feature selection using Association rule mining algorithm has given the best way of identifying the rule to be used for classification phase.
