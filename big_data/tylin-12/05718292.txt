 Research on Tennis Technique and Tactic s Decision Support Based on Theory of Association Data Mining  Liang Chengjun School of Kinesiology Shanghai University of Sport Shanghai, China Yu Lijuan  Wang Jihong University Office Shanghai University of Sport Shanghai, China   Abstract The result of tennis match were great influenced by the level of technique and tactics decision-making, and how to find the characteristics of athletes  technique and tactics from mass data is a urgent problem which is needed to be shoveled in order to make up the insufficiency of traditional statistical 
method and provide scientific basis for tennis technique and tactics decision-making. Based on association data mining theory and the Weka data mining platform, association data mining model was established, which was about the association between the stroke placement, stroke technique, stroke line and score of tennis technique and tactics. Specific case research were carried out from the following three perspectives, i.e. the association analysis between the last two stroke placement, line and win or lose of each point, the association analysis between the first three stroke placement and win or lose point in serve game, the association analysis between the first two stroke placement and win or lose point in service game. The research 
results indicate that the data mining model were capable of providing objective and scientific decision support for technique and tactics decision-making in tennis game and daily tennis technique and tactics training Keywords-Tennis; technique and tactics; stroke placement Association rules; Data mining I   I NTRODUCTION  Data mining rose in 1990s, which is extract or mine the knowledge from the large amounts of data [1 d it is t h e combination of many subjects and technology. Data mining is mainly based on the method of discovery to find new knowledge and laws in large amounts of data, so it is also 
known as knowledge discovery in database \( KDD The development of information technology enables people to descript sports events scientifically and quantitatively, which makes it possible to quantify decisionmaking for people. But it is difficult to discover these hidden rules in large mounts of data by using single statistical method, which is not benefit to make scientific decision-making. Some more valuable information or rules will be discovered by using data mining that will make up the shortcomings of traditional statistical method, and this 
will be capable of providing decision support for people making tennis technique and tactics decision-making Therefore, it is necessary for people to research and use data mining technology to assist them in tennis technique and tactics decision-making Association analysis can help people to find interesting potentially relation between things from a large amount of database, which can be presented in maximum frequent itemsets and association rules. The algorithm include Apriori algorithm  a nd i t s i m p r o v ed A p r i or i  000 algorithm, FP Growth and its improved algorithm[3 et c  II  T HE ESTABLISHMENT OF ASSOCIATION DATA MINING MODEL  A

002 I. In general 031 to contain 0 or more items in correlation analysis is called itemset. The transactions contain the number of itemset is called support count, and 0011 A\means the support count of itemset A. Association rule is an implication of the form A==>B, where A 
I, B 
003 I, and A 001 B= Ø.A rule has a measure of its strength called support and confidence, which can be defined as follows S \(A 001 B N BA  
005 005 004 2 In formula \(1\ the total number of transactions Minsup is defined as minimum support, and minconf as minimum confidence. If the support of itemset is above minimum support, then the itemset is called large itemset 
004 005 1 C \(A 001 B   A BA 
Given a set of transactions, the problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have support and confidence greater than the user-specified minimum support \(minsup\d minimum confidence minconf\he problem of discovering all association rules of sufficient support and confidence can be decomposed into two subproblems[4 First  f i n d all larg e ite m s et s w h ic h  are sets of items that have transaction support greater than minsup; Then, use the large itemsets to generate the desired rules which have a computed confidence greater than minconf. Fig. 1 shows an example of algorithm in production of large itemsets

Considering the character of association algorithm, i.e. combination is adopted to generate large itemsets once for one transaction, and based on this, association rules were generated.  Therefore, the association data mining model can be applied to mine one technique and tactics attribute character once. Moreover, the stroke sequence must be considered in data mining that is demanded in tennis technique and tactics decision-making Only in this way, the rules that are mined have directive significance for actual decision-making of tennis technique and tactics. Theoretically, this data mining model can realize data mining analysis in any number of sequence stroke information. But in consider of the demand of the rules' confidence and support, the actual data mining analysis results indicate that the number of sequence stroke should be between 1 and 3 strokes. The research has obtained better decision making effect on these aspects as follows: the association analysis between stroke placement and stroke results \(win or lose\ the first 1 to 3 sequence strokes in serve or receive of research object, the association analysis between stroke placement, stroke line and stroke results \(win or lose\ the last two stroke of a rally  III  C ASE ANALYSIS  The technique and tactics information of Thirteen international open championships of Chinese elite female athlete Li Na was collected, and association data mining model that was established was used to mine the association rules between stroke placement, stroke line and stroke result win or lose\he basic parameters setting of data mining model are as follows: minsup \(10%\inconf \(70 A  The last two stroke placement and line association analysis As are shown in table 001\017 and table 001\020 the association rules indicate that both Li Na and her opponents stroke the placement on middle area of court, the confidence of the stroke results are losing is more than 90%. The main stroke placement of Li Na wins the point on the last stroke are back court right and left area, which confidence is more than 86%, and with relatively high support are 27.3% and 24.2 respectively. These rules indicate that on more than 2 strokes per point content Li Na should decrease stroke to the opponents' middle court area, and increase stroke to the left or right side of the court, so as to enhance the rate of win point Table 000\003\001\021\000\003 shows the results of the last two stroke association analysis between stroke line and stroke result The rule indicates that the confidence and support that Li Na loses the point are 79% and 18.7% when Li Na stroke line is down the line shot. It suggests that Li Na should strengthen the ability of stroke down the line shot successfully. The opponents stroke two kinds of line in the next to the last stroke, i.e. crosscourt shot and Middle area to middle area and then Li Na stroke back, the results show that Li Na lose the points with high rate. The confidences of these two rules are 74% and 72% respectively. The rules reveal that the capability of Li Na return crosscourt shot and middle area to middle area shot should be improve further TABLE VII  T HE LAST TWO STROKE L I NA LAST STROKE  PLACEMENT ASSOCIATION RULES    rules confidence support The last stroke placement=back court middle area ==>lose 97% 11.5 The next to the last stroke placement back court left area ==> win 80% 13.3

The second rule indicates that Li Na serve to the opponent's Right area internal angle, and then the opponent stroke to back court middle area, the stroke result is opponent win the point with confidence of 93% and support of 14.9%.

numerical attribute e  g the attribute Age which is generally in the range 0-100, can be divided into six sharp partitions namely 0-15, 16-30, 31-45, 46-60, 61-75, 76 and above. In case of FACISME, fuzzy sets are used instead of sharp partitions, in order to convert numerical attributes to fuzzy partitions. The attribute Age can be divided into three fuzzy partitions, namely Young, Medium-aged, and Old, with each value of age belonging to each of the three fuzzy partitions with some membership value 265 Thus, the number of sharp partitions that need to be used to handle a numerical attribute is far greater than the number of fuzzy partitions required to do the same. Moreover, this leads to better understanding by the user as there are few well-defined fuzzy partitions with linguistic names/meanings like Young and Old, as opposed to sharp partitions which are less intuitive and to which a user cannot relate to immediately For the current analysis we have used two fuzzy partitions for all numerical attributes throughout all the datasets. As described in section 5.C, the time complexity of FACISME is quite high, because of which the time required to train a fuzzy classifier using FACISME is also high. Hence, we have used two fuzzy partitions so as to limit the training time. But, even with just two fuzzy partitions we have achieved quite high accuracies, as described above. More importantly, even with this, we achieved similar \(sometimes better results\s other state-of-the art classifiers used in this experimental analysis. The reason for these high accuracies is that FACISME is based on the theoretically sound and well-established maximum entropy framework  VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have proposed a new classifier based on the paradigms of association rules mining and fuzzy logic  Though recent classifiers i nvolving association rules have shown their techniques to be accurate, their approaches to build a classifier either manifest unobserved statistical relationships in the dataset, or have no statistical basis at all FACISME uses the well-known maximum entropy principle and iterative scaling to build a statistical and robust theoretical model for classification Fuzzy Logic gives FACISME the capability to deal accurately and efficiently  with any type of datasets and domains, and in any kind of environments, which is not necessarily true for traditional crisp classifiers. Thus, using maximum entropy and fuzzy logic, FACISME provides very  good  accuracy and can work with all types of data irrespective of size and type of attributes \226 numerical or binary  REFERENCES 1  Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R.: Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
