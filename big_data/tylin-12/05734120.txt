A Novel Web Recommender System Considering Users\222 Need Evolution  Rozita Tavakolian Department of Information Technology Engineering Tarbiat Modares University Tehran, Iran tavakolian@modares.ac.ir Nasrollah Moghadam Charkari Department of Electrical and Computer Science Trabiat Modares University Tehran, Iran charkari@modares.ac.ir   Abstract 227 The recommender systems\222 task is to predict items in which a user might like in future. Typically they do it in two stages. One, offline stage, that extracts patterns from mining users\222 historical behavior, and another, online stage predicts items by matching the active requests with the patterns; but without considering other interests of the active user. In general web users\222 navigations contain gradual evolution of their needs We conducted an approach that addresses the evolving nature of users\222 needs and interests in making recommendations. Since users\222 behaviors are not stable and their interest changes with time, our approach is based on interest-drifting. One of the main shortcomings of interest-drifting based approaches is that they assume different users have the similar interest changes over time and do not consider this important factor that the trend of interest changes for users is different. This paper attempts to tackle this problem, too. Up to now there has not been any study to tackle these problems. We evaluate our proposed methodology on EachMovie dataset. Results show a better performance than existing approaches Keywords-component; recommender system; web mining evolution of users\222 needs and interest; interest-drifting I   I NTRODUCTION  Web Mining \(WM\ is a popular technique that can be used to discover information hidden into Web-related data by exploiting Data Mining techniques [1 I t  ca n b e  use d fo r different goals such as web recommendation systems. The recommender systems\222 task is to predict items in which a user might like in future. Typically they consist of two major parts offline mining and online recommendation. In the first part some web mining techniques are applied to historical behaviors of users to mine the navigation patterns of users. In the online recommendation part, user\222s requests from his/her current active session are matched with the patterns obtained from the offline part in order to generate recommendations [2  T h e most recommender systems work in this way [3,4,5,6  The y  consider only current request of user and don\222t pay any attention to other interests of him/her. In general, Web users\222 navigations contain gradual evolution of their information needs. Therefore some previous observations of users might be still of their interest. It represents that considering previous observations and related interests of the user might result predicting his/her future needs more precise. Suppose that a user has been interested in movies that actor X plays in them before and now he/she browses movies with genre Y. Our system can suggest movies with genre Y that actor X plays in them In this paper we propose a novel method that is able to dynamically identify potential interests of an active user and consider this information to improve the performance of recommendations. The main idea is introducing a recommendation approach that identifies potential interests of the user and integrates it with his/her current request in making recommendation On the other, user\222s interest changes with time. The old interest is gradually forgotten, and the new one is created. This phenomenon is called as interest-drifting [7  Us e r m ay ch an g e the items which have been rated highly in the past. For example, a man previously liked thrillers. So he rated The 39 Steps, a thriller, the highest score 5 three years ago. But he changes his interests as time goes by. Currently he dislikes thrillers. He rated The Bourne Identity, another thriller, the score 2 a month ago [8  I t re p r es en ts th at all o b s e rv at i o n  history of a user might not include in his/her potential interest So, our approach is based on interest-drifting In the recent years, many researchers have focused on addressing user\222s interest drifting problem. They assign time weights to all observations of user. Since the last observations of users represent the current users\222 interest better than older ones, they assign time weights to items such that the items visited recently have more contribution to the recommendation It\222s called forgetting mechanism [7 Sugi y a m a  H a t a no and yoshikawa explored a type of time-based collaborative filtering with detailed analysis of user's browsing history in one day [9 In [8  an it em b ased c o l l a b o r a tiv e f ilt erin g a l g o r ith m h a s b e en  presented to compute the time weights for different items in a manner that will assign a decreasing weight to old data. In [10  a hybrid filtering algorithm has been introduced to address interest drift. Godoy and Amandi developed a mechanism named WebProfiler which learns a hierarchical representation of all user interests using conceptual clustering [1 I nt e rest s at the top and bottom levels of the hierarchy can be seen as long-term short-term interests respectively. Then a time-based forgetting is used to give weight to different web paged in the hierarchy. Li and Feng has developed a computation model to estimate the user interest of the accessed pages through analyzing users\222 browsing behaviors; they have used a time 2010 5th International Symposium on Telecommunications \(IST'2010 978-1-4244-8185-9/10/$26.00 ©2010 IEEE 738

Min and Ha  d e ve l o p e d a m o di fi ed  c o l l a bor a t i v e filtering based approach which can find the active user\222s neighbors according to his/her changing pattern One of the main shortcomings of available approaches based on interest-drifting is that they assume different users have the similar interest changes over time. In real world, the trend of interest changes in user purchase interest is different For example, some users\222 interest changes with time quickly while others may have a stable interest.  We decided to address this problem, too. Differently from previously approaches, our method tracks and detects the drifted interests of users individually We evaluate the efficiency of our proposal from two aspects: \(1\ the impact of considering user\222s interest evolution and \(2\ the impact of detecting users\222 interest drifting individually The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes our proposed approach. The experiments are given in section III. And the paper ends with a short conclusion and some suggestions for future work in section IV II  THE  PROPOSED  RECOMMENDATION  S YSTEM  In this section we present an approach based on web mining techniques and interest-drifting that takes into account all potential interests of the user in making recommendations. It solves the problem of identifying drifted interests of users individually. The steps in the algorithms could be briefly summarized as follows a  Create a Time-to-Category Rating matrix using web page clusters and web users\222 ratings to detect interest drifting of users individually b  Calculate the weights of interests based on their importance for users c  Mine weighted association rules d  Update active user profile e  Recommend unseen items to the active user Fig. 1 shows a general view of the proposed algorithm In the next subsections, we will describe each step in detail A  Detecting User Interest Drifting In an electronic shop different users differ about purchase behavior and, consequently the trend of their interest changes is not same. We attempt to detect changes in user interest at different periods of times individually. For this, we use a modified approach in [1 O u r  pr opo sed m e t h o d i s a s fo l l o w s  Step 1 Cluster web pages after preprocessing and TF-IDF weighting w e c a t e gor i z e d w e b pa ge s ba sed o n co nt e n t  similarity  Figure 1  The architecture of our proposal  Step 2 Produce a Time-to-Category Rating Matrix for each user in this matrix, rows are timeframes and columns are categories found in previous step. Numbers in each row denotes ratings of user u to each item in categories. We represent the interests of a user in different timeframes by Time-to-Category Rating Matrix. Table 1 shows a Time-toCategory Rating Matrix of a user Step 3 Calculate category ratings the category rating is defined as the average ratings for the items in that category and defined as follow     ku T1 cr is the category rating k of user u in timeframe T1 and  u 1T r is the average ratings of user u in timeframe T1  739  ia k category,i k ku r RN 1 cr        002  1 In the above equation cr u,k is the derived rating of category k of user u  RN k is the number of rated items that belong to that category r u,i is the rating of item i of user u we calculate category rating for each category and each user in different timeframes. In our work, category ratings might be a good indicator for estimating the amount of importance for a particular content for each user Step 4 Calculate the correlation between different interests of each user in different timeframes the calculation is done by Auto-Similarity measure \(AS\ which discussed in [14  H e r e   it\222s applied to detect a behavior change for any user.

4 Function F\(t\ called time function or forgetting function. In literature, many Forgetting Functions have been introduced, for example, logistic function, sigmoid function and linear functions. Here, we choose the time function used in [10  following 003  5 It can satisfy our needs well. Using F\(t\, the value of time weight lies in the range \(0,1\ and the more recent data will have the higher the value We firstly, defined a decay rate parameter Our aim is to define the rate of decay of the weight assigned to interests [1    C  Mining Weighted Association Rules In this section, we extract weighted association rules Discovery of association rules has been found successful in many recommender systems. Despite classic association rule mining, weighted association rule mining allows different weights to be assigned to different items to reflect their importance to the user. The weights may represent as the profitability or popularity of different items for the user Weighted association rule mining pays more attention to items with higher importance [1 We have implemented the algorithm of weighted rule mining presented in  T h e va l u e  o f m i ni mu m sup p o r t and confidence was considered 0.6 and 0.5 respectively. The result 740 TABLE I  T IME T O C ATEGORY RATING M ATRIX    This measure is used for detecting the degree of changes Auto-Similarity AS\(u T1,T2 is defined as the similarity between the user\222s category ratings at timeframe T1 and the same user\222s category ratings at timeframe T2  Step 5 Detect changes if the value of \(2\ is less than a predefined threshold we can understand that a change in user interest has been occurred In real world, the timeframe size is decided by how frequently the user purchase interest changes. If the user preference changes frequently or dramatically, we should assign a small size; it helps us detecting more drifting Conversely, if the user preference is consistent, we should increase the size of timeframe. So, timeframe size influences the performance of the algorithm B  Calculating the Weights of Interests To capture the real interest of a user to items, we assign a new weight to each rating based on combining user ratings and time whenever user\222s interest changes. Several reasons validate the idea of computing this hybrid weight    change interstif change interest noif if 200  An item with more ratings is of greater interest to customers 200  Customer preferences are time-sensitive. The item rated more recently by a user might have a larger impact on the prediction of user\222s preference than an item that was rated long time ago. In the other words recent ratings should be able to reflect user\222s current interests more accurately [8   Users\222 ratings recorded  in dataset. Most studies applied a time-sensitive function to assign a smaller weight to old ratings and larger weight to newer ratings [8,10,11,12,13 u t t h e s e studies don\222t detect drift and multiply the time function in all ratings of a user. If a user has a stable interest, it results decreasing the importance of his/her long-term interest and finally poor predictions. In this paper, we firstly detected users\222 interest drifting individually. Then we apply time function whenever an interest change occurs. In this case time function can decrease the importance of items related to each interest of the user The following example illustrates our approach in finding individually the interest drift of each user and then giving weight to each interest Suppose that table 1 is a Time-to-Category Rating Matrix of a user u  Ti is a timeframe T m represents the last timeframe user has done rating and T 1 is the oldest timeframe. We compute the new weight for items using \(3 W u,j and R u,j  denote new weight of item j for user u and, rating user u has assigned  to item j  F\(t i  is a time function   i F\(t ju R ju W 200  Since the ratings in row Tm indicate the current interest. So, we consider t i 0 for all items in this row 200  In other rows, ti 0. If in timeframe T i a drift is detected, then t i will be the elapsed days from T i to Tm. For example if Tm is November 1995 and T i is August 1995, then t i for all items in timeframe T i is equal to 91 200  If in timeframe T i interest doesn\222t change, then t i will be equal with the value of t i in timeframe T i+1  Equation \(4\ shows the above explanation briefly   T -T t 0 t mi 1ii   t e  F\(t 327 3 The value of variable t i is determined as follows 


6 After retrieving a rule with the most Similarity\(R\alue we recommend active user items with the highest weight in right-hand side of the rule III  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  To evaluate the performance of our proposed recommender system, we carried out our experiments on The EachMovie  dataset that have been the most widely used common datasets in recommender system researches. The EachMovie dataset has rating information on 1,628 movies by 72,916 users during an 18-month-period. Users rated various numbers of movies by rating values to values between 0 and 1. Each vote is accompanied by a date and time stamp. We have collected the content of each movie from Internet Movie Database \(IMDB\1 using a web crawler. These content includes movie title director, genre, plot summary, cast, award and user comment We have selected a subset of 466,245 includes 1,628 movies and 2,880 users with more than 100 rated items. We divided the dataset into a 90% for the training set and 10% for the test set The quality of recommendation is evaluated by Mean Absolute Error \(MAE\ MAE is a widely applied metric. It can be defined as the average absolute difference of predictions from the real users\222 ratings. In our experiments, we computed the MAE on the test set for each user \(in \(7\ Then averaged over the test set \(in \(8\\. A smaller value means a better performance [1   represent the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the a th weighted rule respectively p i represents each item and w i is the weight of the  i th  item S a and C a are weighted support and weighted confidence of rule a th  respectively D  Updating Active User Profile and Recommendation As mentioned before, because of evolving nature of users\222 needs, we have decided to take into account related interests of the active user in prediction. Current observations of an active user in website represent his/her recent preferences. When a user enters the website and starts to visit web pages, we first update active user profile by reassigning new weights to his/her interests based on current session using technique described in sections II and subsection B In our evaluations of recommendation approach, we use leave-one-out method. Suppose that vector  k where   s s 1-i 1-i11 w,t ..., , ,w,t  S   1-i 1-i 1 1 r,t ..., ,r,t  S  004 as the profile of u. Now we can suggest more useful item to u by matching the sequence S with the mined historical behavior patterns As we said earlier, each of the weighted association rules are represented as a set of item-weight pairs. So, we can retrieve rule has the most similar left-hand side with S\222. If lefthand side of the each rule is represented as a vector of this algorithm conceptually described as follows  is a vector in test set for an active user u where ti and i r indicate each item and the rating of user u to t i respectively. Then we apply the leave-one-out method for each t i r i in T. In this way, we eliminate a t i r i t each step, then the current user session will represent as a vector  Therefore, S represents current interest of u. Now we update the profile of u based on current session and obtain   w,p,..., w,p nknk1k1k  004 004 327  kk 2 s k w 2 r k w k s k w r k w R,SM R,SM  R Confidence R Similarity  then the similarities will be computed using \(6    w,p..., ,  w,p kk 11 and     w,p...,,  w,p{R r kk r ii         327   n r - ar MAE i n 1j ji,ji i i   7  m m 1i i MAE MAE  8  A  Parameter Settings There are three major parameters in the proposed mechanism: \(1\ the timeframes size in section I and subsection A. \(2\The threshold used to determine the correlation of user interests in different timeframes. \(3\e decay rate in \(5 We conduct a series of preliminary experiments to find the optimal performance obtained for each parameter when the value of other is constant 1  Experiment \(1\: impact of the Timeframe size In the first experiment, we change the timeframe size from 1, 2, and 3 to 4 months. The impact of using different values is demonstrated in Figure 2. This parameter value depends on the speed of the users interest change. It is found that timeframe size dramatically influences the performance of the algorithm It\222s necessary to assign different values to this parameter to obtain the best performance. When the speed of changes is high, the size must be selected smaller 2  Experiment \(2\: impact of  We vary values of to evaluate its influence on the performance of algorithm. Results are showed in figure 3. As   1  www.imdb.com 741     nn 1 1 r,t ..., ,r,t  T     C ,S ,  w,p w,p  w,p..., ,  w,p{  r aanknk 11k kk 11a 


we can see from the results, MAE values increase with  Recall that, in Section II, if the similarity of two interests is less than it means a drift occurs. So, when increases, more interest drifts will determine. It is while that two interests may be similar but when the value of is larger, they may consider distinct. Therefore it seems reasonable that the higher value of causes the higher value of MAE is 3  Experiment \(3\: impact of  To experimentally determine the impact of the decay rate on the quality of the prediction, we selectively vary the parameter to 0.05, 0.02, and 0.01. The higher the value of  in \(5\ the faster old data decays and the lower the importance of the historical information compared to more recent data. Fig 4 shows the MAEs of the proposed algorithm in different cases B  Overall Performance In order to demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm some experiments have been conducted. We evaluate the efficiency of our proposal from two aspects: \(1\the impact of considering user\222s interest evolution, and \(2\he impact of detecting users\222 interest drifting individually. Therefore, we compare results with the approach of [1 an d th e c l as s i c  approach that did not consider other interests of active user in prediction. Ma, Li, Ding and Orlowska [10 us e d  co l l a bor a t i v e filtering with interest-drifting in which users have assumed to have similar interest-drifting over time. We re-implement this method and compare it with our approach. For second approach, we consider a classic weighted association rule mining where recommendation is done based on active session alone. Also, weights are only user ratings and no forgetting function used. Here, we called it C-WARM The results are evaluated based on MAE metric and showed in figure 5. We can see that our proposed approach performs 6.80% better than  a nd 1  42 b e t t e r t ha n C-WARM    Figure 2   The impact of timeframe size   Figure 3   The impact of threshold  Figure 4   The impact of decay rate   Figure 5   MAE using different algorithms on EachMovie  IV  C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK  In this paper, we developed a novel approach based on web mining techniques and interest-drifting which addresses the evolving nature of users\222 needs in making recommendations Our approach takes into account all related interests of the active user to making more accurate predictions. Also, it was able to detect user\222s interest changes individually and assign weights to drifted preferences of users not to all of them to improve the existence methods. The proposed algorithm consists of five phases of \(1\ detecting interest changes individually, \(2\lculating weights, \(3\ining behavior pattern, \(4\ updating active user profile and \(5 recommendation We conducted experiments to evaluate the prediction quality on the EachMovie dataset and compared them with the approach of [10 an d th e c l a s s i c a p p r o ach th at ig n o r e oth er  potential interest of user. The results show the proposed methodology has the better precision in both individually detecting users\222 interest changes and address evolving nature of user interests. If a system is not aware of all interests of user its prediction will be poor As future work, we intend to evaluate our methodology using other data set. Since the timeframe size has significant impact on the performance of our algorithm, it can be useful to employ heuristics methods to adapt its value for each customer Also, we decide to use a time window like [18  to  c o n s id e r  only recent profile of users instead of considering all their profile in making prediction, and apply adaption mechanism to adapt the size of window R EFERENCES  1  M.H.
