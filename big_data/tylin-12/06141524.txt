  New Application of Association Rules in Teaching Evaluation System  Lanfang Lou, Qingxian Pan, Xiuqin Qiu Institute of Computer Science and Technology, Yantai University Yantai, China, 264006 Loulanfang@126.COM pqx@ytu.edu.cn  Abstract Data mining is the process of finding correlations or patterns among dozens of fields in large relational databases In this paper we propose a novel association rules for data mining to improve the famous algorithm Apriori. The proposed approach uses the intersection operation to generate frequent item sets. It is different from the existing algorithm as it scans the database only one time and then uses the database to mine association rules. The proposed technique has been implemented in a teaching evaluation system, to enhance the foundation in performance evaluation for staff in teaching issues Keyword-data dining, association rules; Apriori algorithm teaching evaluation I   I NTRODUCTION  Data mining is a kind of process of decision support. It gets the potential and useful information and acknowledges from practical application data which is large, incomplete noisy, ambiguous and random. Data mining relates to extracting a large of data from database, transforming analyzing and modeling handling these data, and withdrawing the critical data to aid decision making. Mining association rules is an important issue in data mining R Agrawal et al in 1993 proposed the famous the Apriori algorithm based on frequent item set [2, 3 th en the m o s t  algorithms are all based on the basic algorithm for improvements or derivative variant of  the algorithm [4 , 5  An improved association rule is proposed in this paper which uses the intersection operation to generate frequent item sets. The method can be easily realized using SQL language, which lays the basis of enhancing the performance of mining algorithm based on association rules This algorithm only needs to scan the database one time and then uses it to mine association rules in teaching evaluation system, which provides effective foundation to the scientificity of the teaching evaluation II  DATA  MINING  ANALYSIS  METHOD  BASED  ON  ASSOCIATIONRULE A  Association Rules The mining of association rules is the important research direction of data mining area. Association rules reflect the inherent correlation among data. To find the inherent correlation of data is helpful to maker to make correct and reasonable decision. Association rules model belongs to description model, and using the algorithm to find association rules belongs to unsupervised learning methods The data mining of association can be formal described, as shown in the follows Let I={i1, i2,ƒ, im}, which is a collection consisting of of m different items. Given a transaction database D, and among it, every transaction T is a collection of a group items of I, namely T I, T has the unique identifier TID. An association rule is an implication formula such as X=>Y and X I, Y I, XY=. The conditions of association rules to set up are It has the support degree S, namely at least there are S transactions in transaction database which contain X Y  It has confidence level C, namely in all the transactions containing X of transaction database D, there are at least C% transactions which contain Y too The basic task of association rules is to mine the strong rules \(rules with high support degree and confidence level which are called strong rules\t mining association rules can be divided into two phases [6   1  m i ning bi g ite m  collection, the transaction support degree S is higher than the pre-determined minimum threshold item. \(2\ using big item collection to produce the association rules whose confidence level C is higher than the pre-determined minimum threshold item in the database. The whole performance of mining association rules is decided by the first phase. After determining a big item collection, the corresponding association rules can be derived. So the key to improve association rule for data mining algorithm is to effectively calculate big item collection B  Apriori Algorithm Apriori [7, 8 i s an algorith m to calc ul at e the sp eci f i c  length of item collection of the given database. Apriori calculates the frequent item sets in the database iteratively level by level, the calculation in i-th iteration provides all the i-item frequent item sets  An improved Apriori is proposed in this paper. It needs to scan the database only one time and create a logo for each data item list. The support of frequent item sets is obtained I nternational Conference on Computer and Information Application ICCIA 2010 13  C 978-1-4244-8598-7 /10/$26.00      2010 IEEE 


  by logo list intersection. This can reduce the scanning times The method can be easily realized by using SQL language III  IMPROVED  APRIORI  ALGORITHM The improved algorithm is mainly improved when generating frequent item sets. The main idea is based on the intersection operation Definition 1 Lk*Lk={p q, and p q  Lk,p.item1 q.item1,ƒ, p.itemk-1 = q.itemk-1, p.itemk<q.itemk}         \(1 When k=1, the operator expresses single connection For example :suppose L2={BC,BD},Support set of itemset {BC} is{002,003,004,006}, Support set of itemset BD} is {002,003,004,006},According to according  to definition 1 we can get L2*L2={002,003,004} without scanning database A  Description of Improved Apriori Algorithm[10  L 1 large 1-sets  L 1 is made up of itemset , tset set and support  for  k 2 Lk 1     k  do   Ck gen Lk 1  k length frequent itemsets are generated  end Answer k Lk   Function gen\(\ is Lk-1 as input, and the results can be directly generated k-item frequent item sets. Function Gen  is as follows  Function Gen Lk 1   Ck  Lk 1.Itemset Lk 1.Itemset candidates are generate according  to definition 1  Tk  Lk 1.Tset Lk 1.Tset for all candidates c   Ck  do   c support=Count c  Tk  If c support < minsup then  delete c  end  end  B  Applications We use table I as an example to illustrate the algorithm TABLE I  A SIMPLE  TRANSACTION  DATABASE Tran saction ID Itemset 001 A, C, D 002 A, B, C, D, E 003 B, C, D 004 A, B, C, F 005 D, E, F 006 B, C, D, F  This algorithm only needs to scan the database once then create the following database tables II According to table II, we can calculate the elements number of each row \(that is transaction support number then delete those itemsets whose support number are less than that of a given threshold support of items set. And thus 1-item frequent itemsets are got. In table II, itemset {E} is canceled because of its support number is 2,which is less than the given threshold TABLE II  N EW  CREATION  DATABASE  Itemset Support Set A  001,002,004  B  002,003,004,006  C  001,002,003,004,006  D  001,002,003,005,006  E  002,005  F  004,005,006  According to the one length of large itemsets, support set of itemset uses intersection operation between each other and calculate the row number of elements, then delete those whose support are less than a given threshold support of items set. And two length of large itemsets are got TABLE III  O NE LENGTH OF LARGE ITEM SETS  Itemset Support Set Support A  001,002,004  3 B  002,003,004,006  4 C  001,002,003,004,006  5 D  001,002,003,005,006  5 F  004,005,006  3 TABLE IV  T WO  LENGTH  OF  LARGE ITEMSETS  Itemset Support Set Support A,C  001,002,004  3 B,C  002,003,004,006  4 B,D  002,003,006  3 C,D  001,002,003 006  4 According to the two length of large itemsets, we can get three length of large itemsets TABLE V  T HREE  LENGTH  OF  LARGE  ITEM SETS  Itemset Support Set Support B,C,D  002,003 006  3 There is only one three length of large item sets, so algorithm ends IV  THE  APPLICATION  OF  IMPROVED  ALGORITHM  IN  THE  TEACHING  EVALUATION  SYSTEM   Teaching evaluation is a process of value judgment and improvement to teaching effect and the realization degree of teaching target according to the teaching target and teaching I nternational Conference on Computer and Information Application ICCIA 2010 14 


  standards. Ever since a long time, the evaluation of teacher works only focused on quantity, not on quality, which leaded to unscientific evaluation and quantification. There are important theory meaning and practical application value to enhance teachers level and teaching quality, promote the development of education that how to scientifically accurately, objectively evaluate the teaching effect of teachers In database, the original data of students evaluation on 2007-2008 spring semesters teaching is shown in table VI In data table, there are part of the data of student evaluation on teaching.

Through the feedback and investigation of 968 teaching evaluation results of 20072008 autumn semester, the method of evaluation teaching has been approved by all teachers, which proves the method is valid  I nternational Conference on Computer and Information Application ICCIA 2010 15

The transact  number  is 1000, the item number is 11, and the ATL \(the average transaction length\ 2.8. We analyzed the privacy protection with minimum support of 3 and the following table shows the privacy protection intensity of the minimum support of 3 with different values of randomized algorithm parameters for different T ABLE 7  I NTENSITY OF PRIVACY PROTECTION   The Fig.2 shows the average itemset error of SRRCR method and MASK method, and states the relationships between the random parameter, the data privacy intensity and the accuracy of mining results  Fig. 2 Average itemsets error of SRRCR method and MASK method As can be seen, MASK method has wide error by comparison. When the P is close to 0 or 1, the mining results is more accurate, but the intensity of privacy protection is poor. When the value of P gradually approaches 0.5, privacy protection intensity has been improved, but the accuracy of mining results will be significantly decreased. Error changes of the method SRRCR proposed in this paper is relatively stable, according to the P value that is, when the proportion of real data vary from 0 to 1, the privacy damage coefficient will increased from 0 to 1 simultaneously, so it lead to the decrease of the intensity of privacy protection, and continuously improve the accuracy of mining results VI  C ONCLUSIONS  Privacy preserving in web data mining has arisen worldwide concerns with the promotion of network technology and the demand of application. But there are many drawbacks and open questions In this paper, we have presented a method for privacy preserving mining of association rules based on web usage mining. First, we gave the general framework for mining association rules in the web usage mining, generated session sets by exploring user sessions and transfer session sets to relation two-dimension table. Second, we proposed secondary random response column replacement SRRCR\, a simple and effective privacy preserving algorithm, and achieve privacy protection association rule mining based on SRRCR. Finally we presented experimental results that validated the algorithm \(SRRCR\ in practice by simulation In the future, we will enhance the efficiency of mining algorithm further by parallelization and other methods, and combine  SRRCR with other privacy preserving ways to achieve more significant improvements in terms of privacy, accuracy efficiency, and applicability A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The study is funded by key project of Shanghai Scientific Committee, subject number 08dz1204802 R EFERENCES  1  Rizvi SJ, Haritsa JR.

classi“er in order to identify the nature of the request normal or abnormal based on the normal usage pro“le maintained previously Since we used a passive anomaly detector in terms of response action the result of the classi“cation is recorded in the anomaly log database using the ResponseM anager module V R ELATED W ORK A paradigmatic example for how to do host-based IDSs approach is presented in If the system call traces of normal applications are self-similar then it is straightforward to build an IDS that allows to learn the normal behavior of applications and recognizes possible attacks by looking for abnormalities For learning the IDS gathers system call traces from times when the system is not under attack extracts all sub-traces containing consecutive system calls and creates a database of these observed sub-traces which in turn are deemed anomalous if it does not appear within the database In the monitoring the abnormality of a new system call trace is measured by counting how many anomalous sub-traces it contains A process mining framework that utilizes the concept of clinical pathways to facilitate the automatic and systematic construction of an adaptable and extensible detection model is presented in The authors took a data-centric point of view and considered healthcare fraud and abuse detection as a data analysis process This automatic approach eliminates the need to manually analyze and encode behavior patterns as well as the guesswork in selecting statistics measures The proposed framework was evaluated via real-world data to demonstrate its ef“ciency and accuracy In the authors presented a more-rob ust anomaly detection IDS using data mining techniques The techniques are designed to dynamically model what a normal network should look like at the same time aimed to reduce the false positive and false negative alarm rates in the process Moreover the authors used classi“cation-tree techniques to accurately predict probable attack sessions Overall their goal is to model network traf“c into network sessions and identify those network sessions that have a high-probability of being an attack Various work have been going on mining audit data for IDSs In this area the work closest in spirit to ours can be found in where the authors describes a n o v e l framework name MADAM ID for mining audit data in order to construct models automatically for the intrusion detection The framework compute activity patterns from system audit data and extracts predictive features from the patterns It then applies machine learning algorithms to the audit records that are processed according to the feature de“nitions to generate detection rules Past results on the DARPA ID Evaluation showed that their ID model was one of the best performing of all the participating systems The related works described also several other works in IDSs use several techniques such as machine learning state-machine abstraction process mining and even data mining Our work is not aimed at advancing such approaches Rather it tailors host-based anomaly modeling and detection technique to pervasive healthcare systems and the use of data mining is traced back to the beauty of data mining techniques in extracting patterns from large dataset In this regard pervasive healthcare systems are immediate candidates for data intensive domain We also pointed out that there is lack of tool-support for anomaly-based intrusion detection of pervasive healthcare systems To this end the anomaly detection model and the prototype implementation could help as springboard for the attempt in alleviating tool-support for intrusion detection of pervasive healthcare systems VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we described constructing anomaly detection model based on data mining techniques in a medical pervasive environment for legitimate users Due to the sensitiveness of medical records it must protect medical records both from outsiders and insiders who try to abuse their privileges What we can conclude from this work is that maintaining user activity information for intrusion detection can enhance the role played by the proposed model in protecting a pervasive healthcare system from insider attacks Moreover we demonstrated the algorithmic detail showing the way to accomplish this through maintaining associations between selected attributes to represent normalcy which is required for classi“cation purpose Finally we described the prototype implementation of the proposed model and discussed the results of evaluation Even though we proved that the algorithms devised in the anomaly detection work in practice the evaluation of algorithmic ef“ciency issues are left as future work The rules generated from a limited number of dataset are very large in number In order to identify an activity as anomalous the data structures used to maintain the rules resides in memory Consequently the speed of the classi“er is boosted at a cost of more memory consumption Another line of future work is to monitor a larger data set to determine the ef“ciency pattern as the data set size get larger As described in the proposed anomaly detection model we only used the association rule and classi“cation based on association techniques Nevertheless for better detection capabilities it is also advisable to include the sequence analysis technique This is basically because anomalous activities are also hugely manifested in some sequential pattern R EFERENCES  E Bardram The T rouble with Login On Usability and Computer

   C4.2 Open GL has excellent documentation that could help the developer learn the platform with ease C4.3 Developer has very little ex perience in working with Open GL platform  For our case study, alternative B i.e. Adobe Director was the most favorable alternative amongst all the three. It catered to the reusability criteria quite well and aimed at meeting most of the desired operational requirements for the system   6. CONCLUSION & FUTURE WORK  The main contribution of this paper is to develop an approach for evaluating performance scores in MultiCriteria decision making using an intelligent computational argumentation network. The evaluation process requires us to identify performance scores in multi criteria decision making which are not obtained objectively and quantify the same by providing a strong rationale. In this way, deeper analysis can be achieved in reducing the uncertainty problem involved in Multi Criteria decision paradigm. As a part of our future work we plan on conducting a large scale empirical analysis of the argumentation system to validate its effectiveness   REFERENCES  1  L  P Am g o u d  U sin g  A r g u men ts f o r mak i n g an d  ex p lain in g  decisions Artificial Intelligence 173 413-436, \(2009 2 A  Boch m a n   C ollectiv e A r g u men tatio n    Proceedings of the Workshop on Non-Monotonic Reasoning 2002 3 G  R Bu y u k o zk an  Ev alu a tio n o f sof tware d e v e lo p m en t  projects using a fuzzy multi-criteria decision approach Mathematics and Computers in Simualtion 77 464-475, \(2008 4 M T  Chen   F u zzy MCD M A p p r o ach t o Selec t Serv ice  Provider The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy 2003 5 J.
