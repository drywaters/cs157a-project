It 
was designed to support the reliability of data transfer It  has been proved to be remarkably successful in the Internet H owever, it is not suitable  in HBDP  network environme nt because of its  AIMD\(Additive Increase Multiplicative Decrease\ congestion control mechanism  which is inherently not able to effectively utilize a given available bandwidth 1     Several UDP based researches have been tried to overcome TCP transfer rate limitation in HBDP network environment These protocols include SAUBL Simple Available Bandwidth Utilization  Library 3 RBUDP Reliable Blast UDP 4  T husnami PAU DP Performance Adaptive UDP 5 UDT  UDP based Data Transfer 6  UDP based protocols  make use of UDP protocol and add a supportive congestion control 
algorithm in application layer functioning such as TCP 222 s reliable data transfer In addition, t hese use a rate congestion control which  update s  the packet sending  period every constant inter val   if the packets are transmitted to a receiver without any packet loss, then one ACK  is delivered from the receiver These UDP based protocols show significantly outstanding performance than that of TCP   and are generally considered as an  alternative  da ta transfer means for  HBDP network environment  On the other  hand the specifications  of host system have been also developing to maximize the data transfer rate   Above all, the advance of microprocessor  plays a big role to process the work I n 7   au th o rs proposed a new transport method which utilizes multiple parallel UDP connections to take 
advantage of the full power of multicore processors With this  it is possible to process incoming packets more efficiently so it is  resulting in a good performanc e H owever most of parallel based approaches including the above work  simply presented a theoretical  model in the  restricted network  environments As a result, the efforts to find out the number of optimum  parallel channels is based on empirical  simulatio n results In order t o utilize  UDP based parallel data transfer more efficiently, it needs a more sophisticate  mechanism to control  the number of channels according to its  network status  In other words, the sender which finally decides the number of  optim um channels  should be considered with network environment 
parameters  including network congesti on, data transfer distance  and  host system  specifications   In this paper, we pro pose an adaptive channel number  tuning algorithm  which effectively reflects  net work status W e implemented a parallel transfer protocol based on UDT library w hich is the  most commonly used UDP based data transfer protocol. The main function is to implement a management module of multi thread which  transmit s  packets simultaneously Th en  a supportive function is provided  to tune these multi connections  with the network status that is   RTT  RTT can be mainly classified  into two folders O ne is based on the  data transfer distance, which it is proportionally  increased as far as the  dista 
nce  from sender and the receiver  T he other is to reflect the  network congestion  which is more comprehensive because it  i s  influenced by numerous n etwork parameter s To do this, we firstly conduct a theoretical analysis  to investigate the impact of data tr ansfer distance on the number of parallel channels   and present  an  equation. Then, we suggest  an Jongseon Park, Dosik An, and Gihwan Cho 206  Div. of Computer Science and Engineering  Chonbuk National University  Jeonju, S.

adaptive tuning algorithm to finally decide the optimum number of channel s  which effectively  the  network status   The rest of the document is organized as fo llow  Chapter II describes the parallel UDT transfer protocol. In  chapter III  we propose  an adaptive tuning mechanism to decide  the optimum number of parallel data channels  Chapter IV  presents  the simulation  result s  and chapter V  concludes the study  II P AR ALLEL UDT  P ROTOCOL  UDT is originally planned to make up the poor performance of TCP. The most primary lure of this is that users are able to implement additional  function s  to facilitate data transfer rate. Also, the congestion control algorithm can be easi ly adjusted  with c onsidering its network environments 10   It is well known that p arallel transfer improves data transfer rate by transmitting a data aggressively  using  multi channel s  As a result it make s  the a data transfer tool  to utilize maximum avai lable network link capac ity given by a high speed network   9    In this paper we consider a parallel U D T which i m plements the parallel transfer technique to make its  data transfer rate more outstanding. In the case of using single channel the sender  has to wait for ACK to transmit next packet On the other hand  with  multi channel s  it  can have a m ore better  chance to transmit packets continuously to different channels As a re sult, the amount of packets to be transmitted wi ll be increased for a given time than that of single  channel  Fig. 1 s hows a conceptual  architecture of proposed parallel UDT  As shown  in Fig. 1 data is transmitted  from the sender to the receiver In addition control channel and data ch annel are differ entiated respectively to stability of data transfer D ata moves from the sender to the receiver along the solid line   and control information  is handed from the receiver to the sender along the doted lin e  UDT only takes charge of transmitting packets  thro ugh each channel  So, we additively implement  a  supportive function to manage  multiple control information  through the TCP File block manager functions to control  data blocks to be transmitted from disk and verifies the sequence number of blocks I n the s ender, it loads data blocks from disk into the send buffer   and the loaded blocks are transmitted from the sender to the receiver through each connections I n receiver  data blocks incoming  through each channel s arriv es  and moves into the receive buffer. T hen, file block manager checks the sequence number of incoming blocks and verifies  it I f there are  no data losses the data blocks are forwarded into  the disk and control information  is handed to a sender  A mong these control information the auto tuner e xtracts RTT and utilizes  it to decide the optimum number  of parallel channels I n chapter III, we discuss it in more detail  in  term of adaptive channel number  tuning mechanism       III A DAPTIVE C HANNEL N UMBER  T UNING MECHANISM  In implement ing  the parallel d ata transfer protocol  the  most important thing is to decide optimum number of channels  It  basically  needs to be presented  with suitable theoretical  models I f appropriate parallel connections  are created, the performance will be proportionally increased alongside the number of channels so it results in efficiently utilizing available bandwidth However in the case of congested network environment, it may lead  to  consecutive data losses  resulting  in a poor performance RTT is the most significant network  environment parameter to estimate network status which can be summarized  as follow    D ata transfer distance T he RTT ca n range from a few milliseconds thousandths of a second\ under ideal conditions between closely spaced points to several seconds unde r adverse conditions between points separated by a large distance  N etwork congestion  W hen network status is congested with many packets in a bottleneck link, the data rate of a  flow is limited in delay. So, in this case, measured RTT value will be larger  than that of normal  H ost system specification  The system specification is another key component  to delay data transfer  With a good host  specification, packets incoming into a receive buffer are processed more efficiently   When the  sender decides  the number of optimum channels it can consider RTT from the receiver which is  influenced  with the above network environment parameters O ur  work starts to firstly conduct a theoretical analysis to investigate the impact of data transfer distance  A Theori tical Channel Prediction Model   HBDP is commonly known as a long fat network it  i s  more useful to utilize the parallel technique. BDP  refers to the product of a data link capacity\(bandwidth\ and its  delay\(RTT/2 which is presented as the below equation   Delay Bandwidth BDP  A s a result, an amount of packets to be transmitted is equivalent  to the maximum amount of data on the network link at any given time So, parallel based transfer  in HBDP can be really helpful  to maximize its  transfer rate  To the oretical  analysis according to the RTT, we organize  a  real network environment as shown in Fig. 2 Data is transmitted from host1 to host  2 ~ host  4, and all hosts are connected to each other with 1Gbps network link capacity  N etwork emulator WANem    lo cates between host1   Figure 1  Concetual  architecture of the parallel UDT  347 


and switch to intentionally  modif y  of RTT The experimental  results  are  aggregated in a specified RTT section from 1.5ms to 400ms  Along with this the number of channels is changed from 1 to 20 in each RTT section  A ll host system s  are  equipped  with different system specifications which are  summarized as shown in Table  I  For each file transfer, we have done at least 20 times and calculated their  aver age throughput             T ABLE  I  H OST S YSTEM S PECIFICATIONS   Host 1  Xeon 2.83  8 GB  Ubuntu 10.04  Host 2  i5 760  4 GB  Ubuntu 10.04  Host 3  i5 650  4 GB  Ubuntu 10.04  Host 4  i5 2500  8 GB  Ubuntu 10.04   TABLE I I  presents an optimum channel number which show s  the highest data transfer rate  in each host according to RTT  respecti vely   With  T able  II we found out  that the number of parallel channels is increase d  proportionally  as RTT is getting bigger. Especially a  great change is shown from 1.5 ms  to 50ms than that of any o ther RTT section s  We can confirm  that the parallel techni que is more effective in this RTT section. In other RTT section s  its  change is a little bit  moderate   T ABLE  II  O PTIMUM C HANNEL N UMBER S HOWING T HE H IGHEST T RANSFER R ATE I N E ACH H OST     1.5  6  5  5  50  11  12  11  100  12  12  13  150  133  14  14  200  14  14  15  250  15  15  15  300  16  16  16  350  17  18  17  400  17  18  17   Based on the  above analysis, we know the number of parallel channels increases proportionally  with RTT in different hosts  W ith this fact, we propose a theoretical  ch annel p rediction model  to optimum data transfer  rate  according to the RTT  change  without considering any packet losses and network congestion   Therefore we present a mathematical  equation reflecting its  correlation  between the number of parallel channels and RT T A  r egression analysis  is a commonly useful method to present a theoretical approach based on the actual testing results. Through the results of T able II  we can estim ate increasing aspect in  ph ase of each RTT section s For example, the increasing amount  of channels in each  RTT section s  appears curvilinear for all hosts. In this case logarithmic based  approach to make equation is suitable General  logarithmic based  equation is r epresented as below   b x a y  ln  x  represents the independent var iable and y  the dependent variable And, the  coefficients a, b  are calculated by using the method of least squares  Based on the measured results of Table II, we can easily extract the equations for all hosts respectively as shown below  4046  4  ln 9894  1   2 rtt ch host  3147  4  ln 0326  2   3 rtt ch host  4046  4  ln 1894  1   4 rtt ch host  I n these equations, the number of channels host i ch is determined depending on RTT  To get the final equation  named OPCN  Optimum Parallel Channel Number  we calculat e  the average of all equations  and present it as shown below  3746  4  ln 0038  2 rtt OPCN  T o verification of this equation, we input RTT from 1.5ms to 400ms in order T able III shows calculated results  by using this equation  where all values are  a rounding  value   T ABLE  III  OPCN  C ALCULA TED  B Y  T HE E QUATION   1.5  5  50  12  100  13  150  14  200  15  250  15  300  16  350  16  400  16   From the results of  TABLE I II  an optimum  channel number  in  RTT section from 1.5 ms  to  50ms is increased abruptly comparing with any other RTT section s In other RTT section s  its  chang e  is more moderate. This shows that the theoretical  channel prediction model  has an equivalent result  with comparing the experimental results in  TABLE I I So, we believe our modeling is valuable  enough to use it as a theor etical  equation  B Adaptive Channe l   Tuning Mechanism  W e make use of the equation presented above as a prediction model to decide the number of channels according  to the RTT   This  equation should  be adaptively tune d further  with considering the network statu s    Figure 2 Network environment to  theor etical  analysis according  to RTT  348 


The  optimum number of channels is based solely on RTT So it is the first stage to measure current RTT before creat ing a  channel  In Fig 1  an auto tuner module provides some function s  to create new connection s  and takes  over the information that  is a current  RTT measured by the receiver Based on this information the sender can  finally decide the optimum parallel data channels    C H N c u r    S T A R T R T T  m e a s u r e R T T m i n  R T T c u r R T T c u r    R T T p r e C H N    O P C N   R T T m i n  R T T d i f f     R T T c u r 226  R T T p r e  c o n f i x    1 R T T m i n    m i n  R T T t i   205    R T T t  c o n f i x    0 c o n f i x    0 R T T m i n    R T T c u r E N D R T T p r e    R T T c u r C H N c u r    C H N  t h r e R T T d i f f    C H N c u r    C H N t h r e C H N c u r  c o n f i x    Figure 3  The adaptive channel number tuning mechanism   Fig 3 shows t he adaptive channel number tuning mechanism  with considering distance and network congestion It can be explained as follow  1 Upon arrival  of  control packet including current RTT measu re d by the receiver the sender compares it with minimum RTT w hich is a originally user defined value In the first stage, current RTT is decided as a mimimum RTT. It goes d i rectly to the OPCN RTTmin stage and decides the number of channels and substitutes RTTpre  with RTTcur otherwise goes to step 2   2 I f RTT min   RT T cur calculates RTT diff  which is a n  absolute value as  RTT cur 226 RTT pre We consider  that the  network status is sometimes very irregular   and make use of a  threshold  to compare it with RTT diff If RTT diff  value is bigger  than  network congestion is  considered to be temporal O therwise, network cong estion last for a lon g  time and fixed I f RTT diff    the confix that stand s consgestion fix increaments count  is incr eased by 1 and goes to step 3, otherwise sets the confix value with 0 and goes step 4  3 C ompares the  confix value with  I f it exceeds the  extracts a new minimum RTT among previous RTTs otherwise goes to step 4. Then, goes to OPCN RTT min  and decides an optimum channel number  4 C ompares current RTT with previous RTT. According to this result whether the number of channels increases or not is decided I f RTT cur   RTT pre the number of current channels is  increased because it means that the current netwo rk status more favorable than previous O therwise goes to step 5 It is needed  to  regulate the number of channels to be increased. If it is exceed ed  the threshold maintains the previous channel number  5 This situation means that current network status is m ore congested than previous, which  decreases the number of current channels  W e summarized this channel number tuning mechanism as a simple pseudo  co de  as follow   Pseudocode1 : auto tuner  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  Parameter auto tuner  RTT cur RTT measure  If RTT min is smaller than RTT cur  RTT diff absolute RTT cur  RTT pre   If RTT diff is smaller than  confix 1  If confix is larger  than  RTT min minimum RTT t 1  205  RTT t   CHN OPCN RTT min   confix 0  Otherwise  If RTT cur is smaller than RTT pre  If CHN cur is smaller than CHN maxinc  CHN  channel is increase  Otherwise  If CHN cur is large r than CHN maxinc  CHN  channel is decrease  Otherwise  confix 0  If RTT cur is smaller than RTT pre  If CHN cur is smaller than CHN maxinc  CHN  channel is increase  Otherwise  If CHN cur is larger than CHN maxinc  CHN  channel is decrease  Otherwi se  RTT min  RTT cur   CHN OPCN RTT min   confix 0  RTT pre  RTT cur   Return CHN    349 


IV P ERFORMANCE  E VALUATION  F or validating the proposed method  we make use of  the  re al network environment shown in Fig 2   The  proposed method  is compared with the UDT\(versi on 4.7  and  parallel TCP over a local link  The proposed method is test ed in two cases  o ne is a parallel UDT based on OPCN and the other is an adaptive  channel number tu n ing of parallel UDT\(ACT parallel UDT  Two  host system s is identically equipped with l  Gigabit NIC   i5 76 0 processor, 4  GByte of RAM and U b untu 10.04  operating system  WANem is used to intentionally modify  RTT which is changed from 1ms to 400ms   The fi le size used is 4  G b yte  and  a ll experiment s  are performed 20 times to get average throug hputs      Figure 4  Throughput comparison with jitter 20   Figure 5  Throughput comparison with jitter 40  Fig 4  presents an  experiment al  result  measured in each RTT section, which jitter is used to inte ntionally modify RTT  much like as a  real network environment. In this  experiment jitter  is set  with 20% of original RTT For example, it will be randomly changed from 100ms to 120ms in the case of 100ms RTT section. All protocols show high transfer rate i n low RTT section In  TCP the data  transfer rate is dramatically decreased as RTT is increase d  It is well known that  this is caused by AIMD congestion control algorit hm of TCP Single UDT is more rigorous  than that of TCP in each RTT section. Most of UDP based data transfer protocols including UDT show high  transfer rate in HBDP with benefit of  its rate based congestion control The Parallel UDT shows high er  data  transfer rate as RTT increases T his confirms that parallel based data transfer is really hel pful in HBDP network The ACT Parallel UDT  which includes an adaptive  channel number tu n ing  shows the highest data transfer  rate than that of the  other protocols, but a little bit higher than that of the P arallel UDT   Fig 5  is a experiment al  res ults measured  in same environment   but the jitter is changed to 40 T he result shows nearly the same but  there are  some difference s  between P arallel UDT and ACT P arallel UDT. As RTT increases, ACT parallel UDT  shows  high performance  than that of P arallel  UDT With this we can confirm  that ACT P arallel UDT shows 644%, 135%, 7% improvement than that of TCP, single UDT and parallel UDT respectively  V C ONCLUSION  Utilizing multiple connection s  in HBDP network is really helpful to efficiently utilize available  bandwidth. But, i t is a critical  issue to decide the number of optimum channels according to network environment variation  Most existing researches on parallel based data transfer analyzed  it depending on empirical  methods. In this paper, we proposed an adaptive channel number tuning mechanism. T o do this, we firstly conduct ed  a theoretical analysis to investigate the impact of data transfer distance on the number of parallel channels and formalized  the result into  an equation  Based on this result an ad aptive channel number tuning mechanism  is proposed   The performance superiority of proposed method was verified by the experiment al  results measured in a real network environment. For the future work, we are going to keep elaborating  the proposed  method w ith  taking account of local host system   R EFERENCES   J   Edmonds 223 O n t he c ompetitiveness of AIMD TCP w ithin a  g eneral n etwork,\224 Theoretical Computer Science Vol. 462, pp. 12 22, 2012   P.

Fig 6 Number of Disk Accesses and number of similarity calculation on query execution on database fragments of different sizes a distance radius equal to 50 of a given image takes around 1,200 seconds using the Slim-tree for the respective fragment and 18,577 seconds using the Slim-tree for the entire database On the other hand the query to retrieve images annotated with the tag value chamberlains just 2 images and within the same distance radius of 50 from a given image takes less than 1 second using the respective fragment and 12,514 seconds using the Slim-tree index for the entire database Finally Figure 7 presents the results of a conjunctive complex query with the equality predicate tag  puppy and a kN N q predicate with the center in the image presented in the top left corner highlighted by the red square These 4 images are ranked in the results from left to right and from top to bottom The execution of this query using the fragment referring to the tag puppy  which contains the descriptions of 105,570 images took 108 seconds using a B-tree to 002nd the fragment and a Slim-tree to process the similarity-based predicate in the contents of this fragment As the kN N predicate is not commutative with other predicates for data 002ltering we sho w in Figure 8 the results of a query by a Range q predicate with radius 50 and center in the image on the top left corner These results were produced by using a Slim-tree that indexes the entire database This query took 13,176 seconds to execute Filtering these results for the tag value puppy to produce the result showed in Figure 7 would require further processing but the time to solve the Range q predicate on the Slim-tree that indexes the entire database contents is dominant VI C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK This paper introduces an approach for ef\002ciently processing queries on big complex databases by using horizontal fragments of the database and multi-level indexing This approach has three steps i 002nd fragments with data satisfying some query predicate\(s ii 002lter the data in the chosen fragment\(s according to other predicate\(s conjunctively connected to the former iii compose the results obtained from each fragment The experimental results demonstrate that this proposal drastically improve query execution speed They show that it is not viable to run the similarity-based predicates over the Fig 7 Results of a conjunctive query executed by using the fragment that describes only images tagged with puppy Fig 8 Results of a Range q predicate on the entire database that took almost 100 times longer to produce than those in Figure 7 entire CoPhIR database that describes around 106 million images even using the Slim-tree metric index to speedup the execution of similarity-based predicates on image content descriptors In fact even big fragments describing more than a 100 thousand images approximately need to be further fragmented to ensure acceptable response time Though the case study presented in this paper only considers conjunctive queries with an equality predicate and a similarity-based predicate the proposed approach can be employed for ef\002cient execution of queries with arbitrary numbers of predicates of various kinds and logically connected in different ways In fact our approach opens new research paths towards ef\002cient query execution on big complex data Among the challenges involved in the full exploitation of the proposed approach we mention the following ones for future work i develop automatic techniques to create appropriate horizontal fragments of large databases for ef\002cient query execution ii index fragment collections to ef\002ciently 002nd fragments suitable to solve different kinds of predicates iii devise and validate queries optimization techniques that exploit appropriate database fragments and access methods VII A CKNOWLEDGMENTS Thanks to CNPq CAPES FEESC and FAPESP for their 002nancial support

 From Figure 8 we can see that, when data size increases the performance of CSA-DSD decreases rapidly while the performance of IOT-StatisticDB is relatively stable. The main reason is that in CS A-DSD, large volumes of statistical raw data needs to be transferred to and stored at the master server for statistical analysis. Therefore, the query response time is prop ortional to the whole data size On the other hand, in IOT-StatisticDB, the main workload is distributed among the nod e servers, so that the overall performance is less sensitiv e to the overall data size To better analysis how the statistical analysis workload is shared by multiple node servers in IOT-StatisticDB, we define the speedup rate 60 100 140 180 220 2.85 3.05 3.71 3.81 3.73 19.25 21 22.36 22.5 21.85 We can observe from Table 3 that when the number of node servers is 4, the speedup rate is between 2.85~3.81 and when the number of node servers is increased to 32, the speedup rate is between 19.25~22.36. In general, with the number of node servers incr easing, the query response time decreases, since in IOT-StatisticDB, the query response time is main decided by the da ta size of each node server V C ONCLUSIONS  Statistical analysis on sensor sampling data is one of the most important procedures in IoT systems to transform dataŽ into knowledgeŽ. In this paper, we propose a

Table 3 shows th e speedup rate of  IOT-StatisticDB The main contribution is as follows 1\general statistical database cluster mechanism is proposed, with data typ es and operators for statistical analyzing provided. The mechanism is a general model which can support complicated statistical queries through standard SQL statements 2 methods, including Euclidean-based spatial aggregation, Network-based spatial aggregation, Euclidean-based parameter aggregation, and Network-based parameter aggregation, are proposed with detailed algorithms presented 3\he parallel processing techniques of statistical queries are proposed, so that multiple servers can conduct statistical analysis in parallel and the performance can be greatly improved As the future work, event detections and data mining techniques based on IoT statistical analysis will be studied A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  The work was partially supported by National Natural Science Foundation of Chin a \(NSFC\under grant number 91124001 and by National High-Tech.

messages seen for all workers in a superstep \(Figures 10 and 13\. When looking at the messages sent by workers in a superstep for METIS, we see that there are message load imbalances within work ers in a superstep, caused due to concentration of vertices being traversed in that superstep in certain partitions This variability is much more pronounced in CP as compared to WG \(Figures 11 and 14\ E.g. in superstep 9 for CP, twice as many messages \(4M\ are generated by a worker compared to another \(2M\.  For Pregel BSP, the time taken in a superstep is determined by the slowest worker in that superstep. Hence increase d variability in CP causes even goodŽ partitioning strategies to cause an increase in total execution time wh en using the Pregel/BSP model VIII A NALYSIS OF E LASTIC C LOUD S CALING  Cloud environments offer elasticity … the ability to scale-out or scale-in VMs on-demand and only pay for what one uses [28   On th e f l i p s i de  on e en ds u p  paying for VMs that are acquired even if they are underutilized. We have already shown the high variation in compute/memory resources used by algorithms like BC and APSP across different supersteps. While our earlier swath initiation heuristics attempt to flatten these out by overlapping swath executions, one can consider leveraging the clouds elasticity to, instead, scale up and down the concurrent workers \(and graph partitions\ allocated in each superstep The peak and trough nature of resource utilization combined with Pregel/BSPs synchronous barrier between supersteps offers a window for dynamic scaleout and …in at superstep boundaries. Peak supersteps can greatly benefit from additional workers, while those same workers will contribute to added synchronization overhead for trough supersteps We offer an analysis of the potential benefits of elastic scaling by extrapolating from observed results for running BC on WG and CP graphs, using four and eight workers.  To provide a fair and focused comparison, we turned off swath heuristics in favor of fixed swath sizes and initiation intervals Figure 15 \(Bottom\ plots the speedup of BC running on eight workers when normalized to BC running on four workers, at corresponding supersteps.  The number of workers does not impact the number of supersteps We also plot the number of active vertices \(i.e. vertices still computing for a given swath\these supersteps which is a measure of how much work is required \(Fig 15 \(Top\. We find that we occasionally get superlinear speedup spikes \(i.e. >2x\ that shows a strong correlation with the peaks of active messages, for both WG and CP graphs. At other times, the sp eedup is sublinear or even a speed-down \(i.e. <1\responding to inactive vertices.  The superlinear speedup is attributable to the lower contention and reduced memory pressure for 8 workers when the active vertices peak \(similar to what we observed for the swath initiation heuristics Similarly, the below par speedup during periods of low activity is contributed by the increased overhead of barrier synchronization across 8 workers. Intuitively, by dynamically scaling up the number of workers for supersteps with peaking active vertices and scaling them down otherwise, we can leverage the superlinear speedup and get more value per worker Using a threshold of 50% active vertices as the threshold condition for between 4 and 8 workers in a superstep, we extrapolate the time per superstep and compared this to the fixed 4 and 8 worker runtimes. We also compute the best-case run time using an oracleŽ approach to i.e. for each superstep, we pick the minimum of the 4 or 8 workers time.  Note that these projections do not yet consider the overheads of scaling, but are rather used to estimate the potential upside if we had an ideal or an automated heuristic for scaling. The total time estimates for running BC on WG and CP graphs, normalized to  
 plot shows speedup of 8 workers relative to 4 workers, for each superstep, when running BC on WG and CP graphs plot shows the number of vertices active in that superstep Estimated time for BC using elastic scaling, normalized to time taken for 4 workers. Normalized cost is shown on secondary Y axis WG graph shown on left CP graph shown on right. Smaller is better

observed time taken using 4 workers, are plotted in Figures 16\(A\ and 16\(B We see that our dynamic scaling heuristic using the percentage of active vertices achieves nearly the same CP\ or better \(WG\ performance as a fixed 8 worker approach. Clearly there is benefit of using fewer workers for low utilization su persteps to eliminate the barrier synchronization overhead. Also, the dynamic scaling heuristic performs almost as well as the ideal scaling. Finally, when we consider the monetary cost of the proposed approaches, assuming a pro-rata normalized cost per VM-second plotted on the secondary Y axis, we see that dynamic scaling is comparable \(CP\ or cheaper \(WG\ than a 4 worker scenario while offering the performance of an 8 worker deployment IX C ONCLUSION  In conclusion, we introduce optimization and heuristics for controlling memory utilization and show they are critical to performance.  By breaking computation into swaths of vertices and using our sizing heuristics we achieve up to 3.5x speedup over the maximum swath size that does not cause the a failure.  In addition overlapping swath executions can provide a 24% gain with automated heuristics and even greater speedup when a priori knowledge of the network characteristics is applied This evaluation offers help to eScience users to make framework selection and cost-performancescalability trade-offs. Our he uristics are generalizable and can be leveraged by other BSP and distributed graph frameworks, and for graph applications beyond BC. Our work uncovered an unexpected impact of partitioning and it would be worthwhile, in future, to examine the ability to pred ict, given certain graph properties, a suitable partitioning model for Pregel/BSP It may also be useful to perform such evaluations on larger graphs and more numbers of VMs. At the same time, it is also worth considering if non-linear graph algorithms are tractable in pr actice for large graphs in a distributed environment B IBLIOGRAPHY  1  F  L i lj er os C   Ed l i n g L  A m a r a l H  S t an ley   and Y    berg The web of human sexual contacts
