T his mission design enables an investigation of both spatial and  temporal effects within the radiation belts using only two o bservatories and the two year science mission allows an investig ation of all local time positions and interaction regions.  Each Observatory contains a suite of instruments to study ions, elec trons and the local magnetic and electric fields  An overview of  the RBSP mission is presented with an emphasis on the fault management system design  The goal of the RBSP fau lt management system is to be as simple as possible wh ile 1 ensuring that the observatory is capable of detecti ng correcting and recovering from any single recover able anomaly that affects the health and safety of the o bservatory and 2 the observatory meets the overall mission co ncept and mission goals  Five high-level requirements that d efine the fault management redundancy modes/safing and grou nd intervention concepts will be presented to demonstr ate that despite using a relatively simple architecture the  RBSP fault management system allows for mission goals to be me t T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  INTRODUCTION 1  1.1  Mission Summary 1  1.2  Mission and Spacecraft Overview .......... 1  2  F AULT M ANAGEMENT D ESIGN 4  2.1  FM Definition/Objectives ....................... 4  2.2  Process for FM Development ................. 4  2.3  FM Design Drivers 4  2.3.1  Orbit/Spacecraft Design ................... 5  2.3.2  Environment ..................................... 5  2.4  Overview of FM Architecture ................ 6  2.4.1  Redundancy Concept ....................... 6  2.4.2  Modes and Safing Concept .............. 7  2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept .......... 9  3  VERIFICATION 10  4  CONCLUSION 12  5  REFERENCES 12  1  INTRODUCTION 1.1  Mission Summary NASAís RBSP mission is a dual observatory mission t hat studies variations in solar activity and how this a ffects the earthís environment as well as human activities in space and on the ground.[1   T h i s  w i l l  i m p r o v e  o u r  o v e r a l l  k n owledge of the radiation belts and how they respond to sola r storms and events. Particles accelerate through the radiat ion belts in unpredictable ways and scientists need more data to develop and improve current models of this important area surrounding the Earth The on-board instruments mea sure high and low energy electrons and protons, ion comp osition and electric and magnetic fields using the Energeti c Particle Composition and Thermal Plasma Suite the Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite Proton Spectromete r Electric Field and Waves Instrument and the Ion Composition Experiment  1.2  Mission and Spacecraft Overview The RBSP mission is comprised of twin observatories  that are identically instrumented They launched stacked  together on a single launch vehicle The mission de sign provides orbits for each observatory that maximize observation time in the Van Allen radiation belts t o collect science data and space weather data  The observatories are designed to operate and survi ve in the harsh radiation belt environment using shielding fo r electronics as well as radiation hardened parts and circuitry 2   T h e  o b s e r v a t o r i e s  s p i n  a t  a  n o m i n a l  s p i n  r a t e  of 5.5 rpm to provide the fields-of-view FOV required for th e instruments to make their respective measurements  The observatories downlink an average daily data volume of 6.4 Gbits of recorded data plus real time data throug hout the operational phase of the mission  This data is rec eived by the 60 foot dish at the APL ground station each day  as the observatories pass overhead  The spacecraft launched on a single EELV Atlas V-40 1 launch vehicle from Kennedy Space Center on August 30 2012 The launch vehicle spun up released each observatory separately and oriented each observato ry with solar arrays pointed to the sun. Both observatories operate in 


   2 highly elliptical orbits in order to spend a substa ntial part of the mission life in the Van Allen radiation belts The two orbits have apogee altitudes between 30,050 and 31 250 km perigee altitudes between 500 and 675 km and incli nation of 10 degrees The observatories are phased such th at one laps the other approximately four times per year E ach observatory, as depicted in Figure 1, is designed f or an onorbit life of 2 years and 74 days. This encompasses a 60-day commissioning period post launch a 2-year science mission and a 14-day decommissioning period at end  of life Spacecraft decommissioning includes a delta-V  maneuver to lower the perigee and a precession mane uver to orient the solar arrays away from the sun each spa cecraft will be disposed of via uncontrolled atmospheric re entry within 5 months The 2-year science mission provide s sufficient local time altitude and event coverage  to improve the understanding of and determine the rel ative significance of the various mechanisms that operate  within the radiation belts and their individual and collec tive effects   Figure 1:  RBSP observatory  The observatories operate independently in a spin s tabilized mode with a 5.5 RPM nominal spin rate the spin axi s is maintained between 15 and 27 degree off pointing fr om the sun. Each observatory has four deployed solar array panels and eight deployed instrument booms Two 40 m and t wo 50 m spin plane booms provide AC and DC electric fi eld measurements two 6 m axial booms 12 m tip-to-tip  provide 3D electric field  measurements and two magnetometer booms extend an additional 2 m beyond the solar array panels. Figure 2 shows the observatory in a fully deployed configuration and Figure 3 shows the space craft bus with accommodation of the instruments and their FOVs   The observatories are nearly identical and comprise d of mechanical/structural components avionics RF telecommunications power generation and storage p ower distribution propulsion guidance and control the rmal flight software, and harness subsystems. Figure 4 s hows the observatory block diagram with the functional elem ents of the observatory and the interfaces and connectivity between the spacecraft and instrument components    Figure 2:  RBSP observatory fully deployed   Figure 3:  RBSP spacecraft bus with instrument FOVs   The mechanical subsystem includes primary and secon dary structure central cylinder and structural panels  mechanisms deployables and a separation system T he primary structure is a forged aluminum cylinder; th e panels and decks are honeycomb with aluminum facesheet wit h cutouts for booms instrument apertures power shun ts thrusters, and Sun sensors. The octagonal cylinder is 1.3 m high and 1.8 m in diameter  The guidance and control G&C subsystem consists o f a Sun sensor the science magnetometer for attitude reconstruction on the ground and blow down monopropellant hydrazine propulsion system for atti tude control, spin rate change, Delta-V, and de-orbit ma neuvers The observatories are spin-stabilized with a spin rate of approximately 5.5 RPM and a spin axis pointing towa rds the Sun The observatories have no on-board software to  estimate or control attitude or orbits therefore a ll attitude maintenance maneuvers are performed open loop Atti tude sensor information from the Sun sensors is stored o n-board the satellite and downlinked during the ground cont act periods Control maneuvers are planned on the groun d designed into canned executable sequences, uploaded to the satellite, and executed based on the planned timeli ne  


   3  Figure 4:  Observatory Block Diagram  The avionics subsystem comprises the hardware comma nd and data handling functions in a single spacecraft bus component the Integrated Electronics Model IEM The IEM is a card cage design based upon the 6U Compact PCI cPCI form factor The IEM consists of five cards connected across a common backplane A 32-bit PCI b us clocked at 16.5 MHz, connects the Single Board Comp uter SBC\, Solid-State Recorder \(SSR\ and Spacecraft In terface Card \(SCIF\ for flow of commands and telemetry. The SBC is a BAE RAD750 based design, clocked at 33 MHz for 50 MIPS nominal with 16 MB of Synchronous Random Access Memory SRAM 4 MB of Electrically Erasable  Programmable Read Only Memory EEPROM and 64 kB of Programmable Read Only Memory PROM The SSR contains 16 Gb of Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access  Memory SDRAM memory with Error Detection and Correction EDAC and hardware scrubbing The selec ted SDRAM has a low upset rate even in the RBSP environment\; the few SDRAM errors that are expecte d will be corrected by SSR EDAC  The onboard flight software provides the following functionality command uplink spacecraft command management autonomy rule processing command macro  management spacecraft time-tag command management  SSR management telemetry management downlink management and spacecraft-to-instrument hardware interface management  The remaining two IEM cards include a telemetry card which gathers temperature  analog and discrete data and a DC-DC converter card which provides regulated secondary voltages derived from the spacecraft primary power bus and implements the box  offpulse capability  The observatories utilize a Direct Energy Transfer DET power system. The power bus voltage varies with the eightcell Lithium Ion \(Li-Ion\ battery voltage. The powe r system consists of the Power System Electronics PSE Bat tery Management Electronics \(BME\, Solar Array Junction Box SAJB\, 50AH Li-Ion battery, and four deployed sola r array panels The Power Distribution Unit PDU provides the switched unswitched and pulsed power to the obser vatory components The PDU receives primary power from the  PSE and has a serial Universal Asynchronous Receive rTransmitter UART command/telemetry interface with  the IEM The PDU is a modular slice design with each s lice consisting of a printed circuit board housed in a m echanical frame stacked and bolted together The slices elec trically connect using internal rigid-flex connectors for si gnals A wiring harness external to the box is used for powe r connections  


   4 The Radio Frequency \(RF\ system operates at S-band with unique uplink and downlink frequencies for each observatory. The RF system is sized to enable downl ink of at least 6.7 Gb of data per day per spacecraft, inc luding realtime housekeeping telemetry during the operational  phase of the mission To meet data return requirements t he RF system provides data rates up to 2 Mbps. The data r ate can change during a ground contact in order to accommod ate different link parameters due to the changing space craft range to the ground station  The observatories utilize a cold-biased passive the rmal control design system to maintain the on-board elec tronics and instruments on-board within their required temp erature limits The majority of the electronics boxes are h ard mounted to the inside of the spacecraft panels and decks with their internal heat going into the spacecraft structure Local radiators on the side panels and bottom deck control the amount of heat lost to the space. Multi-Layer I nsulation MLI blankets cover the majority of the outside of  the spacecraft especially on the top deck to insulate the observatory from the Sun Heater circuits on all th e panels and decks are installed to protect the observatorie s from getting too cold Very little heater power is requi red onorbit and the heater circuits are provided as a fa il-safe device A few observatory components such as the L i-Ion battery and several instruments, are thermally isol ated from the spacecraft and have individual radiators blank ets and heaters 2  Fault Management Design 2.1  FM Definition /Objectives Fault Management FM is defined as the functional requirements distributed throughout the observatory  and ground that enable detection isolation and recove ry from events that upset nominal operations The goal of t he FM system is to achieve mission reliability objectives  without violating program resources FM must achieve this g oal by balancing project risk and the cost of developing testing and operating the Fault Management System \(FMS  The RBSP FMS is a distributed system with allocatio ns to hardware flight software rule-based autonomy and  ground/mission operations. The RBSP FM design uses both activeî and ìpassiveî features to deal with potent ial faults Active features include actions taken on-board the observatory that are implemented with hardware sof tware or a combination of the two whereas passive featur es include design decisions and development practices to minimize the probability that a fault occurs The o verall goal for the on-board FMS is to be as simple as pos sible while ensuring that 1 the observatory is capable o f detecting correcting and recovering from any sing le recoverable anomaly that affects health and safety and 2\ the observatory meets the overall mission concept and m ission goals 2.2  Process for FM Development RBSP follows the Fault Management Engineering Proce ss which is documented within JHU/APLís Quality Management System QMS The FM engineering Process  prescribes a systematic approach to FM with collabo ration among all members of the systems engineering team subsystem leads and mission operations from Phase  A through Phase E Figure 5  depicts the high-level engineering process used in  the development of the FM system for RBSP Capturin g distinctive mission design elements is critical to successfully developing the FMS since it focuses t he engineering team on what needs to be done different ly in comparison with past missions. A significant portio n of the early FM design approach focuses on describing the key mission design characteristics and possible advanta ges the mission design may offer in the design of the FMS The RBSP top-level FM architecture also includes the redundancy concept modes and safing concept groun d intervention concept and critical sequences as gu ided by the FM engineering process  Reliability analyses p lay an important role in the development of the FMS by identifying potential faults and failures and analy zing the impact of cross-cutting faults and failures on the planned protection schemes in a comprehensive framework Th e reliability analyses are used in an iterative manne r, to ensure the quantity and impact of potential faults are min imized completeness of the FM design, as well as to enable system efficiency in design and fault response 2.3  FM Design Drivers The RBSP FM design takes advantage of inherent miss ion design characteristics to reduce complexity, but a number of design drivers also influence the design The nearSun pointed spin-stabilized design offers a number of advantages while the extreme radiation environment  project cost constraints and the NASA risk classif ication drive several unique features within the FMS. These design characteristics and drivers result in five high-lev el requirements that govern the overall RBSP FM design  and from which lower-level FM concepts and requirements  are derived These high-level requirements include sele ctive fault tolerance minimized on-board fault managemen t layered fault management for maximum science limit ed instrument fault management and off-pulse capabili ty for unswitched electronics and map into the fault manag ement concepts for redundancy modes and safing and grou nd intervention

The allowable range of Sun offs et angles is determined by minimum and maximum offsets from t he ecliptic plane N-S and in the ecliptic plane E-W  Propulsive maneuvers are performed periodically to maintain this near Sun-pointing attitude as the Ear th and observatories move around the Sun The spin axis d rifts from a maximum total offset through a minimum offs et equal to the N-S offset back to the maximum betw een precession maneuvers as shown in Figure 6. The sizes of the offset angles determine how often precession maneuvers are performed approximately e very 21 days  Figure 6:  Sun Offset Angles The G&C subsystem design takes advantage of the nea r-Sun pointed, spin-stabilized design by utilizing an ope n-loop architecture for the guidance and control functions The observatories have no on-board software to estimate or control attitude or orbit, and attitude changes are performed by the ground with open-loop commanding of the on-b oard thrusters, thus greatly simplifying on-board FM  2.3.2  Environment The severe environment in which the observatories s pend the majority of their time is a significant design driver: each observatory is designed for the challenging environ mental requirements imposed by its orbit in the Van Allen Radiation Belts The risk to electronic hardware is  high since both observatories spend most of the mission life at high-risk altitudes to perform the science measurem ents The environment causes high total ionizing dose and single event effects due to radiation as well as surface c harging and deep dielectric charging/discharging on electri cal hardware The spacecraft and instrument subsystems and components operate continuously while the observato ries transit through the heart of the inner-trapped prot on Van Allen belt twice every ~9 hour orbit for the nomina l 2 year 74 day mission. These energetic \(up to hundreds of MeV protons provide the majority of the penetrating dos e and all of the displacement damage. The second major contri bution to the total radiation dose is the outer belt trapp ed electrons that bombard the observatories during the long expo sures near apogee  


   6 Since RBSP is a mostly single-string mission sever al passive FM features are designed into the system to  deal with these environmental effects First electronic s boxes have additional shielding Second the radiation-ha rd parts program required devices to be tested to at least 5 0 krads Si with the required hardness based on chassis w all thickness and use of spot shielding All integrated  circuits are designed to be latch-up immune Third first ci rcuit interfaces are hardened to survive deep dielectric discharge pulses in the spacecraft harness Fourth in order to enable sensitive science measurements, the spacecraft are designed with features to reduce spacecraft internal and sur face charging so that the spacecraft-generated fields w ill not contaminate the electric and magnetic fields being measured In addition to these passive features th e FMS also employs an off-pulsing scheme to mitigate agai nst the effects of discharges inside spacecraft components  discussed in detail later in this paper 2.4  Overview of FM Architecture In addition to the design characteristics and drive rs that influence the FM architecture the RBSP FMS include s a redundancy concept, modes and safing concept, and g round intervention concept Each of these concepts are ex plained in detail in the following sections 2.4.1  Redundancy Concept All NASA-sponsored missions are required to adhere to the NASA procedural document 8705.4, Risk Classificatio n for NASA Payloads which provides general redundancy requirements based on the mission risk classificati on However, the document leaves it to the engineering team to decide how best to implement redundancy requirement s The RBSP mission is classified as risk category C As such critical single-point failures \(SPFs\ for Level 1 r equirements may be permitted but are mitigated by use of high reliability parts additional testing or by other means in addition single string and selectively redundant d esign approaches may be used The RBSP program abided by a selective fault tolerance posture to maximize relia bility while minimizing cost and complexity Fault toleran ce for RBSP was directed at increasing the reliability of critical sequences, high-risk parts prone to failure, parts with failure modes due to the environment or parts with movable  components redundancy was not used to increase the  lifetime of limited-life items The end result was a singlestring architecture for RBSP with fault tolerance as identified in Table 1 note degraded performance i s highlighted in yellow Fault tolerance options wer e identified through engineering rigor and the use of the fault analysis techniques such as probabilistic risk asse ssment PRA and failure modes and effects analysis FMEA  These fault analysis techniques are used to systema tically evaluate the benefit of redundancy fault tolerance  and mitigation strategies. The decision to use fault to lerance was made by examining the reliability improvement cost  complexity, and mission criticality Table 1:  RBSP Selective Fault Tolerance Function Redundancy Fault Tolerance Description Spacecraft Separation Indication   Fault tolerant separation switches   3 of 4 separation switches required Deployments   Redundant deployment for Mag Boom and Search Coil   1 of 2 actuators required for each    Redundant deployment for solar panel   Redundant EFW AXB and SPB deployment enables   1 of 2 actuators required for each    1 of 2 boom enables required \(for each Data Storage   Fault tolerant SSR memory banks      Failed SSR   Failure of an SSR memory bank impacts the amount of data stored half the recorder lost but SSR would still function   IEM continues to function without SSR; mission severely degraded Latch Valves   Cross-over latch valve   2 of 3 latches valves required Precession Maneuvers   Redundant catbed heaters   Redundant thruster groups   1 thruster control group could fail and still perform nominal precession Delta-V Maneuvers Z   Redundant catbed heaters   Fault tolerant thruster groups   1 thruster control group could fail and still perform degraded +Z maneuver Delta-V Maneuvers Z   Redundant catbed heaters   Fault tolerant thruster groups   1 thruster control group could fail and still perform degraded -Z maneuver Spin-Rate Maneuvers   Redundant catbed heaters   Fault tolerant thruster groups   1 thruster control group could fail and still perform degraded spinrate maneuver Sun Sensor   Redundant sensor heads   1 of 2 heads needed for spin pulse Sun Sensor   Back-up sun pulse from spin timer \(not adequate for full science   Mitigates spurious pulses on Sun Sensor output Telecomm   Antennas   Failure of antenna reduces availability by 50 PDU   Redundant safety enabled buses    Redundant wires for select loads   Redundant operation of actuators, thrusters SSPA, and SAJB   Redundant wires for HOPE, REPT, RPS, IEM PDU, XCVR, thruster valves, and latch valves Power Generation   Spare solar string   Power design is tolerant of one failed solar string without loss in mission performance Power Generation   Battery cell    Power design is tolerant of one failed battery cell with possible degraded performance

The term safing refers to an onboard autonomous activity that occurs after a major fault is detected; it demotes the observatory to it s most basic functionality to maximize the potential for surviva l until the next ground contact The observatory safing strateg y is important to reducing mission risk Due to its impo rtance the RBSP modes and safing strategy clearly presents  two pieces of information to properly guide the FMS development process First the modes and safing st rategy presents the objectives of each mode Second the m odes and safing strategy clearly states the mode transit ions and the types of faults that cause entry into safe mode It should also be noted that the modes and safing strategy de cision process flows from a strong understanding of the mi ssion design and the critical sequences  In the end the decision of how and when to safe a spacecraft affects the requirements for the spacecr aft hardware software autonomy and ground operations  and helps to determine the FM modes Another considerat ion the FM lead engineer should make in designing the s afing strategy is including a ìsafety netî to capture unk nown fault conditions Despite the robust fault analysis tools  the FM lead engineer and larger engineering team must acknowledge a lack of imagination in identifying every fault single fault common cause failures uninten ded subsystem interactions multiple synchronous failur es and every necessary response for all phases of the miss ion A robust safety net that can reset the entire system and/or cycle through all redundant components in a last-di tch effort to recover the spacecraft to a safe state should be included in the FM safing strategy Nonetheless the FM lead en gineer should not make the safety net overly complex as i t can unnecessarily tax the design implementation and t est resources allocated to the FMS development without providing a clear benefit  To reduce the complexity of the RBSP FMS, the goal was to have the least number of modes possible to safely p erform the mission. By design, the RBSP observatories are in a safe state The observatories are inherently stable nea r-Sun pointing spinners which require only periodic atti tude precession maneuvers performed via an open-loop att itude control system These inherent mission design characteristics and observatory design decisions re sult in a simplified safing concept for the mission as compa red to more complicated missions with 3-axis stabilized at titude control Two modes have been identified for RBSP Operational and Safe  Operational Mode is the prim ary mode for the observatory and is used from launch th rough the end of the mission, unless the observatory enco unters a life-threatening fault condition When possible th e observatory flies through faults or fails operat ional meaning that non-critical faults leave the observat ory in Operational Mode. These faults are handled by the o n-board FMS or by the ground during subsequent ground passe s The occurrence of a critical fault e.g low volta ge sense low battery state of charge expiration of hardware  command loss timer or violation of maximum Sun-lin e angle causes a transition to Safe Mode The goal o f Safe Mode is to autonomously place the spacecraft into a known communication-safe, power-preserving configuration so that ground operations has time to identify and recover from the fault The transition from Safe Mode back to Operat ional Mode is performed by ground command only  The RBSP  FM modes diagram is shown in Figure 7    


   8  Figure 7:  RBSP Fault Management Modes Diagram   2.4.2.1  Layered Fault Management for Maximum Science Data Collection Three of the high-level requirements that drive the  RBSP FM design flow into the modes and safing concept. T he first of these high-level requirements is layered FM to m aximize science data collection The mission is designed fo r concurrent particle and magnetic field, electric fi eld, plasma density and interferometric timing measurements I n order to meet these science measurement goals, the FMS ut ilizes a layered approach in order to maximize science data collection in the event of a fault Faults are cate gorized by severity with the goal of quickly detecting and re sponding to less severe, isolated faults with minimum interr uption to science data collection and ensuring a power-safe and communication-safe observatory for more severe tim ecritical faults through a system-wide response. Var ious fault analysis tools such as FMEA and PRA are used to ide ntify and categorize faults  Less severe faults are categorized as faults where the cause is more easily identified and isolated to a particu lar subsystem. These faults are treated locally at the subsystem level either by on-board FM \(i.e., hardware, flight software or rule-based autonomy or by the ground during the  subsequent ground passes For faults that are handl ed onboard, the FMS detects the fault and the action tak en allows the system to have limited or no interruption to Op erational Mode in which science data is collected the ground  is responsible for identifying and correcting the prob lem during subsequent ground passes. For faults that ar e handled by the ground provisions have been made that allow  the ground to reset or off-pulse specific components th rough critical command decoder CCD and/or flight softwa re commands  More severe faults are categorized as faults where the cause is less easily identified and could be attributed t o one or more subsystems in addition these faults are more  timecritical in that lack of immediate action could cau se a mission-ending failure For faults identified as se vere the on-board FMS detects the fault and the observatory is demoted to Safe Mode Safe Mode is a more global response that is reserved for faults that require a  systemlevel response with the goal of preserving observat ory power and ensuring communication 2.4.2.2  Off-Pulsing Architecture The next high-level requirement that drives the mod es and safing approach is off-pulsing for unswitched elect ronics Since RBSP is a mostly single-string mission criti cal components i.e IEM PDU and transceiver are po wered using unswitched power services so that they cannot  be turned off once the spacecraft is powered up.

   9 extreme radiation environment could induce faults i n these components that can only be cleared by the removal and reapplication of power termed off-pulsing The FM S implements an off-pulsing architecture that provide s offpulsing capabilities to clear faults in the transce iver IEM and PDU. Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earthís orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraftís orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the missionís product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
