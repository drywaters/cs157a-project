Aziz, Senior Member, IEEE Electrical Engineering Department, Faculty of Engineering Al-Baha University, Al-Baha, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia amaziz64@ieee.org  Abstract 227Radar emitter signal identification is a special issue of data clustering for classifying unknown radar emitters In this paper an efficient approach for automatic classification of radar emitter signals in multisensor systems is proposed. The proposed approach exploits measured features extracted from multiple sensors as well as the sensor accuracies for classification of unknown multiple radar targets The proposed approach can easily be applied to any number of sensors 
with different accuracies any number of emitters and any number of measured features without exponential growing of the required computations. The performance of the proposed classification approach is evaluated in terms of percentage of correct classification and compared to other classification approaches.

In this case, a number of distributed radars have been deployed to support surveillance and monitoring operations [11, 12   M u ltir a d a r  d a ta  f u s io n  is  th e  p r o c e s s  b y  
which measured features from diverse radars sensing multiple targets is fused to yield improved performance than could be achieved using a single radar system [13, 14   The measured features are corrupted with different types of disturbances that are likely to occur in a typical multisensor system Features refer to the parameter measured by the radars sensors and fusion is the process of combining the parameters of the sensed targets Sensor fusion can be  1 978-1-4673-1813-6/13/$31.00 \2512013 IEEE   efficiently applied to several military and civilian applications in order to increase the coverage area and improve the system accuracy One of the main tasks performed by multisensor systems is the classification issue performed in surveillance 
applications. These systems are composed of multiple radars and one of their main tasks is classification of multiple radar emitter signals Radar emitter classification is a special application of data clustering for classifying unknown radar emitters from received radar pulse samples. For example, for a multisensor coastal surveillance system presented in [11   it is composed of two platforms of sensors a land-based platform and an airborne platform. The land-based platform is equipped with a land based radar an automatic identification system and an infrared camera. The airborne platform is equipped with an airborne radar, a video camera and an infrared camera. There are many tasks performed by this multisensor systems including target detection target tracking threat assessment and classification of multiple 
targets. Another practical example are the electronic warfare systems presented in 15   E le c tr o n ic  w a r f a r e  r e c e iv e r s  a r e  passive receivers which receive emissions from many platforms and perform some analysis on these emissions Some of these electronic warfare receivers receive radar pulses, measure the features of each pulse received, and then classify the pulses that belongs to the same emitter together to determine the radar features for each emitter The measured features are then compared with values related to known radar types to identify the emitter type Another application is the classification of real-life audio signals that are collected by a ground surveillance radar mounted on a tank [16   A  h u m a n  o p e r a to r  c a n  o p e r a te  th e  r a d a r  s y s te m  to  discern among small number of signals bouncing off tanks 
vehicles planes and so on The aim here is to achieve automatic target classification and reduce the number of personnel required in a tank; for example The challenges in target emitter classification are real time processing closely located radar clusters and high dimensionality in terms of the number of emitters the number of sensors and the number of measured features This paper proposes a novel and efficient approach for automatic radar emitter classification based on measured features from multiple sensors with different accuracies. The proposed approach treats all the measured features at once not pairwise and generates classification weights based on 


 2  the measured features, prototype radar types, and the diverse sensor accuracies The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Problem formulation assuming uncorrelated sensor errors and a review of some published studies related to classification of radar emitter signals are considered in Section 2. The proposed classification approach is presented in Section 3 Performance evaluation and numerical results based on Monte Carlo simulations are reported in Section 4 Performance comparison with other classification approaches is also presented in Section 4. Section 5 contains the summary  2  P ROBLEM F ORMULATION AND A R EVIEW OF S OME P UBLISHED S TUDIES R ELATED TO C LASSIFICATION OF R ADAR E MITTER S IGNALS  To simplify the problem formulation we formulate the problem with a simple example. We assume a scenario of a multisensor multiemitter environment with two sensors, with different accuracies and three emitters in an overlapping coverage scenario Each sensor observes some emitters under surveillance and sends feature vectors to a central processor We assume uncorrelated sensor errors Sensor 1 observes emitter 1 and emitter 2. Sensor 2 observes emitter 2 and emitter 3 Due to the overlapping coverage the number of feature vectors, reported to the central processor is 4 feature vectors although we only have 3 emitters We assume that each feature vector 2,1,3,2,1  ji ij F  has two features which are the radio frequency  RF  and the pulse repetition interval  PRI  of the observed emitter Each feature vector ij F represents the features vector from sensor j  due to observing emitter i  The main goal is to find out which features  are similar \(i.e. represent the same emitter and dissimilar i.e represent different emitters to each other  With this simple example of two sensors, three emitters,  and two features we can simply find the similar and dissimilar emitters Two emitters that have about the same feature values are more similar than two emitters  that do not. But for large number of sensors, emitters, and visual inspection fails us and automatic classification becomes useful Furthermore the number of emitters is not known a priori which makes the problem more complicated for a large number of emitters. The number of ways of classification of N  feature vectors into e n  emitters is a Stirling number of the second kind  [9  a n d  is  g iv e n  b y     1 0  N nk k e e n N k k n n W e e 001   002 002 003 004 005 005 006 007  1  For even the relatively simple problem of classification of 25 feature vectors into known 5 emitters the number of ways \(possibilities\ is the quantity 751,110,974,684,436,2 5 25  W 2  which is very large The problem is compounded when the number of emitters is unknown. In this case, the number of possibilities increases markedly to 001   264 25 1 18  25 104 m m j W 3  This example shows the essential need of automatic classification  In 15   a  s e lf o r g a n iz in g  n e u r a l n e tw o r k  is  p r o p o s e d  f o r  clustering This algorithm has the capability of  good clustering in real time applications In 15   tw o  p a r ts  a r e  focused, emitters deinterleaving and PRF-type identification The deinterleaving is done through parameters clustering Two parameters are selected for clustering direction of arrival and radio frequency In 16   R a d ia l b a s is  f u n c tio n   neural networks with training are used for target recognition to classify real-life audio radar signals that are collected by a ground surveillance radar mounted on a tank Different signal classification models in the neural net literature, such as autoregressive model are also considered in 16    I n  17   tw o  r a d a r  ta r g e t c la s s if ic a tio n  te c h n iq u e s  d e v e lo p e d  to  utilize radar returns are discussed. Both of these techniques utilize resonance region backscatter measurements of the radar cross section and the intrinsic target backscattered phase The first technique uses nearest neighbor algorithms on the radar cross section magnitude and phase at a number of operating frequencies The second technique uses an inverse Fourier transformation of the complex multifrequency radar returns to the time domain followed by cross correlation. Comparisons are made of the performance of the two techniques as a function of signal-to-error noise power ratio for various processing options In 18   th e  problem of classifying radar target signals based on radio frequencies is discussed in case of Gaussian distributed observations Two different classification approaches are analyzed based on the adaptive coherent estimator and on the generalized likelihood ratio test. The performance of the two classification algorithms are evaluated analytically and by Monte Carlo simulations In 19   a n  a p p r o a c h  is  proposed for intra-pulse feature extraction of radar emitter signals based on symbolic time series analysis In this approach embedding time-delay and modified Shannon entropy are used as two-dimensional feature vector to sort the interleaving radar signals In 20   a n  a p p r o a c h  f o r  classification of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar images is presented. It has been developed by integrating an analysis of the multitemporal synthetic aperture radar signal physics with a pattern recognition approach The system is made up of a feature-extraction module and a neuralnetwork classifier, as well as a set of standard preprocessing procedures This method reduces the complexity of the neural architecture increases the generalization capabilities of the classifier, and relaxes the requirements relating to the number of training patterns to be used for classifier learning

Simulation results showed the superior performance of the model-based algorithm over competitive learning in terms of better classification accuracy flexibility and stability In 22   a  classification method is proposed to overcome the complex and dense pulses environment which is vital factor to restrict the efficiency of classification of the conventional multiparameters signal sorting system. This method is considered as  a segment clustering radar signal sorting method based on support vector clustering  according to the statistics learning theory.  In [23   a  th r e e la y e r  v e c to r  n e u r a l n e tw o r k  with a supervised learning algorithm suitable for signal classification in general and for emitter identification in particular The input features of the emitter identification problems include the radio frequency, pulse width, and pulse repetition interval of a received emitter signal. This method requires a training phase for the measured data  In general, the computational cost in generating the optimal classification to the problems of classification of radar emitter signals is usually excessive and infeasible for realtime surveillance systems Furthermore they assume idealized modeling assumptions and a prior knowledge of the signal environment which is limited in practice It is worth noting that the use of an optimum complicated classification  techniques under idealized impractical assumptions may not achieve acceptable performance when these assumptions are not satisfied  Unlike the optimal solutions the suboptimal solutions provide approximate solutions to the problems of  radar emitter signal classifications. The approximate solutions are based on neural network and fuzzy logic techniques The major drawbacks to the neural network implementations are that they require unreasonable numbers of neurons and require training with a very large set of tracks 16 23   Fuzzy techniques have been proven very successfully in many classification problems Fuzzy techniques are currently applied to important application areas such as medical imaging robot vision remote sensing sonar systems and pattern recognition  and are rapidly growing to become a powerful technique for multisensor data fusion [7 10 12    F u z z y  s y s te m s  a r e  w e ll s u ite d  to  m a n a g e  uncertainty and to model decision-making processes and offer the advantage of a clear understanding of their operation because they construct knowledge by rules that resemble human thinking. For the problem of  classification the distributed sensors use their input data to form an opinion in the form of a fuzzy membership on the environment The features are fuzzified using membership functions The outputs from the fuzzification are values between  0  and  1  and represent the correlation between all the feature vectors These outputs are called fuzzy outputs The fuzzy outputs from the fuzzification process are processed using fuzzy rules represented as IF THEN rules The defuzzification process converts the fuzzy outputs to non-fuzzy outputs which are called crisp data The defuzzification outputs are analyzed and compared with each other or with thresholds to determine whether two/more feature vectors, obtained from two or more different sensors represent the same emitter Unfortunately the extension of fuzzy techniques to the case of a large number of sensors/emitters/features is fairly complex due to the required large number of IF THEN rules 4 12   Furthermore, as the system complexity increases, it becomes difficult to determine the right set of rules and membership functions to describe the system behavior In addition the solution of the conventional fuzzy logic approach to the classification problem is an approximate solution and the accuracy depends on several factors including the number of input variables the number of linguistic variables the choice of membership function and the accuracy of fuzzy rules and statements  3  P ROPOSED A PPROACH FOR A UTOMATIC R ADAR E MITTER C LASSIFICATION  First, we will consider the case of two feature vectors, then the proposed method can easily be applied to any number of feature vectors.

tionship between beer brands and customers Our proposed criterion played an important role in determining the number of clusters in this analysis We nally compare our proposed criterion with other ones For example AIC discovered four customer clusters and the customer behavior suggested by each cluster is rather different from that given by NML ICL selected only ve brand clusters whereas results of NML also distinguished brand clusters B and E Each of these results shows certain aspects of the data but we emphasize that the model selection results given by NML are justiìed from the perspective of data compression VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have addressed the issue of statistical model selection in GRD modeling From the viewpoint of the MDL principle we have clariìed the asymptotic property of NML in GRD modeling and have proposed a new model selection criterion We have applied our proposed criterion to the issue of model selection in SBM learning and have derived a new and efìcient method of calculating the NML code-length for SBM The effectiveness of our NML-based criterion has been demonstrated experimentally using artiìcial data and real beer-purchase data Thus for the rst time we have realized a model selection technique that considers the statistical characteristics of GRD models We will extend our discussion to other problems and criteria A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was partially supported by MEXT KAKENHI 23240019 by the Aihara Project the FIRST program from JSPS initiated by CSTP by HAKUHODO Inc and by MACROMILL Inc R EFERENCES  B Long Z Zhang and P  S Y u  Relational Data Clustering Models Algorithms and Applications  Chapman  Hall/CRC 2010  T  Roos T  Silander  P  K ontkanen and P  Myllymaki Bayesian network structure learning using factorized NML universal models in Information Theory and Applications Workshop  Feb 2008 pp 272 276  P  K ontkanen P  Myllym  aki W Buntine J Rissanen and H Tirri An MDL framework for data clustering in Advances in Minimum Description Length Theory and Applications  MIT Press 2005  A T  Cemgil Bayesian inference for nonne gati v e matrix factorisation models Intell Neuroscience  vol 2009 pp 4:1Ö4:17 Jan 2009  H Akaik e  A ne w look at the statistical model identiìcation  IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control  vol 19 no 6 pp 716  723 Dec 1974  G E Schw arz Estimating the dimension of a model  Annals of Statistics  vol 6 pp 461Ö464 1978  E M Airoldi D M Blei S E Fienber g and E P  Xing Mixed membership stochastic blockmodels J Mach Learn Res  vol 9 pp 1981Ö2014 Jun 2008  J Rissanen Modeling by shortest data description  Automatica  vol 14 no 5 pp 465  471 1978   Fisher information and stochastic comple xity   IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 42 no 1 pp 40 47 Jan 1996  Y  M Shtark o v  Uni v ersal sequential coding of single messages Problems of Information Transmission  vol 23 no 3 pp 3Ö17 1987  S Hirai and K Y amanishi Ef cient computation of normalized maximum likelihood coding for Gaussian mixtures with its applications to optimal clustering in Proceedings of the 2011 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory ISIT  Aug 2011 pp 1031 1035  J Rissanen MDL denoising  IEEE Transactions on Information Theory  vol 46 no 7 pp 2537 2543 Nov 2000  Y  Hayashi and K Y amanishi Sequential netw ork change detection with its applications to ad impact relation analysis in IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ICDM2012  2012 pp 280Ö289  T  A Snijders and K No wicki Estimation and prediction for stochastic blockmodels for graphs with latent block structure Journal of Classiìcation  vol 14 pp 75Ö100 1997  N Friedman L Getoor  D  K oller  and A Pfef fer  Learning probabilistic relational models in Proceedings of the 16th international joint conference on Artiìcial intelligence  vol 2 1999 pp 1300Ö1307  J.-J Daudin F  Picard and S Robin A mixture model for random graphs Statistics and Computing  vol 18 no 2 pp 173Ö183 2008  C K emp J B T enenbaum T  L Grif ths T  Y amada and N Ueda Learning systems of concepts with an inìnite relational model in Proceedings of the 21st national conference on Artiìcial intelligence  2006 pp 381Ö388  C S W allace and P  R Freeman Estimation and inference by compact coding Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B Methodological  vol 49 no 3 pp pp 240Ö265 1987  C Biernacki G Celeux and G Go v aert  Assessing a mixture model for clustering with the integrated completed likelihood Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence IEEE Transactions on  vol 22 no 7 pp 719Ö725 2000  H Jef fre ys  A n i n v ariant form for the prior probability in estimation problems in Proceedings of the Royal Society of London Series A Mathematical and Physical Sciences  vol 186 no 1007 1946 pp 453Ö461  I S Dhillon S Mallela and D S Modha Informationtheoretic co-clustering in Proceedings of the ninth ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining  2003 pp 89Ö98 429

and emotional topic, it is not a top priority for US foreign policy  This paper has multiple limitations on its research. The datasets included are only for the three most recent female Secretar ies of State and cannot be used to generalize an overall US foreign policy message. Also, there is a gap between the three female Secretaries filled by Secretary of State Colin Powell. For purposes of this paper, and in order to keep gender consistent across all datasets, Secretary Powell was not included Another limitation is the lack of keyword in context analysis. Although these keywords and phrases are important due to their number of times used, as well as their appearance in a large percentage of cases, their context may differ. Further analysis of these important keywords and phrases will lead to deeper insights and more complex nuances  This study is an initial analysis on three separate datasets. Further contextual analysis can lead to deeper understandings of the frequently occurring keywords and phrases that are predominant from each Secretary. Keyword in context analysis will provide further unpacking a nd clearer definitions of what each keyword or phrase means when the Secretary uses it. A prior crosstabs analysis on the Secretary Clinton dataset provided further clues to the evolution of keywords and phrases over time and geography. This analysis will be completed on Secretary Rice and Secretary Albrightês datasets as well. Future analysis will include Secretary Powellês tenure from 2001-2005 in order to see if his themes are consistent with those before and after his term Future research will also include the final two approaches from the ASSANA Methodology traditional hand coding as well as the High Performance Computing Environment. Incorporating these other approaches will allow for a full review of the differences in findings and time for analysis between each approach
