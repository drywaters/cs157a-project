This VCM system comprises eight of NASAís recommended codes from the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems CCSDS standards including four turbo and four AR4JA/C2 l owdensity parity-check codes, together with six modul ations types BPSK QPSK 8-PSK 16-APSK 32-APSK 64-APSK  Th e signaling protocol for the transmission mode is bas ed on a CCSDS recommendation  The coded modulation may be dynamically chosen, block to block, to optimize thr oughput A novel aspect of the VCM design is that each opera ting mode has a unique number of symbols in its frame.  This enables the receiver to identify the code and modulation simply  from the number of symbols occurring between the dedicated f rame markers which occur between frames without having to explicitly transmit a signal to identify the operat ing mode This concept allows for a limitless selection of mo des and low complexity design The paper describes a MATLAB end-to-end simulation consisting of random data generation encoding the data modulation of the data additive white Gaussian noi se for channel simulation frame marker identification co ded modulation mode extraction demodulation and decod ing Achievable error rates and total throughput are rec orded This simulation can be applied to any link budget t hat describes the signal to noise ratio over time and c an selectively use all or some of the supported coded modulation m odes The simulations show that for a representative lowEarth orbit satellite which encounters a 15 dB variation of sym bol SNRs in a 10 minute pass VCM doubles the achievable throug hput compared to the optimal fixed-mode communication  This simulation shows that VCM is a major and practical method for communicating high data volumes from space  T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I NTRODUCTION  1  2  VCM  S YSTEM D ESIGN 2  3  VCM  S OFTWARE S IMULATION 3  4  VCM  P ERFORMANCE 4  5  S UMMARY  7  R EFERENCES  7    1  I NTRODUCTION  Many NASA missions communicate in a highly dynamic environment because of variations in geometry weat her and interference.  On the other hand, during each r eception pass missions typically communicate using fixed ch annel codes modulations and symbol rates resulting in a constant data rate that does not adapt to the dynam ic conditions  When conditions are good the fixed da te rate can be far below the theoretical maximum called th e Shannon limit; when conditions are bad, the fixed d ata rate may not work at all  To move beyond these fixed communications modes and achieve higher total data volume from NASA's emerging high-tech instruments we investigate the use of time-varying codes and modul ations Variable coded modulation VCM takes advantage of the dynamic link by transmitting more information bits when signal-to-noise ratios SNRs are high whereas fix ed communications transmits the same information rate as long as a certain signal threshold is met  Likewise VC M can throttle down the information rate when SNRs are lo w without having to stop all communications  This al lows a higher total throughput than can be achieved with f ixedmode communications The current development of nanosatellites picosate llites and CubeSats has introduced the idea that small and simple satellites can be used for important scientific res earch with a relatively low cost for construction and launch  T ypical CubeSat missions however are size and power limit ed which poses significant limitations for the communi cations system especially the downlink  This in turns adv ersely affects a designerís ability to meet the scientific  mission requirements  Designers have attempted to overcome  this limitation through the use of globally distributed ground systems 1  a n d  a d a p t i v e  d a t a  r a t e s   2     T h i s  c u r r ent work suggests that variable coded modulation can provide  increased downlink throughput under the constraints  of the CubeSat standard while tailored for low complexity onboard the satellite The purpose of this paper is to introduce a modifie d VCM system design with a selection of VCM modes and hig hlight the advantages of this particular design namely mo de detection using only frame markers and unique lengt hs Lastly this paper shows the performance of the soft ware simulation, and an example of throughput improvemen t for a CubeSat application  


 2 2  VCM  S YSTEM D ESIGN  Physical Layer Frame Structure The design of the proposed VCM system closely follo ws the VCM protocol used in the Consultative Committee for  Space Data Systems \(CCSDS\ recommendation for seria lly concatenated convolutional codes SCCC 3    N a m e l y a Physical Layer Frame consists of a Frame Marker FM  a Frame Descriptor FD and 16 frames of the same VC M type.  The physical layer frame symbol length varie s based on the VCM mode being transmitted  Attached Sync Markers ASMs are inserted into the data and the i nput goes through a pseudo-random interleaver prior to e ncoding The FM is generated using the Gold sequence describ ed in the CCSDS recommendation [3    T h i s  F M  i s  2 5 6  b i t s  long and is modulated with binary phase-shift keying BP SK The FM always follows the last or 16 th  codeword and precedes the FD, which signals which code and modul ation will be used in the remainder of the physical layer  frame The FD is generated as section 5.3.3.2.2 of the CCS DS recommended standard 3  s u g g e s t s    T h e  F D  h a s  a  t o tal length of 64 bits, can describe up to 32 VCM modes and is also modulated with BPSK  Figure 1 ñ Physical Layer Frame  This paper will show that the CCSDS VCM protocol of 3  can be used with turbo and low-density parity-check  LDPC codes providing an easier infusion path for  NASAís use of VCM  It also shows that the existing  CCSDS VCM protocol is general enough to support a variety of codes and modulations  CCSDS Turbo and LDPC codes CCSDS has recommended a set of 16 turbo codes 4    There is a code for each of rates 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, an d 1/2, and input lengths 1784 3568 7136 and 8920  These co des have been a workhorse for deep space missions havi ng been used on for example on the Mars Reconnaissan ce Orbiter and the Curiosity Mars Rover From this se t of 16 codes, this paper will use the turbo codes of lengt h 8920 and rates 1/6, 1/4, 1/3, and 1/2 CCSDS has also recommended a set of nine accumulate  repeat-by-four jagged accumulate AR4JA LDPC codes  along with one other higher rate LDPC code [4    T h e nine ARJA codes represent each combination of code rates  1/2 2/3, and 4/5 and input lengths 1024, 4096, and 1638 4.  The 10 th  LDPC code called C2 has input length 7136 and ra te 223/255, or approximately 7/8.  From this set of te n codes this paper will use the AR4JA codes of length 16384  and rates 1/2, 2/3, and 4/5, along with the C2 LDPC cod e CCSDS Modulations The CCSDS recommendation on SCCC [3  m a k e s  u s e  o f  a  number of modulations  Binary phase-shift keying  binary PSK or BPSK quaternary PSK QPSK and 8-ary PSK  8-PSK\ are text book modulations.  The union of tw o PSK constellations is used to form a 16-ary amplitude p hase-shift keying \(16-APSK\.  Two other modulations, 32-APSK a nd 64-APSK are also formed from the union of PSK constellations  CCSDS has described particular sym bol mappings and relative amplitude scalings for these modulations 3   a n d  t h e  o p t i m a l  d e m o d u l a t i o n  o f  t h e modulations are described in [5   The VCM modes The VCM system described in this paper uses eight t urbo code modes and 20 LDPC code modes.  Additionally, a ll six modulation types discussed above are used.  The 28 modes are listed in Table 1 with the shaded modes ultima tely omitted from VCM design as described below  The ta ble gives the code rate the number of information bits  per modulation symbol \(equal to the code rate times the base-2 logarithm of the number of constellation points of the modulation the number of modulation symbols per physical layer frame and the minimum      in dB needed to achieve a codeword error rate of 10 4   Here    refers to the energy of a modulation symbol not a code symbol Design for Receiver Frame Marker Synchronization  A desirable property of the VCM system is that the modes have unique physical layer frame lengths  This is helpful because the separation between frame markers can th en be used to identify the VCM mode, in the event that th is cannot be determined reliably from the frame descriptor To obtain this property the VCM modes in Table 1 w ere reduced to 24 modes of unique length  Of the modes  the VCM system was designed for there are four pairs o f modes that shared identical symbol lengths   2 and 4 \(BPSK 1/3 Turbo / QPSK 1/6 Turbo   3 and 5 \(BPSK 1/2 Turbo / QPSK 1/4 Turbo   13 and 16 \(8PSK 2/3 LDPC / 16APSK 1/2 LDPC   22 and 25 \(32APSK 4/5 LDPC / 64APSK 2/3 LDPC Looking at the eight modes, the solution of elimina ting the usage of four modes can conveniently be justified  In an idealized system which supports BPSK and QPSK equal ly well, the BPSK modes serve little purpose since QPS K can deliver twice spectral efficiency with no change in  power efficiency  Thus the BPSK 1/2 and BPSK 1/3 BPSK modes can be removed labeled Modes 2  3   Mode 13 can be eliminated because it is dominated by mode 1 6 mode 13 achieves a throughput of 2 bits per symbol and requires      n dB, while mode 16 achieves 2 bits

Similarly LDPC 32APSK 4/5  LDPC 64APSK 2/3 both deliver 4 information bits per symbol but 64APSK 2/3 requires  a higher signal to noise ratio to operate so 64APSK 2/3 can be removed from the list of VCM modes   Although w e have made these particular choices here the availa ble support for higher order modulations and their rel ative implementation losses will dictate which modes are  dominated and can be eliminated in a particular sys tem. For the purpose of this paper we assume support of all  six modulations and equal implementation losses for all  modulation types After reducing the VCM mode list to 24 unique-lengt h modes, the receiver may be structured to identify t he VCM mode from the spacing between frame markers, and no t by the frame descriptor bits which explicitly indicate the VCM mode  Thus the frame descriptor can be eliminated  from the protocol entirely  This number of VCM modes in  this new design would not be limited by the number of bi ts in a frame descriptor ñ 32 modes for a 5-bit frame descr iptor and would allow for support of an arbitrary number of VCM modes  Of course any additional mode added will b e required to have a unique symbol length or some ot her means to identify it CubeSat Implementation Feasibility Only the downlink for CubeSat communications is pow er limited, resulting in the VCM system being applied for only outbound communications which is a major key to th e implementation of a VCM system in these small satel lites The computational complexity of the error correctin g codes is found in the receiver which will be at the groun d station The encoders are relatively low-complexity and can easily fit on Field Programmable Gate Arrays FPGA like t he Altera Cyclone or Xilinx Spartan3A which are alread y being included in other CubeSat designs [6   3  VCM  S OFTWARE S IMULATION  Overview of Software Implementation An end-to-end software simulation of the VCM system was created.

 4 4  VCM  P ERFORMANCE  Frame Marker Identification Error Rate A MATLAB simulation was performed to discover the e rror rate for detecting frame markers under Additive Whi te Gaussian Noise \(AWGN\.  This process consisted of a cross correlation between the noisy received signal and t he expected 256 bit frame marker.  The estimated offse t index is given by r                   n  where s  is the noisy signal m  is the known 256 bit frame marker, and  is length of the cross correlation or the length of the search.  The search length l can be selected based on the length of the longest physical layer frame amo ng all VCM modes  Under the VCM design the longest physic al layer frame possible is 857,024 symbols or bits sin ce the modulation is BPSK.  Doubling this length and subtr acting 256 the length of a frame marker results in the l ength of the longest possible bit stream containing only one  frame marker, which is 1,713,792 bits.  This simulation g enerated two physical layer frames chopped off the first fr ame marker applied AWGN and then computed the cross correlation to find the index with the highest corr elation.  If this index didnít match the known value an error w as recorded  This simulation was repeated one million  times for each     level of -20 to -8 dB.  The simulation results can be seen on Figure 3   Figure 3 ñ Frame Marker Identification Error Rate under AWGN  At      of 8 dB the Frame Marker is misidentified 1 in 10,000 trials which is an acceptable level for eve n the lowest rate turbo code operating at      of -7.87 dB with its own Codeword error rate of 10 4 This simulation shows that the CCSDS designed Frame Marker is acceptable for all codes considered in this VCM design Frame Descriptor Error The next simulation was to test the frame descripto r performance under the same noisy conditions to ensu re that the receiver will demodulate and decode using the r ight mode This simulation assumes that the frame marke r was correctly detected.  The simulation randomly select s one of the 32 frame descriptors simulates a noisy channel  with AWGN decodes the noisy received frame descriptor and checks if it was correctly detected.  This simulati on is then repeated 1 million times for six      levels 9 to 4 dB which are the noisy conditions expected under opera tion of this VCM system The receiver demodulation and decoding process of t he frame descriptor utilized a lookup table of all 32 unique frame descriptors stored in a 32 by 64 matrix d in their BSPK format of n  with    denoting the i th bit in the frame descriptor for the j th VCM mode  Finding largest inner-product between the noisy input signal and al l 32 frame descriptors yields the frame descriptor with the minimum distance to the received frame descriptor  0-1   2      34 5 6   Figure 4 below shows the results of this simulation   Figure 4 ñ Frame Descriptor Identification Error Ra te under AWGN  The simulation shows unacceptable error rates for f rame descriptor identification for the same low signal l evels that at which the turbo codes are designed to work.  The 64 bit code described from the CCSDS standards is actually  generated using a 32,6 code which is simply doubl ed to create a 64,6 code This means that the frame de scriptor code has the error correction performance of a 6/32  code which will not work with the VCM design when the da ta is coded at a rate of 1/6.  Similarly, the simulation shows that when operating at      of 4.5 dB the frame descriptor would be misidentified 1 of the time and this wou ld prevent reliable decoding of Turbo 1/6 QPSK codes 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 10 6 10 5 10 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 Es/N0 Error Rate 9 8 7 6 5 4 10 3 10 2 10 1 10 0 Es/N0 Error Rate Es/N0 \(dB Es/N0 \(dB 


 5 There are several solutions to this problem the ob vious choice is to design a new frame descriptor that has  error correcting capabilities surpassing rate 1/6  In th eory a 64,6\ length code might accomplish this Or, the problem could be solved with a more complex receiver  When  the receiver demodulates and decodes the received signa l with the wrong demodulator and/or decoder, it can be dis covered quickly by the failure of the decoder to converge t o a valid codeword, or by the simple fact that the next frame marker does not appear in the expected location Instead of reprocessing data with another mode type  or decoding in parallel this software simulation rece iver was designed to find two frame markers, identify the nu mber of symbols in-between the markers, and deduce the mode from the length  This is a low-complexity high-perform ing solution, and one novel result of the paper This approach relies on the desirable property we d iscussed in Section 2.  Of the 28 modes selected to be explo red, only 24 were implemented, as the original 28 modes had a ll but four unique symbol lengths  Removing four codes wo uld give 24 unique lengths, and as it turned out the fo ur modes removed do not sacrifice VCM performance \(See Desig n for Receiver Frame Marker Synchronization above   Thi s method completely eliminates the need for the recei ver to process the poorly performing frame descriptor sug gesting that the VCM design could eliminate it all together  Overall Data Throughput Performance Low Earth orbiting satellites are great candidates for VCM communications with primary ground stations due to  a varying link geometry and a fixed power budget.  Th is paper looks at the performance of using three different s ets of VCM codes for a CubeSat mission The simulation input requires a link budget that de scribes the       vs time for the duration of the pass  For this research Satellite Tool Kit software by Analytical Graphics Inc. was used to describe the link budget of a pola r orbiting CubeSat at 600 km with a primary ground station in Fairbanks AK  Two passes were generated with cons tant parameters for antenna gain and transmit power leve ls, with the only difference being the passís maximum elevat ion Two pass types were analyzed a near overhead pass at 80 degrees maximum elevation and a slightly shorter pa ss with only 35 degrees maximum elevation  The 80 degree p ass exhibits a minimum     of -2.76 dB at the horizon and a maximum of 11.93 dB with a total time of 635 secon ds The 35 degree pass exhibits a minimum     of -2.79 dB at the horizon and a maximum of 7.89 dB with a sli ghtly shorter time of 591 seconds The two sets of pass data was then simulated with t hree sets of VCM codes The 24 VCM modes from Table 1 labeled  CCSDS Digital Video Broadcasting Satellite Second Generation for single carrier per transponder label ed DVBS2 and the SCCC Encoder codes described in 3   VCM mode switching thresholds were calculated using each modeís respective minimum      for a codeword error rate of 10 4 5  7    Additionally the simulation calculates the maximum  fixed throughput using only one of the VCM modes  VCM improvement is calculated by dividing the VCM throu ghput by the fixed mode throughput.  Table 2 shows the ad vantage of using VCM for these CubeSat passes and the compa rison between all three VCM coding sets.  This simulation uses a fixed symbol rate of 9600 kilo symbols per second   Table 2 ñ Coding Comparisons and VCM Improvement Pass Elevation Pass Time \(s Code Set Fixed Throughput Mbits VCM Throughput Mbits VCM Improvement 35 591 CCSDS 3,437 6,564 1.91 35 591 DVBS2 2,909 5,482 1.88 35 591 SCCC 3,315 5,732 1.73 80 635 CCSDS 3,878 8,502 2.19 80 635 DVBS2 3,657 7,068 1.93 80 635 SCCC 3,704 7,722 2.08  The simulations showed that all three sets of codes  double or nearly double the overall throughput  The VCM d esign is able to take advantage of the 80 degree passís h igher variation in      and exhibit more improvement Additionally the CCSDS set of codes slightly outpe rform SCCC and DVBS2 in total throughput  This can be attributed to the turbo codes which are able to ope rate when the link is the poorest, whereas both SCCC and DVBS 2 are unable to utilize the link at all during the times the satellite is on the horizon Doubling the data throughput is a significant accomplishment for VCM and presents evidence that t his system will be a valued asset in space communicatio ns Figures 5 and 6 are visual comparisons of fixed mod e communications vs VCM for the CCSDS codes showing the 80 and 35 degree passes respectively.  Table 3 indicates the subset of VCM modes used in the 80 degree pass   As can be seen the rate 1/6 turbo code is used only b riefly 1.4% of the pass\, corresponding to the very begin ning and end of the pass  The highest rate code C2 is not  used because, as it happens in this idealized example, a lower rate code together with a higher order modulation produc es a higher throughput  For receivers which incur signi ficantly higher losses for the higher order modulations, C2 may play a larger role in the VCM system

T his will help communication systems using VCM at low symbol rates and ensure proper mode transitioning for prop er transmission at all noise levels A Word About VCM vs. Adaptive Data Rates It is worth pointing out that fixed coded modulatio n in combination with adaptive data rates is also a good means to increase throughput in dynamic conditions.  There i s already a CCSDS standard for proximity links ñ orbiter to o rbiter or orbiter to lander links ñ which describes this appr oach.  It is currently in use by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter  MRO\, for example VCM and adaptive data rates are complementary tools  to increase throughput  As conditions improve one ma y adaptively increase the data rate, typically up to some limit The limit may arise because of spectral constraints   Each doubling of the data rate doubles the spectral occu pancy after all.  Or, the limit may simply reflect the li mitations of the spacecraft  MRO has a maximum symbol rate of 6  Msps, for example VCM provides the extra flexibility to operate at hi gh throughputs beyond the point at which adaptive data  rate technology  has reached its spectral or symbol rate limit.  In this way low data rates may be doubled doubled ag ain etc using adaptive data rates until a symbol rat e limit is reached, at which point a VCM system at this fixed system may be applied, using higher code rates and/or high er order modulations 


 7 5  S UMMARY  The purpose of this paper was to introduce a modifi ed VCM system design for near and deep space communication s Software simulation of this design was performed to  determine throughput improvements and verify the feasibility of the whole design  Problems with fra me descriptor identification were resolved by unique l ength VCM modes and inferring the VCM mode though frame marker spacing.  The simulation looked at an exampl e of a varying communications link polar orbiting CubeSat s Simulation showed that the proposed VCM system roug hly doubles throughput and slightly outperforms similar  VCM codes like SCCC and DVBS2  Future work for the proposed VCM system includes eliminating the frame descriptor from transmission developing an optimal  mode selection algorithm, and developing the proposed sy stem in hardware specifically for CubeSat application A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  The research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology und er a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the University of Alaska Fairban ks College of Engineering and Mines funded in part by  the Alaska Space Grant Program R EFERENCES  1  J   C u t t l e r  a n d  J   M a n n    G l o b a l  G r o u n d  S t a t i o n  Survey 5 th  Annual CubeSat Developers Workshop  August 2008 http://gs.engin.umich.edu/documents/Mann_etal_2008 pd f 2  M   C a f f r e y    E x p l o i t i n g  L i n k  D y n a m i c s  i n  L E O t o Ground Communications 6 th  Annual CubeSat Developerís Workshop  San Luis Obispo CA 2009 http://www.cubesat.org/images/cubesat/presentations Dev elopersWorkshop2009/4_Comm/2_CaffreyLink_Dynamics.pdf 3  F l e x i b l e  A d v a n c e d  C o d i n g  a n d  M o d u l a t i o n  S c h e m e  for High Rate Telemetry Applications CCSDS 131.2-B-1 Blue Book Issue 1 March 2012 http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/131x2b 1.pdf 4  T M  S y n c h r o n i z a t i o n  a n d  C h a n n e l  C o d i n g    C C S D S  131.0-B-2  Blue Book Issue 2 August 2011 http://public.ccsds.org/publications/archive/131x0b 2ec1.p df 5  J   H a m k i n s    P e r f o r m a n c e  o f  l o w d e n s i t y  p a r i t y check coded modulation Aerospace Conference 2010 IEEE  vol., no., pp.1-14, 6-13 March 2010 6  S   O l i v i e r i    M o d u l a r  F P G A B a s e d  S o f t w a r e  D e f i n ed Radio for CubeSats Worcester Polytechnic Institut e May 2011  7  D i g i t a l  V i d e o  B r o a d c a s t i n g   D V B    S e c o n d  g e n e r ation framing structure, channel coding and modulation sy stems for Broadcasting Interactive Services News Gather ing and other broadband satellite applications ETSI EN  302 307, v1.1.2,2006 B IOGRAPHIES   Thomas A Sielicki  received a B.S degree in electrical engineering from the University of Virginia in 2010.
