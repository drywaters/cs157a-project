A Remote Sensing Images processing in single machine 
       
The appearance of our UAV \(AS-4\ is shown in Fig. 1 and related specification is in the following: maximum carried weight is 15 KGs; maximum altitude is 10,000 feet about 3000m\; it can fly one-hour with standard oil box range is 30 KM radius; and the highest speed is 100 KM/h   Figure 2 R ELATED W ORK  In this section, we studied and executed remote sensing image processing in single machine and cloud computing environment There are many unsupervised classification algorithms    9 w hi c h ha ve b e e n w i d e l y use d i n t h e cl a ssi fi c a t i o n of remote sensing image. Two of most frequently used algorithms are K-means [4 1 2], [13] a n d I S O D A T A 16  In this paper, the input of image processing is a color remote sensing image, a set of pixels each of which represented by RGB value. We apply the transformation of each pixel from 4   T h ey tran s f e r e ach  pix el f r om R G Bv alu e t o L  a b  value where L is a brightness layer and can be ignored, a indicates where color falls along the red-green axis, and b indicates where color falls along the blue-yellow axis In this section, we demonstrate how to use these images in a single machine by real case. Firstly, a researcher can retrieve one image from the repository returned by AS-4 in Fig. 6. Then, this paper implements normal steps referred to  f pro ce ssing cluster ing for one image as follows 1 Read image form aerial image repository 2 Image transformation \(RGB L*a*b 3 Extract a pair \(a*, b*\of each pixel in above step and keep them in an array 4 Apply clustering algorithm \(K-means is used here 5 Label every pixel in the image using the results from K-MEANS 6 Clusters are done and rendered on a graphics layer 
Related modules of AS-4 Since AS-4 is configured with the related modules given in Fig. 2, UAV can shoot high-resolution picture or HD movie with camera in sky, and we can control UAV by realtime monitoring software in Fig. 3 installed in the personal computer on the ground. Consequently, rescue workers can also plan a flight path and shoot information of the disaster area   Figure 3 Automatic flying system in ground control station Fig. 4 depicts the flight path of UAV \(CP01-START POINT is the start of the shot\ after the take-off point in Taichung City of Taiwan   Figure 4 The flight path of AS-4 in Taichung city of Taiwan After shooting multiple images, the subsequent images can be mosaicked into a large high-resolution image, so that the researchers can get the overall picture of the environment in the following Fig. 5. Meanwhile, system will keep metadata of each aerial photo \(ex. *.jgw of *.jpg and *.tfw of tiff  Figure 5 Mosaicked aerial images photographed by AS-4 III

IV P ROPOSED F RAME W ORKS  003 Cloud Computing 003  003 Internet 003  003 Computing on the Internet 003 shows a concept that computers can collaborate with each other, and services spread far and wide In remote sensing images repository, we have lots of highresolution images called as big data, and related services will access these data by standard interface. We encountered some questions that how do we cope with these big data, and users/applications can use them in the following situations: 1 is not easy, 2 are costly, 3 capacity is hard to expand, 4 access makes the poor efficiency result, 5. Ensure of data Therefore, based on these issues and requirements, this paper proposes a cloud computing framework that is suitable for remote sensing images. This framework consists of four major parts and is described as follows. A. User can upload and retrieve aerial images by UAV image Management; B WebGIS used to render aerial images and put a dynamic layer in any web page; C. Data Analysis and processing module is serious part of the framework to store and process images; and D. Cloud Computing Environment is a basic infrastructure. We implement part A and B in section V and test performance of part C and D in section VI  Hadoop WCS WMS WPS Service Interface Data Management Unit HDFS MapReduce Image Retrieval Image Manager User Interface Metadata Unit Image Analysis unit Image Recognition Image Classification Applications OpenLayers Users Cloud Computing Portal Module Data Analysis and Processing Module Cloud Computing Environment HDFS Adapter MapServer 002è\002Ô\002é\002³\002Ü\003\000\002ô\002ú\002ø\003\006 002à\002ô\003\001\002ô\002ú\002ø\003\000\002ø\003\001\003\007 002ê\002ø\002õ\002Ú\002Ü\002  Figure 10 UAV Image Management is a system for users to upload images and manage these images afterwards. This system includes image retrieval and image manager by the user interface. An image retrieval system is a web system for browsing, searching and retrieving images from the database of aerial images repository. Most traditional and common methods of image retrieval utilize some methods of adding metadata to the images so that retrieval can be performed over the annotation words. Manual image annotation is timeconsuming, laborious and expensive; to address this, there has been a large amount of research done on automatic image annotation. By Image Manager, user can upload related images, and all uploaded images stored in the data warehouse WebGIS is an interface that can accept users parameters setting and show the relevant map information that adds layer objects to your map by OpenLayers [19  T h e presentation should communicate with the service interface by standard of OGC; that is, WCS, WMS, and WPS OpenLayers … Google Maps gives you a quick and easy way to add maps to your Web site, but when you're using Google's API, your ability to display other data is limited. If you have your own data you want to display, or data from sources other than Google, OpenLayers, an open source JavaScript library, can give you more options. OpenLayers works either with data you're serving yourself, using a package such as GeoServer or MapServer, or with data others are publishing via WMS WCS … The OGC Web Coverage Service \(WCS allows for the publication of coveragesŽ- digital geospatial information representing space-varying phenomena WMS … A Web Map Service \(WMS\is a standard protocol for serving georeferenced map images over the Internet that are generated by a map server using data from a GIS database WPS … The Web Processing Service \(WPS Interface Standard provides rules for standardizing how inputs and outputs \(requests and responses\ for geospatial processing services, such as polygon overlay. The standard also defines how a client can request the execution of a process, and how the output from the process is handled. It defines an interface that facilitates the publishing of geospatial processes and clients discovery of and binding to those processes  An image retrieval system is a computer system for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large database of digital images. MapServer [17  is  a po pu la r  Open Source project which purpose is to display dynamic spatial maps over the Internet. HDFS adapter we proposed holds a feature to mount HDFS as a file system. Image Classification utilizes Mahout [18  t o p r o cess  im ag e clustering  Under cloud computing environment, we clustered 2dimensional points that are the values of a* and b* discussed above and applied KMeansDriver of Mahout to image classification module in Fig. 10 and computed similarity by EuclideanDistanceMeasure. For more details, refer to the book of Mahout by Owen, Anil, Dunning, and Friedman

IMPLEMENTATION  By uploading images to the data warehouse in HDFS Researchers can query images by year, country, town, and village to obtain query results. Then these images can be fully or partially downloaded as a zip file in the following prototype. Furthermore, image processing module executed in back-end and this module integrates with MapServer [17   through the front-end of the display interface, showing layers of overlapping effects in part B of this section Implementation of Part A in Fig. 10 Fig. 12 summarized the results of querying data from warehouse of UAV in the cloud computing environment in GIS Research Center of Feng Chia University These photos were taken in Fengshan Village, Alishan Town Chiayi County, Taiwan after Typhoon Morakot in 2009-0817. Researchers can download these images as a zip file   Figure 12 Query results of UAV photographed in Alishan area of Taiwan Implementation of Part B in Fig. 10 by OpenLayers [19  VI EXPERIMENTATION  There were 2 difficulties confronted during the experiment. The first is the storage of large number of aerial image, and second is image processing. In this section, we just test the performance of storing and accessing image files in local file system and HDFS \(replication = 1\. We simulated four types of datasets \(100 files included in each dataset\depicted in Fig. 14: \(a\ormal Distribution with average of around 5MB and a standard deviation of around 1MB in dataset 1; \(b\ew to Left with eighty percent of 13MB; \(c\w to Right with eighty percent of 8-10MB; and d\Peak in Left and Right with forty percent of 1-3MB and forty percent of 8-10MB. And we also simulated the number of threads \(10, 20, 30, 40, and 50\o test concurrent users in writing and reading performance

Our cluster environment includes one NameNode and four DataNode, and each node equipped with 8 × 2.53 GHz CPU, 4 GB RAM, 1 TB disk space  In Fig. 15 and Fig. 16, the results revealed that read/write performance in four kinds of data sets. Compare HDFS with local file system performance, the HDFS writing performance is lower than the local file system in  Fig. 15\(a and Fig. 15\(b\d  the HDFS reading performance is lower than the local file system in  Fig. 16\(a\d Fig. 16\(b These results delivered that local file system outperforms than HDFS in Normal Distribution and Skew to Left   However, it is noteworthy that write/read performance of HDFS increases as concurrent users increase. Overall, the results have been very positive; that is, HDFS can serve more threads and have better performance than the file system in data set \(8-10 MB\eschrittene indicated HDFS writing performance scales well on both small and data set in  r experiments also confirm this trend, especially in the threads more than 40. The write/read performance of HDFS is better than the local file system in the situation of larger files most files range in size from 8 MB to 10 MB\d a large number of threads \(threads equals to 40 or 50  a\ Data Set 1: Normal Distribution   b\Set 2: Skew to Left  c\ Data Set 3: Skew to Right   d\Set 4: Peak in Left and Right Figure 14 C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  Based on the remote sensing images from UAV by GIS of FCU, we proposed a cloud-based framework for massive remote sensing image storage and process. We have also demonstrated how to process real sensing image by Matlab and ENVI in a single machine and by Mahout in a cloud computing environment. This framework also implements image management by communicating with metadata unit and data management unit; furthermore, prototype WebGIS can accept users parameters setting and show the relevant map information of MapServer included clustering result by OpenLayers. Finally, we utilize four types of data distribution and simulate concurrent users by threads to test massive image files in writing and reading performance in local file system and Hadoop HDFS A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan, under grant NSC100-2625-M-035-003, NSC1002119-M-035-001, NSC101-2625-M-035-002, and NSC1012119-M-035-003 R EFERENCES  1

DistGreedyCSS 
 The use of the distributed CSS algorithm extends the original algorithm proposed by C ivril and Magdon-Ismail to work on distributed matrices In order to allow ef“cient implementation on MapReduce the number of leading singular vectors is set of   is the distributed column subset selection method described in Algorithm 4 For all experiments the dimension of the random projection matrix is set to  This makes the size of the concise representation the same as the DistApproxSVD method Two types of random matrices are used for random projection 1 a dense Gaussian random matrix rnd and 2 a sparse random sign matrix ssgn For the methods that require the calculations of Singular Value Decomposition SVD the Stochastic SVD SSVD algorithm is used to approximate the leading singular values and vectors of the data matrix The use of SSVD signi“cantly reduces the run time of the original SVDbased algorithms while achieving comparable accuracy In the conducted experiments the SSVD implementation of Mahout was used Table II shows the run times and relative accuracies for different CSS methods It can be observed from the table that for the data set the DistGreedyCSS methods with random Gaussian and sparse random sing matrices outperforms all other methods in terms of relative accuracies In addition the run times of both of them are relatively small compared to the DistApproxSVD method which achieves accuracies that are close to the DistGreedyCSS method Both the DistApproxSVD and DistGreedyCSS methods achieve very good approximation accuracies compared to randomized and hybrid methods It should also be noted that using a sparse random sign matrix for random projection takes much less time than a dense Gaussian matrix while achieving comparable approximation accuracies Based on this observation the sparse random matrix has been used with the data set For the data set although the DistApproxSVD achieves slightly higher approximation accuracies than DistGreedyCSS with sparse random sign matrix the DistGreedyCSS selects columns in almost one-third of the time The reason why the DistApproxSVD outperforms DistGreedyCSS for this data set is that its rank is relatively small less than 1024 This means that using the leading 100 singular values to represent the concise representation of the data matrix captures most of the information in the matrix and accordingly is more accurate than random projection The DistGreedyCSS however still selects a very good subset of columns in a relatively small time IX C ONCLUSION This paper proposes an accurate and ef“cient MapReduce algorithm for selecting a subset of columns from a massively distributed matrix The algorithm starts by learning a concise representation of the data matrix using random projection It then selects columns from each sub-matrix that best approximate this concise approximation A centralized selection step is then performed on the columns selected from different sub-matrices In order to facilitate the implementation of the proposed method a novel algorithm for greedy generalized CSS is proposed to perform the selection from different submatrices In addition the different steps of the algorithms are carefully designed to be MapReduce-ef“cient Experiments on big data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and ef“ciency of the proposed algorithm in comparison to other CSS methods when implemented on distributed data R EFERENCES  A K Jain and R C Dubes

messages seen for all workers in a superstep \(Figures 10 and 13\. When looking at the messages sent by workers in a superstep for METIS, we see that there are message load imbalances within work ers in a superstep, caused due to concentration of vertices being traversed in that superstep in certain partitions This variability is much more pronounced in CP as compared to WG \(Figures 11 and 14\ E.g. in superstep 9 for CP, twice as many messages \(4M\ are generated by a worker compared to another \(2M\.  For Pregel BSP, the time taken in a superstep is determined by the slowest worker in that superstep. Hence increase d variability in CP causes even goodŽ partitioning strategies to cause an increase in total execution time wh en using the Pregel/BSP model VIII A NALYSIS OF E LASTIC C LOUD S CALING  Cloud environments offer elasticity … the ability to scale-out or scale-in VMs on-demand and only pay for what one uses [28   On th e f l i p s i de  on e en ds u p  paying for VMs that are acquired even if they are underutilized. We have already shown the high variation in compute/memory resources used by algorithms like BC and APSP across different supersteps. While our earlier swath initiation heuristics attempt to flatten these out by overlapping swath executions, one can consider leveraging the clouds elasticity to, instead, scale up and down the concurrent workers \(and graph partitions\ allocated in each superstep The peak and trough nature of resource utilization combined with Pregel/BSPs synchronous barrier between supersteps offers a window for dynamic scaleout and …in at superstep boundaries. Peak supersteps can greatly benefit from additional workers, while those same workers will contribute to added synchronization overhead for trough supersteps We offer an analysis of the potential benefits of elastic scaling by extrapolating from observed results for running BC on WG and CP graphs, using four and eight workers.  To provide a fair and focused comparison, we turned off swath heuristics in favor of fixed swath sizes and initiation intervals Figure 15 \(Bottom\ plots the speedup of BC running on eight workers when normalized to BC running on four workers, at corresponding supersteps.  The number of workers does not impact the number of supersteps We also plot the number of active vertices \(i.e. vertices still computing for a given swath\these supersteps which is a measure of how much work is required \(Fig 15 \(Top\. We find that we occasionally get superlinear speedup spikes \(i.e. >2x\ that shows a strong correlation with the peaks of active messages, for both WG and CP graphs. At other times, the sp eedup is sublinear or even a speed-down \(i.e. <1\responding to inactive vertices.  The superlinear speedup is attributable to the lower contention and reduced memory pressure for 8 workers when the active vertices peak \(similar to what we observed for the swath initiation heuristics Similarly, the below par speedup during periods of low activity is contributed by the increased overhead of barrier synchronization across 8 workers. Intuitively, by dynamically scaling up the number of workers for supersteps with peaking active vertices and scaling them down otherwise, we can leverage the superlinear speedup and get more value per worker Using a threshold of 50% active vertices as the threshold condition for between 4 and 8 workers in a superstep, we extrapolate the time per superstep and compared this to the fixed 4 and 8 worker runtimes. We also compute the best-case run time using an oracleŽ approach to i.e. for each superstep, we pick the minimum of the 4 or 8 workers time.  Note that these projections do not yet consider the overheads of scaling, but are rather used to estimate the potential upside if we had an ideal or an automated heuristic for scaling. The total time estimates for running BC on WG and CP graphs, normalized to

observed time taken using 4 workers, are plotted in Figures 16\(A\ and 16\(B We see that our dynamic scaling heuristic using the percentage of active vertices achieves nearly the same CP\ or better \(WG\ performance as a fixed 8 worker approach. Clearly there is benefit of using fewer workers for low utilization su persteps to eliminate the barrier synchronization overhead. Also, the dynamic scaling heuristic performs almost as well as the ideal scaling. Finally, when we consider the monetary cost of the proposed approaches, assuming a pro-rata normalized cost per VM-second plotted on the secondary Y axis, we see that dynamic scaling is comparable \(CP\ or cheaper \(WG\ than a 4 worker scenario while offering the performance of an 8 worker deployment IX C ONCLUSION  In conclusion, we introduce optimization and heuristics for controlling memory utilization and show they are critical to performance.  By breaking computation into swaths of vertices and using our sizing heuristics we achieve up to 3.5x speedup over the maximum swath size that does not cause the a failure.  In addition overlapping swath executions can provide a 24% gain with automated heuristics and even greater speedup when a priori knowledge of the network characteristics is applied This evaluation offers help to eScience users to make framework selection and cost-performancescalability trade-offs. Our he uristics are generalizable and can be leveraged by other BSP and distributed graph frameworks, and for graph applications beyond BC. Our work uncovered an unexpected impact of partitioning and it would be worthwhile, in future, to examine the ability to pred ict, given certain graph properties, a suitable partitioning model for Pregel/BSP It may also be useful to perform such evaluations on larger graphs and more numbers of VMs. At the same time, it is also worth considering if non-linear graph algorithms are tractable in pr actice for large graphs in a distributed environment B IBLIOGRAPHY  1  F  L i lj er os C   Ed l i n g L  A m a r a l H  S t an ley   and Y    berg The web of human sexual contacts
