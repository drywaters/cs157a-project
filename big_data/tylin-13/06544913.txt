Statistical Machine Learning has undergone a phase transition from a pure academic endeavor to being one of the main drivers of modern commerce and science Even more so recent results such as those on tera scale learning  1  and on very large neural networks  2  suggest that scale is an important ingredient in quality modeling. This tutorial  introduces current applications techniques and systems with the aim of cross fertilizing research between the database and machine learning  communities  The tutorial covers current large scale applications of Machine Learning their computational model and the workflow behind 
building those. Based on this foundation, we present the current state of the art in systems support in the bulk of t he tutorial. We also identify critical gaps in the state of the art. This leads to the closing of the seminar where we introduce two sets of open research questions Better systems support for the already established use cases of Machine Learning and supp ort for recent advances in Machine Learning research  I  I NTRODUCTION  The democratization of data has fueled the collection of \(even more!\ massive data sets. Platforms for large scale analytics are being built for extracting insights that enhance services an 
d optimize operations However the current suite of platforms can only capture a small fraction of machine learning algorithms at scale. Those that fall out of scope induce solutions that abuse the intended programming model or motivate the implementation  of a separate system. This leads to production pipelines built out of bailing wire and glue code for moving data in and out of different subsystems. The problem is further complicated by the assumption that each system assumes ownership of the entire mach ine or at best the VM forcing administrators to divide the cluster into machine subsets assigning a single system to each Resource negotiators like YARN  3  
and Mesos  4  are being built to addres s this problem with a thin virtualization layer that multiplexes higher level systems on a single unified machine cluster.  Yet, the data scientist is still left with the problem of finding the right system and programming model for their data analysis tas k, assuming one even exists, and staging their solution in production  We believe that the database community can provide the appropriate data management toolkits for the data scientist to operate at scale Large scale distributed machine learning techn iques involve many of the same issues parallel databases faced decades ago specifically efficient shared nothing architectures that support a relational algebra programming 
model Machine learning algorithms also have characteristics most notably recurs ion that fall directly in the scope of deductive database query processing techniques And finally we see a longer term need for real time learning support, which will leverage work from streaming database systems  This seminar aims to inform the databa se community about typical use cases and workflows in the machine learning domain. One goal in particular is to highlight the differences to traditional data processing and thus to outline potential research topics. Examples include   The need for iteration Machine Learning algorithms almost exclusively are iterative  
 Non standard fault tolerance policies: Some machine learning algorithms can deal with unavailable partitions   Aggregation functions over very large objects: many machine learning algorithms in volve the aggregation of objects whose size is in the same order of magnitude as the available main memory  We hope that this seminar adds to the ongoing alignment of machine learning and database research. In fact, presenters of this seminar have in the past taken part in similar tutorials to both the machine learning and database communities both within companies and universities as well as at conferences Most recently Markus Weimer co  
ICDE Conference 2013 
presented the tutorial on   5  at WWW 2012, which shares some content with this seminar proposal  II  T ARGET A UDIENCE  The seminar is targeted at database systems practitioners and researchers who are interested in the application of machine learning in Big Data analytics as well as research on systems that support large scale machine learning. The seminar does not require prior familiarity with machine learning techniques  1242

    III  S EMINAR O UTLINE  The seminar is structured into three sections moving from machine le arning practice and theory to current systems support for machine learning at scale, to a research agenda for the database community  A  Machine Learning Applications and Practice  In this part of the seminar, we present a quick overview over the theory and more importantly, practice of machine learning The goal of this section is to give the audience a grasp of the typical uses of and challenges faced by machine learning in practice  Drawing from the industrial expertise of the presenters in large and small  machine learning deployments we develop a prototypical workflow of machine learning projects This workflow consists of three phases Example Formation  Modeling and Deployment We ground the modeling phase in the machine learning literature and introdu ce the Statistical Query Model  6  that underlies many machine learning algorithms and their scalable implementations  1  7 We also discuss the data plumbing  that goes into a typical machine learning project as well as part of the feature extraction and the deployment phases of the workflow.  We present this workflow using example applications familiar to the audience such as email spam filtering and server ha rdware fault prediction  B  Systems  support for \(large scale\ Machine Learning today  In this section, we discuss the various tools and systems used by machine learning practitioners today in more detail We cover this material according to the prototypical wo rkflow introduced above a Example Formation b Modeling and learning and \(c\ Deployment  For Example Formation  we cover the use of Pig  8  MapReduce  9 databases and scripting  The tools for Modeling  and learning are discussed based on their computational model We start with relational algebra inspired systems: MapReduce and its use in Mahout 10  and Spark  11 We then introduce approaches that are grounded in numerical computation using VW  1  as the example. Lastly we discuss graph processing inspired approaches: Pregel  12  and its Open Source implementation Giraph  13  and GraphLab  14   Deployment  is very application specific but we cover examples from the domains of recommender systems and spam filters for email in addition to the running example of machine fa ult prediction  We close this section with a discussion of some of the gaps in current systems with respect to their support for large scale machine learning  C  Open Research Issues  In this last section we outline open problems for large scale machine learn ing and how they relate to database research. This section is split into two aspects  Better systems support for the approaches covered in this seminar  Those open problems include: \(1\ Query and runtime optimizers for iterative distributed programs 2 Declarative specifications and optimizers for asynchronous computations and 3 Semantic models of non standard fault tolerance policies. While each of these has been studied in the past, the specifics of machine learning computation and the latter's importance in Big Data analysis make it worthwhile directing the attention of the database community towards them  Systems support for recent results in mach ine learning research  Approaches such as deep belief networks  15  16  and graphical models have recently received lots of attention in the machine learning community  2  and even the mainstream media  17  However their systems support is currently severely lacking due to their high communication load. We give an overview of those challenges and the current state of the art solutions, as we ll as their shortcomings  It is our hope that this section fosters the convergence of machine learning and databases inside big data systems  IV  B IOGRAPHIES  A  Tyson Condie  Tyson Condie  is a principal scientist with the Cloud and Information Services Lab at Microsoft.

throughput fairness among users and typically give them only a verage throughput fairness Indeed when m  0 the weighted sum-rate maximization problem reduces to normal sum-rate maximisation problem without any fairness consideration The scalar valued a k are constants to allow different throughput requirements among users The variable 030 is an appropiate small value for ensuring that the denominator is non-zero The value 026 c k  t  is the moving average of past throughput for user k which is updated as 026 c k  t   1 000 1 013  026 c k  t 000 1  1 013 C k  t 000 1  13 where 013 is the smoothing factor and C k  t 000 1 is the data rate of user k at time t  The scalar 026 C avg  t  in 12 is de\002ned as 026 C  t   1 K  K X k 1 026 c k  t  14 Any user with a k 026 c k  t   026 C  t  has a value less than 1 as its weight In this case that user might be excluded from a selected user set for transmission by weighted sum rate maximisation rule for meeting the throughput fairness constraint among MTs despite its high channel gain From time-slot two onwards the scheduling algorithm also takes in account the throughput fairness metric as described by equation 12  So as it is evident from the algorithm proposed for 002rst iteration the algorithm searches to maximize the throughput fair largest channel gain of user Once the 002rst MT is chosen in the 002rst iteration then the algorithm tries to include a single MT in every other iteration based on the maximisation of the Fair-SLNR criterion In the calculation of Fair-SLNR only the leakage power to MTs selected in the previous iteration is considered and also the throughput fairness metric for that user The throughput fairness metric takes the QoS demanded by the user into account The no of iterations per time slot is equal to the number of transmitting antennas at the CAN as stated before After scheduling the HCC broadcasts data streams of selected users using leakagebased precoding For the ease of readability the pseudo code of the algorithm is also provided in this paper which is just a mere abstraction from our previous work In the algorithm the imperfect CSIT is however taken into account and modi\002ed accordingly A comparative study on how FairSLNR scheduling algorithm fares against the Greedy-SLNR and the Random scheduling scheme can be found in our previous work V L OWER B OUND ON ACHIEVABLE SUM RATE In this section we provide a lower bound for the achievable sum rate of the system per time-slot If we replace h k of 1 by 024 h k as we only have knowledge of modi\002ed equivalent channel matrices after MMSE estimation so we can write it as follow 024 r k  t   024 h k  t  024 b k  t  x k  t   024 h k  t  X i 6  k 024 b i  t  x i  t   w k  t   024 h k  t  u k  t   X i 6  k 024 h k  t  u i  t   w k  t  15 Algorithm 1 F air-SLNR based scheduling TIME-SLOT t=1  I nitialization  S 1  f 036 g   S 1  f 1  2   K g  s 1 1  argmax k 2  S 1 j 024 h k 1 j 2  S 1  S 1 S f s 1 1 g   S 1   S 1 000 f s 1 1 g  for j=1:N-1 do 024  H j 1   024 h T s 1 1  024 h T s j S 1 j 1  T  while f or each k 2  S 1 do f ind b opt k 1 normalise b opt k 1 to unity  f ind SLN R mod k 1 end while s j 1 1  argmax k 2  S 1 f SLN R k 1 g  S 1  S 1 S f s j 1 1 g   S 1   S 1 000 f s j 1 1 g  end for TIME-SLOT t=n n  1   Initialization  S  n   f 036 g   S  n   f 1  2   K g  s 1  n   argmax k 2  S  n  026 k  n  j 024 h k  n  j 2  S  n   S  n  S f s 1  n  g   S  n    S  n  000 f s 1  n  g  for j=1:N-1 do 024  H j  n    024 h T s 1  n   024 h T s j S  n  j  n   T  while f or each k 2  S  n  do f ind b opt k  n  normalise b opt k  n  to unity  f ind F air 000 SLN R k  n   026 k  n  003 SLN R mod k  n  end while s j 1  n   argmax k 2  S  n  f F air 000 SLN R k  n  g  S  n   S  n  S f s j 1  n  g   S  n    S  n  000 f s j 1  n  g  end for where u k  t  r epresents the precoded signal that is being transmitted The data rate of MT k ignoring the time-index can be given as follow Rate k  I  u k  024 r k  16 Now taking P i 6  k 024 h k u i  w k as the resultant total noise term owing to the interference and the desired MTs receiver noise and representing it as n k we have 024 r k  024 h k u k  n k 17 Thus Rate k can be given as Rate k  E 024 h k log 022 1  j 024 h k j 2 1 N  E  n k n 003 k j 024 h k  023 025 E 024 h k l og 022 j 024 h k j 2 1 N  E  n k n 003 k j 024 h k  023  18 The inequality in equation 18 is because we assume high snr regime We replaced above E  j u k j 2  by 1 N  Thus Rate k 025 E 024 h k log 000 j 024 h k j 2 1 N  001 000 E 024 h k log 000 E  n k n 003 k j 024 h k  001 19 The inequality in 19 assumes that the resultant noise is Gaussian distributed which is the worst case possible noise distribution So replacing the resultant distribution with any other distribution will perform better Applying Jensen's Inequality we have
