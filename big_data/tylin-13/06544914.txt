enti\002es a range of open problems for the community I I NTRODUCTION The Big Data era is the inevitable consequence of our ability to generate collect and store digital data at an unpreceden ted scale and our concomitant desire to analyze and extract val ue from this data in making data-driven decisions to alter all aspects of society Big Data comes with a lot of promises 226 as a Dilbert cartoon would have it 223It comes from everywhere It knows all.\224 1 This data is being collected today in a large variety of domains Examples include Web text and documents Web logs large-scale e-commerce social networks sensor net works astronomy genomics medical records surveillanc 
e etc 2 Since the value of data explodes when it can be linked and fused with other data to create a uni\002ed representation big data integration BDI is critical to realizing the prom ise of Big Data For example to understand habitat utilization and animal behavior in reaction to external forces such as weath er marine animal researchers need to combine animal tracking data with bathymetric meteorological sea surface temper ature and animal habitat data 3 BDI differs from traditional data integration which inclu des virtual integration and materialized warehousing in many dimensions 017 Volume Not only can each data source contain a huge volume of data but also the number of data sources 
1 http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2012-07-29 2 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big data 3 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data fusion even for a single domain has grown to be in the tens of thousands For example in the recent work by Dalvi et al 6  w h e r e they analyze the nature and distribution of structured data on the Web they studied many domains e.g restaurants automotive libraries schools hotels and showed that each domain has tens of thousands of sources on the Web This is much higher than the number of data sources considered in traditional data integration 017 Velocity As a direct consequence of the rate at which 
data is being collected and continuously made available many of the data sources are very dynamic For example there are many data sources that provide near real time continuously changing information about the stock market including bid and ask prices volume of shares traded etc Providing an integrated view of stock market data across all these data sources is beyond the ability of traditional methods for data integration 017 Variety Data sources even in the same domain are extremely heterogeneous both at the schema level regarding how they structure their data and at the instance level regarding how they describe the same real-world entity exhibiting considerable variety even for substantially si m 
ilar entities For schema-level variety in the recent work by Li et al 32  a s t u d y o f 5 5 s o u r c e s i n t h e s t o c k m a r k e t d o m a i n identi\002ed 153 global attributes that are manually matched from 333 local attributes The number of providers for each global attribute observes Zipf's law with 13.7 of the attributes provided by at least one third of the sources and over 86 of attributes provided by fewer than 25 of the sources For instance-level variety Guo et al 20 s h o w e d t h a t f o r b u s i n e s s l i s t i n g s  t h e n u m b e r of distinct business names is typically twice as many as the number of distinct businesses in a zipcode Similarly an early study 34 o n G o o g l e B a s e s h o w e d t h a t j u s t f o r vehicle color there are over 250 different colors provided 
as values including very speci\002c ones such as 223polished pewter\224 and 223light almond pearl metallic.\224 017 Veracity Data sources even in the same domain are of widely differing qualities with signi\002cant differences i n the coverage accuracy and timeliness of data provided For example the work by Dalvi et al 6 s h o w e d t h a t with strong head aggregators such as yelp.com collecting homepage URLs for 70 restaurants that are mentioned by some websites required only 10 sources however collecting URLs for 90 restaurants required 1000 sources

and collecting URLs for 95 restaurants required 5000 sources Similarly the work by Li et al 32 s h o w e d t h a t even in the stock market domain inconsistent values were provided by different sources for over 80 of the data items whose values should be fairly stable such as daily closing price This is consistent with the belief that 2231 in 3 business leaders do not trust the information they use to make decisions.\224 4 This seminar explores the progress that has been made by the data integration community on the topics of schema mapping  record linkage and data fusion discussed in more detail below in addressing these novel challenges faced by BDI We do this using illustrative examples that would be of interest to data management researchers and practitioners  We also identify a range of open problems for the community in integrating a galaxy of data sources II T ARGET A UDIENCE The target audience for this seminar is anyone with an interest in understanding data integration in the Big Data e nvironment In particular this includes the attendees at data base conferences like ICDE The assumed level of mathematical sophistication will be that of the typical conference atten dees III S EMINAR O UTLINE The importance of big data integration has led to a substantial amount of research over the past few years on the topics of schema mapping record linkage and data fusion to deal with the novel challenges faced by big data integration  Table I shows a summary of these techniques Our seminar is example driven and organized as follows A BDI Motivation 10 minutes The seminar will start with a variety of real-world examples illustrating the importance of big data integration build ing on recent work by Dalvi et al 6 a n d L i e t a l   3 2   B BDI Schema Mapping 25 minutes Schema mapping in a data integration system refers to i creating a mediated global schema and ii identifyi ng the mappings between the mediated global schema and the local schemas of the data sources to determine which sets of  attributes contain the same information 41   3    1   Early efforts in integrating a large number of sources involved integrating data from the Deep Web Two types of solutions were proposed The 002rst is to build mappings between Web forms interfaces to query the Deep Web as a means to answer a Web query over all Deep Web sources 5  The second is to crawl and index the Deep Web data 34  35  M o r e r e c e n t e f f o r t s i n c l u d e e x t r a c t i n g a n d i n t e g r a t i ng structured data from Web tables 4   4 0  a n d W e b l i s t s  2 1   15  The number of sources also increases the variety of the data Traditional data integration systems require a signi 002cant schema mapping effort before the system can be used so is 4 http://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/bigdata obviously infeasible when the heterogeneity is at the BDI scale The basic idea of dataspace systems is to provide best-effort services such as simple keyword search over the available data sources at the beginning and gradually evol ve schema mappings and improve search quality over time 16  22   7    8    4 2    2 6    1 7    2 5    4 3   A related notion becoming popular in the Hadoop community is 223schema on read\224 which in contrast to the traditiona l approach of de\002ning the schema before loading data i.e schema on write gives one the freedom to de\002ne the schema after the data has been stored 5 C BDI Record Linkage 25 minutes Record linkage refers to the task of identifying records that refer to the same logical entity across different data sources especially when they may or may not share a common identi\002er across the data sources 24   1 9    3 0    4 6    1 4  Record linkage has traditionally focused on linking a stati c set of structured records that have the same schema In BDI i data sources tend to be heterogeneous in their structure and many sources e.g tweets blog posts provide unstructur ed text data and ii data sources are dynamic and continuousl y evolving These characteristics make record linkage parti cularly challenging in BDI When there are a large number of sources and a large volume of data traditional record linkage approaches beco me inef\002cient and ineffective in practice To address the volume dimension new techniques have been proposed to enable parall el record linkage using MapReduce These include techniques f or adaptive blocking 12   4 4    3 7  a n d t e c h n i q u e s t h a t b a l a nce load among different nodes 29   2 8   When the data sources are dynamic and continuously evolving applying record linkage from scratch for each update becomes unaffordable To address the velocity aspect incremental clustering techniques have been proposed to address this problem 45   3 6   Record linkage between structured and unstructured data sources arises e.g when linking shopping transactions o f people with tweets or blog posts about their shopping experienc e To address the variety aspect techniques have been proposed that tag and match free text to structured data 27  Finally in the BDI environment information is typically more imprecise and noisy To address this veracity aspect a variety of clustering and linkage techniques that are robus t to noise or evolving values have been proposed 31   2 0    2 3   D BDI Data Fusion 20 minutes Data fusion refers to resolving con\003icts from different sources and 002nding the truth that re\003ects the real world 2  11  U n l i k e s c h e m a m a p p i n g a n d r e c o r d l i n k a g e  d a t a f u s i o n is a new 002eld that has emerged only recently Its motivation is exactly the veracity of data the Web has made it easy to publish and spread false information across multiple sourc es 5

It’s  the intelligence of organization  we are talking about   4 Big organization culture entropy reduction theory Big organization culture entropy reduction theory refers to such situation that the innovative abilities of enterprise \(organization individual or smart body  are enhanced when the entropy flux gained on the Platform Ecosystem of the big organization promotes the increase of negative entropy. Therefore, t he culture management of organizational culture system is a process of entropy deduction, which makes  it necessary to gain more entropy flux from the Platform ecosystem of big organization to promote the increase of culture negative entropy in organization al culture system   4 1 The significance of culture entropy change  What cultural entropy of the system revealed is the situation of effective energy in the system. As  an open system far from equilibrium , one organization exchanges energy, material and inf ormation with the environment constantly, and the cultural entropy of the organization therefore keeps changing continuously namely, cultural  entropy change. The  trends of this change will determine the direction of evolution and development of the organi zation  The change of cultural entropy includes both positive entropy change \(entropy increase\ and negative entropy change \(entropy decrease\. Positive and negative entropy change usually work together in the same system for most situation, and  accompany  with whole process of the movement in the system   4 2 Model of culture entropy change   454 


The organizational culture entropy can be displayed in formula 3.1    formula 3.1   Where Q is  the energy of various flow; V is corresponding economic value of each flow; R is a space state variable of organization which can be set to a constant; T is time variable of organization for different stages of development   The culture entropy change ca used by in a certain time interval is displayed in formula 3.2     formula 3.2   Where   ci ES  is culture entropy generated in culture system of individual organiza tion  ce ES  is entropy inflow from platform ecosystem. The difference between  ci ES  and  ce ES  is the culture entropy change in a certain time interval   When 0 c ES 000'\000\037  002  entropy inflow is greater than entropy generated within culture system of individual organization . It indicates that negative  entropy of individual organizational culture system is increasing , toward a direction  of advanced order and more innovative in a growing up status    W hen 0 c ES 000'\000 002  entropy inflow is less than entropy generated within culture system of individual organization. It indicates that positive entropy of individual organizational culture system is increasing , toward a direction  of recession in disorder and confusion statu s   W hen 0 c ES 000'\000 002  entropy inflow equals to entropy generated within culture system of individual organization. At this moment, the organization is in a unusual state of equilibrium under which the degree of order may either increase or decrease, and may even perish   5 Big organization collaborative innovation theory   Big organization collaborative innovation theory means coordinating innovative stakeholders Each organizational individual  innovation stakeholder  in big organization s platform ecosystem  gather innovative resources and elements effectively and realize cooperation at a higher level by breaking through the barriers between the innovation subjects and fully releasing the energy of innovative elements such as talent, capita l, information and technology  The realization of collaborative innovation is by mechanisms of recourses sharing, advantages complementation, joint inputs and risk sharing mechanisms to carry out open  collaborative  innovation, improve innovation capabiliti es and innovation efficiency, bring  customers benefits and contribute the development of whole industry. That is, taking both social effect and industrial effect into account  A collaborative innovation model is constructed in this paper      c ci ce ES ES ES 000'\000 000\020  c S f QV RT 000 455

It takes a development cycle as standard, the range of ij 000T  is 90 ij 000T 90  i 000T  is the time for enterprise  i  to innovate  i U  is status of enterprise i The value of i U  is related to industrial efficiency i Q and social efficiency  i P and is the basis for calculating i P and i Q   4.2 C ollaborative innovation model  C ollaborative innovation model  is shown  in formula 4.1     formula 4.1       Since it is difficult to calculate the direct social effect and industr ial eff ect a dummy node  i U i 000T  is set as a benchmark i n the complex network  to measure the state of the industry Node  i U i 000T  is the zero 456

Innovation stakeholders’ social effect and industrial effect can be obtained upon ij B  and ij G set according to relation between innovation stakeholders  Model 4.1 points out  that the value of Gij  directly affects social benefits and sector benefits. Large Gij  can lead to increasing benefits of the entire industry and the entire social growth Bij reflects big organization’s impact on businesses. Only strengthening the inter agent association within big organization and enhancing the str ategic partnership between enterprises can jointly promote the development of the entire industry, and bring more social benefits, so that each agent can be improved   5 Summary This paper puts forward the concept of the big organization based on the CSM t heory. It introduces the basic implication of the big organization and theoretical framework of the big organization including: the big organization's perspective  overall perspective, dynamic perspective, and new resource perspective; the big organizat ion’s sense  the purpose of the organizational structure is innovation, organizational activities around the flow of information, breaking the traditional organizational structure, encouraging self run structure, and blurring organizational boundaries; the big organization’s platform  the platform ecosystem of the big organization ; the big organization’s operation mode  borderless learning mode, and cluster effect; the big organization’s theory  active management theory  leading consumers, and culture  entropy reduction theory  negative culture entropy and humanistic ecology theory  inspiring humanity, and circuit theory  a virtuous circle, and collaborative innovation theory  collaborative innovation stakeholder. This paper also discusses culture entropy reduction theory of the big organization  negative culture entropy, and coordinated innovation theory  innovation stakeholders collaboration. Culture entropy change model and collaborative in novation model are constructed   The research has just begun for the big organization. It also needs further improvement but remains the trend of the times   Reference  1  Gordon Pellegrinetti, Joseph Bentsman.

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rolling… I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors
