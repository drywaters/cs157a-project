Event Processing with Dynamically Changing Focus Marc Schaaf University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland Olten Switzerland Email marc.schaaf@fhnw.ch Abstract 227Event Processing technologies are likely to play an increasingly important role in future IT systems due to the increasing demand for on-line analytical systems as well as big data processing applications Event Processing is particularly suitable for those applications due to its active processing approach combined with scalability Today's approaches for achieving scalability are however focused on rather static event stream partitioning mechanisms to allow parallelization Such approaches are well suited as long as a feasible partitioning for all processing tasks can be found However when such a scaling mechanism is faced with processing tasks with dynamically changing focus areas no effective pre-determined partitioning can be found which massively hampers with the required scalability This paper presents the 002rst steps towards a focused processing framework to overcome these limitations I I NTRODUCTION AND P ROBLEM S TATEMENT Event processing systems are well suited for the rapid processing of measurement data to produce near real time results To achieve scalability a usual approach is the parallelization of the processing by subdividing the overall event stream into suitable partitions that can be handled in parallel by several machines This requires that the processing tasks are focused only on a subset of the event stream which needs to be known before the processing starts However when the focus of a processing task can only be determined during runtime or even changes during the ongoing processing static partitioning approaches are not suitable anymore In the research project DYNE 204Dynamic Complex Event Processing for Hybrid Telecommunication Networks and Smart Grids\224 we intend to overcome this limitation following the overall research question how event processing with dynamically changing focus can be realized for the processing of big data streams without hampering with the processing performance of the overall system Our approach is to de\002ne a specialized processing model for focused event processing that separates the overall processing task into separate phases that can be executed in multiple stages to allow the handling of big amounts of event data However this approach raises several detail challenges that are discussed in this paper The research work for the dissertation that is discussed in this paper is conducted as part of the DYNE project The research methodology applied for this work is design research as the central intention is the creation of an approach for dynamically focused event processing to solve the given challenges To allow a veri\002cation of the results the created concepts will be tested against gathered real world test data for the considered use cases together with our project partner BaseN 1  In the research project DYNE we aim at utilizing event processing concepts for the detection analysis and tracking of dynamic complex situations which can be found for example in the two application areas telecommunication network monitoring and Smart Grid monitoring alike as they require to rapidly detect and track situations of interest in country scale networks We classify such dynamic complex situations by their two central requirements 1 The need to correlate measurement data from various event sources to detect and analyze a situation 2 The need to access a non pre-de\002ned set of event sources which further varies during the analysis to allow tracking monitored situation For this paper we will discuss one of the project's use cases from the Smart Grid domain to introduce the challenges we are faced with and to outline our solution approach One major challenge Smart Grids will be faced with is the replacement of big power plants by small mostly renewable power providers Households will increasingly install solar panels on their roofs more and more wind turbine parks will be built But these kinds of power suppliers are highly affected by changing weather conditions To maintain the overall grid stability a close monitoring of the power grid will be needed An essential part of this monitoring will be the intelligent detection and tracking of situations like power production holes as they can be caused for example by clouds that affect closely related solar panels so that they not produce energy anymore Solar panels at the border will however still produce energy allowing the detection of the location of the clouds as well as their trajectory Based on such information dynamic load management systems can be created that compensate for such regional production holes by automatically switching of currently unused 1 http://www.basen.net 


Figure 1 Detection and tracking of an energy production hole caused by a cloud blocking direct sunlight to solar panels household devices to reduce the local grid utilization and thus helping with the overall grid stability The main goal of the DYNE project lies in the detection of complex situations like the above mentioned power production holes in near real-time To achieve this goal we follow the approach of providing an event processing framework which is capable of handling dynamically changing foci to allow an in depth analysis of occurring incidents including the capability to correlate side effects with an analyzed incident The remainder of this paper is structured as follows The next section will discuss a concrete use case from the DYNE project and classify it with regard to its suitability for the focused processing approach Section 3 will then brie\003y outline current event processing approaches related to the given problem set and discuss their limitations Based on this Section 4 will discuss our approach in more detail and point out the major challenges that we are facing Section 5 concludes the paper with a description of the next steps II U SE C ASE AND ITS C LASSIFICATION One of the Smart Grid use cases investigated in the DYNE project is the detection of energy production holes as they are caused by clouds that block the direct sunlight to solar panels in a rural or urban areas One or several clouds may affect closely related solar panels that do not produce energy while solar panels at the border of a cloud will still produce energy The DYNE system needs to be able to monitor the solar panels to detect such a situation with all relevant aspects like its position extend and trajectory in near real-time so the information can be used for intelligent grid management On the technical level the use case constitutes strong challenges to a near real-time processing system responsible of monitoring a country wide network The processing system must determine the presence of a power production hole from the huge stream of measurement data To actually determine the position and size it further needs to combine several affected event streams dynamically power generators in and around a power production hole into a focus area For this use case the focus area needs to be formed based on the spacial neighborhood of the measured solar panels Figure 1 However the actual extend of this focus area will only be known once a production hole was detected and the processing has started Moreover due to the movement of the power production holes the focus area that is needed for the tracking must be adjusted continuously and dynamically These two aspects however break with static event stream partitioning approaches as it is very likely that a focus area spans multiple partitions and is thus preventing an ef\002cient parallelization  To overcome the limitations imposed by static data partitioning approaches we follow the approach of a dynamically focused event processing that separates the in depth analysis of an identi\002ed problem which we call focused processing from the indication that the problem probably exists which we call the situation indication  As part of this approach we also introduced a transitional task the initial focus area determination  that derives from the initial situation detection the required preconditions for the focused processing As a 002rst step our approach is based on the following two assumptions 1 A situation indication itself can be realized based on a small and pre-de\002ned portion of the event stream and can be executed massively parallel as each indication task is separate from the other tasks 2 Based on the initial situation indication it is possible to determine which parts of the overall event stream are required for an in depth analysis Based on our approach and the assumptions we classi\002ed the use cases of the DYNE project to determine the general suitability of our approach for the given problem set For the here outlined use case the classi\002cation is as outlined in Table I We also classi\002ed the other use cases covered by the project which led to similar conclusions The classi\002cation of the use cases supports our assumption that the situation indication can be separated from the actual in depth analysis Furthermore for all of the use cases we analyzed the situation indication could be executed based on the stream of a single event source e.g the measurements from a single solar panel which allows for a very 003exible data partitioning for the initial situation indication III R EVIEW OF EXISTING APPROACHES Several sophisticated Complex Event Processing Systems exist on the market like for example Esper 2  StreamBase 3 or JBoss Drools Fusion 4 as well as in the scienti\002c community like Rapide    or SASE    Those engines already feature extensive query mechanisms including the capabilities for event stream processing In the DYNE project we will evaluate those candidates to 2 http://www.espertech.com Accessed 11.01.13 3 http://www.streambase.com Accessed 11.01.13 4 http://www.jboss.org/drools Accessed 11.01.13 


Situation Detection The indicating situation a certain drop in the energy production of a solar pane can be detected by monitoring the solar panels independent from each other Thus the use case situation detection can take place on each single event stream separately without the need for correlation with other event streams which we consider as a local problem  Initial Focus Area Determination The initial focus area for the focused processing can be identi\002ed based on the detected situation by specifying a neighborhood relation based on the geospacial neighborhood information usable for querying for the solar panels in direct neighborhood to the triggering situation Later adaptations to focus area are needed based on interim results Focused Processing The focused processing itself can for this use case be subdivided into two phases 1 Determining if a sudden drop in the energy production of a solar panel is possibly caused by a cloud by 002nding the border of the cloud 2 Determining the trajectory of the cloud based on positional changes within a certain time frame All two phases represent a regional problem as they require the correlation of a set of event streams Furthermore they all have a a non pre-determined focus area  thus they require a non pre-determined part of the overall event stream In addition they also require the a dynamic adaptations of this focus area as for example the search for alternate traf\002c paths can't specify upfront complete set of event streams that will be required during the processing Table I C LASSIFICATION OF THE S MART G RID USE CASE identify their suitability for our problem set and their extendability for focused processing Current approaches for achieving scalability of event processing applications are mostly focused on ef\002cient data partitioning and effective operator placement which is realized as a static optimization task that takes place before the actual instantiation of the processing system as for example discussed in    Hirzel    describes an additional operator for the event processing language of System S that allows automatic partitioning of the event stream However their work is again focused on determining the data partitioning before the actual processing has started Therefore those approaches cannot effectively deal with continuous changes in the processing focus which require a 003exible adaptation of the running system without hampering with the other parts of the processing Several approaches for optimizing the event processing itself by introducing new query languages or extensions to the concepts of existing ones have been published Wu et al    proposes SASE a system that allows a more ef\002cient processing of queries with large sliding windows among other optimizations Wang et al    e xtend this concept further by distrib uting the processing onto various machines based on a query plan mechanism from SASE Maier    proposes an e xtension Figure 2 Focused processing framework with the three main processing phases to window based queries towards situation speci\002c windows Where the window size matches the occurrence of the situation not some 002xed values like number of events or a time frame Liu et al    proposes a ne w query language NEEL that allows the speci\002cation of nested CEP patterns that allow the reuse of subsequences as partial results from various queries to optimize the processing Even though such approaches do not address the required partitioning of the incoming event stream they can be seen as a likely future addition to the DYNE processing system to optimize the processing responsiveness even further The approach for dynamically focused processing presented in this paper requires the capability to dynamically provide event data to processing components to allow them to execute the various focused processing tasks A very initial concept for a related dynamic event stream subscription system is presented in       Their motivation for such a dynamic event stream assignment lies in data dissemination for mobile computing applications and does not focus on the speci\002cation of a focused processing framework IV A PPROACH AND C HALLENGES As currently no approaches are providing support for event processing with dynamically shifting foci our aim is to specify a focused processing framework It will de\002ne the structure for focused processing rules as well as their semantics and their execution process This will allow the speci\002cation of focused processing rules based on the well de\002ned semantics of our framework to guarantee for the correct execution Our framework de\002nes the focused processing in three phases Situation Indication Focused Processing Initialization and Focused Processing Figure 2 1 Situation Indication The situation indication phase handles the initial detection of a situation of interest that requires special attention by a focused processing Such a situation would for example be the energy production drop of a monitored solar panel as discussed in the use case It is important to note that the result of this processing phase can in some cases only be an indication of a possible situation where the actual determination if the indicated situation exists is done separately in the focused processing phase This uncertainty of the situation indication is caused by its limited view of the situation of interest For example 


for the cloud tracking use case the situation indication only indicates that a certain drop in the energy production has occurred for a single solar panel which might also be caused some failure in the solar panels One of the central aspects for the processing model and the corresponding language for the speci\002cation of this part of the rule is the possibility to evaluate the speci\002ed triggering situation patterns in an ef\002cient form against a huge amount of streaming data 2 Focused Processing Initialization Once a possible situation has been indicated a focused processing needs to be started for the in depth analysis This processing task is intended only to run on a very small subset of the overall event stream to be able to realize complex processing tasks in an acceptable time frame The second processing phase is responsible to deduce the required part of the event stream the focus area  and to prepare a separate processing environment where this data is available for the focused processing To be able to deduce the focus area from the initial situation indication an additional speci\002cation in a suitable language will be needed This Focus Area De\002nition Language will express the initial processing focus area as a function of the gathered information of the situation indication step For this the language needs to be able to refer to the previous processing results and to correlate them with background knowledge both in spatial and temporal terms 3 Focused Processing Once the environment for the focused processing is set up the actual focused situation processing can start This processing itself can be subdivided into three parts Focused Situation Processing The actual focused situation processing happens in this third phase and can in contrast to the 002rst processing phase be much more time consuming per processed event as the amount of events that need to be processed should already be reduced dramatically This allows the use of much more expressive languages for this processing step which is needed in may of our use cases as for example for the correlation of the various energy production drops of solar panels that are shaded by clouds in a country wide power grid Focus Area Adaptation During the setup of the focused processing an initial focus area was de\002ned to allow the focused situation processing to start However over time the processing focus will in many cases shift or be extended e.g when the tracked cloud moves or grows in size which also requires the capability to specify the required adaptations as a function from the current processing state Therefore a language needs to be found in a similar form to the Focus Area De\002nition Language that speci\002es how to deduce required adaptations of the processing focus from the current processing state Failure and Success Conditions and Actions As the focused situation processing takes place on a continuous stream of events conditions need to be de\002ned when the processing should be stopped This is required for both termination cases The successful end of the processing as well as the cancellation of the processing as the indicated situation was not found Furthermore it needs to be possible to specify which actions shall be executed in either of the cases in addition to the termination of the focused processing Therefore a language needs to be found or de\002ned to specify these conditions as function from the current processing state The three phases speci\002ed by this processing framework will also be referred to when specifying a focused processing rule as outlined by the following pseudo code Situation Indication Pattern TRIGGERS SPECIALIZED PROCESSING Focused Processing Definition BASED ON Focus Area Description REQUIRES FOCUS CHANGE BY Dynamic Focus Adaptation Description EXECUTES External Action OR IS CANCELED BY Cancelation Condition We aim at providing a general framework for such focused event processing which allows the embedding of various specialized rule languages into the different parts of such a focused processing rule to allow a 003exible tailoring to the needs of a given use case For example for the described Smart Grid use case the situation indication is a fairly simple analysis drop in the energy production of a solar panel following a certain pattern that however needs to be very fast as it needs to be done for a huge part of the overall event stream in this case all solar panels thus the use of language with limited expressiveness but fast execution characteristics would be required for this use case where another use case might need much more expressiveness already in the situation indication phase V C HALLENGES Aside from the general challenge to provide a dynamic mechanism for the in depth analysis of complex situations in high volume event streams which we aim to tackle with the presented processing approach several detail challenges arise from the approach itself C1 Focused Processing Initialization Determining the initial focus area from the situation Indicator The focused processing is intended to look at a suitable subsection of the overall event stream As the processing requires the availability of all necessary data to work properly it is essential to be able to de\002ne the initial focus area in such a way that all required data is 


available while keeping that focus area as small as possible as adding too much to the focus area would hamper with the performance Consequently the focus area needs to be determined in a sensible way from an early situation indicator It is important to note that C1 covers the need to de\002ne an initial focus area therefore the focus area that needs to be determined before the actual focused processing starts Therefore the mechanism used needs to cope with the fact that the only information that is available so far is from the initial situation indication and static background knowledge on for example the topology of the monitored telecommunications network C2 Focus Area Adaption Determining when the focus areas must be adapted and how they need to be adapted For the use cases we analyzed the initially de\002ned processing focus will not be enough for the entire focused processing as the focus shifts over time possibly outside of the initial focus area Therefore suitable mechanisms need to be found to 1 detect the need to adapt the focus area during the on-going focused processing and to 2 determine how the focus area needs to be adapted which event streams are now relevant and which aren't anymore and to 3 adapt the focus area for the on-going processing while guaranteeing for correct results Updating the focus area dynamically is one of the important research challenges for our approach as it is essential for the effectiveness of the focused processing E.g when a focused processing is based on the geographical position of a cloud a change in its position would require also a shift in the focus area to include the event streams related to the new geographical location of the cloud as well as removing event streams from the old location which are not needed anymore In addition to such a change also the characteristics of focused situation can change over time C3 Failure and Success Conditions Determining the end of the focused processing As the focused processing is done based on a continuous stream of events it is necessary to specify some criteria which can be used to identify if a focused processing is 002nished This can be separated into two sub-challenges 1 Determine if the focused processing reached its goal and thus can be terminated 2 Determine if the focused processing is in vain and needs to be terminated as the initial indicator that triggered the processing mis\002red Also the focused situation might disappear while the focused processing is still running like for example a cloud can disperse over time in such a way that it does not give a signi\002cant amount of shade to the solar Figure 3 Time windows from initial situation indication to the actual focused processing panels anymore One possibility to realize those checks would for example be the state of the indication E.g if the state of the trigger has changed this could mean a premature end of the focused processing C4 Handling time differences between the situation indication and the focused processing As the complete evaluation of a focused processing rule is done in multiple stages the time difference between the start of a situation indication and the start of the actual focused processing results in a different view on the continuous event stream for the different processing phases This time difference impacts the processing in two ways Figure 3 1 The initial situation indication takes some time before the actual processing can be triggered During this period of time the event stream might however already contain information that is required for the focused processing Normally all events occurring during the situation indication phase will be lost for the focused processing which starts at a later point in time Thus a suitable mechanism needs to be found to provide the the required event data This however raises the question of the focus area of the possibly upcoming focused processing task otherwise all event data during the given period of time would need to be saved 2 In addition to the delay caused by the situation indication other delays will occur between the initial problem indication and the actual focused processing due to the focus area determination and the overall setup of the focused processing task The central questions that need to be answered are 1 Is it acceptable for a focused processing task that it misses some parts of the event stream and 2 if it is not acceptable to miss some events how can it be determined in a sensible way what needs to stored even before the focused processing has been started C5 Detection of multiple focused processing tasks for the same situation The initialization of a focused processing will be based on an indicator However it is by far not guaranteed that such indicators don't 002re multiple times for various incarnations of the same situation For example if one 


cloud blocks direct sunlight to some solar panels the indication for a possible cloud will be raised by all of the shaded solar panels This however results in the challenge that ongoing focused processing tasks need to be combined in such cases to grasp the overall situation as well as to free resources Furthermore an already analyzed situation might still trigger further situation indicators which also need to be grouped to the already running or possibly even 002nished focused processing In the case of a false indication of a situation of interest future indications 223that would lead to the same conclusion\224 should also be suppressed if possible Thus a sensible way to give a characterization of indicated situations that allows to correlate multiple indications of the same situation needs to be found VI C ONCLUSION AND N EXT S TEPS Current trends towards rapid online analytics of big data amounts support the further development of event processing approaches as a fast and scalable technology However current event processing concepts are not yet capable of providing ef\002cient methods for processing tasks with a dynamically changing focus as they are unsuitable for the typical static optimization methods applied to event processing systems To overcome this limitation we propose the concept of focused processing rules that allow the separation of the dynamic processing that can't be effectively handled by static optimization methods in a task that is triggered by a simple triggering condition which we call the a situation indicator The central characteristic for these situation indicators is their limitation to a well de\002ned part of the overall event stream which allows the usage of common optimization approaches For the current state we gathered several use cases from the application domains telecommunications networks and Smart Grids focused in our research project Based on these use cases we created a detailed requirements speci\002cation and identi\002ed the central challenges Based on the speci\002ed requirements and challenges we will now de\002ne the model for a focused event processing This model de\002nition will be oriented on the use cases but with the aim of providing a general processing model that can be used in a much broader scope Based on the de\002nitions of the processing model with regard to the processing 003ow and the detailed semantics of it we will de\002ne a rule speci\002cation language for dynamically focused processing rules Our aim it to design the language with focus on modularity of the different rule parts that need to be expressed With this we hope to provide the capability to tailor the actual rule de\002nition language to the needs of a certain use case by for example choosing a certain sub-language for specifying situation indicators with geospacial attributes For the sub languages we expect to be able to largely reuse existing event processing languages To evaluate the applicability of our approach we will create a prototype that realizes the focused processing model as an addition to a cloud computing based monitoring platform provided by our industry partner BaseN Based on this prototype we will realize several use cases which require the detection of complex situations For the telecommunications use cases the evaluations will be based on real measurement data gathered from a country wide telecommunications network For the Smart Grid use cases the tests will be based on test data that will be partly simulated due to limited availability of

Furthermore, in the datasets which only knows the number of groups, the Calinski-Harabazs and Davies-Boulin index with the real number of groups can be used to determine which the largest quality clustering, thus is finding the corresponding \003 value for that clustering. From both index have a growing trend, the clustering analysis based on both allows finding more reliable clustering of better quality As for the datasets that lack of any information describing the actual grouping, both indexes are used again to define the quality VI C ONCLUSIONS  In this article we checked some of the most used cluster validation index to determine the clustering quality. This quality was analyzed based on the result of all the indexes, to know its quality and finally which of them quantifies the actual, being the F-measure the one that offers the most reliable results. The results presented correspond to those obtained from the clustering step of the methodology presented in [2 s o  d etai le d p r es en ta ti on an d an aly s is   The clustering result is quite close to the expected and through this analysis can be seen that for these datasets an optimal \003 value can be specified as follows: 0.1 < \003 <= 0.2 Consequently, for determining the quality of clustering in datasets with information about the real grouping, the Fmeasure gives the clearest value about the quality of the clustering result. As seen in the case of datasets with lack of information no index is the best, and then both are used The Future lines for this issue are oriented to the proposal to implement different validation index and analyze their behavior, as well as work with other datasets to parse through the index an optimal \003 value, and compare if is the same as in this paper A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We would like to thank to the Instituto TecnolÛgico de Toluca and also acknowledge the PROMEP/103.5/12/4783 project for their financial support R EFERENCES  1

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
