Keynote I I  COM.Geo 2013   A Fresh Look at Mobile Location Sensing   en-GB Dr. Jie Liu  en-GB Principal Researcher & SERG Manager, Microsoft Research    en-GB Abstract   GPS and WiFi  in our smart phones and other mobile devices However continuous location sensing such as logging, tracking, and geo fencing, consume too much energy and shorten device battery life. In this talk we take a fresh look at location sensing in both outdoor  and indoor settings For outdoor location, we dive into the principles of GPS receivers and show that by offloading GPS processing to the cloud we can reduce the device side energy consumption by three orders of magnitude For indoor location, we discove r that commercial FM signals are good sources of location signatures that work better than WiFi signatures by themself and works even better if combined with WiFi signatures These low energy approaches enable always there location services without users paying batter life penalty  en-GB  Bio   Jie Liu is a Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, and the manager of its Sensing and Energy Research Group \(SERG\.

Keynote I V  COM.Geo 2013   NASA World Wind Infrastructure for Spatial Data   en-GB Patrick Hogan  NASA World Wind Manager  NASA   en-GB Kevin Montgomery, PhD  CEO, Intelesense Technologies, Inc  Sr. Researcher, Stanford University    en-GB Abstract   Spatial information intelligence is a global issue that will increasingly affect our ability to survive as a species Collectively we must better apprecia te the complex relationships that make life on Earth possible Providing spatial information in its native context can accelerate our ability to process that information To maximize this ability to process information three basic elements are required d ata delivery server technology data access client technology and data processing information intelligence NASA World Wind provides open source client and server technologies based on open standards The possibilities for data processing and data s haring are enhanced by this inclusive infrastructure for geographic information It is interesting that this open source and open standards approach unfettered by proprietary constraints simultaneously provides for entirely proprietary use of this same t echnology  en-GB  en-GB  Why World Wind Over ten years ago NASA World Wind began as a single program with specific functionality, to deliver NASA content But as the possibilities for virtual globe technology became more apparent, we found that while enabling a ne w class of information technology, we were also getting in the way  en-GB  en-GB  Researchers developers and even users expressed their desire for World Wind functionality in ways that would service their specific needs. They want to add their own features. They w ant to manage their own data. They told us that only with this kind of flexibility, could their objectives and the potential for this technology be truly realized. World Wind is a set of development tools, a software development kit \(SDK that allows a sof tware engineer to create applications requiring geographic visualization  en-GB  en-GB  Modular Componentry Accelerated evolution of a technology requires that the essential elements of that technology be modular components such that each can advance independent of  the other elements World Wind therefore changed its mission from providing a single information browser to enabling a whole class of 3D geographic applications. Instead of creating a single program, World Wind is a suite of components that can be selecti vely used in any number of programs  en-GB  en-GB  World Wind technology can be a part of any application Or it can be extended with additional functionalities by application developers World Wind makes it possible to include virtual globe visualization and server  technology in support of any objective. As open source, the world community can collectively collaborate in advancing this technology and thereby continually benefit from optimization and increased functionality of this open source infrastructure  en-GB   en-GB  Open Source  Open Standards  Accelerated Solutions NASA World Wind is NASA Open Source software. This means that the source code is fully accessible for anyone to freely use, even in association with proprietary technology  en-GB

en-GB  Facilitate Solutions The  ability to effectively deliver spatial data is an essential element of the US Executive Order 12906 for the National Spatial Data Infrastructure NSDI Open standards for data format facilitate data access. In the same manner, an open source 'standard' v isualization tool facilitates the ability for others to generate spatial data solutions, proprietary or other. This open source technology for data access and visualization also improves the ability for information intelligence the analytical results to  be readily and more effectively shared NASA World Wind open source technology provides the foundational tool for spatial data visualization and facilitates the creation and evolution of spatial data analysis and information exchange  en-GB  Bio    Mr. Patrick Hogan  currently manages the NASA World Wind development team, a group of world class engineers producing open source software that has received National awards and NASA Software of the Year for 2009/2010.

Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
