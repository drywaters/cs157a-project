The Sweet Burden Young Consumers\222 Extroversion, Number of Friendship on Online Social Network and Luxury Consumption Tendency  Wang Min International School of Business Beijing Foreign Studies University Beijing, China wangmin@bfsu.edu.cn Cheng Yuan School of Economics and Management Tsinghua University Beijing, China chengyn@sem.tsinghua.edu.cn   Abstract 227The purpose of this paper is to build a model consisting of young consumers\222 personality, the use of online social network, and the luxury consumption tendency. We 
collected data from users of a popular online social network site in China, renren.com, which is Facebook copy. Over 150 respondents from two leading Chinese universities, respectively located at Beijing and Shanghai, volunteered to participate in the survey. The results indicated that one\222s extroversion strongly predicted the number of fans on renren. Number of friendship was also strongly associated wi th his/her luxury consumption tendency, after controlled the gender, grade, disposable income and frequency of internet use. Moreover, the participants\222 place of origin \(big city vs. small town\ed to moderate the relationship, i.e., for young consumers from small towns, their 
increased extroversion is associated with larger online social network, but at the cost of higher consumption of luxury goods while the effect on undergraduates from big cities was lessened These findings offer insight into the influence of consumers\222 personality on luxury consumption and provide managerial implications for marketers to build luxury businesses in China Keywords-component; luxury consumption; extroversion social network; place of origin I   I NTRODUCTION  Despite the worldwide economic downturn in 2008, the luxury market has been thriving in recent years. According to a 
report by the leading consulting company Bain & Company global luxury goods accounted for $ 212 billion in retail sales in 2012 and it is estimated that the market will grow by four to six percent per year between 2013 and 2015, pushing the market to between $240 and $250 billion by the middle of the decade. It is worthy that China has bypassed Japan as the sector\222s second market, behind the United States. Chinese consumers now make half of the luxury purchases in all of Asia, and nearly one third of those in Europe. Globally, one in four purchases of personal luxury goods comes from Chinese consumers Despite the dramatic growth of the luxury market over the 
past two decades, the literature remains scant \(Truong simmons, McColl, and Kithen, 2008\ Besides, prior research mainly focused on demographic characteristics \(gender disposable income, social class\; however, with the phenomenon known as the \223democratization of luxury\224 Truong et al., 2008\ which means luxury g oods have become more affordable and accessible to new customers, more consumers from various classes are willing and able to pay a price premium for higher quality, higher status products, thus becoming occasional luxury customers. Considering the trend it is necessary for researchers to develop a good understanding of consumers\222 underlying psychological factors. To address 
this knowledge gap, this study investigates the influence of Chinese young consumers' personality on the aspiration towards luxury goods II  C ONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESES  Our review of the literature begins with a discussion of luxury consumption. Next, we discuss the personality extroversion as well as its influence. Finally, we focus on the impact of place of origin A  Luxury consumption From the perspective of consumers, there are several kinds of predictors of luxury consumption. Earlier research examined the demographics as antecedents. Researchers found that 
consumers\222 income is predictive of luxury goods consumption Dubois, & Duquesne, 1993\ Eng and Bogaert \(2010\lso stated that, at the country level, there is a direct relationship between economic growths and increased spending on luxuries Chao, & Schor \(1998\ found that race is positively associated with status consumption; specifically, compared to Black and Hispanic women, white women tend to engage in statuspurchasing Later studies attempted to examine the influence of psychological characteristics as antecedents. Based on an online sample of adults in the Southeast USA, Eastman Eastman \(2011\und that, there was a significant negative relationship between the level of status consumption and levels 
of price consciousness, value consciousness and brand consciousness, indicating that those more motivated to consume for status are both more brand-name conscious and more likely to see a higher price as indicative of higher quality Similarly, Zhan, & He \(2012\monstrated that value consciousness is positively related to luxury consumption among Chinese middle-class consumers The authors thank the support from National Nature Science Fund of China \(No. 71102175 978-1-4673-4843-0/13/$31.00 © 2013 IEEE 


Some researchers focus on the influence of values. Lee Hwang \(2011\wed that consumers who desire materialism and hedonism had favorable attitudes toward luxury restaurants, whereas consumers who desire uniqueness had unfavorable attitudes toward luxury restaurants. Gil, Kwon Good, & Johnson \(2012\ also demonstrated that materialistic orientation is a powerful force in developing positive attitudes toward luxury brands Additionally, social influence and conformity account for why people engage in luxury sh opping. For example Kastanakis & Balabanis \(2012\ found that consumers\222 interdependent self-concept was positively related with bandwagon luxury consumption, which indicates people consume luxury goods to pursue perceived social value. Shukla 2011\und that normative interpersonal influences were significant antecedents of luxury consumption across nations Zhan, & He \(2012\ also demonstrated that susceptibility to normative influence is a key predictor for Chinese consumers Although much has been learned about the luxury consumption, little research had addressed the issue of consumers\222 personality, which has been proven significant influencing factors of consumer behavior B  The influence of extroversi on on luxury consumption This study attempts to construct the relationship between personality and luxury consumption tendency. In this research we introduced extroversion as a determinant of luxury consumption tendency. Extroversion is one of the traits of Big Five Factor model, consisting neuroticism, extraversion agreeableness, openness, and consciousness \(Goldberg, 1992 which have been identified in numerous studies as the most salient dimensions of personality Extraversion is distinguished by sociability, positive affectivity, assertiveness and confidence. Although previous research has not examined the relationship between extraversion and luxury consumption, we argue that several reasons make extroversion a good predictor of luxury shopping. First, extrovert individuals tend to be talkative and socially ascendant, they prefer interpersonal interaction and more importantly, they like to be the center of conversation Costa & McCrae, 1992\s a consequence, luxury goods would make extroverts attract more attention from friends as well as strangers. Second, Extraverts are cheerful and optimistic individuals hence have a tendency to experience more positive emotions \(Costa and McCrae 1980\ Researchers indicated that extraversion is positively related to hedonic shopping values \(Guido, 2006\ and brand passion \(Matzler et al., 2007\ With the superior quality and aesthetic, luxury goods provide consumers positive experience, which is what extroverts are seeking. Finally, Individuals with high scores on extraversion have been characterized as assertive, forceful and ambition. Since luxury goods usually signal status or wealth extroverted consumers may do luxury shopping to enhance their image Relying on the analysis above, we suggested the hypothesis H1: Individuals\222 extroversion is positively related to luxury consumption tendency C  Use of social network as mediator Besides the main effect, we attempt to explore the possible influencing mechanism of extroversion on luxury shopping. As mentioned above, extroverts prefer making friends; for the young generation, extraverted individuals are more likely to be active in social networks and have more friends. Meantime past research found that consumers\222 extraversion is positively related to their brand evangelism, which means advocating for a product to people around \(Matzler et al., 2007\. To some extent, online social network provides paths for extroverts to sharing \(or even showing off\ what they shopped. In this light we hypothesize the mediation effect H2: Individual\222s use of social network will mediate the relationship between extroversion and luxury consumption tendency D  Place of origin as moderator Aside from the main effect of personality, this paper aims to explore whether such effect will differ for people coming from cities and town. For young people born and raised in small towns, when they come to large cities for colleges or work, they usually feel the shock brought by unfamiliar city life, which is totally different from the past quiet town life. For example, women who live in urban and suburban areas are more status-conscious than those in rural areas \(Chao, & Schor 1998\. When the new comers would try to adapt to the city and build the new identity, luxury or status goods may be a good choice with their meanings of success or status. Image a girl from a small town in Minnesota the first time in her life and go to New York University, a Gucci bag may give her some confidence in a subtle manner Researchers demonstrated there are upwards purchases concerning the luxury. Lee & Hwang \(2011\ found that low income populations exhibited more unfavorable attitudes toward luxury restaurants than did middle and high income populations. More research demonstrated the compensation mechanism when examining the motivation for luxury and they found that individuals consume status-infused products for their reparative effects on the ego \(Braun, & Wicklund, 1989 Sivanathan, & Pettit, 2010 In this light, for young people who were not born at large cities, the city life would drive their willingness to spend on high-status goods, especially for extroverted people who desire to grasp the attention and build social network in a short time Following this logic, we suggested below H3: Individuals\222 place of origin will moderate the influence of extroversion on luxury shopping; specifically, for consumers from small towns \(versus big cities\, the relationship between extroversion and luxury consumption tendency would be stronger  


III  M ETHODOLOGY  A  Participants and procedures Over 150 respondents volunteered to participate in the survey. They come from two leading Chinese universities respectively located at Beijing and Shanghai, two leading cities in China. With the various place of origin, college students make a good sampling population. A self-report, paper and pencil survey instrument was used to collect data. The sample has 119 female students and 33 female students between 18 and 22 years of age B  Measures 1  Extroversion The construct was measured by the 10items Extroversion Subscale from Goldberg\222s Big Five 50 personality markers \(1992\. The adjective-anchored bipolar rating scales ranges from 1 \(very Trait A\, to 7 \(very Trait B Samples of the adjectives include unenergetic-energetic, and silent-talkative. Higher score represents higher extroversion Alpha coefficient for this scale was 0.90, indicating high internal consistency  2  Use of social network Participants were asked to report their friends on the most popular online social network site among Chinese college students, renren.com, which is Facebook copy  3  Luxury consumption tendency Considering college students could not afford luxury goods, we measure the tendency by asking participants to list the luxury brands they could remember. Some participants just reported Louis Vuitton, Gucci, but some can list Bottega Veneta, prada and mont blanc. The average number of brands is 5.97\(SD=4.19  4  Place of origin We asked students to answer the question, \223Generally, where do you think you come from, big city or small town?\224 It is a dummy variable 5  Control variables Control variables include participants\222 gender, grade, disposable income, and the frequency of internet use IV  R ESULTS  We used SPSS to analyze the data. To examine H1, luxury consumption brands were regressed after controlling gender grade, disposable income and internet use, F\(5, 135\=3.76 p<0.01, and the standardized coefficient of extroversion was 0.16, t=1.96, p<0.05. H1 was supported To examine the mediation effect of individual\222s use of social network between extroversion and luxury consumption H2\e followed the procedures recommended by Baron and Kenny \(1986\. First, a regression of number of friends at social network was conducted on extroversion F 1, 133\=4.69 p 0.05 R 2 0.03 and the standardized coefficient was 0.18 t 2.16 p 0.05. Second, luxury consumption was regressed on extroversion after controlling demographics F 5, 135\=3.76 p 0.01, while F change 3.84 p 0.05 R 2 change 0.03, and the standardized coefficient of extroversion was 0.16 t 1.96 p 0.05. Third, luxury consumption was regressed on friends at social network after controlling demographics F 5 123\=4.87 p 0.01 R 2 0.17 while F change 11.64 p 0.01 R 2 change 0.08, and the standardized coefficient of friends at social network was 0.29 t 3.41 p 0.01; Finally, luxury consumption tendency were regressed on control variables extroversion and number of friends at social network F 6 122\=4.53 p 0.01 R 2 0.18 and the standardized coefficient of extroversion s effect on luxury shopping was reduced from 0.16 to 0.14 t 1.60 n.s, while the coefficients of friends at social network was 0.27 t 3.12 p 0.01. From the above analysis, we found that number of friends at social network was a full mediator between extroversion and individual outcomes, supporting H2. Figure 1 demonstrates the mediation effect  Figure 1  Mediation effect Using correlation analysis, we checked the moderating effect of undergraduates\222 place of origin on the relationship between extroversion and luxury consumption. For undergraduates from large cities, there is no significant relationship between their extroversion and number of friends on social network r 0.02, n.s\s well as extroversion and luxury consumption r 0.01, n.s\, while for undergraduates from small town, the correlation is 0.22 p 0.05\nd 0.29  p 0.01\ respectively. The analysis supported H3 V  C ONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS  A  Conclusions In this study we investigate the role of one personality trait extraversion\s antecedents of luxury consumption tendency which has been neglected so far. The results indicated that one\222s extroversion strongly predicted the number of fans on renren. Number of friendship was also strongly associated with his/her luxury consumption tendency, after controlled the gender, grade, disposable income, and frequency of internet use. Moreover, the participants\222 place of origin \(big city vs small town\ served to moderate the relationship, i.e., for young consumers from small towns, their increased extroversion is associated with larger online social network, but at the cost of higher consumption of luxury goods, while the effect on undergraduates from big cities was lessened B  Theoretical implications This research makes two important contributions to the luxury marketing literature. First, our findings provide evidence of a relationship between consumers\222 personality and luxury consumption buying behavior, and the intensity of Individuals\222 extroversion Number of friends on Social network Luxury consumption tendency  0.18 0.16*/0.14, n.s 0.29**/0.27 


social network use mediated the relationship, which is consistent with the arguments of personality psychology that extroverts tend to make friends and have a greater desire for goods which grasps others\222 attention. Furthermore, the relationship is stronger for young students from small town rather than large cities, since they have greater motive to bridge social capital via social network and enhance their self-esteem via luxury consumption, which demonstrates the compensation mechanism of luxury or status consumption C  Practical implications The current research demonstrates that, when the luxury brands intend to target potential luxury consumers, number of friendship on online social network would be a strong predictor in that such consumers may score high on extroversion, which increases the likelihood of sharing or showing off goods on internet and luxury consumption tendency. We suggest that luxury brand develop specific marketing strategy towards the young consumers, for example, online marketing education and online games towards the intense social network users D  Limitation and future research One limitation of the study is that the sample was predominately college students. Future research is needed to determine if the same relationship hold for a more diverse population. Additionally, researchers should further explore the influencing mechanism of extroversion aside from use of social network  R EFERENCES  1  A. Chao, and J. B.

 Figure 9. Data Recovery Demonstration Using First 50 Principal Components  In this application PCA was primarily useful because it allowed the reduction of very high dimension data sets to smaller, more manageable data sets that could be used as training inputs to the model generation tools 4.6  Results  In order to generate the best non-parametric model possible, different combinations of data inputs to the GENFIS3 and NFTOOL were considered.  Different implementations of the options discussed above were evaluated during this analysis  The best performing NFTOOL generated model used all 244 original variables, which were then expanded the dimension to 1945 using the nonlinear variable derivation calculations.  Next, the dimension of the data was shrunk to 150 so that the training function had sufficient memory to train the network.  The resulting network was the best of all the generated models  The best performing GENFIS3 generated model evaluated during this effort used the same input data set as mentioned in the paragraph above with the exception that the dimension was shrunk down to 50 using PCA.  It was observed during this effort that effectiveness of the GENFIS3 tool appears to be less tolerant of high dimension training data sets than the NFTOOL   Figure 10.

Note that these performance numbers should be compared qualitatively since the different input parameter configurations can yield different numbers of training data points Table 1. Performance Comparison of the Generated NonParametric Models \(GENFIS3  Table 2. Performance Comparison of the Generated NonParametric Models \(NN10   A sub-optimal predictor was constructed in order to show its performance relative to that of the non-parametric models.  This predictor was based on the average GHI DHI, and DNI values for each time bin in the data set Table 3 shows the improvement of the non-parametric models when compared to this sub-optimal predictor named \223Time Bin Mean\224 in the table below Table 3. Performance of Best Non-Parametric to Mean Time Bin Sub-Optimal Predictor   During this analysis, the aspect of the scalability of the GENFIS3 and NFTOOL tools was evaluated.  The model generation time for NFTOOL was always shorter than GENFIS3 for the same data sets.  The relationship of NFTOOL execution time to dataset length and dimension was generally linear for the test cases evaluated.  The relationship of GENFIS3 execution time to dataset length was also linear; however, its relationship between dataset dimension and execution time was a function of the dataset dimension squared.  This is shown in Figure 14 and Figure 15  Figure 14. Model Generation Execution Time Relationship with Dataset Dimension  182

Model Generation Execution Time Relationship with Dataset Length 5  Conclusion  This paper presents a high level look at some of the tools available in the Matlab toolset that enable the user to extract information from \223Big Data\224 sources in order to draw useful conclusions.  As described in Section II, the specific application discussed in this paper is the prediction of the amount of solar power generated by a micro-grid Section III then discusses the data that was gathered to support this exercise.  Section IV discusses the steps and techniques considered while trying to generate the best solar irradiance prediction model.  Techniques discussed included dataset sanitation, training input parameter selection, model generation via Fuzzy C-Means Clustering and Rule Inference GENFIS3 Neural Network training using back propagation NFTOOL Pre-Processing nonlinear variables to add to the training data set, and the use of PCA to reduce the dimension of the training data while maximizing the information retained in the data set  It was observed in the results presented in Section IV that the best model predicting solar irradiance was one utilizing the maximum number of original and preprocessed variables, which was then reduced to a manageable dimension using PCA prior to use in training the model.  The results in this section also showed that the non-parametric model generation methods discussed in this paper performed significantly better than a sub-optimal predictor.  Finally, the results describing the model generation times for the two techniques showed that NFTOOL provides significantly better training times especially when the dimension of the dataset is high  Future work on this topic is planned to address the benefits of using Genetic Programming to optimally reduce the dimension of the dataset, the use of cloud computing to generate models for larger data sets, and the design and evaluation of a controller to buy or sell money from the grid based on demand and predictions of received solar energy References 1  M.
