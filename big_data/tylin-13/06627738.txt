On the Data Path Performance of Leaf-Spine Datacenter Fabrics Mohammad Alizadeh Insieme Networks San Jose CA malizadeh@insiemenetworks.com Tom Edsall Insieme Networks San Jose CA edsall@insiemenetworks.com Abstract Modern datacenter networks must support a multitude of diverse and demanding workloads at low cost and even the most simple architectural choices can impact missioncritical application performance This forces network architects to continually evaluate tradeoffs between ideal designs and pragmatic cost effective solutions In real commercial environments the number of parameters that the architect can control is fairly limited and typically includes only the choice of topology link speeds oversubscription and switch buffer sizes In this paper we provide some guidance to the network architect about the impact these choices have on data path performance We analyze Leaf-Spine topologies under realistic trafìc workloads via high-ìdelity simulations and identify what is important for performance and what is not important I I NTRODUCTION Datacenter networks have been rapidly evolving in recent years as the nature of their workloads have evolved Unlike traditional enterprise client-server workloads the modern datacenterês workload is dominated by server-to-server trafìc This ne w w orkload requires intensi v e communication across the datacenter network between tens to hundreds and even thousands of servers often on a per-job basis Hence network latency and throughput are extremely important for application performance while packet loss can be unacceptably detrimental 3 Accordingly  datacenter netw orks no longer employ the traditional access aggregation core architecture of the large enterprise Instead commercially available switches are used to build the network in multirooted Clos or Fat-Tree topologies 5 Generally  ar chitects are choosing smaller dense top-of-rack switches at the leaf for server connectivity connected to larger modular 
switches in the spine creating very at densely connected networks Liberal use of multipathing is used to scale bandwidth This Leaf-Spine architecture shown in Fig 1 is designed to provide very scalable throughput in a uniform and predictable manner across thousands to hundreds of thousands of ports In effect it approximates the ideal network  a very large non-blocking switch where all servers are directly connected The network architect is trying to get as pragmatically close to the ideal network as possible while at the same time controlling costs These cost considerations force most networks to use some amount of oversubscription and for the architect to continuously evaluate the link speed and 002\003\004\005\006\007 010\011\012\013\003\006\007  010\003\014\015\003\014\006

gives us high conìdence in our results Our study mainly focuses on ow completion time FCT performance for realistic dynamic workloads with a mix of small and large ows and also bursty trafìc patterns with the Incast problem We derive our trafìc patterns from empirically observed workloads in production datacenters 5 The key ndings of our study are 1 Using higher speed links in the fabric between the leaf and spine switches relative to the edge at the servers signiìcantly improves the efìciency of Equal Cost Multipath ECMP load-balancing In particular we observe up to 40 degradation in FCT for large ows relative to an ideal non-blocking switch when both the edge and fabric links run at 10Gbps However with 40Gbps or 100Gbps fabric links the performance is very close to ideal 2 Oversubscription does not negatively impact performance for moderate levels of load e.g up to 60 of the available bisection bandwidth but it makes the network more fragile compared to non-oversubscribed or lesser oversubscribed networks at high load 3 The leaf switch uplink ports and spine switch ports observe similar degrees of queue buildup Hence perport buffer sizes at the leaf and spine tiers should generally be consistent to be effective In particular having extremely large buffers e.g as afforded by offchip memory in one tier is not useful if the buffers in the other tiers are much smaller At the same time we nd that Incast problems trafìc bursts are more severe at the leaf switches than at the spine switches Therefore increasing the buffer size in the leaf switches mitigates Incast more than increasing the spine buffers We do not claim that all these ndings are new Indeed some of these issues have been previously observed in the literature However in speaking with network designers we have found there is a lot of confusion regarding the impact of different design choices on the data path performance of datacenter fabrics We hope the present paper will help shed light on these issues and be useful to practitioners II M ETHODOLOGY Our goal is to understand how close the data path performance of the Leaf-Spine architecture is to a large ideal non-blocking switch for workloads commonly encountered in practice Speciìcally the Leaf-Spine architecture differs from an ideal switch in two important ways which may reduce its performance i inefìciencies in multipath loadbalancing may create hot-spots and reduce effective bandwidth and ii queue buildup in the spine of the network may delay or worse cause drops for packets traversing the spine even trafìc destined to non-congested ports We now brieîy describe the setup we use to study these issues Simulation platform We start with the INET framework that pro vides models of standard L2/L3 netw orking protocols and make extensions to support multipath routing via ECMP We leverage the NSC package to port the Linux 2.6.26 TCP stack to our simulator and enable Reno with SACK as the congestion control algorithm Topology We use a Leaf-Spine topology Fig 1 with 100 10Gbps servers organized in 5 racks We consider various scenarios with different link speeds 10Gbps 40Gbps or 100Gbps and different over-subscription ratios 1:1 2.5:1 and 5:1 for the fabric links between the leaf and spine switches The leaf switches are assumed to have a base latency without buffering of 700ns and the spine switches have a base latency of 2  s The host networking stack adds an additional latency of 10  s for a total one-way socket-tosocket latency of 25  s round-trip time is 50  s Switches We model all switches as shared-memory outputqueued switches Unless otherwise speciìed the total buffering at each switch is 10MB Each switch queue has a reserved buffer of 30KB and can grab up to half 5MB of the total buffer during congestion Workload We simulate a dynamic workload with foreground query trafìc and background trafìc The query trafìc models trafìc spawned by user queries in the backend of a web application Queries arrive according to a Poisson arrival process with an average rate of 10 queries per second per server When making a query a server requests a 1MB le from n other randomly chosen servers in parallel with each of the servers responding with 1 n th of the le the fanout n  is chosen uniformly at random The query completes when the entire le is received The transfers are over persistent TCP connections hence the query trafìc is very bursty and creates the TCP Incast problem since transfers start with the TCP window already open as opposed to going through the slow-start algorithm The background ows are a mix of small and large ows with the ow sizes drawn from distributions empirically observed in production datacenters We consider distributions from a web search and a data mining 5 cluster  In the interest of space we only report the results for the web search distribution the results for the data-mining distribution are qualitatively similar though it generally creates less congestion than the web search distribution The distribution exhibits common heavy-tailed characteristics 70 of the ows are smaller than 1MB but contribute only 5 of all data bytes with the rest from 1Ö30MB ows These ows also arrive according to a Poisson process and we vary the rate of the arrivals to obtain a desired level of load for the background trafìc Since our goal is to compare the Leaf-Spine network with a large non-blocking switch we generate ows such that all trafìc traverses the spine That is we ensure that the randomly chosen source and destination servers for each ow are in different racks Of course this is not realistic since some amount of locality usually exists at the rack level but it allows us to stress the network and tease out the impact of different aspects more clearly

parts First we present simulations that compare the performance of networks with 10Gbps 40Gbps and 100Gbps fabric links Next we evaluate the impact of oversubscription at the leaf switches Finally we study the impact of the buffer size of the leaf and spine switches A Impact of link speed We begin by comparing three topologies with different link speeds between the leaf and spine switches each leaf switch has either i 20  10 Gbps ii 5  40 Gbps or iii 2  100 Gbps uplinks amounting to 200Gbps total uplink capacity Note that all three networks are non-oversubscribed since the leaf switches have 20 10Gbps front-panel ports We compare these topologies with an ideal non-blocking network where the leaf switches are connected to a single spine switch using inìnite capacity links This represents what we would achieve if we built the entire datacenter network as one large output-queued switch Figure 2 shows the average query completion time QCT and the average ow completion time FCT for large   10 MB background ows at 30 to 80 trafìc loads In the interest of space we omit the plot for the small background ows which similar to the plot for query trafìc does not show much difference between the different topologies Indeed it is only for the large ows that we nd a notable difference for the 20  10 Gbps topology with FCTs that are 002 12Ö40 higher than the other topologies Since the FCT for large ows is determined by the bandwidth they achieve this shows that ECMP load-balancing is inefìcient when the fabric link speed is 10Gbps However increasing the fabric link speed to 40Gbps or 100Gbps improves the load-balancing efìciency and achieves performance that is almost identical to Non-Blocking Interestingly there isnêt much difference between using 40Gbps links and 100Gbps links which are more expensive in the spine Further though we clearly observe the Incast problem particularly at high load as much as 12 of the queries 002 003\002 004\002 005\002

intensity between 30Ö80 of the uplink capacity in 10 increments experience TCP timeouts at 80 load there isnêt much difference between the three topologies suggesting that the extent of Incast is predominately determined by the size of the buffers 10MB at each switch We revisit this in  III-C B Impact of oversubscription We now evaluate the impact of oversubscription at the leaf switches We introduce oversubscription to the nonoversubscribed conìguration of the previous section by removing some spine switches from the network Speciìcally we consider two oversubscribed conìgurations with i 2  40 Gbps 2.5:1 oversubscribed and ii 1  40 Gbps 5:1 oversubscribed uplinks at each leaf switch For each topology we vary the background trafìc intensity from 30 and 80 of the available capacity in the spine the query rate is 10 queries per second per server in all cases For example for the 2.5:1 oversubscribed topology which has 80Gbps of uplink capacity per-leaf the trafìc intensity varies between 24Gbps to 64Gbps per-leaf The average query and ow completion time for large background ows are shown in Figure 3 the behavior for other background ows is similar We nd that oversubscription does not signiìcantly degrade performance as long as the load is not very high For loads of 60 and lower the performance of the two oversubscribed topologies is inline with that achieved by the non-oversubscribed topology at the same trafìc intensity It is only for the two data points at 70 and 80 load the two rightmost data points of each line that the performance of the oversubscribed topologies breaks away from the overall trend and is notably worse C Impact of buffer size We now study how the buffer size in the leaf and spine switches impacts performance We use the 2.5:1 oversubscribed topology of the previous section and evaluate four combinations with either 2MB or 100MB total buffer in the leaf and spine switches a single queue can grab up to half the total switch buffer during congestion events We use these values to make a clear contrast between the extremes of small and large buffers at the leaf and spine switches and to understand where buffers are more effective

ports b Average normalized query completion time for different buffer sizes at the leaf and spine switches This is for a 2.5:1 oversubscribed topology with 2  40 Gbps uplinks at each leaf switch Natural buffer occupancy First we study the natural buffer occupancy at the leaf and spine switches deìned as the buffer occupancy when the switches have unlimited buffer space and thus do not drop packets As a representative example Figure 4a shows the distribution of the buffer occupancy at the leaf fabric ports uplinks and spine ports at 60 load with 100MB buffers which is large enough to avoid packet drops at both the leaf and spine switches We nd that the distribution of buffer occupancy is nearly identical at the leaf fabric ports and spine ports This is because these ports run at the same speed and are subject to very similar trafìc in terms of intensity and ow size distribution Of course this stems from the nature of the allto-all workload For a different workload with predominately one-to-many communication patterns among leaf switches the natural buffer occupancy would be larger at the leaf fabric ports while for many-to-one patterns the spine ports would have more queue buildup Nonetheless this experiment demonstrates that without speciìc knowledge of trafìc patterns having signiìcantly more buffering in one tier than the other is wasteful Where are larger buffers more effective While the natural buffer occupancy indicates that the buffer sizes at the leaf and spine switches should not differ too much it could be useful to have somewhat larger buffers in one tier versus the other depending on the extent to which they experience Incast and traf c b ursts Indeed comparing the a v erage query completion time for the different buffer combinations in Figure 4b we nd that the 100MB-Leaf 2MB-Spine conìguration performs much better than the 2MB-Leaf 100MB-Spine conìguration though both are worse than having 100MB buffers everywhere Interestingly the average query completion time with 2MB buffers at both the leaf and spine switches is not that much worse than with 2MB at the leaf and 100MB at the spine This is explained by the number of packet drops for the different buffer sizes For instance as shown in Table I at 60 load there are 261,350 dropped packets with 2MB buffers at both the leaf and spine switches while increasing the spine buffer to 100MB only reduces the total drops to 238,499 packets 2MB-Spine 100MB-Spine 2MB-Leaf 261,350 238,499 100MB-Leaf 126,142 0 Table I N UMBER OF PACKET DROPS AT 60 LOAD  IV C ONCLUSION The datacenter network is evolving to a Leaf-Spine architecture that aims to approximate a very large non-blocking switch This paper investigated the data path performance of these network using high-ìdelity simulations with realistic trafìc workloads and real TCP stacks to shed light on different design tradeoffs such as link-speeds oversubscription and buffering We found that using higher speed links in the fabric between the leaf and spine tiers relative to the edge at the servers greatly improves the efìciency of ECMP load-balancing and that having signiìcantly larger per-port buffer sizes in the leaf or spine tier compared to the other is wasteful Further it is better to apply additional buffering in the leaf tier than the spine tier to control Incast problems R EFERENCES  Cisco

S YSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION  To evaluate the effectiveness of the CITSS architecture proposed in section III, a pilot system was developed and a distributed apparel manufacturing company with multiple plants was selected as the pilot company to evaluate this system. The  pilot manufacturing company has 4 production plants located in 4 different cities, which receives production orders from its global customers and produces these order in its 4 plants according to customersê requirements.  These plants include 5 types of production departments, including cutting silk-screen, sewing, finishing and packaging. Each production department includes one or more shop floors. Each sewing shop floor consists of multiple assembly lines while other shop floor consists of multiple workstations. In each plant, different production departments are included The pilot system contains the functions of remote production tracking and production scheduling at company level. In the pilot manufacturing company,  one shop floor in each production department of each plant was selected out to implement and test the pilot system In apparel manufacturing, sewing production has the largest effects on production performance of each plant. An RFID terminal is thus installed in each sewing workstation in sewing assembly lines to capture the production records of each sewing operations. In cutting department, RFID terminals are installed in each cutting workstation to capture the output of cutting pieces from each cutting bed. In silk-screen department each bundle of garments is collected while the production record of each piece of garment is collected in finishing department. In packing department, RFID terminals collect the records of each carton of garments. In addition, three RFID terminals are installed in a fabric supplierês shop floors to track the production progress of main fabric materials The pilot system was developed on the basis of Java/J2EE SQL Server 2005 and web technologies. The production management at different levels can track the production progress of each order by some summarized reports, and also assign each order to an appropriate plant. Some examples of interfaces of the pilot system are shown in Fig.s 6-8 Fig. 6 shows an interface illustrating the comparison of production efficiency and progress for different operationsê in a production unit. By this interface, one can compare the average efficiency and progress of different operations of a production order being processed in a plant, a production department, a shop floor or an assembly line. It can be clearly found if the production flow of an order is smooth in a production unit. One can also compare the actual operating time of each operation with its SAM value by this interface. For example, the average operating time of operation è001ê and its SAM value is 20 and 22 seconds respectively. This interface can be used by production management at different levels to track each orderês production detail   Fig. 6. Interface 1 Ö Production detail of operations in an order  Fig. 7. Interface 2 Ö Production detail of orders in an order group   Fig. 7 shows an interface illustrating the comparison of production progress of all orders in an order group, which is designed for production management at plant and company levels to track each order and each order groupês production progress. As shown in this figure, the order group çNKESP01B1é consists of 21 orders. On the whole, 55% total workload of this order group has been completed. 89 workload of order 2 has been completed while only 18 workload of order 9 was completed. By this interface, one can compare the production progress and average operating time for each product of different orders in an order group Fig. 8 shows the interface of showing the solution of assigning production orders to different plants, which is the result of production scheduling at company level. As shown in this figure, the orders of order group èNIT-WI12-2Bê are assigned to plant 2 while the orders of order group èOKYSP13-1Sê are assigned to plant 1 for processing. Each production order can only be assigned to one plant for

B Evaluation 
The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is evaluated by examining the benefits brought by the pilot system. Before the pilot system was developed and implemented in the pilot manufacturing company, production data were collected by manual recordings and the production management could not track the production progress of each order in a real-time and accurate manner. The production schedulers at the headquarters made production scheduling decisions by assigning each order to an appropriate plant based on their experience and subjective judgments, which generated lowly efficient solutions After the pilot system was run in the pilot company for more than 6 months, the system performance was analyzed and evaluated by comparing the production performance of latest 3 months and the performance of the same 3 months of last year before the system was implemented. On the basis of the comparison in the two selected periods, the pilot company reported that the following tangible benefits have been achieved 1\ 8% reduction in labor and system costs: No computer operator is required to input job tickets records now. The pilot system needs less computer servers, less installation and maintenance costs, less IT-related and IE-related manpower 2\5% increase in production efficiency: The real-time and accurate production data collected and effective production scheduling decisions generated by the pilot system can definitely improve production efficiencies 3\ 12% reduction in production waste: Effective order tracking and monitoring leads to more transparent production process, which has direct effects on reducing overproduction defects, and in-process inventories. Effective order scheduling decreases the possibility of rush production, which is also helpful to reduce defects V C ONCLUSIONS  A production tracking and scheduling system was developed to make effective production tracking and scheduling in a distributed labor-intensive manufacturing environment based on a cloud-based system architecture and 3 different management levels. Due to its cloud-based and easily accessible feature, except for the subordinate plants, real-time production data can also be collected conveniently from supplying and outsourcing plants. These data collected are transferred to remote real-time production database via TCP/IP protocol, and are then analyzed and extracted to be used in production scheduling decision-makings. The intelligent technique-based scheduling mechanism is able to handle production scheduling tasks in distributed labor-intensive manufacturing environments from a holistic perspective The effectiveness of the CITSS was validated by the application of a pilot system in a distributed apparel manufacturing company with multiple plants. By implementing this system, better supply chain coordination and better production scheduling decisions can be achieved so as to provide its customers with better services A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors acknowledge the financial  supports from the Sichuan University \(Grant No. SKYB201301\ and the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(Grant No 000\021 71302134 R EFERENCES  1 K  B u t n er, "Th e s m a r t e r sup p ly ch ai n of t h e f u tu re

shown in Figure 11 The X-axis is the percentage of the normal completion time of Query 5 when a failure is injected Firstly it is not surprised that ParaLite is about twice faster than Hive One reason for the superiority is that not all the operators are checkpointed in ParaLite Moreover Hive uses sort-join while ParaLite uses hash-join In addition the start-up overhead for Hadoop cannot be ignored Hive uses 3 MapReduce jobs to express the query and each takes 10 15 seconds before all map tasks are started Secondly the slowdown for both system are similar However the slowdonw of Hadoop is limited to the interval of heartbeat message send to the JobTracker\(master from each TaskTracker\(worker After a x time we set it 30 seconds from receiving the last heartbeat if the master does not receive a new heartbeat message it sets the status of the worker failed and re-schedules the failed tasks So for a light-weight job whose execution time is not much larger than the interval the slowdown becomes larger because it needs to wait for the task re-execution On the other hand ParaLite detects the failure immediately after a process fails and then starts the recovery D Scalability To evaluate the scalability of ParaLite we perform TPCH Query 3 on 10 20 and 30 nodes with the s cale factor 100 200 and 300 respectively As Figure 12 shows ParaLite scales well with the increase of nodes The selective checkpointing mechanism adapts to clusters with different number of nodes                   0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 10 20 30 Execution Time\(s of nodes Fig 12 The scalability of TPC-H Query 2 VI C ONCLUSION To efìciently support intra-query fault tolerance for longrunning queries we propose a selective checkpointing mechanism which automatically chooses necessary operators whose output data are worth being checkpointed to minimize the expected runtime of the query in a failure-prone environment The mechanism provides a cost model to simulate the execution of the query plan and takes a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem The mechanism is implemented in a share-nothing parallel database ParaLite and evaluated with several TPC-H queries The experimental results rstly show that different fault-tolerant strategies affect the overall runtimes of queries Our selective checkpointing can choose reasonable operators to be checkpointed and outperforms other fault-tolerant strategies In addition the divide-and-conquer algorithm taken by our mechanism has a smaller overhead than brute-force approach while keeping a

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
