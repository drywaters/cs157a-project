Abstract 
I I NTRODUCTION The modiìed quadratic discriminant function MQDF has been applied prevalently and successfully in handwritten Chinese character recognition 3 o v er the past 25 years However the large number of free parameters of MQDF usually lead to over-ìtting of the training data To solve this 
Locally Smoothed Modiìed Quadratic Discriminant Function 
Modiìed quadratic discriminant function MQDF is a state-of-the-art classiìer for handwriting recognition However the big gap between accuracies on training and testing sets indicates that MQDF has a good capability to t training data but the generalization performance is not promising To solve this problem we propose a new model called locally smoothed modiìed quadratic discriminant function LSMQDF by smoothing the covariance matrix of each class with its nearest neighbor classes LSMQDF can be viewed as a regularization to avoid over-ìtting The covariance matrix estimated by local smoothing is more accurate and robust LSMQDF can be also viewed as an extension of the global smoothing method namely regularized discriminant analysis RDA Experiments on both ofîine and online Chinese handwriting databases demonstrate that with local smoothing the accuracy on training set is decreased over-ìtting avoided and the accuracy on testing set is improved signiìcantly and consistently generalization improved

In Bayes decision theory the quadratic discriminant function QDF is derived from the assumption of classconditional Gaussian distribution 1 where

3 The performance of QDF is highly dependent on the computation of the inverse matrix  The covariance matrix is usually singular and under-estimated due to the estimation errors and the sensitivity of the estimation to small sample size Therefore QDF can not achieve high accuracy in real applications To achieve an accurate and robust estimation of  many improvements have been proposed among which the modiìed quadratic discriminant function MQDF is the most ef fecti v e one for lar ge category Chinese handwriting recognition By utilizing eigen-decomposition algorithms the covariance matrix can be diagonalized as  where

therefore both the storage of parameters and the computational complexity are reduced More importantly higher classiìcation accuracy can be obtained by setting the minor eigenvalues to be a class-independent constant as and using cross-validation to select from on the training data Although MQDF is a state-of-the-art classiìer for Chinese handwriting recognition many improvements have been proposed in the past 25 years We rst give a summarization of the improvements on MQDF in Section II After that the motivation and deìnition of the newly proposed locally smoothed MQDF are described in Section III The experimental results on both ofîine and online Chinese handwriting datasets are presented in Section IV and the concluding remarks are drawn in Section V II R ELATED W ORKS Many improvements have been proposed for MQDF from different aspects such as discriminative training memory reduction instance selection and generation ensemble learning and discriminative feature extraction Because MQDF is a generative model Liu et al proposed to use the minimum classiìcation error MCE criterion for discriminative training of MQDF After that the sample separation margin criterion and perceptron criterion were also adopted for this purpose The retraining of MQDF based on instance importance weighting instance selection 8 and virtual instance generation mirror image can be also vie wed as some kinds of discriminative training Discriminative training of MQDF can directly optimize the classiìcation boundaries therefore high classiìcation accuracy can be achieved especially when the size of training data is large The memory requirement of MQDF is usually very large e.g 120MB for a 3,755-class and 160-dimension problem To reduce the memory requirement of MQDF Long and Jin proposed to use the v ector quantization and split quantization techniques to compress the parameters means eigenvectors and eigenvalues of MQDF Modeling the inverse covariance matrices by the expansion of some tied basis matrices was proposed by Wang and Huo The precision constrained Gaussian model was combined with the minimum classiìcation error MCE training criterion to simultaneously compress the parameters and improve the accuracy W ith parameter compression the high accuracy MQDF classiìer can be embedded into some handheld devices such as mobile phones and tablet computers There are also many other improvements of MQDF derived from different viewpoints The kernel MQDF was proposed by Yang and Jin to e xtend MQDF from original feature space to kernel space implicit highdimensional space The ensemble learning methods such as cascade classiìer training boosting 15 and pairwise discrimination were adopted to impro v e the accurac y of MQDF The graphical lasso method was used to estimate a sparse inverse covariance matrix for QDF The normalization of the determinant of the covariance matrix was shown to achieve better classiìcation accuracy The asymmetric Mahalanobis distance can be vie wed as an extension of the symmetric Gaussian distribution Combining MQDF with the discriminative feature extraction can further improve the performance III L OCALLY S MOOTHED MQDF Although MQDF is a generative model it has a very high accuracy on training set over 99 However the accuracy on testing set is much lower around 89 and 93 for ofîine and online Chinese handwriting recognition This indicates that MQDF has a good capability to t training data but the generalization performance is not promising 1 The covariance matrix estimated by maximum likelihood ML is usually under-estimated due to small sample size and the large number of free parameters gives MQDF a strong memory of training samples over-ìtting To improve the generalization performance of MQDF we propose a new model of locally smoothed modiìed quadratic discriminant function LSMQDF by smoothing the covariance matrix of each class with its nearest neighbor classes In the following sections we rst give a description of the ML estimation and then present the details of LSMQDF After that we compare LSMQDF with a global smoothing method Given a training dataset  and  where is the number of training samples in class  and is the number of classes Let denotes the th training sample from class  The function of the negative log-likelihood of the data from class w.r.t the mean and the covariance matrix can be deìned as 5 The maximum likelihood ML estimation of and is conducted class-by-class   as 6 By solving this convex optimization problem the ML estimation is 7 8 1 This explains why discriminative training of MQDF can only improve the testing accuracy slightly

The class-wise ML estimation is proven to be sensitive to small sample size small  and the estimation error in covariance matrix 8 is more serious than the estimation error in mean vector 7 To achieve a robust estimation we propose a local smoothing method 9 where KNN denotes the nearest neighbors of class from the remaining classes deìned by the Euclidean distance between the class means The rst term of 9 is the ML estimation and the second term is a local smoothing of the covariance matrix with the nearest neighbor classes The is a tradeoff parameter Because the estimation of the class-mean is accurate enough is xed as the ML estimation 7 The new covariance matrix is estimated to maximize the likelihood of not only class but also the neighboring classes Therefore both the samples from class and the neighboring classes are used simultaneously to achieve a robust estimation This is based on the assumption that the covariance matrices of neighboring classes are close to each other which is satisìed in handwriting recognition because similar characters usually have the same types of distortion variation The optimization problem of 9 is also a convex problem which has a closed-form solution 10 where is the ML estimation 8 From this deìnition we can nd that is a smoothing of with the neighboring classes KNN  Therefore should be more accurate than especially when is small By using 7 and 10 to train the MQDF classiìer Section I-B much better generalization performance can be achieved and we denote this method as LSMQDF With local smoothing some discriminative information of the training data is lost but the new covariance matrix will be more robust Therefore although the accuracy on training set is decreased over-ìtting avoided the accuracy on testing set will be improved generalization improved LSMQDF can be viewed as an extension of the global smoothing method namely regularized discriminant analysis RDA which constrains the range of parameter values by interpolating the class covariance matrix with the common covariance matrix and the identity matrix  11 where  and  With appropriate values of and empirically selected RDA can improve the generalization performance and some special cases are included i original QDF  ii linear discriminant function LDF  and iii Euclidean distance  Improvements can be achieved when using 7 and 11 to train the MQDF classiìer Section I-B and we still denote this method as RDA for simpliìcation RDA is a global smoothing method while LSMQDF is a local smoothing method When the number of classes is large global smoothing can not achieve any improvement while local smoothing is still effective to improve the accuracy This is because we can not assume all the covariance matrices to be close to each other and contrarily the neighboring classes are more likely to have the same covariance matrices The superior performance of LSMQDF is also veriìed by experiments in the following sections IV E XPERIMENTS We evaluated the performance of LSMQDF on two 3,755class Chinese handwriting databases the of ine handwriting database CASIA-HWDB1.1 and the online handwriting database CASIA-OLHWDB1.1 Both of them contain handwritten Chinese characters from 300 writers 240 for training and 60 for testing Each writer has about 3,755 characters one for each class The extracted feature data can be downloaded from our website 2 For representing an ofîine character sample we extract features from gray-scale character images back-ground eliminated using the normalization-cooperated gradient feature NCGF method The original feature dimensionality is 512 which is further reduced to 160 by Fisher linear discriminant analysis FDA For the LSMQDF method we set and for 10 Sensitive analysis of these parameters will be shown in the following sections For the RDA method 11 we have the common covariance matrix is in the FDA transformed subspace and now the RDA can be simpliìed as and we report the best performance of RDA on testing set by searching from0to1 The accuracies of MQDF RDA and LSMQDF on both training set and testing set with various numbers of principal eigenvectors are shown in Figure 1\(a We can nd that i with either global smoothing RDA or local smoothing LSMQDF the training accuracy is decreased over-ìtting avoided and the testing accuracy is improved generalization improved ii LSMQDF outperforms RDA consistently and signiìcantly on the testing set and iii compared with the baseline MQDF LSMQDF is effective to improve the 2 http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/databases/handwriting/Download.html

By using FDA to reduce the dimensionality from 512 to different subspaces we compare the performance of MQDF and LSMQDF  and for 10 and the number of principal eigenvectors is 50 The results are shown in Figure 1\(b When the dimensionality is small the difference between MQDF and LSMQDF is not signiìcant but with the increasing of dimensionality the difference becomes larger and larger This is because the curse of dimensionality i.e in the high-dimensional space the training data are not sufìcient to get an accurate parameter estimation and in this case smoothing is an important tool for improving the generalization performance We also compare the performance of MQDF and LSMQDF with different number of training samples In this case we x the dimensionality as 160 use for 10 and set the number of principal eigenvectors as 50 The results are shown in Figure 1\(c We can nd that LSMQDF can improve the testing accuracy consistently and signiìcantly especially when the number of training samples is small e.g the accuracy is improved from 84.79 to 86.80 when there are only 60 training samples per class In this section we evaluate the performance of LSMQDF by varying the number of nearest neighbors in 10 Other parameters are xed as the same of Section IV-C The results are shown in Figure 1\(d When  the testing accuracy of LSMQDF is already higher than MQDF and with the increasing of  the performance is further improved When  the accuracy is nearly not changed Therefore the performance of LSMQDF is not sensitive to the selection of  We also evaluate the performance of LSMQDF by varying the values of the tradeoff parameter in 10 Other parameters are xed as the same of Section IV-C The results are shown in Figure 1\(e When  the accuracy of LSMQDF is higher than MQDF because the information of neighboring classes is incorporated into the estimation of the covariance matrix With the increasing of  the performance is further improved However when  the accuracy is decreased due to the over-smoothing Therefore in practice we should pay attention to the value of  and is shown to be a good choice in our experiments In this section we use LSMQDF for online handwriting recognition For representing an online character sample

Figure 7 DoS attacks against 172.20.1.5 corporate web server from 10.200.150.201 206-209 Figure 8 Three group of machines in heavy IRC trafìc with the websites through port 6667 Potential botnet infections The host 172.23.231.174 all-time IRC client show negrained patterns the connections are composed of two temporal stages indicated by a small gap in the middle of the anomaly panel A drill-down analysis at this gap shows that the rst stage ends-up with a large port 43325 and the second stage starts with a small port 1185 After checking the anomaly le we conclude that the IRC trafìc from the workstations are programmed with sequentially enumerated source ports It veriìes the hypothesis that these hosts have been compromised as botnet clients VI C ONCLUSION In this paper we apply the Structural Equivalence Grouping SEG method to visually condense the large network trafìc graph without sacriìcing the connectivity information It is shown that SEG can effectively reduce the scale of many real-world trafìc graphs and still preserve critical features of the original graph The classical node-link representation is introduced to visualize the SEG-compressed graph with carefully designed visual encodings and interactions to provide the user with both ease and interactivity in visual analysis We showcase the applications of the integrated NSAV tool in two use cases and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed compressed graph visualization technique R EFERENCES  N McK eo wn T  Anderson H Balakrishnan G P arulkar  L Peterson J Rexford S Shenker and J Turner Openîow enabling innovation in campus networks ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review  vol 38 no 2 pp 69Ö74 2008  E R Gansner  Y  K oren and S North Graph dra wing by stress majorization in Graph Drawing  2004  P  Gajer and S G K obouro v  GRIP Graph dra wing with intelligent placement Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications  vol 6 no 3 pp 203Ö224 2002  Y  Hu Ef cient and high quality force-directed graph dra wing Mathematica Journal  vol 10 no 1 pp 37Ö71 2005  D Auber  Y  Chiricota F  Jourdan and G Melancon Multiscale visualization of small world networks in InfoVis  2003 pp 75Ö81  J Abello F  v a n Ham and N Krishnan ASK-GraphV ie w A large scale graph visualization system IEEE Trans Visual Comput Graphics  vol 12 no 5 pp 669Ö676 2006  F  Lorrain and H C White Structural equi v alence of individuals in social networks The Journal of Mathematical Sociology  vol 1 no 1 pp 49Ö80 1971  D R White and K P  Reitz Graph and semigroup homomorphisms on networks of relations Social Networks  vol 5 no 2 pp 193Ö234 1983  M E J Ne wman F ast algorithm for detecting community structure in networks Physical Review E  vol 69 no 6 p 066133 Jun 2004  C P apadopoulos and C V oglis Dra wing graphs using modular decomposition Journal of Graph Algorithms and Applications  vol 11 no 2 pp 481Ö511 2007  C Dunne and B Shneiderman Motif simpliìcation Impro ving network visualization readability with fan and parallel glyphs in CHI  2013 pp 3247Ö3256  S P  Bor gatti and M G Ev erett Notions of position in social network analysis Sociol methodol  vol 22 pp 1Ö35 1992  L D Sailer  Structural equi v alence Meaning and deìnition computation and application Social Networks  vol 1 no 1 pp 73Ö90 1978  T  A Da vis and Y  Hu The uni v ersity of orida sparse matrix collection ACM Trans Math Software  vol 38 no 1 2009  K Dinkla M A W estenber g and J J v a n W ijk Compressed adjacency matrices Untangling gene regulatory networks IEEE Trans Visual Comput Graphics  vol 18 no 12 pp 2457Ö2466 2012  T  v o n Landesber ger  A  K uijper  T  Schreck J K ohlhammer  J J van Wijk J.-D Fekete and D W Fellner Visual analysis of large graphs EuroGraphics State of the Art Report  pp 37Ö60 2010  F  Chierichetti R K umar  and S Lattanzi On compressing social networks in KDD  2009  IEEE V AST Challenge  2011 http://hcil.cs.umd.edu localphp/hcil/vast11  IEEE V AST Challenge  2012 http://www v acommunity  org/VAST+Challenge+2012 612

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
