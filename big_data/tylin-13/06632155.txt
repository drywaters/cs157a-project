On Use of Big Data for Enhancing Network Coverage Analysis 250 Omer Faruk C\270 elebi Engin Zeydan 250 Omer Faruk Kurt 250 Omer Dedeo 013 glu 250 Omer 001 Ileri Burak Aykut Sungur Ahmet Akan Salih Erg 250 ut Abstract 227 Proliferation of data services has made it mandatory for operators to be able identify geographical regions with 3G connectivity discontinuity in a scalable and cost-ef\002cient manner The currently used methods for such analysis are either costly such as in drive tests partly unreliable such as in network simulation approaches or are not precise enoughsuch as in base station key performance indicators KPI based approaches In this paper towards addressing these inadequacies we propose a 3G coverage analysis method that makes use of 224big data\224 processing schemes and the vast amounts of network data logged in mobile operators In the proposed scheme the BSSAP mobility and radio resource management messages between the BSS and MSC nodes of the operator network are processed to identify inter-technology handovers from 3G WCDMA access to 2G EDGE GPRS GSM Demonstrative examples show that the proposed mechanism produces accurate and precise results outperforming the base station KPI-based approach Index Terms 227 big data cellular networks coverage Hadoop I I NTRODUCTION Digitization of content and emergence of wireless communication technologies which enable data transmission has placed mobile data services as an important revenue source for mobile operators This trend has further been emphasized after the emergence of third generation 3G networks WidebandCDMA in Europe which have provided substantial gains in data speeds compared to 2G EDGE GPRS technologies On the customer side the technological availability of high data rate connections has transformed the growing 223demand\224 for mobile data to a 224need\224 for 223any-time any-where\224 connectivity Therefore providing ubiquitous and high quality QoS mobile data services through data connectivity has become priority for mobile operators in most parts of the world A major challenge that needs to be addressed by the operators in this respect is the discontinuity in 3G connectivity experienced by mobile users Such discontinuity is experienced when the user is forced to handover from 3G connectivity down to 2G possibly due to loss of signal quality Such vertical handovers result in less ef\002cient use of the spectrum through low data rate connections thus reducing the revenues from data services and also cause imperception regarding service quality on the customer side It is therefore 250 O F C\270 elebi E Zeydan 250 O F Kurt 250 O 001 Ileri B A Sungur and S Erg 250 ut are with AveaLabs and 250 O Dedeo 013 glu A Akan are with Radio Network Planning Department at AVEA 001

salih.ergut@avea.com.tr omer.dedeoglu@avea.com.tr ahmet.akan@avea.com.tr of utmost importance for operators to identify geographical regions with discontinuities in 3G connectivity Identifying regions with 3G service discontinuity might prove to be challenging as the coverage area for a typical 3G transmitter does not only depend on signal path loss phenomena but also on the overall planning and dimensioning of the surrounding 2G and 3G base stations Furthermore the coverage area is not always steady as it is also in\003uenced by the time varying band and channel characteristics as well as the instantaneous capacity demand in the cell particularly in the case of 3G access The traditional methods of identifying regions with 3G service discontinuity such as drive-around tests and network simulations do not address the dynamics outlined above and often are costly Other methods making use of the base station KPI parameters that track 3G to 2G handovers often do not provide precise enough results as they only include the signaling information that belongs to 223connected mode\224 of mobile devices ignoring the 223idle mode\224 dynamics that correspond to time intervals in which the mobile is silent Therefore there is need to develop coverage analysis methodologies that can accurately and precisely pinpoint service discontinuity in a cost ef\002cient manner Using big data processing platforms in telecommunication 002eld is studied in different papers in the literature 2 3 4 5 6 7 In this paper inspired by the use of 223big-data\224 tools and concepts in diverse 002elds of study such as customer-centric marketing we propose a methodology making use of the vast amounts of signaling data that is constantly produced by the mobiles and fed back to the operator In the context of a mobile operator 223big data\224 refers to the collection of vast quantities of data that are being generated by mobile devices such as signaling and location data web site visits and several million CDRs Call Detail Records produced on a daily basis In the scope of this paper we propose to process the network logs for mobile uses corresponding to both their idle and connected mode signaling data using the Hadoop platform to come up with dynamic 3G service discontinuity maps More speci\002cally mobility and radio resource management signaling data BSSAP messages collected by the probes attached to the relevant network switches are used Through such data the inter radio access technology handovers IRAT HOs from 3G to 2G for mobile users are mapped to geographical locations of the users to identify the 3G service discontinuity areas Experimental results show that the service discontinuity areas achieved through this approach match the drive test results Moreover the approach provides more accurate results and provides a more detailed coverage map than the aforemen 


tioned methods based on tracking base station KPIs The increase in accuracy is caused by the fact that such logs include both the 223idle\224 and 223connected\224 mode signaling data as opposed to the latter alone The increase in precision can be attributed to the fact that BSSAP messages provide destination information regarding a hand over unlike the KPI parameters in a base station The proposed system thus constitutes a scalable accurate and precise approach that captures the timedynamicity of coverage analysis in a cost ef\002cient manner Besides the speci\002cs and bene\002ts of the analysis approach that it advocates this paper also constitutes a contribution in the sense that it provides a nice example of combining results from the two seeming disjoint areas of research namely the 223big data\224 processing schemes and coverage analysis tools The mentioned 002elds have often been elaborated on separately especially in the wireless cellular network domain However some of the results of one study area can readily be applied to the other making it more powerful and ef\002cient as illustrated here This paper is organized as follows Section II provides the background for the proposed approach by providing a brief overview of traditional coverage analysis tools and of the concept of 223big data\224 The section also details the proposed big data based coverage analysis method Section III discusses the simulation results and 002nally Section IV gives the conclusions and future work II B IG D ATA B ASED C OVERAGE A NALYSIS Establishing continuous 3G connectivity is important for operators in achieving their aim of providing ubiquitous and high quality services for their customers The undesired vertical handovers from 3G access are often results of falling RSSI received signal strength indicator or SNR signal-tonoise-ratio values below a certain threshold In the case of 3G access the handovers are also triggered by instantaneous demand for excess capacity Most coverage analysis methods considered in literature are based on drive tests and costly 002eld measurements 10 In 3GPP standardization effort this work item goes by the name of 224minimization of drive tests\224 MDT In dynamic environments due to population change new base station deployments the use of new services outages etc new driving tests and 002eld measurements need to be conducted on a periodic basis to have up-to-date info regarding the coverage areas and potential handovers likely to be triggered across technologies Several other methods rely on statistical tools In these methods Monte-Carlo simulations are utilized to mimic real network conditions and derive estimates for received signal strengths at different localities Such methods require high computational power and may also lack real network conditions Mobile operators also make use of the base station KPI parameters for detecting vertical handovers The parameters corresponding to 3G IRAT HO Inter Radio Access Technology Handovers give an indication of the tendency of the mobile associated with a certain base station to experience outbound handovers from 3G access thus aiding the coverage analysis Such parameters however suffer two major limitations i they include handovers associated with connectedmode signaling only and ii they only give an indication of 223outbound\224 handovers without specifying the destination base station in case the mobile changes the point of connection as well Thus an analysis based on such parameters fails to consider the idle-mode handovers limiting the sampling space It also misses geographical precision as the lack of knowledge regarding destination base stations avoids pinpointing cells where 3G access is not adequate A cost-effective coverage analysis that provides an accurate and precise identi\002cation of regions with 3G service discontinuity can be implemented through making use of the vast quantities of customer device data continuously collected by the operatoroften classi\002ed as 223big data\224 as outlined in the sections that follow Fig 1 Cellular network architecture and mirroring of A-interface in the network A 223BigData\224 and Hadoop Platform Technically 223Big data\224 refers to huge quantities of data that are so large that it is practically not possible to process them using the readily available tools Vast amounts of data that accumulates at companies as a result of their daily operations can be considered in this category The analysis of big data is a central and important activity in a variety of 002elds such as 002nance telecommunications transportation and the like Most high-technology companies such as Yahoo Facebook Google as well as many smaller companies are now processing terabyte-scale data processing on a regular basis The major technical challenge regarding big data is that it is not economically sound to store and process such data at its entirety as the traditional analysis techniques are computationally expensive To this end advanced processing platforms specialized at handling big data such as Oracle DB2 Microsoft PDW EMC Greenplum Teradata Vertiva and Hadoop have recently been developed Such platforms help lower the cost of storage enhance computation and memory allocation 


Among the available platforms Hadoop stands out as the most notable one as it is an open source solution It is made up of a storage module namely HDFS Hadoop Distributed File System and a computation module namely MapReduce Whereas HDFS can have centralized or distributed implementations MapReduce inherently has a distributed structure that enables it to execute jobs in parallel on multiple nodes B Operator Data and Usage for Coverage Analysis Mobile operators typically are experiencing vast quantities of data that are being generated both by customer mobile devices smartphones laptops etc as well as various network elements present in their core networks like MSC Mobile Switching Center MGW Media Gateway HLR Home Location Register etc as illustrated in Fig 1 User generated data also include several million CDRs essentially processed on a daily basis and includes information regarding phone calls text messages web site visits online mobile banking transactions Traditionally among such huge quantity of data only those related to billing charging and similar customer relations functions are utilized by the operator Data originating from network elements is often not considered in efforts to understand the user experience Such data can in fact be used to track inter-technology handovers Number of such handovers in different localities are instrumental in identifying regions with interruptible 3G services Towards this end connected mode data inherent in the inter-node signalling in the form of IRAT HO inter radio acess technology handover indicators as well as the idle-mode data that corresponds to time intervals in which the mobile is silent can be utilized An important source of such data in the operator network is the interface between the BSC and MSC nodes also referred to as the 223A-interface\224 as also indicated in Fig 1 The BSSAP messages that go through this interface provide the data needed to identify intertechnology handovers The BSSAP messages are mobile device based and include numerous indicators related to resource management hand over control and mobility management Among these numerous indicators the four 002elds that are relevant in identifying inter-technology handovers are the location update 002elds namely 223LAC serving\224 223Last LAC target\224 223BSSAP procedure\224 and 223Last Cell ID\224  LAC location area code serving 002eld corresponds to the previous location area information of a mobile before location update and Last LAC/Last Cell ID target are the location area/cell information the mobile is currently attached to when the location update messages are sent It is important to note that the location area information inherent in the LAC serving and Last LAC target 002elds also indicate the radio access technologies utilized by the mobile in the considered location areas The 002eld value 223BSSAP procedure  Update location\224 is indicative of handovers by users who reselect cells due to poor or lack of 3G coverage Switch on or off actions or 3GPP protocol enforced periodic location updates and mobility based location updates when a mobile moves from one location area into another in idle mod are also potential triggers Thus both idle mode and dynamic mode dynamics are captured in location updates A joint analysis which takes into account previous and current location information reveals inter-technology handovers The number of such handovers is indicative of 3G service discontinuity in the considered geographical location It is also important to note that in such analysis the cell id to which the mobile switches to 2G access can precisely be identi\002ed providing the geographical precision that is missing in base station KPI parameters Fig 2 Proposed 3G coverage evaluation methodology C Coverage Evaluation Methodology Based on Big Data A high level description of the proposed methodology that makes use of the A-interphase data is presented in Fig 2 The proposed process for near-real time coverage performance evaluation methodology contains the following steps 1 Data 003ows from cellular network to Hadoop distributed data warehouse Hive and is loaded into HDFS 2 The data is queried with Hive in order to count all handovers such as from 3G to 2G Hive transforms the query to MapReduce functions implicitly 3 Results are transferred to MySQL database 4 Relevant information from database is queried using SQL for only handovers from 3G to 2G This query can also be merged with the second step but we decided to get all the handovers in order to not constraint ourself on speci\002c IRAT HOs 5 Coverage results are monitored on the web based GUI over google maps for the desired IRAT HO In step 1 the four relevant 002elds of LAC serving Last LAC target BSSAP procedure and Last Cell ID are loaded onto the Hadoop platform In step 2 only those entries for

Turkey while Fig 3\(b shows the corresponding area as it is analyzed through the base station based KPI Fig 3 c provides the results of the roadtest as benchmark The hand over counts specify the color of the discontinuity spot As can clearly be seen from the 002gures the proposed method yields results that are in coherence with the drive tests and are thus accurate The comparison between the proposed method and the KPI based approach reveals that the proposed method provides greater precisions identifying areas with service discontinuity that are not discovered by the latter method These representative results demonstrate that inclusion of idle mode signaling data and target cell id info increases the quality of the coverage analysis IV C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK In this paper we have proposed a 3G coverage analysis method that identi\002es 3G service discontinuity areas by processing BSSAP signaling data through the Hadoop based big data processing methods The proposed method identi\002es the location updates that correspond to inter-technology handovers and uses the target Cell ID provided to precisely identify geographic locality where there are 3G service discontinuities The experimental results suggest that the proposed mechanism produces accurate results and provide precision gains as opposed to traditionally employed methods The approach displayed in this paper is a nice example demonstrating the use of big data concepts in increasing the ef\002ciency of network operations in mobile operators As future work we aim to enhance the proposed method

corresponding real track, it is considered as  see Table I\. Since the time span of the group video data is limited, some vehicle tracks are broken off, which are marked as Since some conditions of camera views are not perfect enough, when a car disappears in the view which goes beyond the detection area, it is marked as  also includes those cars that disappear in blind regions  Figure 3. Cameras for evaluation on the map TABLE  I  E VALUATION OF MULTI CAMERA TRACKING  For the location measure, enter/exit area is defined for each camera and their connections across cameras are used as spatial features. For the time measure, the mean and variance between two corresponding enter/exit areas is learned during the training stage. A single Gaussian distribution is used to model the object travel time. In this practical traffic surveillance system, since all cameras are deployed in a campus, the distance between two neighbor cameras is not far Most of them are 50-200 meters, and the speeds of most vehicles in the campus are between 10-40km/h. Table II shows the parameters for enter/exit areas pairs during the training stage TABLE  II  L EARNED PARAMETERS OF TIME MEASUREMENT FOR  ASSOCIATED ENTER  EXIT AREA PAIRS  Since the classification method we used concerns primarily with the front area of the vehicle, the identifying accuracy is poor when a target shows only the back part in the camera views. However, it is a good opportunity to test how robustly the system can run in such a serious situation Some vehicle objects of correct tracking across 6 major cameras are shown in Figure 4, while some of incorrect tracking are shown in Figure 5  Eight serials of monitoring videos with duration of 5 minutes are processed by the server with 2.26 GHz 2xIntel Xeon E5520 CPU. The amount of objects we detected is 233 We use two ways to search for the tracks. One is the traditional Bayesian method, the other is our MCMF\ethod

In accuracy, the contrast ratio between our method and the Bayesian method is 1:1.11; in the computation time, our method increases about 27.5%. Table III shows the comparison of detail computational time taken by two methods and Table IV shows the accuracy comparison  TABLE  III  C OMPARATION ON COMPUTATIONAL TIME  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we present a new vehicle tracking surveillance approach with non-overlapping views in multicamera. A framework to perform robust multiple targets tracking across multiple cameras is discussed. The multiobjects in multi-camera data association problem is formed with a minimum cost and maximum flow mode. For robust multi-camera tracking, time, location, classification type, and appearance of targets are effectively applied as a similarity measure. The approach is tested with real surveillance videos from the campus of HUST. The experimental results validate the robustness and effectiveness of the approach Experimental results also indicate that the method of tracking across multiple cameras is feasible after a high quality of feature extraction and target detection. For future work, more efficient and effective appearance models and feature extraction are desired to increase the accuracy of the approach A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant No.61133008 R EFERENCES  1

Innovation stakeholdersí social effect and industrial effect can be obtained upon ij B  and ij G set according to relation between innovation stakeholders  Model 4.1 points out  that the value of Gij  directly affects social benefits and sector benefits. Large Gij  can lead to increasing benefits of the entire industry and the entire social growth Bij reflects big organizationís impact on businesses. Only strengthening the inter agent association within big organization and enhancing the str ategic partnership between enterprises can jointly promote the development of the entire industry, and bring more social benefits, so that each agent can be improved   5 Summary This paper puts forward the concept of the big organization based on the CSM t heory. It introduces the basic implication of the big organization and theoretical framework of the big organization including: the big organization's perspective  overall perspective, dynamic perspective, and new resource perspective; the big organizat ionís sense  the purpose of the organizational structure is innovation, organizational activities around the flow of information, breaking the traditional organizational structure, encouraging self run structure, and blurring organizational boundaries; the big organizationís platform  the platform ecosystem of the big organization ; the big organizationís operation mode  borderless learning mode, and cluster effect; the big organizationís theory  active management theory  leading consumers, and culture  entropy reduction theory  negative culture entropy and humanistic ecology theory  inspiring humanity, and circuit theory  a virtuous circle, and collaborative innovation theory  collaborative innovation stakeholder. This paper also discusses culture entropy reduction theory of the big organization  negative culture entropy, and coordinated innovation theory  innovation stakeholders collaboration. Culture entropy change model and collaborative in novation model are constructed   The research has just begun for the big organization. It also needs further improvement but remains the trend of the times   Reference  1  Gordon Pellegrinetti, Joseph Bentsman.

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rollingÖ I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Todayís cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlightís data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlightís hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlightís method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
