The results of performance tests of the SQL and NoSQL solutions and suggestions on the conceptual 
architecture of the ECM system based on NoSQL Documentoriented database are provided. Using of cloud computing clustering, data ranking and other Big Data related technologies is discussed Keywords\227 Big Content, Big Data, cloud computing clustering, data ranking, document-oriented databases, ECM NoSQL I   I NTRODUCTION  As stated in the recent report of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce [1 e B i g Data  m ark et is ex pec t e d t o g r ow to  
16.9 billion in 2015. IBM\222s statement 204E ve r y d a y  w e  create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data \227 so much that 90% of the data in the world today has been created in the last two years alone\224 might be questioned by the skeptics. Still there is no doubt that the Big Data is already an integral part of the global economy, which could not function without it anymore. This extremely rapid growth of the data amount and complexity has introduced new dimensions in data processing that are out of the comfort level for the old one-size-fits-all database products 
and that has led to the introduction of new ones \226 dedicated for use in separate areas \226 transaction processing, data warehouses stream procession, data aggregation  etc. Our area of interest is Enterprise Content Management \(ECM\ and, in particular Document Management, that is influenced heavily by the rapid growth of data amount as well. Currently we run ERDF European Regional Development Fund\ funded research project to evaluate and compare the performance on large document databases of our in-house ECM system Namejs and 
the NoSQL database system Clusterpoint, and design the architecture of the new NoSQL based ECM system Chapter II examines the state of the art of the Big Data related development in ECM area Chapter III and chapter IV briefly describes the two platforms used for performance tests - SQL based Namejs and NoSQL Document-oriented Clusterpoint Chapter V discusses the important differences between SQL and NoSQL platform Chapter VI summarizes  the results of performance tests and advantages of NoSQL for ECM 
Chapter VII details the concepts of the proposed ECM architecture Conclusion outlines the results and suggests the direction for the future work II  ECM  AND  BIG  DATA Enterprise content management \(ECM\ \223the technologies, tools, and methods used to capture, manage store, preserve, and deliver content across an enterprise\224 [3 ECM covers a wide area of functionality [4 5  6 Fig   1  7 d e p i ct s t h e tr ad it io n a l ap p l ic a t io n  ar e a s

server NemakiWare [9   Big Data is both an issue and an opportunity for ECM because using large sets of data and sophisticated methods of analysis can lead to enhancement of the existing products and services. Still Big Data means a lot of change \226 \223you cannot add earthquake to your line of employee relocation options and tools. No doubt an earthquake will move people but it probably will not relocate them as you planned\224 [10 Res e a r ch e r s t a lk  about significant changes to the architecture of ECM systems To stress the importance of these changes Gartner introduced the new term \226 Big Content [11 th at m a rri es En te r p r i se  content with Big Data. Big Content means that an enterprise content should be augmented with public information [11  a n d  that it gets new qualities, like being human \(speaks with a conversational voice\ simple, visual, conversational \(supports comments, reviews, ratings etc.\ and organic \(published fast often in response to unpredictable moments\ [12  III  N AMEJS  Namejs [1 s a MS S Q L ba s e d EC M s y s t em  f i t bot h f o r  public bodies \(like municipalities\d privately owned companies.  The system provides document registration and management within one or several organizations, maintenance of different types of documents, files and related information existing in the organization, as well as business process automation Namejs is implemented in more than 30 municipalities in Latvia as well as in number of other organizations. We are not confident though that the system is able to cope with really large data amounts. We had to develop from scratch a separate Namejs-like ECM system for the Latvian Ministry of Agriculture, for example, because Namejs did not qualify to the customer\222s requirements, in particular, for the data volume to be processed. The system for Ministry of Agriculture is based on MS SQL as well but uses a replicated Clusterpoint database to provide an acceptable response times for full-text search We consider that the platform shift might be necessary for our ECM system and Clusterpoint is one of the candidates for the new platform. Our research project should help us to learn if the Clusterpoint fits as the technology platform for our ECM product and to develop the main architectural concepts for the system in question IV  C LUSTERPOINT  Clusterpoint DBMS \(DataBase Management System, see Fig. 2 15  i s  a  do c um e nt o r i e nt e d share d no t hi ng N o S Q L database that uses sharding \(database horizontal partitioning across multiple instances of the database schema\o split the data volume and computational load over potentially multiple servers A database \(or store as it is called by the authors of Clusterpoint\ can be sharded by document id or using a hashing algorithm. Shards are distributed across nodes on either physical servers or virtual machines in a shared-nothing architecture. The same Clusterpoint software image is installed on each node so the cluster operates in multi-master mode i.e all nodes are equal and can handle all the operations  A Clusterpoint database comprises one or more stores Each store contains a repository and its associated index. The repository contains all data objects and is written back to disk The index contains information for all of the fields that the user has asked to be indexed \(regardless of data type\The index is written to disk for persistency but is partially cached in memory for performance [14   Each Clusterpoint store is a collection of XML documents The XML structure can be defined by user when creating the data store and can contain as subparts the document as well as metadata \(Title, Author, Release Date, Rate etc.\ields. Data is stored and retrieved through an API which supports a full range of CRUD \(Create, Read, Update and Delete\perations and provides both Google-like search and SQL-like query [14  V  N O SQL VERSUS SQL ECM mainly stores unstructured information \(almost 85 of all the data in 2011 was of this type according to [16  l i k e  e-mails, word processing documents, digital images and PDF files. SQL databases are not well suited for management of such kind of data, traditionally it \223exists outside the confines of databases or systems with fixed routines and pathways, such as enterprise resource planning systems and workflow applications\223 [3  T h e  c o nt ent m a na ge m e nt d oc um e n t a nd workflow management in particular\n case of SQL database is based on extracting \(or manually appending\o the document of some metadata \(e.g. author, document type keywords etc.\ and using that metadata for the management purposes. The rest of the content is stored in a content repository so that its semantic is not available for the database system and cannot be used for e.g. workflow management SQL database systems need metadata in particular to facilitate search functionality. The search is based on the metadata. If user needs more \226 he may get a full text search but this does not work particularly well in case of traditional SQL databases [17  The NoSQL world provides another option \226 Documentoriented databases that store the document as a whole \(e.g. as xml\. Examples are MongoDB [1  Co u c hBa s e 16   1 9 a nd Clusterpoint DBMS   Unlocking the potential of Big Data may bring the following benefits for ECM and Document Management in particular  Fig. 2  Architecture of the DBMS Clusterpoint ISBN: 978-1-4673-5256-7/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE                            \                                                                73 


200  ECM systems may profit from benefits of cloud computing; this would allow to move from a paradigm of separate ECM databases of the organizations interchanging the documents via e-mail, for example to the cloud based merged databases 200  usage of clustered cloud based platform addresses the scalability issues allowing to seamlessly add new nodes to the infrastructure in case of rapid growth of data to be processed 200  clustered infrastructure may be used to host several replicas of the data and therefore insure acceptable level of data availability and uninterrupted functioning of the system in case of hardware or software crash 200  ranked search may be used to provide acceptable response times when millions of documents must be processed to find the relevant ones for the customer request VI  P ERFORMANCE TESTS  Series of performance tests were executed inside our project comparing the response times of Clusterpoint DBMS versus SQL based Namejs database. The performance of document loading into database, document indexing and search was measured for both platforms. The performance was measured on identical hardware configuration for both platforms for the main data corpus of 13 million documents copy of Wikipedia english version [20 SQ L p l a t f o r m  w a s tested in addition on 1 million, 100 000 and 10 000 document databases, while NoSQL database \226 on 1 million document database A  Database scaling The results of tests show that performance of the NoSQL solution does not degrade with the increase of the database amount. The same concerns performance tests for document loading and indexing in case of SQL platform \226 the performance does not degrade significantly The different story is about the search. We learned that the performance of the SQL database on the main data corpus is unacceptable for the majority of the tests. The response time of full text ad-hoc search against randomly selected words degraded to as much as 40 minutes and more. The response time of the same search requests was less than a second in case of NoSQL database. The degradation of the performance of the SQL based solution \(in comparison to the NoSQL\ starts to show up as soon as the database reaches amount of about 100 000 documents B  Document loading The loading times \(Fig. 3\ of the NoSQL database are better because it stores a document as a whole while SQL application has to split the data in several \(5-10 for a typical case\ data and index tables which results in more disk access operations C  Document indexing According to the performance tests document indexing on NoSQL is about 8 times faster than on SQL. SQL reindexes about 66MB of documents per second while NoSQL \226 550MB D  Document search Fig. 4 shows the average search time of the word \223tree\224 The search time of the SQL solution for the 13 million document database is not shown - it is more than 40 minutes. It has to be stressed that we are talking about search of relatively small set \(10-20\ of highly relevant data. We are not considering there the search of large volumes of data \(e.g. for report processing  Fig. 3  Average document loading time \(millisec  Fig. 4  Average search time \(millisec\ for word \223tree\224  ISBN: 978-1-4673-5256-7/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE                            \                                                                74 200  Usage of new data sets like voice messages, text messages, videos, e-mails, social networks, etc. may result in improved business processes and more efficient way of content management, assuring that more information is available to make reasonable decisions about what workflow path to follow and what user to assign for the next action on the given document 


VII  A RCHITECTURAL CONCEPTS  We propose four level architecture of the ECM system 200  User interface layer \(client software on PC, smartphone tablet 200  Business function or middleware layer \(ECM business functionality 200  NoSQL Document-oriented DBMS layer \(implements data clustering, replication, indexing, search, retrieval 200  Infrastructure layer \(operating system, visualization network and data transfer, event journaling, e-mail, file and FTP services, utilities The DBMS layer in our architecture is the one that seamlessly implements clustering and parallel processing allowing developers of the business layer to concentrate on design and implementation of the business process functionality. The DBMS should implement the following important for Document management architectural concepts 200  Shared nothing architecture, this allows database to be split into shards and add new nodes to a cluster effortlessly 200  Several replicas of the database may be created and maintained. This ensures the data availability \226 if one of the replicas goes down the other replica\(s\ may be used 200  Inverted index and ranking is used to determine document\222s relevance against the search request. The rankings can be configured flexibly, particularly by editing the ranking policies in a data store ranking policy file Maximum flexibility should be supported for location of the shards and replicas on the cluster nodes. This is supported by Clusterpoint DBMS as illustrated in the Fig. 5 \226 shards of Articles are located on nodes x and y, shards of the replica of Articles \226 on nodes y and z [14   I f n o de y go e s do w n  w e still  have all the data available A  Search in a shared nothing data store The search request is forwarded for parallel execution to all shards of the data store \(if some of the primary shards are down, a replica is involved instead\. Results of the search are transferred back to the originating shard which joins them and presents to the user. In the case of the ECM system that means that with the increase in data amount new shards may be added to the database to avoid the performance degradation. This means as well that the business layer of the application must not be concerned about how to split the documents between shards, which shard to address in a search request or how to merge the results \226 DBMS is providing means to configure this and takes responsibility of the process B  Document ranking and search There are three basic information ranking mechanisms in the Clusterpoint DBMS [15   200  By value of document\222s metadata field <rate>, assigned to each document before storing it 200  By value ranges assigned to the document\222s metadata fields \(controls the relevant importance of one metadata field against another \226  hence document that has the searched term in, for example, \223title\224 field is considered to be more relevant that one with the searched term in 223comment\224 field 200  By frequency and position of search terms within textual content of the document or metadata fields \226 higher ranks may receive, for example, document containing more occurrences of the searched term document with search term occurrence closer to the start of document or closer to other searched terms The ranking policy is defined when creating the data storage. It influences the sort order of the returned result set This means that when creating the ECM for a particular domain the ranking policy may be defined to assure the most relevant results are returned in the first page C  Adding new documents A new document is added instantly to one replica of one of the shards. The DBMS decides what shard must take care of the current document; later on it replicates the document to other replicas. In case of ECM this means that the new document will be stored in database even if some of the replicas are not available. Replicas may be out of sync for short periods of time but the DBMS makes sure they are in sync again D  Indexing Indexing is performed when the new document is added to the database or the document is updated. In relation to ECM we should consider two kinds of functionality \226 creating of an index record and creating of metadata. Both are used when searching for relevant data. A structure of the metadata must be decided upon creation of the database structure. The metadata of the document must be provided to DBMS from the business function layer \(extracted from the document automatically or with assistance of the user\ The index data is extracted from the document by DBMS. To ensure acceptable performance the items that are searched must be indexed. In case of ECM the  Fig. 5  Sharding and replication ISBN: 978-1-4673-5256-7/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE                            \                                                                75 


searchable items are words hence the index consists of words that are supplemented with links to documents containing that word E  Clustering Obvious advantage of the shared-nothing documentoriented database \(like Clusterpoint DBMS\at it scales easily and is convenient for clustered computing. The reason is that every data item \(e.g. document\ere is stored as a whole which makes the easy task to add new cluster nodes to the system and split the items through the nodes\ in contrary to SQL database where the item data is split in several tables Thus the normalization of data which is the very fundament of relational databases turns out to make the platform not suited for the clustering VIII  C ONCLUSION  NoSQL document-oriented ready for clustering DBMS like Clusterpoint\eems a reasonable platform for ECM in the Big Data world. Our performance tests show that starting from the 100 000 document database the selected NoSQL platform outperforms the SQL platform for the tasks typical for Document management. With the increase of amount the performance of SQL solution degrades quickly and the system definitely cannot cope with a 13 million document database The performance of NoSQL solution, in contrary, stays at the reasonable level even without the use of clustering For the further increase of data amount Document-oriented storage and shared nothing architecture provides easy scaling through adding of new cluster nodes. The clustered processing usage of inverted indexes and ranked search ensures that the response times stay at an acceptable level even for very large amounts of data The main direction of the future work is the further elaboration of the ECM architecture discussed in this paper R EFERENCES  1  Leslie Bradshaw. \223Big Data and What it Means.

3  Throughput Through the throughput, system administrators can evaluate system performance clearly, higher throughput indicates that the system can complete more jobs in unit time, and the system resources can be utilized sufficiently Fig. 7 presents the throughput \(number of jobs processed in one minute\ of five schedulers under mixed workload Because the mixed workload contains many large jobs, the value of throughput is low. By solving the locality problem the throughput of fair with delay scheduling can gain an outstanding improvement, which is 1.2 times of that of default FIFO scheduler. Although Naïve Fair sharing and capacity schedulers have different turnaround time, their throughputs are almost same; they are all larger than FIFO scheduler and HOD scheduler  Figure 7  The throughput \(number of jobs processed in one minute running full workload by using five schedulers respectively Through the above experiments, we find fair with delay scheduling scheduler is the most efficient scheduler; it can be shown in DPS, average turnaround time, average running time, and throughput. But due to the affection of data locality some jobs with large size will have longer time to finish than usual jobs For running mixed workload the Naïve Fair sharing and capacity scheduler have the nearly same performance in throughput and DPS two administrator’s perspective, but naïve fair has the shorter average turnaround time and capacity has the shorter average waiting time. Fair with delay scheduling, naïve fair, capacity, these three schedulers are all have the better performance than default FIFO scheduler HOD scheduler preformed not very well, affected by the extra cost of virtualization V  C ONCLUSIONS  With the popularization of Hadoop, numerous private clouds based on Hadoop clusters are established by many organizations. Since these data centers are often used by multiple users, optimizing the performance of Hadoop clusters is very necessary and significant. In this paper, we evaluate the five common Hadoop schedulers by using CloudRank-D, a publicly benchmark suite for private cloud Throughput, Turnaround time and Data Processed per Second are chosen as the metrics of evaluation. Experimental results show that different task schedulers have different influences on system performance in different situation, so the choice of task schedulers is very critical for system performance improvement of Hadoop cluster. Specially, fair sharing with delay scheduling can improve data locality and reduce the cost of network communication between nodes and DPS is improved by 20% than that of FIFO scheduler Optimization and design of the scheduler need to refer to the characteristics of the workload. In the future, we will use more complex workloads to study and evaluate more efficient task schedulers for Hadoop based cloud systems A CKNOWLEDGMENT  Our work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61372171 and the National Key Technology R&D Program of China under Contract No. 2012BAH23B03 R EFERENCES  1  J.

TABLE II Summary of Average Monthly FTP Hit Rate and Monthly Power Consumption Fig 18 Monthly power consumption for 200TB LRU caches with and without prefetching 3 Prefetching and Expansion of Storage Capacity Cache Con\223guration Avg Monthly Hit Rate Avg Monthly Power Watts Avg Monthly Cost  We now examine power consumption of the same two cache con\223gurations in 223gure 18 We observe that the inclusion of prefetching results in an average monthly power consumption of 17,052,688 watts a 15.38 reduction from the 20,152,915 watt average monthly power projection of a 200TB LRU cache without prefetching In this section we provide several possible software and hardware con\223gurations that EROS may choose to improve the performance of its satellite image distribution system presented previously in Figure 7 EROS currently operates with a cache capacity of 100TB and can achieve a 3.71 increase in hit rate through the use of our proposed prefetching algorithms In addition to an increase in hit rate EROS is projected to consume 159,963 less kilowatts of power per month If the system were expanded to a cache capacity of 200TB we predict that an additional 6,244,295 watts of power would be consumed monthly at the bene\223t of 3.71 increase in monthly hit rate If EROS does expand to a larger FTP server our proposed prefetching algorithms have the potential to reduce the power consumption by 3,100,227 watts per month 15.38 Furthermore prefetching on a 200TB LRU cache would increase the hit rate by 2.25 The results of our experiments are summarized in Table II V R ELATED W ORK Massive data systems are characterized by their focus on the warehousing of vast amounts of data and the necessity to serve a multitude of clients simultaneously The current trends in research in the improvement of massive storage systems have focused on the application of solid state disks to take advantage of the myriad of technical bene\223ts they provide Lee et al has presented a thorough evaluation of the bene\223ts of using solid state drives as a cache for a larger sized hard disk array to create a tiered storage architecture in order to improve system throughput as well as to reduce power consumption Other researchers have also explored using SSDs as a faster tier of storage for caching and suggest a similar approach Schall et al have explored using SSDs in high-performance massive databases and measured power consumption under a series of differing loads and access patterns recommending that SSDs not being used as large storage devices but instead as storage for the most highly accessed pieces of data in order to take advantage of the potential power savings provided by SSDs The ER OS system utilizes a tiered hybrid storage system where raw data is stored on magnetic tapes before being requested for processing and sent to the higher layer the FTP servers made of SSDs which can take advantage of SSDs and tradeoff performance and cost when appropriate con\223gures are selected Prefetching has been widely used to increase cache performance 8 9 10 11 12 It w as reported that an effective prefetching algorithm can improve the cache hit ratio by as much as 50 percent It also has been shown that performance can be improved without a higher cost via intelligently prefetching Prefetching techniques can be classi\223ed into informed prefetching and predictive prefetching Informed prefetching relies on user-provided hints while predictive prefetching is based on the analysis results of historical user behavior For the EROS system it is almost impossible to obtain a list of a user\220s future requests before they are submitted to the system Without prior knowledge of a user\220s choices predictive prefetching will be the most appropriate method for offsetting the FTP miss penalty Next Sequential Prefetching NSP 22 23 are also used to explore spatial locality to improve cache performance However the structure of the EROS data prohibits the forming of direct spacial relationships among two images because each request can shift in six possible dimensions Please refer to Section III-B VI C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we have presented a variety of con\223gurations that can be applied to the FTP servers of a public-servicing massive storage system maintained by USGS EROS We have explored the changes in two key metrics performance and power consumption that can be obtained by the adoption of 100TB LRU No Prefetching current 65.8628 13,908,620 1,127 100TB LRU with Prefetching 70.2583 13,748,657 1,114 200TB LRU No Prefetching 69.5770 20,152,915 1,632 200TB LRU with Prefetching 71.8283 17,052,688 1,381 C Summary of Results 


in Proceedings of the 1995 ACM SIGMETRICS Joint International Conference on Measurement and Modeling of Computer Systems various software and hardware con\223gurations leading us to the recommendation that prefetching algorithms be applied to any of the proposed cache con\223gurations in order to increase the hit rate and decrease the system power consumption In addition we have examined the effects of a likely future expansion of FTP server size on the EROS system and found a slight increase in hit rate in addition to the expected substantial increase in power consumption Although the bene\223t of prefetching diminishes as cache sizes become larger we continue to suggest the use of prefetching as a mechanism for offsetting the cost of powering additional hardware The cost of expanding the FTP server farm to 200TB would contain not only a signi\223cant up-front investment about 8 million dollars but an increasing power draw Our experimental results Table II demonstrate that the EROS system can maintain the same level of performance with 31.78 of power savings by using our proposed popularity-based and user-speci\223c prefetching algorithms compared to doubling the size of its FTP server farm Therefore we suggest administrators of large scale massive storage systems fully explore all possible software optimizations before physically expanding the existing system
