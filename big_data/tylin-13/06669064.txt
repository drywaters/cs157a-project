Evaluation of Memory-Efìcient 1-bit Compressed Sensing in Wireless Sensor Networks Theerat Sakdejayont Doohwan Lee Yuanyuan Peng Yasutaka Yamashita and Hiroyuki Morikawa Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology The University of Tokyo Japan Email  theerat leedh peng08 yasu mori  mlab.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp Abstract Wireless sensor networks generate big-data which leads to overwhelming trafìc in the networks Compressed sensing CS can exploit signal sparsity to reduce the amount of trafìc We evaluate the performance of 1-bit CS with a circulant random bipolar measurement matrix The results show that 1bit CS can decrease trafìc at higher degree in wireless sensor networks compared to the conventional CS Moreover applying a circulant random bipolar measurement matrix overcomes the limitation of memory in sensor nodes The scheme is studied in terms of reconstruction accuracy and memory consumption by using real sensor data The implementation on sensor nodes validates the viability on a practical system I I NTRODUCTION Compressed sensing CS e xploits signal sparsity to reduce the amount of trafìc generated from a big-data technology e.g wireless sensor networks WSNs The sensor data usually exhibits correlation among data which can be represented as sparse data in some domain Lower power consumption for data transmission and server storage memory can be expected by applying the CS-based data compression 1-bit CS can improve the performance of trafìc reduction in wireless sensor networks while applying a circulant random bipolar measurement addresses the limitation of memory in sensor nodes CS conventionally represents high-dimensional signals in the form of smaller number of measurements by using randomized linear non-adaptive measurements The conventional CS assumes that the measurements are real valued and have inìnite bit precision However in practice the measurements are quantized into nite number of bits In an extreme case Boufounos et al introduced 1-bit CS which uses only 1bit quantization representing sign of the measurements Although more measurements are necessary in 1-bit CS it can nally decrease the number of bits from the original high resolution quantized bitstream WSNs are composed of large number of distributed nodes which capture huge amount of data and communicate with each other via wireless communication The small sensor nodes usually have limited processing power limited energy and scarce memory This work focuses on applying CS without violating the memory limitation which is crucial because it determines the feasibility of a desired application A measurement matrix used in the CS measurement is stored in sensor nodes limited memory and it is accounted as main memory space consumption of CS data processing algorithm Since 1-bit CS requires more measurements which result in larger memory consumed by a measurement matrix a circulant structured matrix with entries randomly generated by Fig 1 Block diagram of compressed sensing Bernoulli distribution is introduced to cope with the memory issue In this paper we evaluate the performance of memoryefìcient 1-bit CS which adopts a circulant random bipolar measurement matrix by using real sensor data including temperature relative humidity and illuminance The results show that the proposed scheme can reduce the trafìc and save signiìcant amount of memory compared to the conventional CS under same conditions Furthermore the experiment on real sensor nodes is also conducted to verify our scheme II CS B ACKGROUND When the original signals can be expressed as a large number of zero or nearly zero values and a small number of non-zero values the signals are said to be sparse CS is a state-of-the-art data compression and reconstruction theory that exploits the fact that many natural signals are sparse or compressible in an appropriate basis such as Fourier Discrete Cosine Transform DCT and Discrete Wavelet Transform DWT etc 4 Figure 1 shows the block diagram of CS CS measurement is performed in data sources which is sensor nodes in our consideration A measurement vector y which is an outcome of CS measurement is transmitted along the network to a root node to reconstruct the original signal The root node which is usually a relatively high performance computer rstly nds a sparse solution s according to l 1-norm minimization problem and then transform the sparse solution to a reconstructed signal corresponding to a sparsifying basis Unlike thresholding-based transformation compressions which also exploit the signal sparsity in some domains by IEEE R10-HTC2013 Sendai, Japan, August 26-29, 2013 326 


extracting high coefìcients as an output the encoding part of CS is universal among sensor data The same encoding process can be done even when different sensor data are sparse in different domains The sensor nodes do not require a knowledge of which domain the data is sparse In another aspect the reconstruction performance of CS is improvable ceaselessly Given CS measurements stored in a server the discovery of better sparsifying basis for the data can be applied at the reconstruction process to improve the reconstruction performance III 1-B IT CS WITH S TRUCTURED M EASUREMENT A 1-bit CS When reducing trafìc at high rate the conventional CS suffers from insufìcient measurements and results in high distortion from reconstruction Therefore we are interested in 1-bit CS where each measurement is quantized into one bit of sign information At a given target number of bits of compressed data 1-bit CS can increase the number of measurement Despite of low resolution quantization the additional measurements which may even exceed the number of original signal can improve the reconstruction accuracy and therefore lower distortion by 1-bit CS can be expected Let a lengthN signal vector x be represented as a sparse vector s with the relationship x  s where  is a basis matrix In 1-bit CS measurement the original signal vector x is compressed by an measurement matrix  as follows y sign x  1 where y denotes the lengthM acquired CS measurement vector sign function returns 1 for positive numbers and  1 for negative numbers Note that the conventional CS assumes that the measurements y are real valued and have inìnite bit precision Therefore Eq 1 becomes y  x  However in practice measurements y have to be quantized to a discrete value over some nite range before being further processed Let a system quantization be B bits A total compression rate including quantization R c is deìned as the ratio between the number of bits required for a compressed and an original signal such that R c  M conv N for the conventional CS and R c  M 1 bit BN for 1-bit CS Although the amplitude information is lost during 1-bit measurement stage the reconstruction method w a s proposed to enforce that the sparse solution s lies on the unit sphere and the l 1 norm minimization problem becomes min  s  1 subject to y  sign  s    s  2 1  2 As a comparison between the conventional and 1-bit CS 1-bit CS can increase the number of measurement to BR c N compared to that of the conventional CS at R c N at a given target number of bits of compressed data However due to larger measurement matrix memory requirement of 1-bit CS are increased by a factor of B to store the larger measurement matrix B Structured Measurement Generally we require that coherence between the measurement matrix  and the basis  is small enough A good choice for the measurement matrix  is random matrices In this work we consider two classes of sub-Gaussian distribution measurement matrix namely Gaussian and bipolar random matrix Since entries in bipolar random matrix are only 1 and  1 which can be represented by only 1 bit the use of bipolar random matrix as a measurement matrix can save some memory Instead of storing the fully random measurement matrix which occupies large memory space applying partial random structured matrices as measurement matrices is encouraged It has been shown that circulant random matrices with entries generated independently from the same distributions are also sufìcient to satisfy the RIP restricted isometry geometry with high probability Gi v e n a stem v ector c  c 0   c i  T where i  max  M N   the circulant matrix can be drawn as C      c 0 c i  1  c 1 c 1 c 0  c 2          c i  1 c i  2  c 0      3 In the conventional CS we are interested when a number of raw signal N is larger than a number of measurement M  the measurement matrix will be a row submatrix of C  However in most cases of 1-bit CS a number of measurement M grows larger than a number of raw signal N  The constructed measurement matrix will be a column submatrix of C  By using the circulant matrix the memory required for storing measurement matrices is reduced signiìcantly The memory for storing conventional CS measurement matrices is reduced to O  N   unlike fully random matrices which occupy O  R c N 2   In the M>N 1-bit CS case structured matrices consume O  BR c N  memory while fully random matrices use O  BR c N 2   This comparison is done based on a given xed number of target compressed bits so that we can compare between the conventional CS and 1-bit CS IV E VALUATION We evaluate the performance of 1-bit CS with circulant random bipolar measurement by using real sensor data including temperature relative humidity illuminance of visible light 320 nm to 730 nm The raw data is sensed by using TelosB wireless sensor nodes A Simulation We compare the introduced scheme with the conventional CS and a fully random Gaussian measurement and their combinations The conventional CS uses B 16 bits for quantization GPSR and BIHT 8 are used as reconstruction algorithms for the conventional and 1-bit CS respectively DCT basis is employed as our sparsifying basis The evaluation is done in MATLAB by using 10-day data collected from 83 sensors The data are compressed and reconstructed independently every hour 120 samples It is worthwhile to notice that the signal vector x is consistently removed the DC IEEE R10-HTC2013 Sendai, Japan, August 26-29, 2013 327

We can also see that our approach has achieved a rate of rejection in some cases with sharing of resources smaller than the rate of rejection of Calheiros approach in the case without sharing For example with the rst input ow regular ow and with 50 MVs Calheiros approach has rejected more than 36 of requests received in the case without sharing while our rejected rate is less than 36 in the case of sharing with 5 MVs affected Also with the second ow and 50 MVs Calheiros has rejected in the case without sharing more than 30.5 of received requests while our rate of rejection is less than of 30.5 in the case of sharing and with 5 MVs affected The same gain is more visible with the results of 100 MVs where we can see that the rejection rate of our approach in the case of sharing and with 40 MVs affected 0.1 with the regular ow and 0.2 with the random ow is smaller than the rate of rejection of Calheiros in the case without sharing 4 with the regular ow and 1 with the random ow Fig 5 Rate of rejected requests regular ow with 50 VMs Fig 6 Average response time regular ow with 50 VMs By cons where the vast majority of virtual machines are affected by degradation the Calheiros strategy proved more effective however such cases must be very rare with the use of placement policies of virtual machines in the Clouds V C ONCLUSION In this paper we proposed a new load balancing policy that takes into account the interference of performance which may affect the QoS of virtual machines in the Clouds Our proposal was more scalable and could signiìcantly reduce the rate of rejected requests in both cases with and without resource sharing We have shown that it is possible to reduce the rate of rejected requests through optimal use of capacities of virtual machines and we were able to mitigate the degradations of some virtual machines using other non-affected virtual machines without creating an additional burden However we intend to complete this work by the introduction of a policy to predict the evolution of the intensity of ow of requests to dynamically obtain the appropriate number of instances to create or maintain to meet the desired QoS Fig 7 Rate of rejected requests regular ow with 100 VMs Fig 8 Average response time regular ow with 100 VMs
