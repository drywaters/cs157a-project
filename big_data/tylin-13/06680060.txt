Abstract Extract, transform, and load \(ETL\ is a very common and important technology for building data warehouse includes business intelligence. When people issue a very complex SQL query to acquit data from a transaction system into a data warehouse, it involves many procedures including table-joining, sort, and aggregation. Such procedures require significant retrieving step and huge data

Performance Tuning in Distributed Processing of ETL  
 
transferring from tables. The intensive querying very often causes performance issues to be concerned. Moreover, it commonly generates negative impacts on data instance resources. How to improve the performance for ETL becomes critical and challenging. This paper presents a parallel processing solution that splitting big and complex SQL query into small pieces in distributed computing manor. The proposed method aims at reducing cost of computation, while ensuring data integrity among joined tables. The innovative idea can be verified through selected test-beds of performance tuning Keywords- ETL; Data extraction; Capture data changes

I I NTRODUCTION In processing of extract, transform, and load \(ETL there exist three database functions that are integrated together to operate data transfer from one table to another to form data marts or warehouses. It also functions to convert databases from one format to another. Therefore ETL is a very common technology utilized in business intelligence There is an example of unexpected ETL performance during an implementation of business analysis. The transactional data are extracted, transformed, and loaded from SIEBEL CRM system to a business intelligence data 
warehouse. As ETL 
ProC for extraction Syncsort for capture data changes \(CDC\ and Informatica for loading delta changes \(LDC\ are all functioning well in the first phase. However after the data volume rapidly increased in the system, the performance of complex extraction became worse When sophisticated queries are executed and the system retrieved huge data on the system takes about 90% of total ETL computing time. How to deal with such performance problem become critical to the business data extraction, transactions and distribution in real time. In the following section, we would like to 
s components 
demonstrate how to analyze such problem II P ROBLEM A NALYSIS First, we make sure that all data are read from the Siebel CRM system using ProC. The data in previous and current steps are compared to check whether there exists any data change. Such process can be accomplished by using Syncsort. Then captured data changes are loaded into the data warehouse. Extensive analysis can be conducted to determine bottlenecks occurring in the whole process  The major issues can be addressed as follows All transforms/aggregations can be executed in complex extract queries. For example, a most complex 
query can sometimes consists of more than 10 scalar sub queries and complex aggregations, loops, or sorts  If using the SIEBEL-CRM software system, the performance may lack of tuning. As all know, most of setups in a transactional system is OLTP-dedicated, which only returns first row. It is uncontrollable to all the return rows \(which are DW characteristics\. In addition, the system also suffers negative performance due to the influence cause by huge complex extraction of retrieving data Rapidly-developed commerce markets and business generate huge amounts of data volume significantly The 
corresponding queries become complex and not linearly scalable. The more volume increase, more surfer we may have. When dealing with big data, the intensive computing becomes necessary. Such computation causes low performance of operation using existing software. The performance issues are getting to be more concerned and complained by end-users, especially for Windows-based users on their daily PCs Not like a simple query on a huge amount of data resource, which can be accomplished within a tolerated time scale a complex query on a big data can significantly reduce computing performance Fig. 1 shows the previous solution chart in which 
CM refers to a complex query involved both base table M and referred tables A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, etc. d\(CM\ stands for the change \(or delta\ between the current and previous CM. Everyday only delta records can executed on target table, while remaining the current CM on source table. M is the base table of source. It has the same primary key as in the target table. M*, A*, and B* represent the expected columns from M, A, and B in a target table T, respectively The d\(M d\(A and d\(B*\ are the delta data

III S OLUTION How to reduce the complexity of extract query, while still ensuring data integrity is an important issue. We first analyze what the kind of data are expected to be delivered from source in SIEBEL CRM system to data warehouse during a regular daily process. In such case, we have d\(T\=d\(CM Current CM\(M*,A*,B*\ CDC Previous CM\(M*,A*,B*\. T is the target table, which has the current result from a complex query CM. It includes expected columns of M*, A*, and B*. The d\(T\ is identical to d\(CM\. The d\(T\ is executed to obtain the target table T to keep the current updated When consider ROWID as the primary key in both M and T, the d\(T\ includes the delta ROWIDS calculated in d\(CM In other words, the d\(T\ includes those ROWIDS which have been changed in the base table M or those ROWIDS possibly to be changed in M due to the influences of scalar sub queries A and B. Therefore, the d\(T\ could be split into small pieces based on ROWID, i.e  d\(T\ =d\(SM\{ Current SM CDC Previous SM       M*[impacted by d\(A   M*[impacted by d\(B    SM is the result based on a simple query. It only fetches records from base table M \(or the base table with simple joins The d\(SM\ stands for the delta data of the current SM and previous SM. It includes those that the ROWID are changed The M*\(d\(A*\\,M*\(d\(B*\includes those ROWIDS from base table M*. Whether or not being changed, they are always influenced by the delta data d\(A*\, d\(B The d\(SM\ includes those changed columns from base table M. After d\(SM\ is executed the target table T has the same ROWIDS as M has Let T have the keys A* and B referenced to M*. It is possible to be ROWID or other reference key. Then those delta data come from d\(A The d\(B*\an be calculated from T. It turns out that the calculation of d\(A*\ and d\(B*\ are on the source side. The T\(d\(A*\and T\(d\(B can be update by EQUAL-JOIN on Data Warehouse side. Fig. 2 shows the execution steps Step 1: Restructure a complex query. Put in-line scalar sub queries down to select the location to store using OUT-JOIN Step 2: Split the complex query into main query \(with base table\ and referred queries Step 3: After separating EXTRACT/CDC/LOAD jobs for preparation of distributed main and referred queries load the delta d\(SM\ into target table. The d\(M*\ must be executed firstly to ensure data integrity Step 4: After the d\(M*\ is executed, load delta M*\(d\(A*\\, M*\(d\(B  and M*\(d\(C Fig. 3 shows the proposed solution flow chart. A is a scalar sub query with tables A1, A2 and A3 which are joined each other. B is a scalar sub query with jointed tables B1 and B2 TABLE1 S HOWS THE DIFFERENT COST oading jobs can be

In this way, the querying can be executed in parallel. The OUT-JOIN \(full M out-joins to full referred queries\ becomes EQUAL-JOIN target table T equal-joins delta data from referred several queries\. The complexity can be balanced on two sides while the computational performance can be reduced significantly IV TEST BED OF P ROPOSED SOLUTION After implement the proposed solution in ETL three processes of extract, CDC, and loading have been changed Taking the most complex query as our test, we split a complex query CM into a simple query SM and several referred sub queries A, B, and C. Compare the results of computational cost using previous and proposed solutions we find the differences which are listed in Table1 The total elapsed time for extraction is decreased from about 3 hours to 3 minutes using proposed method Moreover, the distributed queries can be executed in parallel. Though multiple CDC 
87 


present, the total time elapsed is not significantly large compared with of single original CDC and loading jobs  V C ONCLUSION Many methods have been tried on the complex extract query \(like adding hints\ in ETL process with varying instance parameters in data transaction. The cost performance is a concern  In this work, we propose and experiment a parallel method in which a complex query is spited into several simple and small ones for execution in parallel. The results of increasing performance are very promising. The total cost can distributed and decreased, with less influences on source database In future, we would like to consider reduce such cost through reference sub queries if queries are very complex and cannot hosted on source instance The relationship between main query and reference sub queries with data integrity is the most important issue to be considered and modeled, if we split complex queries A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work is sponsored by Shanghai Education Commission Scientific Research Innovation Project 11YZ282\.

Assume that we have 10 computing nodes and each node has 8 CPU cores, 16 GB memory, and acts as Data Node and Task Tracker. We demonstrate the calculation of the first three parameter values of Hadoop framework in Table A1. To achieve the best-effort of CPU utilization, there would be assign 2 processes to utilize for each CPU core, in general. Thus, there are 16 processes execute simultaneously in a node. However, to obtain the functionality of underlying operating system, we prepare one CPU core for system routine process and I/O operations Thus, there are at most 7 CPU cores for Hadoop framework and we decide to set up at most 7 map tasks and 7 reduce tasks concurrently. Since in-memory processing is faster than performing operation with swap space or content switching we optimism the memory usage of each node is within its physical boundary. Furthermore, we preserved around 500 MB for processes of operating system, 1 GB for operations of Data Node, and 1 GB for Task Tracker. To utilize the rest 13 GB memory with at most 14 tasks concurrently, we can assign 950 MB memory for each task 5

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rollingÖ I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Todayís cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlightís data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlightís hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlightís method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
