IOT-StatisticDB\this paper. In IOT-StatisticDB, statistical functions are performed through statistical operators inside the DBMS kernel, so that complicated statistic al queries can be expressed in the standard SQL format. Besides, statistical analysis is executed in a distr ibuted and parallel manner over multiple servers so that the performance can be greatly improved, which is co nfirmed by the experiments 
Sensor Sampling Data, Spatial-Temporal Data 
I I NTRODUCTION  With the recent advances in sensor networks and in the Internet of things \(IoT\atistical analysis of massive sensor data becomes a key research issue. In a large scale IoT system, there are numerous sensors and / or monitoring devices connected, which repeatedly send sampling data to the data center. The data center not only needs to store manage, and query the individual sampling data efficiently but also needs to conduct statistical analysis in order to extract more general informati on about the physical world Such a scenario is a typical big data environment because of 
the huge volume of data and high frequency of updates. As a result, a lot of challenging prob lems need to be solved Statistical analysis of sensor sampling data is one of the most important procedures in IoT systems in order to transform dataŽ into knowledgeŽ, and is crucial in a lot of applications like disaster monitoring, emergency management, e-health, intelligen t transportation systems and so forth. As an example, lets consider the pollution monitoring in a large city. Each pollution sensor can only monitor a small area, and only through statistical analysis we can get more general information over large areas such as  what is the most polluted region of the city 
how the most polluted region changes over time 
and It is obvious that such general information is far more important than the individual sampling valu es collected from the sensors Another example is traffic flow analysis through GPStracked vehicles \(or moving objectsŽ\moving object can sample its motion vectors \(including location, speed, and direction\atedly through GPS an d send them to the data center. However, a motion vector can only reflect the status of a certain vehicle at a certain time instant. To get the traffic flow information of the whol e traffic network, statistical analysis should be conducted 
based on huge numbers of motion vectors There are many existing works which can be used for statistical analysis on sensor sampling data. However, most of them are implemented outside the database kernel, and focus on the specialized analytic methodologies making them unsuited for the IoT environment where both the data types and the statistical queries are heterogeneous and diverse. For instance, in a modern intelligent transportation system, there coul d be many different kinds of sensors which can collect raw data for traffic flow analysis, like loop sensors, traffic video cameras, GPS 
sens ors RF ID rea ders  optic al sens ors m i crowa ve vehic l e detectors, and so forth. The sampling data of these sensors have totally deferent formats and semantics. Therefore, each kind of sensors needs a different statistical analysis module which could be a heavy work load for system developers On the other hand, if we support generalized statistical analysis in database kernel level, then complicated statistical analysis can be easily expressed in the standard SQL interface  Another lim itation for existing statistical analysis methods is that most of them are centralized solutions [5  whic h are uns uited for bi g data analysi s For insta n ce  
the most effective clustering algorithms, DBSCAN  OPTICS [7  K Mean s and its variations [9-10 are all designed for centralized data analysis environments and can not be directly used in distributed and parallel environments. Besides, a lot of index methods to speed up the statistical analysis are no t suited for the IoT environment because the frequent data updates can cause very high index update costs There are several database management systems which can support statistical analysis on structured data However, only simple statistical functions \(like average

IOT-StatisticDBŽ for short\n this paper. The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the architecture the data types, and operators of IOT-StatisticDB, Section 3 presents the parallel statistical analysis methods of IOTStatisticDB, Section 4 discusses implementation issues and performance evaluation results, and Section 5 finally concludes the paper II A RCHITECTURE OF IOT-S TATISTIC DB AND THE D ATA T YPES AND O PERAORS FOR S TATICAL A NALYSIS  In many applications like environment monitoring, we need to conduct complex statistical analysis to understand the physical world and to explore useful knowledge based on the IoT sampling data. We should notice that many applications require similar or even the same statistical operations at the database leve l. This observatio n motivates us to propose a databa se kernel level statistical analysis mechanism to support high performance common analytics on IoT sampling data Among the complex statistical analysis operations in demand, we classify some typi cal ones and implement uniform operators for them. In general, most of the statistical operations in IoT systems can be classified into spatial aggregations and parame ter aggregations. For a given data set, spatial aggregations can cluster the geographical values extracted from sensor data to larger groups so that meaningful knowledge about spatial distributions can be extracted. On the other hand, parameter aggregations allow us to get aggregation information like average, minimum, maximum, and count from the sensor sampling values In addition, both param eter aggregations and spatial aggregations can be further divided into Euclidean-based and network-based. Euclidean-based aggregations do not consider traffic networks whi le network-based aggregations take the underline traffic networks into account. Therefore in IOT-StatisticDB, we can have 4 kinds of statistical analysis methods, designed as statistical analysis operators as shown in Table 1 TABLE I C LASSIFICATION OF S TATISTICAL A NALYSIS M ETHODS IN IOT-S TATISTIC DB Suppose that we have various kinds of sensor sampling data about Beijing Euclidean-based spatial aggregations can answer queries like the output of the query is a spatial region with hole, as illustrated in Figure 1\networkbased spatial aggregations can answer queries like    Figure 1. Euclidean-based Spatial Aggregation  Example Euclidean-based parameter aggregation queries include and network-based parameter aggregations can answer queries like Network-based parameter aggregations compute the tr affic parameters of each road section of a given area by analyzing the GPS trajectories of moving objects or by analyzing the sampling data of traffic flow sensors To support IoT data statistical analysis efficiently, we adopt a three-layered architecture in IOT-StatisticDB, as shown in Figure 2           Figure 2.

Since data are sampled densely, not all samplings need to be stored at the Only key sampling values \(for numeri c sensors\values for multimedia devices\re kept at this layer The is the key for multimodal data query processing \(like spatial-temporal queries keyword-based queries, and value-based approximate queries In the following two subsections, we describe th e working mechan ism of this layer, including the data types a nd the related operators for storing and analyzing the IoT data As shown in Figure 2, the assumes a 2-layered structure. The master server is the coordinator which only keeps global catalogs and global indices, while the node servers store the key sampling values sent from the All key sampling values are sent to the sampling server first, which then distributes them to th e corresponding node servers according to their sampling locations In this subsection, we first describe how traffic network and sampling values are expressed at the of IOT-StatisticDB, and then discuss how they are distributed among multiple servers A traffic network  is defined as follows   where is a set of directed edges and is a set of nodes A direct edge \(or simply edge  is defined as the form   here  String is the identifier of    Polyline is the geometry of where 1     Point is the th vertex of the polyline  Real is the length of and   String are the identifiers of the starting and ending nodes which are connected by edge  A node  is defined as the form        String is the identifier of   Point is the location of  1     String is the identifier of the th edge connected by  and is the connectivity matrix of which describes the traffic transferability among different edges through the node A sampling value denoted as is defined as follows       where  Instant is the sampling time Point is the sampling location String is the network position of the sampling \(expressed with an edge iden tifier, and set to null if not on road network String and  String denote the format and the actual value of the sampling respectively Through the data type, we can express heterogeneous sensor sampling value in a uniformed manner.

data type can be designed and implemented as a pointer in the tuple leading to a file block where the real data are stored. In this way, data updates triggered by new samplings can be conducted quickly without database updates involved With the above data types, we can create the following table for storing sensor sampling data where SensorID, SensorTyp e are the identifier, the type \(e.g VehicleGPS, RFID, etc.\of the sensor; DeployedBy and DeployedTime are the deplorer and time of the deployment SamplingSquence is the sampling sequence from sensors Traffic network is not stored as relational tables. Instead it is directly stored in file system. To speedup the data access, indices are built on traffic network In the following, we discuss how the sampling data and the traffic network are distributed among the master server and the node servers. In the  sampling data are distributed at the node servers according to their geographical attribu te. Each node server  corresponds to a spatial area  ch is called the service area of Any two service areas do not intersect each other and the union of all services areas is equal to the whole application area Therefore, the service areas actually make a spatial partition of  For any sampling value       if is from a static sensor, then the sampling receiver simply transfers it to the node server whose service area contains If is from a mobile sensor \(like GPS sensor the sampling receiver needs to conduct necessary interpolations at the bo rder of service areas, and sends the resultedvalues to the corresponding node server\(s\as shown in Figure 3               Figure 3. Data Distribution at the IoT-Storage and Statistics Layer The traffic network is also distributed among the node servers. Node server only keeps the edges and the nodes which are inside or intersect  For the sake of efficiency, the master server needs to store the whole traffic network The data types allow us to express sensor sampling data and the underlying traffic network in databases and in file systems. To query the sensor data and to conduct statistical analysis, we need to further defi ne a set of operators so that complicated statistical functions can be expressed in SQL In defining operators, we use signatures which describe the input and the output data types of the general, the operators in IOT-StatisticDB can be divided into the following 4 categories returns part of sampling sequence which is inside a given region spatially, while returns part of the sampling sequence which is inside a given time period temporally computes and returns a sampling value corresponding to a specified time instant  If is not a sampling time then necessary in terpolation is required. The signatures of these operators are as follows Projection operators can be further divided into sampling-sequence-based and sampling-value-based Sampling-sequence-based projection operators include s and s which project a sampling sequence towards the spatial plane, and which project a sampling sequence towards the temporal axle. Th eir signatures are as follows Sampling-value-based projection operators include and which get the sampling values sampling location and the corresponding network position respectively, and which get the sampling values sampling time. Their signatures are as follows The operator returns the th component of a sampling value, and its signature is There are 4 statistical operators as introduced in Table 1 Their signatures are as follows

 In processing this query, the master server first sends the query to the node servers whose service areas intersect the query range  For each related node server, it first executes the data collection query which satisfying the que ry condition. For a certain sampling sequence   computes the sampling value corresponding to time and the output sampling value include s the location, the speed and the direction of the corresponding moving object at time as shown in Figure 5           Figure 5. Network-Based Spatial Aggregation Then, the node server calls th e network-based clustering method which takes traffic network as the clustering center. As illustrated in Figure 5, the sampling values returned from see Table 2\o that they can be matched to the right edges easily. The result of the network-based clustering in Figure 5 contains 4 polylines After the master server receives the feedback from all related node servers, it merges the results and returns the final result to the querying user The detailed processing of network-based spatial aggregation query is described in Algorithm 2 The Euclidean-based parameter aggregation operator can be used to compute the aggregation of a set of raw values, such as average, min, max, and count Lets consider the following example Query  When processing this query, th e master server first sends the query to all the node servers whose service areas intersect with the query range Each related node server first executes the statistical raw data collection query   is the average of the raw data and is the number of raw data, to the master server for merging.

Lets consider th e following example Query  When executing this query, the master server first sends the query to the related node servers whose service areas intersect with the query range Each node server will do the following 1\raw data collection query   here is the traffic parameters of edge and is the number of trajectory pieces in the raw data conc erning this edge, to the master server for merging After the master server receives the feed back from all related node servers, it needs to merge the results, since the same edge can cover more than one service areas         Figure 6. One edge covers multiple service areas As illustrated in Figure 6, the edge 3 covers three service areas, so that three nod e servers will return its traffic parameters. In this case, multiple feedback values should be merged. Different traffic parameters can have different merging methods. For a cert ain edge, suppose that the feedback is   n the average speed, the flux, the number of vehicles, and the traffic jam status can be computed as follows Max    True \(if      True False \(Otherwise   computes the traffic parameter values for each edge based on the raw data, and returns a set of pairs of the form Set string line 5 edgeBasedValueMerge erges the feedback results from the node servers \(line 9

1  2  3  and 4 described in Section 3 Figure 7 shows how the query response time of CSADSD and IOT-StatisticDB changes when the number of node servers increases, with the number of sensors fixed to 220,000 From Figure 7 we can see that, in general, IOTStatisticDB has better performance than CSA-DSD. The main reason is that CSA-DSD ne eds to transfer large volumes of statistical raw data from the database servers to the master server for statistical analysis, which is very time consuming, while in IOT-StatisticDB, only statistical analysis results, whose sizes are very small compared with that of the raw data, need to be transferred from the node servers to the master server Another reason is that in CSA-DSD, the whole statistical analysis task is fulfilled by the master server alone, which forms a bottleneck. Therefore, the performance does not ch ange much when the number of node servers increases. In comparison, IOT-StatisticDB conducts statistical analysis at the node servers in parallel while the master server only needs to merge the statistical results. Therefore, with the number of node servers increases, the performance can be dramatically improved                    Figure 7.

 From Figure 8 we can see that, when data size increases the performance of CSA-DSD decreases rapidly while the performance of IOT-StatisticDB is relatively stable. The main reason is that in CS A-DSD, large volumes of statistical raw data needs to be transferred to and stored at the master server for statistical analysis. Therefore, the query response time is prop ortional to the whole data size On the other hand, in IOT-StatisticDB, the main workload is distributed among the nod e servers, so that the overall performance is less sensitiv e to the overall data size To better analysis how the statistical analysis workload is shared by multiple node servers in IOT-StatisticDB, we define the speedup rate 60 100 140 180 220 2.85 3.05 3.71 3.81 3.73 19.25 21 22.36 22.5 21.85 We can observe from Table 3 that when the number of node servers is 4, the speedup rate is between 2.85~3.81 and when the number of node servers is increased to 32, the speedup rate is between 19.25~22.36. In general, with the number of node servers incr easing, the query response time decreases, since in IOT-StatisticDB, the query response time is main decided by the da ta size of each node server V C ONCLUSIONS  Statistical analysis on sensor sampling data is one of the most important procedures in IoT systems to transform dataŽ into knowledgeŽ.

messages seen for all workers in a superstep \(Figures 10 and 13\. When looking at the messages sent by workers in a superstep for METIS, we see that there are message load imbalances within work ers in a superstep, caused due to concentration of vertices being traversed in that superstep in certain partitions This variability is much more pronounced in CP as compared to WG \(Figures 11 and 14\ E.g. in superstep 9 for CP, twice as many messages \(4M\ are generated by a worker compared to another \(2M\.  For Pregel BSP, the time taken in a superstep is determined by the slowest worker in that superstep. Hence increase d variability in CP causes even goodŽ partitioning strategies to cause an increase in total execution time wh en using the Pregel/BSP model VIII A NALYSIS OF E LASTIC C LOUD S CALING  Cloud environments offer elasticity … the ability to scale-out or scale-in VMs on-demand and only pay for what one uses [28   On th e f l i p s i de  on e en ds u p  paying for VMs that are acquired even if they are underutilized. We have already shown the high variation in compute/memory resources used by algorithms like BC and APSP across different supersteps. While our earlier swath initiation heuristics attempt to flatten these out by overlapping swath executions, one can consider leveraging the clouds elasticity to, instead, scale up and down the concurrent workers \(and graph partitions\ allocated in each superstep The peak and trough nature of resource utilization combined with Pregel/BSPs synchronous barrier between supersteps offers a window for dynamic scaleout and …in at superstep boundaries. Peak supersteps can greatly benefit from additional workers, while those same workers will contribute to added synchronization overhead for trough supersteps We offer an analysis of the potential benefits of elastic scaling by extrapolating from observed results for running BC on WG and CP graphs, using four and eight workers.  To provide a fair and focused comparison, we turned off swath heuristics in favor of fixed swath sizes and initiation intervals Figure 15 \(Bottom\ plots the speedup of BC running on eight workers when normalized to BC running on four workers, at corresponding supersteps.  The number of workers does not impact the number of supersteps We also plot the number of active vertices \(i.e. vertices still computing for a given swath\these supersteps which is a measure of how much work is required \(Fig 15 \(Top\. We find that we occasionally get superlinear speedup spikes \(i.e. >2x\ that shows a strong correlation with the peaks of active messages, for both WG and CP graphs. At other times, the sp eedup is sublinear or even a speed-down \(i.e. <1\responding to inactive vertices.  The superlinear speedup is attributable to the lower contention and reduced memory pressure for 8 workers when the active vertices peak \(similar to what we observed for the swath initiation heuristics Similarly, the below par speedup during periods of low activity is contributed by the increased overhead of barrier synchronization across 8 workers. Intuitively, by dynamically scaling up the number of workers for supersteps with peaking active vertices and scaling them down otherwise, we can leverage the superlinear speedup and get more value per worker Using a threshold of 50% active vertices as the threshold condition for between 4 and 8 workers in a superstep, we extrapolate the time per superstep and compared this to the fixed 4 and 8 worker runtimes. We also compute the best-case run time using an oracleŽ approach to i.e. for each superstep, we pick the minimum of the 4 or 8 workers time.  Note that these projections do not yet consider the overheads of scaling, but are rather used to estimate the potential upside if we had an ideal or an automated heuristic for scaling. The total time estimates for running BC on WG and CP graphs, normalized to  
 plot shows speedup of 8 workers relative to 4 workers, for each superstep, when running BC on WG and CP graphs plot shows the number of vertices active in that superstep Estimated time for BC using elastic scaling, normalized to time taken for 4 workers.

observed time taken using 4 workers, are plotted in Figures 16\(A\ and 16\(B We see that our dynamic scaling heuristic using the percentage of active vertices achieves nearly the same CP\ or better \(WG\ performance as a fixed 8 worker approach. Clearly there is benefit of using fewer workers for low utilization su persteps to eliminate the barrier synchronization overhead. Also, the dynamic scaling heuristic performs almost as well as the ideal scaling. Finally, when we consider the monetary cost of the proposed approaches, assuming a pro-rata normalized cost per VM-second plotted on the secondary Y axis, we see that dynamic scaling is comparable \(CP\ or cheaper \(WG\ than a 4 worker scenario while offering the performance of an 8 worker deployment IX C ONCLUSION  In conclusion, we introduce optimization and heuristics for controlling memory utilization and show they are critical to performance.  By breaking computation into swaths of vertices and using our sizing heuristics we achieve up to 3.5x speedup over the maximum swath size that does not cause the a failure.  In addition overlapping swath executions can provide a 24% gain with automated heuristics and even greater speedup when a priori knowledge of the network characteristics is applied This evaluation offers help to eScience users to make framework selection and cost-performancescalability trade-offs. Our he uristics are generalizable and can be leveraged by other BSP and distributed graph frameworks, and for graph applications beyond BC. Our work uncovered an unexpected impact of partitioning and it would be worthwhile, in future, to examine the ability to pred ict, given certain graph properties, a suitable partitioning model for Pregel/BSP It may also be useful to perform such evaluations on larger graphs and more numbers of VMs. At the same time, it is also worth considering if non-linear graph algorithms are tractable in pr actice for large graphs in a distributed environment B IBLIOGRAPHY  1  F  L i lj er os C   Ed l i n g L  A m a r a l H  S t an ley   and Y    berg The web of human sexual contacts

All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
