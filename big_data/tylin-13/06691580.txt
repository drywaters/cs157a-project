A Selective Checkpointing Mechanism for Query Plans in a Parallel Database System Ting Chen The University of Tokyo Email chenting@eidos.ic.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp Kenjiro Taura The University of Tokyo Email tau@eidos.ic.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp Abstract Most existing parallel database systems achieve fault tolerance by aborting unìnished queries upon a failure and restart the entire from the beginning This is inefìcient for long running queries of OLAP workloads To solve this problem this paper presents a selective checkpointing mechanism which materializes the outputs of some necessary operators enabling to resume queries from middle of the execution upon failures Each query is represented by a DAG of relational operators in which data are typically pipelined between operators The goal of the mechanism is to nd a set of operators whose outputs are worth being checkpointed to minimize the expected runtime of the whole query It rstly provides a cost model to estimate the expected runtime of a whole query plan under a given failure probability for each operator Then a divide-andconquer algorithm is proposed to nd a close-to-optimal solution to the problem The algorithm divides the query plan into subplans with smaller search spaces For a given query plan with n operators the algorithm runs in O  n  time The mechanism is implemented in a shared-nothing parallel database system called ParaLite which provides a coordination layer to glue many SQLite instances together and parallelizes SQL queries across them The experimental results indicate that different fault-tolerant strategies affect the overall runtimes of queries Our selective checkpointing mechanism can choose reasonable operators to be checkpointed and outperforms other faulttolerant strategies In addition the divide-and-conquer algorithm taken by our mechanism has a smaller overhead than brute-force approach while keeping a similar effectiveness I I NTRODUCTION Parallel database systems are high performance computing platforms to provide a high-level programming environment and widely used in analytical data warehouse applications OLAP As data that need to be analyzed continue to grow the size of computing resources grows accordingly Thus the probability of a failure during query processing is increasing rapidly Most existing database systems achieve fault tolerance by aborting unìnished queries upon a failure and restart the entire query processing This approach is reasonable for queries with OLTP workload as almost all transactions must be completed within a small amount of time However for long running queries of OLAP workload it is costly to restart the query from the beginning as lots of work are lost Therefore we should distinguish the fault tolerance of read-only queries in analytical workloads from that of traditional transactional workloads While the basic mechanim for fault tolerance in parallel database systems is a transaction MapReduce and its opensource implementation Hadoop support ne-grained f ault tolerance mechanisms In Hadoop when one node fails or is slow its jobs are rescheduled on another node allowing the entire task to complete without restarting The goal of Hadoop is to make sure that only the jobs running on the very failed node need to be re-executed To accomplish this goal Hadoop stores the output of every map task to the durable storage before the data are available for the reduce tasks On the reducer side each reducer fetches partitions from every map task and writes them to local disks before the operation is performed While this strategy is safe-ìrst it is not always efìcient for small to medium-sized jobs as writing all intermediate data to durable storage before making progress may not be better than re-executing the tasks Similar to workîows a query is described in a database system through a directed graph structure where nodes correspond to the activities relational operator in database such as join aggregate and sort and edges correspond to the data dependencies between nodes To achieve fault tolerance workîow systems often use the combination of two techniques checkpointing and rollback recovery There are tw o common checkpointing schemes in workîow systems based on the granularity level task-level checkpointing which saves intermediate states of running tasks so that in case of failure a task can be re-started from a previously saved intermediate state and workîow-level checkpointing which captures the state of the workîow as a whole The main difference between the execution of a workîow and a database query is that most of workîow systems store and transfer all intermediate data in/via les while database systems generally pipeline intermediate data to obtain better performance Therefore fault tolerance issue in workîow systems is more about the adaptation of the checkpoint frequency for reducing overall execution performance To make an efìcient intra-query fault tolerance for longrunning queries we propose a selective checkpointing mechanism which for a given query plan aims to automatically nd necessary operators whose outputs are worth being checkpointed to minimize the expected runtime of the whole query in a failure-prone environment The mechanism provides a cost model to simulate the execution of the query plan and takes a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem Finally the mechanism is implemented in ParaLite a shared-nothing parallel database system which provides a coordination layer 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data

to connect single-node database systems SQLite and parallelize SQL queries across them In summary the major contributions of our work are as follows  We provide a cost model to estimate the expected runtime of a whole query plan under a given failure probability of each operator The model takes ne-grained parallelism within each operator into consideration It splits each operator into many small logical tasks which is loosely coupled with processors  We propose a divide-and-conquer algorithm to solve the problem The algorithm divides the query plan into subplans with smaller search spaces For a given query plan with n operators the algorithm runs in O  n  time  We develop the mechanism in a shared-nothing parallel database system ParaLite and verify it with several queries from TPC-H The e xperimental results rstly show that different fault-tolerant strategies affect the overall runtimes of queries Then our selective checkpointing can choose reasonable operators to be checkpointed and outperforms other fault-tolerant strategies In addition the divide-and-conquer algorithm taken by our mechanism has a smaller overhead than bruteforce approach while keeping a similar effectiveness The rest of the paper is organized as follows Section II presents related work Section III gives a brief introduction of ParaLite In Section IV we introduce the problem setting and the detail of cost model for a query plan and give the heuristic algorithm for the problem Then Section V evaluates the mechanism and presents the experimental results Finally we draw conclusions in Section VI II R ELATED W ORK Most commercial parallel database systems 10 11 provide fault-tolerance through replication 13 14 As they cannot handle the intra-query fault tolerance if a failure occurs during a long running query the entire query must be restarted from the beginning To efìciently recover a longrunning query from the middle of the execution systems achieving intra-query fault tolerance have been proposed FTOpt pro vides an intra-query f ault tolerant frame w ork which enables the mixing and matching of different faulttolerant techniques in a single pipelined query plan However FTOpt focuses on non-blocking query plans where data are pipelined from one operator to the next producing results incrementally In this case they assume that aggregation operators if any appear only at the top of a plan Besides FTOpt uses a brute-force algorithm to enumerate through the search space to get an optimal combination of faulttolerant strategies For a given query plan with n operators the algorithm runs in 3 n  time Another work Osprey provides the ability to detect and recover from failures or slow nodes in long-running queries It divides queries into subqueries to be executed by PostgreSQL and re-schedules a sub-query which failed or progresses too slowly to a different node based on data replication Similar to MapReduce Osprey adopts the MapReduce-style load balancing strategy of greedy assignment of work to solve the skew problem However Osprey is designed for data-warehouse applications in which tables are arranged in a star schema and it cannot support many other queries such as non-star joins and nested queries On the other hand ParaLite is designed for more general queries In contrast to parallel database systems MapReduce model  3 18 19 20 pro vides ne-grained f ault tolerance by storing all intermediate results to a durable storage before making a further progress As a result map jobs and reduce jobs running on a failed worker are rescheduled on another worker allowing that task to complete without restarting However this naive strategy is not always efìcient especially for short to middle running jobs To improve the performance recent work introduced the ability to partly pipeline data in Hadoop III O VERVIEW OF P ARA L ITE ParaLite is a w orkîo w-oriented shared-nothing parallel database system based on a popular single-node database SQLite The basic idea of P araLite is to pro vide a coordination layer to glue many SQLite instances together and parallelize an SQL query across them The architecture of our system is shown in Figure 1 It uses a classic master/worker pattern to organize resources ParaLite is designed to be a serverless and zero-conìguration system so no process is running before a query is executed ParaLite has multiple clients which present an SQL interface to users and allows a group of queries to be submitted at the same time The basic ow to process a query in ParaLite is as follows A single or a group of query is issued through multiple clients One authorized client starts the master process which then parses the query translates the query into the logical plan DAG which is the key structure to connect each logical component Each node in the logical plan is either a relational operator such as join and aggregate or a sub-query which integrates one or more operators Edges represent data transfers among operators Based on the logical plan the master spawns corresponding operators on worker nodes Then the master schedules each operator to worker nodes by the runtime Each worker process is responsible for receiving data from children operators processing them and distributing the output to the next operator The top root operator returns the nal results to clients All data are sent directly between worker nodes and thus the master is not a bottleneck for any data transfers As the intended applications for ParaLite are workîows typically built out of various independently developed executables ParaLite extends SQL to support seamless integration of arbitrary executable called User-Deìned Executable UDX which can be written in any language Long-running executables in workîow makes intra-query fault tolerance more important UDX is very exible because a user does not need to develop a program respecting to rigid formatting rules such as  key value  input/output format or write code with respect to strict speciìcations of databases 238 


                         Fig 1 Architecture of ParaLite The syntax of UDX is similar to that of the traditional UserDeìned Functions with the main difference being that the function can be given as a command line select col1 F\(col2 as new_col2 from T where predicate1 predicate2  with F  command_line A UDX can work on and produce arbitrary columns To avoid registration to system before the query is executed ParaLite allows users to deìne the UDX within the query using WITH clause It starts from a command line followed by data format options such as input  input row delimiter  output and out row delimiter  IV S ELECTIVE C HECKPOINTING M ECHANISM A Query Model A query is expressed by a DAG query plan of relational operators each of which forwards data tuples to the next For example the query plan of Query 3 of TPC-H benchmark  is sho wn in Figure 2 As P araLite stores data in SQLite database it uses SQL query to access data To take advantage of database technologies of SQLite e.g indexing and query optimization we push as much operations as possible into the query to the underlying SQLite So the leaf nodes of the plan are sub-query operators which read relations using corresponding predicates and produce a row-and-column subset of the relational table Operators J3 and J4 join two relations The output from J3 is then aggregated and sorted Specially some operators can be integrated into a single query if no repartitioning operations are necessary for them For example if relations Customer and Orders are both hash-partitioned across data nodes by the join attribute J4  S6 and S7 can be integrated into a single query Each operator is either a pipeline operator which can process each tuple independently without the knowledge of all tuples or a blocking operator which must receive all tuples before emitting the result e.g an aggregation operator and a sorting operator For hash joins we need to have all tuples from at least one table to build the hash table for it Then we   select L.orderkey sum\(L.extendedprice * \(1 - L.discount O.orderdate, O.shippriority from Customer C, Orders O, LineItem L where C.mktsegment = êAUTOMOBILE and C.custkey = O.custkey and L.orderkey = O.orderkey and O.orderdate < ê1995-10-11 and L.shipdate > ê1995-10-11 group by L.orderkey, O.orderdate, O.shippriority order by revenue DECS, O.orderdate Fig 2 A Logical Plan for TPC-H Query 3 could in principle emit outputs as tuples from the other table are coming To simplify the implementation we consider a join operator as a blocking operator in our work Each operator is split into multiple logical tasks and assigned to a set of processors The number of tasks is determined by the number of partitions for the input tuples of the operator and is usually much larger than the number of assigned processors If an operatorês successor is a pipeline operator it forwards the output tuples of each task to the its successor as soon as the task is nished The target processor is chosen based on its processing capacity in terms of estimated runtime For an operator whose successor is a blocking operator it holds all output data on memory until it reaches a threshold at which point it writes them into an intermediate le Tasks of a blocking operator is scheduled to processors using a greedy algorithm to balance the load across all processors Once a processor becomes idle a task is allocated to the processor Next letês consider the checkpointing strategy used in query plans If all data are pipelined from one operator to the next once a job fails all operators must be re-executed because all intermediate data would be lost To avoid re-execution from the beginning a common strategy is checkpointing and rollback recovery approach which periodically records the state of operators to a durable storage To ensure the right recovery from a failure an operator is required to save sufìcient information to replay its state such as join hash tables and partial aggregation results Once failures occur the operator restarts from the last state checkpoint In our work we take a simpler checkpointing method which does not save internal states of an operator but only save the output of an operator in a durable storage This checkpointing method works because the execution of each operator can be divided into many independent tasks and only recovering failed tasks can reduce the work to be lost The output tuples for each operator are split or hash partitioned into n parts according to its successor operator Accordingly the processing of the successor is split into n logical tasks each of which works on the corresponding part of data The tasks are then scheduled to a speciìc number of processors which is usually much smaller than the number of tasks performing the calculation such as join and aggregation For long-running operator i  a checkpointing should be made for i  that is the output tuples of each task are materialized to the disk Once 239 


a failure occurs saying a process for i fails only the failed task which is running exactly when the failure occurs need to be re-executed As a result the recovery overhead of the failed operator is very limited as each task usually runs in a small time With checkpointing strategy the places to insert checkpointing heavily affect the overall execution performance On one hand not making a necessary checkpoint may lead to a loss of important computation degrading the overall execution performance A checkpointed operator speeds up the recovery for its successor operator as reproducing the output tuples is simply re-reading materialized data For example for a query plan A  B  C  D with only A checkpointed if D fails operator B  C and D have to be re-executed while A does not So only checkpointing A leads to too much lost work when a failure occurs On the other hand making an unnecessary checkpoint leads to an increase in the checkpointing overhead We also take the above query plan as an example If the operator C is light on CPU but emits lots of tuples it is unlikely to be worth being checkpointed An extreme case is that the checkpointing time is wasted if no failure occurs B Problem Setting Assume that the logical plan of a query is G  V,E  where V is a set of operators V  v 1 v 2   v n and E is the set of edges or dependencies between operators E   v i v j   v i v j  V  When the query is executed without any failure the expected runtime of the query T total is calculated as a function of the operator and edge sets T total  F  V E  1 In a failure-prone environment we assume that each operator is executed with a probability of failure P  p 1 p 2   p n If an operator v i is failed all of its children are required to be reexecuted to replay the input for v i if they are not checkpointed Otherwise the checkpointed operators can simply replay its output by reading them from a durable storage The problem is that what operators should be checkpointed Not making a necessary checkpoint may lead to a loss of important computation affecting the overall execution performance while making an unnecessary checkpoint leads to an increase in the checkpointing overhead as well Letês denote another variable CK  ck 1 ck 2   ck n  to mark if a checkpoint is necessary or not for each operator In the case of failure the expected runtime of the query is calculated by the following equation T total  F  V E CK P  2 Therefore the problem is equivalent to get the a set of checkpoints to minimize the expected runtime CK opt  argmin CK F\(V E CK P 3 C Cost Model In this section we explain how we model the cost of an execution plan of a query and propose the problem for the selective checkpointing Processing Cost For operator i  the processing cost T P i is the delay introduced by the operator T P i is the sum of execution time for its input tuples and the communication time for its output tuples as shown in Equation 4 T P i  T EXE i  T SEND i 4 T EXE i  the cost for executing input tuples of operator i  T SEND i  the cost of sending output data to the successor for operator i  To estimate T P i  we assume the following two functions are known for each operator i  f i  N in  tuple i   this function provides the number of output tuples produced for a given number of input tuples N in tuple i of operator i  N out tuple i  f i  N in tuple i  5 g i  N in tuple i   this function provides the time to produce all output tuples for a given number of input tuples N in tuple i of operator i  T EXE i  g i  N in tuple i  6 In practice such infomation could come from proìling and statistics or could be supplied by user Speciìcally the function f i is simply given with respect to the selectivity for each operator while g i is more complicated estimated The function g i models the processing for each tuple e.g for an operator only with a sorting algorithm the g i  n  is of the form n  log  n   We ignore other xed auxiliary cost for operators such as initiating and terminating the operation If the output tuples of the operator i is divided into N task tasks with hash function h  key  i 1  i  N task  the partitioning cost is added to T EXE i  The cost for sending N out tuple i tuples depends on the number of the successor operator For the blocking successor operator such as group operator the output tuples are required to be re-partitioned on the group key and transferred to all successor processors For other operators the output tuples are transferred to only one or a few processors Checkpointing Cost We set a checkpoint value CK i for operator i  CK i   0 if a checkpoint for i is not necessary 1 otherwise For operator i  the checkpointing cost T C i represents the cost to write the output tuples of i to disk T C i  CK i  T I/O  N out tuple i 7 T I/O  the time taken to write/read a tuple from/to disk Recovery Cost For operator i  the recovery cost T R i depends on the checkpointing values of both i and its predecessors The recovery time of an operator i contains two parts as equation 8 shows T  R i which is the cost for getting the input tuples again and T  R i which is the cost for the reexecution of the operator i itself For the former assuming that the operator i fails its input tuples are required to be reproduced that is all of its 240 


predecessor operators need to reproduce their output tuples Thus the recovery time for the operator i is determined by the predecessor who takes longer time to reproduce its output tuples as equation 9 shows For each of its predecessors j  the cost for reproducing the output tuples of j is reading data from disk if j is checkpointed  CK j 1  Otherwise if j is not checkpointed  CK j 0  j must be re-executed T R i  T  R i  T  R i 8 T  R i  max j  PRED i  T P j  T  R j   1  CK j  T C j  9 For the second part of the recovery cost T  R i  if the successor of operator i is a blocking operator i keeps the output tuples of received tasks until all tasks are nished As a result all tasks are re-executed if this operator is not checkpointed If the operator is checkpointed only the failed task which is running at the time the operator fails needs to be re-executed If the successor of operator i is a pipeline operator the output of a task is sent to its successor quickly So still only the failed task needs to be re-executed Objective Function Assuming that inìnite resources are used the expected runtime of an operator i is the sum of the processing cost of the operator T P i Eq 4 the expected runtime of its children the recovery cost T R i Eq 8 and the checkpoint cost T C i Eq 7 T i  T P i  max j  PRED i  T j  p i  T R i  T C i 10 PRED i  the set of predecessor operators of i p i  the probability of a failure for operator i  Obviously the expected runtime of a query plan T total is estimated by the following equation according to equation 2 where operator 0 represents the root of the query plan T total  F  V E CK P  T 0  T P 0  max j  PRED 0  T j  p 0  T R 0  T C 0 11 The objective is to nd the optimal checkpointing value for each operator to minimize the expected runtime of a given plan CK opt  argmin CK T total 12 D Heuristic Algorithm The straightforward approach to the problem is to generate all solutions in the full search space and get an optimal one However if the size of the query plan saying that the number of operator is n  is large this approach is not practical as the search space S G is 2 n  So we propose a heuristic algorithm using divide-and-conquer approach to reduce the search space Although the algorithm cannot produce the global optimal solution its efìciency is veriìed by the experiments   xy  CK x     y x 1 x 2 CK x2  CK x1  a simple plan b Fig 3 Example of Simple and Complex plan 1 Reduction of Checkpointing Candidates First of all we use a simple inequality to lter the operators which should not be checkpointed Letês rstly consider a simple sub-plan in which each operator has at most one upstream operator as Figure 3 shows Assume that a failure occurs at the operator y  the runtime of y depends on whether operator x is checkpointed  CK x 1  or not  CK x 0  When x is not checkpointed the recovery starts from the beginning and the runtime of y should be T total y  CK x 0  2  T total x  T  R y 13 With the checkpoint the recovery of y starts from read tuples from disk and the runtime of y with consideration of a checkpoint is T total y  CK x 1   T total x 2  t x  T  R y 14 t x is the I/O cost for reading/writing the output of x from/to the disk For n tuples the I/O cost is estimated as t x  T I/O  n  To get beneìt from making a checkpoint with a failure the runtime of y with a checkpoint should be smaller than that without a checkpoint T total y  CK x 1  T total y  CK x 0   2  t x T total x 15 Inequality 15 intuitively shows that the process of a query plan can gain from a checkpoint of operator i only if the checkpointing cost writing and reading the output of i is smaller than its execution time This observation generates the opportunities to reduce whole search space by setting CK i  0 if i does not satisfy the inequality Next letês consider a more complex sub-plan as the right side of Figure 3 shows Operator y has two predecessors x 1 and x 2 which are executed in parallel We take the following algorithm to decide the checkpoint values for x 1 and x 2  Sibling Checkpointing Algorithm rstly decides the checkpointing value for the operator with larger execution time denoted by i  according to the single Checkpointing function The checkpointing value of the operator with smaller execution time denoted by j  is decided by i s checkpointing value If i is not worth being checkpointed the algorithm thinks it is better for not checkpointing j because the recovery time for their parent is determined by the execution time of i  When i is checkpointed j is also checkpointed if the overall cost of the processing and checkpointing for j is smaller than that of 241

shown in Figure 11 The X-axis is the percentage of the normal completion time of Query 5 when a failure is injected Firstly it is not surprised that ParaLite is about twice faster than Hive One reason for the superiority is that not all the operators are checkpointed in ParaLite Moreover Hive uses sort-join while ParaLite uses hash-join In addition the start-up overhead for Hadoop cannot be ignored Hive uses 3 MapReduce jobs to express the query and each takes 10 15 seconds before all map tasks are started Secondly the slowdown for both system are similar However the slowdonw of Hadoop is limited to the interval of heartbeat message send to the JobTracker\(master from each TaskTracker\(worker After a x time we set it 30 seconds from receiving the last heartbeat if the master does not receive a new heartbeat message it sets the status of the worker failed and re-schedules the failed tasks So for a light-weight job whose execution time is not much larger than the interval the slowdown becomes larger because it needs to wait for the task re-execution On the other hand ParaLite detects the failure immediately after a process fails and then starts the recovery D Scalability To evaluate the scalability of ParaLite we perform TPCH Query 3 on 10 20 and 30 nodes with the s cale factor 100 200 and 300 respectively As Figure 12 shows ParaLite scales well with the increase of nodes The selective checkpointing mechanism adapts to clusters with different number of nodes                   0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 10 20 30 Execution Time\(s of nodes Fig 12 The scalability of TPC-H Query 2 VI C ONCLUSION To efìciently support intra-query fault tolerance for longrunning queries we propose a selective checkpointing mechanism which automatically chooses necessary operators whose output data are worth being checkpointed to minimize the expected runtime of the query in a failure-prone environment The mechanism provides a cost model to simulate the execution of the query plan and takes a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem The mechanism is implemented in a share-nothing parallel database ParaLite and evaluated with several TPC-H queries The experimental results rstly show that different fault-tolerant strategies affect the overall runtimes of queries Our selective checkpointing can choose reasonable operators to be checkpointed and outperforms other fault-tolerant strategies In addition the divide-and-conquer algorithm taken by our mechanism has a smaller overhead than brute-force approach while keeping a

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
