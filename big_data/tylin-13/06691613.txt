of a database which often leads to performance issues In this paper we introduce CR-OLAP a C loud based R eal-time OLAP system based on a new distributed index structure for OLAP the distributed PDCR tree  that utilizes a cloud infrastructure consisting of  m 1  multi-core processors With increasing database size CR-OLAP dynamically increases m to maintain performance Our distributed PDCR tree data structure supports multiple dimension hierarchies and efìcient query processing on the elaborate dimension hierarchies which are so central to OLAP systems It is particularly efìcient for complex OLAP queries that need to aggregate large portions of the data warehouse such as report the total sales in all stores located in California and New York during the months February-May of all years 
We evaluated CR-OLAP on the Amazon EC2 cloud using the TPC-DS benchmark data set The tests demonstrate that CROLAP scales well with increasing number of processors even for complex queries For example on an Amazon EC2 cloud instance with eight processors for a TPC-DS OLAP query stream on a data warehouse with 80 million tuples where every OLAP query aggregates more than 50 of the database CR-OLAP achieved a query latency of 0.3 seconds which can be considered a real time response I I NTRODUCTION On-line analytical processing OLAP systems are at the heart of many business analytics applications This paper reports on the results of a research project supported by the IBM Centre For Advanced Studies Canada to investigate the 
use of cloud computing for high performance real-time OLAP By exploiting multi-dimensional views of the underlying data warehouse OLAP queries allows users to drill down or roll up on dimension hierarchies slice and dice particular attributes or perform various statistical operations such as ranking and forecasting In contrast to queries for on-line transaction processing OLTP systems which typically access only a small portion of the database e.g update a customer record OLAP queries may need to aggregate large portions of the database e.g calculate the total sales of a certain type of items during a certain time period which may lead to performance issues Therefore most of the traditional OLAP research and most of the commercial systems follow the static data cube approach proposed by Gray et al and materialize all or a subset of the cuboids of the data cube 
in order to ensure adequate query performance However the traditional static data cube approach has several disadvantages The OLAP system can only be updated periodically and in batches e.g once every week Hence latest information can not be included in the decision support process The static data cube also requires massive amounts of memory space and leads to a duplicate data repository that is separate from the on-line transaction processing OLTP system of the organization Practitioners have therefore called for some time for an integrated OLAP/OLTP approach with a real-time OLAP system that gets updated instantaneously as new data arrives and always provides an up-to-date data warehouse for the decision support process e.g Some recent publications have begun to address this problem by providing quasi real-time incremental maintenance schemes and loading procedures for static data cubes e.g 3 
 5 Ho we v e r  these approaches are not fully real-time A major obstacle are signiìcant performance issues with large scale data warehouses The aim of our research project is to help address the above mentioned performance issues for real-time OLAP systems through the use of efìcient parallel computing methods In a recent paper we presented the rst parallel real-time OLAP system designed to be executed on a multi-core processor We documented signiìcant performance increases with increasing number of processor cores Our system won the 2012 IBM Canada Research Impact Of The Year Award and an IBM sponsored patent application has been submitted In this paper we report on the next phase of our project to scale up our realtime OLAP system to utilize a collection of  
m 1 multi-core processors in a cloud environment We introduce CR-OLAP  a C loud based R eal-time OLAP system that utilizes a new distributed index structure for OLAP refered to as a distributed PDCR tree  CR-OLAP is designed for a cloud infrastructure consisting of m 1 multi-core processors where each processor executes up to k parallel threads With increasing database size CR-OLAP will increase m by dynamically allocating additional processors within the cloud environment and rearranging the distributed PDCR tree This will ensure that both the available memory and processing capability will scale with the database size In order to ensure high throughput and low latency even for compute intensive OLAP queries that 
may need to aggregate large portions of the entire database CR-OLAP utilizes several levels of parallelism distributed processing of multiple query and insert operations among multiple processors and parallel processing of multiple concurrent query and insert operations within each processor For correct query operation CR-OLAP ensures that the result for each OLAP query includes all data inserted prior but no data inserted after the query was issued within the input stream We evaluated CR-OLAP on the Amazon EC2 cloud for 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 499 


a multitude of scenarios different ratios of insert and query transactions query transactions with different sizes of results different system loads etc using the TPC-DS Decision Support benchmark data set The tests demonstrate that CROLAP scales well with increasing number of workers For example for xed data warehouse size  10,000,000 data items when increasing the number of workers from 1 to 8 the average query throughput and latency improves by a factor 7.5 A particular strength of CR-OLAP is to efìciently answer queries with large query coverage  i.e the portion of the database that needs to be aggregated for an OLAP query For example on an Amazon EC2 cloud instance with eight workers and a stream of OLAP queries on a data warehouse with 80 million tuples where each query has more than 50 coverage CR-OLAP achieved a query latency of 0.3 seconds which can be considered a real time response CR-OLAP also handles well increasing dimensionality of the data warehouse For tree data structures this is a critical issue as it is known e.g for R-trees that with increasing number of dimensions even simple range search no dimension hierarchies no aggregation can degenerate to linear search e.g In our experiments we observed that increasing number of dimensions does not signiìcantly impact the performance of CROLAP  Another possible disadvantage of tree data structures is that they are potentially less cache efìcient than in-memory linear search which can make optimum use of streaming data between memory and processor caches To establish a comparison baseline for CR-OLAP  we implemented STREAMOLAP which partitions the database between multiple cloud processors based on one chosen dimension and uses parallel memory to cache streaming on the cloud processors to answer OLAP queries We observed that the performance of CR-OLAP is similar to STREAM-OLAP for simple OLAP queries with small query coverage but that CR-OLAP vastly outperforms STREAM-OLAP for more complex queries that utilize different dimension hierarchies and have a larger query coverage e.g report the total sales in all stores located in California and New York during the months February-May of all years The remainder of this paper is organized as follows In Section II we review related work In Section III we introduce the PDCR tree data structure and in Section IV we present our CR-OLAP system for real-time OLAP on cloud architectures Section V shows the results of an experimental evaluation of CR-OLAP on the Amazon EC2 cloud and Section VI concludes the paper II R ELATED W ORK In addition to the related work discussed in the introduction there are many efforts to store and query large data sets in cloud environments and its le system HDFS are popular examples of such systems which are typically built on MapReduce Related projects most similar to our w ork are Hiv and HadoopDB[11 Ho we v e r  these systems are not designed for real-time OLTP style operation Instead they use batch processing similar to 3 4 5 The situation is similar for BigT BigQuery[13 and Dremel[14 In fact uses a columnar data representation scheme and is designed to provide data warehousing and querying support for read-only data To overcome the batch processing in Hadoop based systems Storm introduced a distributed computing model that processes in-îight Twitter data However Storm assumes small compact Twitter style data packets that can quickly migrate between different computing resources This is not possible for large data warehouses For peer-to-peer networks related work includes distributed methods for querying concept hierarchies such as 17  19 Ho we v e r  none of these methods pro vides realtime OLAP functionality There are various publications on distributed B-trees for cloud platforms such as Ho we v e r  these method only supports 1-dimensional indices which are insufìcient for OLAP queries There have been efforts to build distributed multi-dimensional indices on Cloud platforms based on R-trees or related multi-dimensional tree structures such as 22 23 Ho we v e r  these method do not support dimension hierarchies which are essential for OLAP queries III PDCR T REES Consider a data warehouse with the fact table F and a set of d dimensions  D 1 D 2   D d  where each dimension D i  1  i  d has a hierarchy H i including hierarchical attributes corresponding to the levels of the hierarchy The hierarchical attributes in the hierarchy of dimension i are organized as an ordered set H i of parent-child relationships in the hierarchy levels H i   H i 1 H i 2   H il  where a parent logically summarizes and includes its children The sequential DC tree introduced by Kriegel et al exploits knowledge about the structure of individual dimension hierarchies both for compact data representation and accelerated OLAP query processing In our previous work  we introduced the PDC tree a parallel DC tree for a single multi-core processor We note that our PDCR tree data structure is not just another distributed R-tree but rather a multi-dimensional data structure designed speciìcally to support efìcient OLAP query processing on the elaborate dimension hierarchies that are central to OLAP systems We now outline a modiìed PDC tree termed PDCR tree which will become the building block for our CR-OLAP system For a cloud architecture with multiple processors each processor will store one or more PDCR trees Our CR-OLAP system outlined in the following Section IV requires that a sub-tree of a PDCR tree can be split off and transferred to another processor This required us to a devise an array based tree implementation that can be packed into a message to be sent between processors and b a careful encoding of data values using compact IDs related to the different dimension hierarchy levels Due to space limitations we refer to the full version of this paper for more details IV CR-OLAP C LOUD BASED R EAL TIME OLAP CR-OLAP utilizes a cloud infrastructure consisting of m 1 multi-core processors where each processor executes up to k parallel threads One of the m 1 multi-core processors is referred to as the master  and the remaining m processors are called workers  The master receives from the users the input stream of OLAP insert and query operations and reports the results back to the users in the form of references to memory locations where the workers have deposited the query results In order to ensure high throughput and low latency even for compute intensive OLAP queries that may need to aggregate large portions of the entire database CR-OLAP utilizes several levels of parallelism distributed processing of multiple query and insert operations among multiple workers 500

processors within the cloud environment and re\255 arranging the distributed PDCR tree This will ensure that both the available memory and processing capability will scale with the database size We start by outlining the structure of a on 1 multi-core processors in a cloud environment Consider a single PDCR tree we refer to the top as the is referred to as the and that each worker stores one or more subtrees As insert operations are sent to the size and height of the are shown as horizontal links in Figures 1 and 2 With the PDCR tree being a collection of subtrees if we were to maintain sibling links between subtrees to build linked list of siblings across all subtrees then levels of starts with an empty database and one master processor i.e m m  0 storing an empty into T h h threads In our previous work  we presented a method to ensure correct query processing for a single PDC tree on a mutli core processor where multiple new neu hat CR-OLAP CR-OLAP and we refer to the remaining trees rooted at the leaves of the as the    at each directory node the query can generate multiple parallel threads depend\255 ing on how many child nodes have a non empty intersection with the query Eventually each query will access a subset of the s leaves and then the query will be transferred to the workers storing the subtrees rooted at those leaves Each of those workers will then in parallel execute the query on the respective subtrees possibly generating more parallel threads within each subtree For each and split the above mentioned insert insert insert insert insert A and parallel processing of multiple concurrent query and insert operations within each worker With increasing database size storing the entire database For a tunable parameter 81 Level The 81 PDC trees 6 and PDCR

operation in the input stream the master will search the and 2 illustrate how plus a new parent node Capacity overflow at then triggers a vertical split illustrated in 2 This creates two subtrees in two different workers As outlined in more details in the mi\255 gration strategies outlined below new workers are requested from the cloud environment when either new subtrees are created or when subtree sizes exceed the memory of their host 501 workers Workers usually store multiple subtrees However randomly shuffles subtrees among workers This ensures that create a distributed workload among workers Fig 1 Insertions triggering creation of processing of an input stream of mixed and operations needs to ensure that the result for each OLAP query includes all data inserted prior but no data inserted after the query was issued within the input stream We will now discuss how this is achieved in a distributed cloud based system where we have a collection of subtrees in different workers each of which is processing multiple concurrent and and operations are processed concurrently The PDC tree maintains for each data or directory item a time stamp indicating its most recent update plus it maintains for all nodes of the same height a left-to-right linked list of all siblings Furthermore each thread maintains a stack of ancestors of the current node under consideration together with the time stamps of those items We refer to  for more details The PDCR tree presented in this paper inherits this mechanism for each of its subtrees In fact distributed PDC tree and PDCR tree CR-OLAP that hat 


we would ensure correct query operation in the same way as for the PDC tree Ho we v e r  since dif ferent subtrees of a PDCR tree typically reside on different workers a PDCR tree only maintains sibling links inside subtrees but it does not maintain sibling links between different subtrees The full proof that correct real time processing of mixed insert and query operations is still maintained can be found in omitted here due to space limitations Load balancing CR-OLAP is executed on a cloud platform with  m 1 processors  m workers and one master As discussed earlier CR-OLAP uses the cloudês elasticity to increase m as the number of data items increases We now discuss in more detail CR-OLAP s mechanisms for worker allocation and load balancing in the cloud The insert operations discussed above create independent subtrees for each height h leaf of the hat  Since internal directory nodes have a high degree typically 10 20 a relatively small height of the hat typically leads to thousands of height h leaves and associated subtrees s 1 s n  The master processor keeps track of the subtree locations and allocation of new workers and it makes sure that a relatively high n/m ratio is maintained As indicated above CR-OLAP shufîes these n>>m subtrees among the m workers This ensures that threads of query operations are evenly distributed over the workers Furthermore CR-OLAP performs load balancing among the workers to ensure both balanced workload and memory utilization The master processor keeps track of the current sizes and number of active threads for all subtrees For each worker its memory utilization and workload are the total number of threads of its subtrees and the total size if its subtrees respectively If a worker w has a memory utilization above a certain threshold e.g 75 of its total memory then the master processor determines the worker w  with the lowest memory utilization and checks whether it is possible to store an additional subtree from w while staying well below itês memory threshold e.g 50 of its total memory If that is not possible a new worker w  is allocated within the cloud environment Then a subtree from w is compressed and sent from w to w  via message passing As discussed earlier PDCR trees are implemented in array format and using only array indices as pointers This enables fast compression and decompression of subtrees and greatly facilitates subtree migration between workers Similarly if a worker w has a workload utilization that is a certain percentage above the average workload of the m workers and is close to the maximum workload threshold for a single worker then the master processor determines a worker w  with the lowest workload and well below its maximum workload threshold If that is not possible a new worker w  is allocated within the cloud environment Then the master processor initiates the migration of one or more subtrees from w and possibly other workers to w   V E XPERIMENTAL E VALUATION O N A MAZON EC2 Software CR-OLAP was implemented in C using the g compiler OpenMP for multi-threading and ZeroMQ for message passing between processors Instead of the usual MPI message passing library we chose ZeroMQ because it better supports cloud elasticity and the addition of new processors during runtime CR-OLAP has various tunable parameters For our experiments we set the depth h of the hat to h 3  the directory node capacity c to c 10 for the hat and c 15 for the subtrees and the number k of threads per worker to k 16  Hardware/OS CR-OLAP was executed on the Amazon EC2 cloud For the master processor we used an Amazon EC2 m2.4xlarge instance High-Memory Quadruple Extra Large with 8 virtual cores 64-bit architecture 3.25 ECUs per core rated at 26 compute units and with 68.4 GiB memory For the worker processors we used Amazon EC2 m3.2xlarge instances M3 Double Extra Large with 8 virtual cores 64-bit architecture 3.25 ECUs per core rated at 26 compute units and with 30 GiB memory The OS image used was the standard Amazon CentOS Linux AMI Comparison baseline STREAM-OLAP As outlined in Section II there is no comparison system for CR-OLAP that provides cloud based OLAP with full real time capability and support for dimension hierarchies To establish a comparison baseline for CR-OLAP  we therefore designed and implemented a STREAM-OLAP method which partitions the database between multiple cloud processors based on one chosen dimension and uses parallel memory to cache streaming on the cloud processors to answer OLAP queries More precisely STREAM-OLAP builds a 1-dimensional index on one ordered dimension d stream and partitions the data into approx 100  m arrays The arrays are randomly shufîed between the m workers The master processor maintains the 1-dimensional index Each array represents a segment of the d stream dimension and is accessed via the 1-dimensional index The arrays themselves are unsorted and insert operations simply append the new item to the respective array For query operations the master determines via the 1-dimensional index which arrays are relevant The workers then search those arrays via linear search using memory to cache streaming The comparison between CR-OLAP using PDCR trees and STREAM-OLAP using a 1-dimensional index and memory to cache streaming is designed to examine the tradeoff between a sophisticated data structure which needs fewer data accesses but is less cache efìcient and a brute force method which accesses much more data but optimizes cache performance Test data For our experimental evaluation of CR-OLAP and STREAM-OLAP we used the standard TPC-DS Decision Support benchmark for OLAP systems W e selected Store Sales the largest fact table available in TPC-DS It has eight dimensions Store  Item  Address  and Promotion are unordered dimensions while dimensions Customer  Date  Household and Time are ordered TPC-DS provides a stream of insert and query operations on Store Sales which was used as input for CR-OLAP and STREAM-OLAP  For experiments where we were interested in the impact of query coverage the portion of the database that needs to be aggregated for an 502 


OLAP query we selected sub-sequences of TPC-DS queries with the chosen coverages Test results impact of the number of workers  m  for xed database size  N  We tested how the time of insert and query operations for CR-OLAP and STREAM-OLAP changes for xed database size  N  as we increase the number of workers  m  Using a variable number of workers 1  m  8  we rst inserted 40 million items with d 8 dimensions from the TPC-DS benchmark into CR-OLAP and STREAM-OLAP  and then we executed 1,000  insert or query  operations on CR-OLAP and STREAM-OLAP  Since workers are virtual processors in the Amazon EC2 cloud there is always some performance uctuation because of the virtualization We found that the total or average of 1,000 insert or query operations is a sufìciently stable measure The results of our experiments are shown in Figures 3 4 and 5 Figure 3 shows the time for 1,000 insertions in CROLAP PDCR-tree and STREAM-OLAP 1D-index as a function of the number of workers  m  As expected insertion times in STREAM-OLAP are lower than in CR-OLAP because STREAM-OLAP simply appends the new item in the respective array while CR-OLAP has to perform tree insertions with possible directory node splits and other overheads However STREAM-OLAP shows no speedup with increasing number of workers because only one worker performs the array append operation whereas CR-OLAP shows a signiìcant speedup because the distributed PDCR tree makes use of the multiple workers It is important to note that insertion times are not visible to the users because they do not create any user response What is important to the user are the response times for OLAP queries Figure 4 shows the time for 1,000 OLAP queries in CR-OLAP and STREAM-OLAP as a function of the number of workers  m  Figure 5 shows the speedup measured for the same data We selected OLAP queries with 10 60 and 95 query coverage  which refers to the percentage of the entire range of values for each dimension that is covered by a given OLAP query The selected OLAP queries therefore aggregate a small medium and large portion of the database resulting in very different workloads We observe in Figure 4 that CR-OLAP signiìcantly outperforms STREAM-OLAP with respect to query time The difference in performance is particularly pronounced for queries with small or large coverages For the former the tree data structure shows close to logarithmic performance and for the latter the tree can compose the result by adding the aggregate values stored at a few roots of large subtrees The worst case scenario for CROLAP are queries with medium coverage around 60 where the tree performance is proportional to N 1  1  d  However even in this worst case scenario CR-OLAP outperforms STREAMOLAP  Figure 5 indicates that both systems show a close to linear speedup with increasing number of workers however for CR-OLAP that speedup occurs for much smaller absolute query times Test results impact of growing system size  N  m combined In an elastic cloud environment CR-OLAP and STREAMOLAP increase the number of workers  m  as the database size  N  increases The impact on the performance of insert and query operations is shown in Figures 6 and 7 respectively With growing system size the time for insert operations in CR-OLAP PDCR-tree approaches the time for STREAMOLAP 1D-index More importantly however the time for query operations in CR-OLAP again outperforms the time for STREAM-OLAP by a signiìcant margin as shown in Figure 7 Also it is very interesting that the for both systems the query performance remains essentially unchanged with increasing database size and number of workers This is obvious for STREAM-OLAP where the size of arrays to be searched simply remains constant but it is an important observation for CR-OLAP  Figure 7 indicates that the overhead incurred by CR-OLAP s load balancing mechanism which grows with increasing m  is balanced out by the performance gained through more parallelism CR-OLAP appears to scale up without affecting the performance of individual queries Test results impact of the number of dimensions It is well known that tree based search methods can become problematic when the number of dimensions in the database increases In Figures 8 and 9 we show the impact of increasing d on the performance of insert and query operations in CROLAP PDCR-tree and STREAM-OLAP 1D-index for xed database size N 40 million and m 8 workers Figure 8 shows some increase in insert time for CR-OLAP because the PDCR tree insertion inherits from the PDC tree a directory node split operation with an optimization phase that is highly sensitive to the number of dimensions However the result of the tree optimization is improved query performance in higher dimensions As shown in Figure 9 the more important time for OLAP query operations grows only slowly as the number of dimensions increases This is obvious for the array search in STREAM-OLAP but for the tree search in CR-OLAP this is an important observation Test results impact of query coverages Figures 10 11 12 and 13 show the impact of query coverage on query performance in CR-OLAP PDCR-tree and STREAM-OLAP 1D-inde x For xed database size N  40 Mil  number of workers m 8  and number of dimensions d 8  we vary the query coverage and observe the query times In addition we observe the impact of a  in one of the query dimensions Figures 10 and 11 show that the  values do not have a signiìcant impact for CR-OLAP  As discussed earlier CR-OLAP is most efìcient for small and very large query coverage with maximum query time somewhere in the mid range In this case the maximum point is shifted away from the typical 60 because of the  values Figures 12 and 13 show the performance of STREAM-OLAP as compared to CR-OLAP ratio of query times It shows that CR-OLAP consistently outperforms STREAM-OLAP by a factor between 5 and 20 Test results query time comparison for selected query patterns at different hierarchy levels Figure 14 shows a query time comparison between CROLAP PDCR-tree and STREAM-OLAP 1D-index for selected query patterns For xed database size N 40 Mil  number of workers m 8 and d 8 dimensions we test for dimension Date the impact of value  for different hierarchy levels CR-OLAP is designed for OLAP queries such as  total sales in the stores located in California and New York during 503 


February-May of all years  which act at different levels of multiple dimension hierarchies For this test we created 7 combinations of  and set values for hierarchy levels Year  Month  and Day   year year-month year-monthday month month-day and day We then selected for each combination queries with coverages 10  60  and 95  The test results are summarized in Figure 14 The main observation is that CR-OLAP consistently outperforms STREAM-OLAP even for complex and very broad queries that one would expect could be easier solved through data streaming than through tree search VI C ONCLUSION We introduced CR-OLAP a C loud based R eal-time OLAP system based on a distributed PDCR tree  a new parallel and distributed index structure for OLAP and evaluated CR-OLAP on the Amazon EC2 cloud for a multitude of scenarios The tests demonstrate that CR-OLAP scales well with increasing database size and increasing number of cloud processors CROLAP has the potential to enable OLAP systems with real-time OLAP query processing for large databases A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to acknowledge nancial support from the IBM Centre for Advanced Studies Canada and the Natural Science and
