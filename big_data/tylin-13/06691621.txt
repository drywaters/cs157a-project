barbara.furletti,lorenzo.gabrielli,chiara.renso,salvatore.rinzivillo  isti.cnr.it Abstract This information about our GSM calls is stored by the TelCo operator in large volumes and with strict privacy constraints making it challenging the analysis of these ngerprints for inferring mobility behavior This paper proposes a strategy for mobility behavior identiìcation based on aggregated calling proìles of mobile phone users This compact representation of the user call proìles is the input of the mining algorithm for automatically classifying various kinds of mobility behavior A further advantage of having deìned the call proìles is that the analysis phase is based on summarized privacy-preserving representation of the original data We show how these call proìles permit to design a two step process implemented into a system based on a bootstrap phase and a running phase for classifying users into behavior categories We evaluated the system in two case studies where individuals are classiìed into residents  commuters and visitors  We conclude the paper with a discussion which emphasizes the role of the call proìles for the design of a new collaboration model between data provider and data analyst I I NTRODUCTION The cellular phones based on the GSM protocol are probably the most popular devices we carry almost everywhere during our life Since GSM is based on the communication to an antenna covering a local area the active connection e.g a call to a certain antenna represents a spatio-temporal position information for the user This information as collected by the telecom provider thus provides a spatio-temporal ngerprint of the users moving in a GSM covered area For example a user calling only in the weekdays and during the working hours in a given area can be considered as a commuter since we observe his presence in the monitored area only during working temporal slots The observation above raises three considerations the rst one is that GSM data embeds a great deal of information about the user habits and behavior the second one is that GSM data when collected from the provider side comes in large volume thus posing new challenges not only from the collection and storage point of view but also from the analysis and mining side thirdly the analysis of this large volume of personal data poses several privacy issues This paper is a proposal for facing these three issues with an approach for mining large volumes of GSM call data with the purpose of identifying the user behavior from his/her call habits An important aspect of our method is that we propose a strategy for behavior identiìcation based on the calling proìles of phone users These call proìles represent an aggregate pre-processed data on which to run mining algorithm for discovering various kinds of user behavior The advantage of having deìned the call proìles is that the analysis phase is no more based on the original GSM raw big and privacy sensitive data but on an aggregated privacypreserving summary of the original data We show how these call proìles permit to design a two step process based on a bootstrap phase and a running phase for classifying users into behavior categories based on their call habits More in detail we present a user behavior inference system where an improved inductive learning phase and automatic classiìcation replaces the two-phase learning steps adopted in Furthermore the structure of the analysis process into a bootstrap and a running phase leads to another interesting result the call proìles represent a quantiìable model to measure the amount of information transferred from the TelCo operator to the data analyst The call proìles therefore can be seen as a common interchange model allowing both parties to implement a collaboration protocol based on the production and analysis of well-deìned pieces of information This brings two important advantages for the two parties the volume of data transferred using pre-aggregated data like the call proìles is considerably lower and the privacy is better preserved since no original raw data is moved to the data analyst We present a large experimentation conduced in two italian cities from calls data provided by an Italian mobile phone operator In these experiments we classiìed users call habits into three mobility behavior categories Residents Commuters and Visitors  This may enable several innovative applications like mobility observatories where monitoring systems periodically receive call proìles from the TelCo operator and then infer the mobility behavior of users The paper is organized as follows after discussing some related works in Section II Section III describes the analysis process to discover user behaviors from GSM data In Section IV the method is experimented in two case studies while Section V discusses some important observations about the advantages of this method both for a new business model for the TelCo operator and for solving the privacy issues Finally section VI draws the conclusions and future works II R ELATED W ORKS A previous work of the authors of the present paper is  where an approach for proìling users based on GMS calls is presented The novel contribution of the present paper compared to the previous one is manyfold First of all the previous paper approach is only experimented in the city of 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 550 


Pisa while the present paper adds another city Secondly the software we have developed here has been improved with an automatic classiìcation of call proìles into user categories Thirdly we envisage a new cooperation protocol between the TelCo operator and the data analyst where the data to be transferred for analysis are the pre-aggregated call proìles instead of the raw GSM data Among the literature on the analysis of GSM data we can recall a famous experiment on analysing GSM data for studying people movement that have been run in Rome and Graz The y use GSM data to realize a real-time urban monitoring system The nal objective is to realize a wide range of services for the city such as trafìc monitoring and tourists movement analysis A different approach comes from Schlaich et al where the authors e xploit the GSM hando v e r data the aggregated number of users owing between cells to perform the reconstruction of vehicles trajectories to study the route-choice-behavior of car drivers Another use of GSM data is the identiìcation of interesting users places as in where the authors propose a method for the identiìcation of meaningful places relative to mobile telephone users such as home and work points They use GSM data both calls and handovers collected by the phone operator They distinguish between personal anchor points like home work and other person-related places as the locations each user visits regularly as for example a gym In Pereira et al the authors e xploit cellular phone signaling data 1  focusing on the prediction of travel demand for special events Since mobility data are dependent on mobile phone usage they proposed to integrate the GSM dataset with external data to increase the quantity and the quality of the data Quercia et al uses GSM data for recommending social events to city dwellers They combine the locations estimated by mobile phone data of users in the Greater Boston area and the list of social events in the same area Trajectories are extracted from GSM calls and combined with events from the web By crossing the events and the stops they identify a set of potential users participating to events Mobile phone records are analysed also in where the authors propose a visual analytics framework to explore spatiotemporal data by means of SOM Self-Organizing Map analysis They propose a method to cluster the dataset by either of the two dimension and evaluate the resulting aggregation on the other one Although they show the potentialities of using SOM for analysing mobile phone records they do not focus on identifying user proìles Differently from the above approaches the aspect we want to study in this paper is to characterize the user behavior based on the call habits of the tracked users III T HE SYSTEM The availability of huge quantity of mobile phone data stimulates more and more challenging questions that go 1 These data consist of location estimations which are generated each time when a mobile device is connected to the cellular network for calls messages and Internet connections beyond the observation of people movements through the territories What is interesting is to infer some mobility behaviors starting from the footprints left by the users during their mobile phone calls Knowing where they make a call and when how many times they call from a certain location are aspects implicitly stored in the GSM data and can be a valid indicator to draw user proìles In this section we introduce an inductive analysis method based on Self Organizing Maps to infer user beha viors These behaviors can identify people categories characterizing the mobility of the monitored individuals In this paper we focus on three speciìc examples of these mobility behaviors distinguishing people who are resident in the monitored area from the commuters and the visitors According to the instructions given by the domain experts we can formally deìne these categories relative to a selected area A as follows  A person is Resident in an area A when his/her home is inside the A  Therefore the presence in A tend to be spread to any week day and any hour  A person is a Commuter between an area B and an area A if his/her home is in B while the work/school place is in A  Therefore the presence of this person is mainly inside A during working days/hours  A person is a Visitor in an area A if his/her home and work/school places are outside A  and the presence inside the area is limited to a certain period of time that can allow him/her to perform some activities in A  The GSM data used in our analysis method are of two kinds spatio-temporal position of the calls the Call Data Records CDRs and the corresponding spatial co v erage of the GSM cells The user categories can be obtained from the data by the analysis process shown in Figure 1 Fig 1 The analysis process to infer the user categories from GSM data To an abstract level the process foresees two phases a bootstrap shown at the top of the gure and a running phase shown at the bottom The bootstrap phase is aimed at nding a temporal proìle of the calls for the users and is based on the analysis of the raw GSM data The running phase starts with the temporal calls proìles and performs inferences to extract the user categories The distinction between bootstrap 551 


and running phase is particularly important since we can decouple the analysis of GSM raw dat a a large dataset of limited use due to privacy and storage issues with the calls proìles needed to infer the user categories In other words the bootstrap phase can be done only once to establish the calls proìles needed to infer the user categories Once the format of these aggregated data has been chosen and tested in the bootstrap phase the running phase iterates the process but starting from these temporal calling proìles instead of the GSM raw data The importance of having established the calls temporal proìles is that in the running phase the data provider limit the data supply to these aggregated proìles thus avoiding the transfer to the analyst of raw data The running phase can therefore be started with new call proìles every time we need to refresh the dataset for a continuing monitoring of the area During the bootstrap phase we have a rst computation step called Spatio-temporal selection and aggregation  Here the CDRs are rst analyzed and some statistics are calculated to learn about the data and get some aggregate information These statistics are useful for the choice of parameters and thresholds in the following steps Each CDR represents an activity of a user with references to space i.e the cells where the call was performed and time i.e when the user called From this information it is possible to reconstruct the call habits of each user The spatial aspect is used when we select the area to be analysed e.g where the call has been issued Depending on the application the area selection may help in deìning the different user proìles Using only the temporal information we can derive a Temporal Calling Proìle TCP Formally given a user u and a time granularity i.e minute hour day week etc a Temporal Calling Proìle is a sequence TCP u  a 1 a 2 a n   where a i is the frequency of calls done by u in time unit i  From the TCP of a user is is possible to infer his/her typical patterns of calls According to the temporal granularity chosen it is also possible to project a TCP on a time period cycle For example given a TCP based on day granularity it is possible to project it on a weekly interval Figure 2 shows an example of the extraction of a Weekly TP The number of calls of each day of the month in the example February 2012 of two users are shown in the top part User 1 a and User 2 b The Weekly TCPs are obtained by projecting their respective TCPs on a single week as shown in parts  c  and  d   The users calls over the same day through the 4 weeks are summed up in the representative weekly TCPs A TCP does not take into account the space dimension i.e where the user performed the calls The spatial information of the CDRs is represented by the cell identiìer used by the user to transmit When referring to relevant places on the territory it is useful grouping different adjacent cells in one group For example a stadium is a large area that usually is covered by several cells the group of this cells may be referenced as stadium  In this work we aggregate adjacent cells by covering the urban area of a city In general given a partition of the cellular network in group of cells each representing an area for each group A i.e for each area covered by Fig 2 Example of temporal proìles computed starting from the GSM calls G  we extract a Space-Constrained Temporal Calling Proìle SCTCP Formally given an area A as a group of cells an user u and a time granularity a Space-Constrained Temporal Calling Proìle is a TCP extracted only from the call activities performed by u in the cells in A  Both TCP and SCTCP use a single time granularity Indeed it can useful to distinguish different time intervals within the same time unit For example given a TCP by day it is interesting for an analyst to split the daily activities by time of the day i.e during the working hours or during the night In this case we can extend the two proìles above by considering a multilevel time granularity Given a user u  and two time granularities TG 1 and TG 2 where TG 2 is contained in TG 1  a Multilevel Temporal Calling Proìle MLTCP is a matrix TCP   P ij   where the entry P ij represents the number of calls performed by u in the time unit i during the time interval j  As before it is possible to deìne a space constrained MLTCP by considering only the activities in a speciìc area A  When TG 1 is day and TG 2 is hour  a MLTCP of a month contains 31 columns and 24 rows the entry P 4  13 gives the number of calls of the user on 4th of the month between 13 and 14 For the objective of our analysis the information of a MLTCP can still be aggregated by losing some redundant details In particular for the objective of this work we are interested only on the presence of a user in a given area during a time interval not on his/her actual volume of calls Thus we can consider only a predicate to state if user u was present in the observation area during a speciìc time interval From the previous example the entry P 4  13 will yields true if the user performed at least one call in that time interval false otherwise We can still aggregate the MLTCP proìle based on days and hour of day by aggregating both temporal granularities with conceptual intervals We call this speciìc aggregation Multi-Dimensional Call Proìle MDCP A MDCP is a proìle that captures the userês presence during the whole period of observation splitted into speciìc temporal slots In particular two operations are performed on the two time granularities 1 Aggregation of the days in weekday and weekend and 2 deìnition of time intervals within the day representing the interesting time windows during the day For instance we have used the following intervals  t1  00:00:00 Early in the morning when 552 


people are usually at home  t2  08:00:00 Mid day when people are out for work/school or other activities  t3  19:00:00 Late in the e v ening and night when people are typically back home The choice of the daily time intervals is not trivial and it strongly depends on the application and on the categories of users we want to identify For instance to distinguish between the two categories of Residents and Commuters we need to concentrate the analysis on a discriminating factor An example is to compare the presence of people in the area of observation when they are at home and outside home work education leisure joint with the typical time windows used for home and work activities Therefore when a user shows a temporal proìle where 1 during a home time window he/she is always outside the monitoring area and 2 during the work time slot and in the weekdays he/she is always inside the monitoring area then we can conclude that this user is potentially a commuter On the contrary a resident is expected to show a call proìle where his/her presence is inside the monitoring area at both the time slots home and work and during both weekdays and weekends From this example we can see that we need to analyse several dimensions at the same time the daily temporal slots dimension the day-of-the-week dimension the spatial dimension Therefore a Multi-Dimensional call proìle represents all these aspects in one structure as shown in Figure 3 The gure exempliìes the construction process starting from the calls along the days the presences over the time intervals t 1 t 2 t 3 are computed then these presences are aggregated over the weekdays and the weekend summing up all of them The result is a sort of compact representation of the global call proìle for a given user Fig 3 Example of Multi-Dimensional Call Proìle computed from the GSM data and representing the userês presence in the monitored area The Inductive step takes as input the call proìles which can be simply Temporal or Spatio-constrained Temporal MultiLevel or Multi-Dimensional depending of the kind of user behavior we want to deìne and according to their relative similarities group them into homogeneous groups of similar call proìles Here we use an implementation of the Self Organizing Map SOM A SOM is a neural netw ork based on unsupervised learning that produces a one/two-dimensional representation of the input space using a neighborhood function to preserve the topological properties of the input space The SOM forms a sort of semantic map where similar samples are mapped close together and dissimilar apart are mapped far away This produces a set of nodes where each node represents a group of users with similar proìle We call each node the General User Proìle  The automatic classiìcation of the General User Proìles in categories like Residents Commuters and Visitors is done by using a K-Nearest neighbors algorithm where the training examples are a set of prototypes deìned by the domain experts In the classiìcation phase each General User Proìle is assigned to the label corresponding to the most similar prototype This phase returns a rst attempt of automatic classiìcation that can be later modiìed by the expert by using the system interface The quantiìcation step concludes the analysis evaluating the percentage of users for each category and computing a general statistics The visualization of the results allows the analyst to discover new proìles that were not considered in the extraction of the proìles For example we were able to distinguish in Pisa the nightly visitors from the daily visitors This inference process has been implemented in a running system written in Java and including a state of the art SOM algorithm The data are stored in a PostgreSQL relational database with geo-spatial extension PostGis IV C ASE S TUDY The method has been tested with several datasets coming from different geographical areas 11 In this paper we focus on the analysis on two Italian cities Pisa in the Center of Italy and Cosenza in the South The nal objective is the deployment of a permanent monitoring system for people moving in the cities The two GSM datasets are provided by one of the Italian mobile phone operators and consist of one month of CDRs of users having an Italian phone contract no roaming users are included in the datasets 2  We are interested in understanding the behavior of people using the city and their locations Therefore for the experiments we selected only the calls performed in the urban areas thus discarding the calls performed outside the selected area Furthermore we discard the People in Transit  thus individuals who only transit through the urban area without performing relevant activities We identify People in Transit as the users who make their calls only inside a short temporal interval of k hours in whole observation period The value of k is estimated based on the minimum time needed to cross the urban area without performing any signiìcant activity For both Pisa and Cosenza k is set to 1 hour according to the indication given by the experts in the domain For both experiments we use the same temporal constraints and the 2 Data have been provided by the Mobile Phone Operator as part of a longterm cooperation with severe data and privacy constraints As a consequence the data cannot be publicly released and we can only disclose the research results 553 


same settings for the SOM algorithm In particular i for each user we build a temporal proìle that captures the weekly presence as described in Section III ii for the SOM we set the dimension of the output map to 10 x 10  These values have been empirically identiìed as the good trade-off to guarantee a sufìcient number of General Proìles to analyze a Proìling people in Cosenza The whole dataset contains around 25 millions of CDRs collected from October 14th to November 15th 2012 in the italian region Calabria The calls are of about 352.600 users After applying the spatial lter the users calling only in the urban area are about 104.600 For each of these users we computed the Multidimensional proìles and then we applied the the SOM algorithm to groups these proìles into General proìles The quantiìcation step returns the statistics depicted in Figure 4 left that shows the percentages of people for each category b Proìling people in Pisa The dataset contains around 7.8 million of CDRs collected from January 9th to February 8th 2012 in the Province of Pisa The calls are relative to about 232.200 users After the spatial lter the users making calls in the urban area of Pisa are about 103.000 Similarly to the Cosenza case we rst computed the MultiDimensional proìles MDTP then apply the inductive step SOM algorithm to obtain the corresponding similarity map It is worth noticing that among the General Proìles some interesting new cases can be identiìed For example we can identify new general proìles belonging to two new categories Night Visitors and Occasional Visitors  The Night Visitors are people calling only during the night and can be interpreted as persons who visit Pisa only for the nightlife We know that Pisa offers several entertainment and it attracts young people for its nightclubs and pubs while more mature persons may be attracted by shows and cultural events Occasional Visitors are instead people who visit Pisa only few occasional times during the month The two statistics in Figure 4 are a good indicator to describe a sort of dynamics of the two cities The categories of people that are present in a city can be in fact considered an indicators on how the presences may change over time Indeed according to the deìnitions given above the Commuters are not present during the weekends and during the nights while People in Transit cross the city but they donêt stop for performing some activity Looking at the statistics we can see that Pisa counts many more People in Transit compared to Cosenza This is because the urban area of Pisa is crossed by 2 high trafìc roads an important Municipal road and a motorway a railway with an important rail station and an Airport Particularly the Airport generates high ows of people arriving and departing from the city and this data has been conìrmed by their managers since the Airport generates a monthly average of 100.000 arrivals during the winter This trend is also conìrmed by the Pisa Tourist Ofìce observing the fact that many incoming visitors actually use the city as a hub to reach Florence or other nearby touristic attractions By studying the density of the People in Transit we have another conìrmation of this behavior The percentage of Residents and Commuters are similar for both the towns while the percentage of Unknown individuals unclassiìed due to the few phone calls is higher in Cosenza than in Pisa Fig 4 Results of the quantiìcation for Cosenza and Pisa These experiments shows some examples of user behavior inference using the system we have proposed These are real case studies where we use the inference process to establish a kind of monitoring of the city the call proìles are feeded by the mobile operator and the running phase of the system computes the user categories and their statistics When this process is iterated periodically on a weekly or monthly basis it realizes the core component of a more complex infrasture like a urban mobility observatory  Naturally this can be enabled only if we can ensure 1 that the data to be transferred is reduced to an aggregated summary and 2 the data to be transferred for the analysis preserves the privacy of the monitored individuals V B USINESS M ODEL P RIVACY The proposed system provides a quantiìcation of social behaviors on a territory that are extremely valuable for local governments At city level it became crucial to evaluate the incidence of distinct groups of user that exploit the resources of the city like water energy wastes etc A real breakthrough of this proìling activity may come from the foundation of a continuous observatory capable of sensing these population along time giving the possibility of observing the seasonal changes along the year or more in general in the long term history One of the main obstacles for the implementation of a continuous monitoring is usually the availability of GSM data In fact these data are usually protected by laws on individual privacy preservation and it may become difìcult for the TelCo operator to easily distribute such information Moreover TelCo operators consider these data as an asset of the company and they tend to adopt a conservative approach towards their disclosure The analytical phase of our system assumes that the only data available are represented as a set of individual temporal proìle This assumption is important for two main aspects 1 the temporal proìles represent a quantiìable model to measure the amount of information transferred from the TelCo operator to the data analyst 2 the agreement on a common interchange model structure allows both parties to implement a protocol of collaboration based on the production and analysis of welldeìned pieces of information When it comes to nd an economic agreement with a data consumer it is difìcult to give objective criteria for estimating 554 


the cost of the data To clarify this point let us consider the basic granularity of GSM data i.e the CDR format A single CDR log contains the information about a single event on the cellular network Per se this information may be of little utility and it depends on other activities performed by the same user Thus the pricing criteria may be inîuenced by this observation and the unit cost of each CDR log depends on the behavior of the corresponding user Our approach tries to overcome this problem by aggregating the behavior of a user in a single model The system we propose serves as connection between the data provider and the data analyst providing an objective quantiìable set of models that can be used by both parties also for an economic agreement For example the data analyst may correspond to the TelCo operator a monthly fee based on the number of distinct temporal proìles received Note that such agreement may not be possible when considering the raw CDR logs On the basis of this common protocol of data exchange the TelCo operator is protected against leakage of important corporate information since the transmitted data is in an aggregated form and it provides the minimum set of information needed to enable the sociometer service Moreover the TelCo is free to rearrange internally the organization of the information and it is constrained only on the requirements of the models to be produced In the bootstrap phase both parties have to agree on a set of procedures to produce the aggregates i.e both deìne the methods and technologies needed to extract the temporal proìles from CDR data Once this phase is concluded the extraction method may be automated in order to produce a set of proìles periodically for example on a monthly basis One of the most relevant advantages of this approach is the possibility of measuring and handle the privacy risks involved in the distribution of individual habits Since the Multi-Dimensional temporal proìle is a spatio-temporal generalization of individual CDR logs this transformation brings in the system a protection against user re-identiìcation We consider in particular a linking attack where a malicious party knows part of the activities of a user and his objective is to look in the set of the MDT proìles to infer new information about other activities of the same user We set up a series of experiments to measure the probability of re-identiìcation on the GSM datasets we used for the experiments We generated a series of basic knowledge conìgurations for the attacker i.e a combination of observations for a user ranging from few observations to the 99 of the userês activities From this empirical evaluation we found out that the highest probability of re-identiìcation is 0,21 for the 5 of the users in the dataset i.e each combination of observation we have generated selects at least 3,6k candidates among the available MDT proìles This indeed is a valuable protection to ensure that the individual information is not at risk VI C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS This paper proposes a process to analyse the big GSM calls data collected by the mobile operators to understand the mobility behavior of people This is done by aggregating and summarizing the calls records then applying data mining algorithms to automatically label the different calling proìles into user behaviors The method has been implemented into a running system and experimented in two case studies where data has been provided by an Italian mobile operators for two cities We also discussed a strategic feature of the method we base our analysis on the aggregation of the raw GSM data into calls proìles thus giving both a new cooperation model between TelCo operator and data analyst and at the same time providing a good trade off between analysis outcomes and privacy preservation Possible improvements include replace the SOM with a more sophisticated clustering algorithm and to design a more efìcient strategy for the automatic classiìcation of the General proìles to reduce the percentage of Unknown More in general we intend to test the new cooperation protocol with the local municipality and the TelCo operator to better understand which is the economical impact of this new paradigm in the business model of the operator A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been partially supported by EU projects

tracker feature they could also access the counters provided by Hadoop By measuring the number of simultaneous map tasks executing the user could infer the relative load on the server  but only if they knew the exact size and conìguration of the cluster which by design of this ecosystem would typically not be the case However by assessing the number of map tasks that ran data-local and comparing that to the number of tasks executing simultaneously information could be gleaned about the capacity of the cluster This information is no longer included in the tracker It is worth noting that the Hadoop cluster used Amazon spot instances which allows users to bid on unused capacity and pay only the prevailing market price We paid 013/hr for each instance or a total cost of 1.17 for the 10 hours of processing time required while these experiments ran Had this been run using on-demand instance it would have resulted in a cost an order of magnitude higher e.g 11.70 IV O BSERVATIONS AND T HOUGHTS G OING F ORWARD This represents a known challenge when dealing with ABAC While there has been work done that addresses this issue 16 in our approach we require attributes be speciìed under authority namespaces in order to prevent attribute collisions This refers to the development environment of the client to be utilized during the development phase of their MapReduce program There are two possible approaches to building this environment 1 A small i.e 1 GB dataset could be supplied to the clients local system for them to work on A problem with this approach is that once data is released it can not be recovered A second problem is that the developer must have a working version of Hadoop deployed 2 The provider  reseller could provide a working development environment to the client that includes an installed Hadoop/data as a virtual machine image which they could run as an instance and upon which they could practice A problem with this approach is designing a bundle that can be used only for a limited period of time This represents a possible avenue of future work A potential security concern exists in the running of untrusted client code on a providerês system Future work will explore the potential for running the submitted code in a sandboxed environment prior to executing on the live system Additionally Hadoop 2x 10 has introduced several security that will also help to mitigate this concern While the current work did not focus on the veriìcation of Modifying Maps this is a crucial aspect with regards to the integrity of the DaaSPatcher ecosystem In the current model the provider/reseller is completely responsible to verify the correctness of their Modifying Maps We intend to explore applying model driven techniques to ensure the correctness of these maps as a part of our future work Installing deploying and conìguring a Hadoop cluster ranges from very complicated to reasonably 10 http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current easy One of the main aspects that determines this level of complexity is the personês prior experience working with such a system By removing the need to perform all administrative tasks and by virtue of the simpliìed interface i.e a high-level GUI rather than complex CLI commands the studentês focus can remain solely on the logic of the MapReduce program they are constructing allowing them to develop their skills and understanding immediately Further because we can deploy different Modifying Maps to each student there is no worry about cheating on assignment material etc A key driver of the DaaSPatcher ecosystem design is the fact that it is built on the cloud The ability of applications to scale dynamically in accordance with their elasticity policyês i.e in response to changing demands/workloads is critical when designing infrastructure for unpredictable numbers of users with undeìned requirements To enable an organization to extend a Hadoop cluster to the public cloud we could use a Modifying Map to selectively copy data to the public Hadoop cluster Other Modifying Maps can be annotated and partitioned as in mo ving those that can run in the public cloud to the new

After many tweaks and focused discussion outside of the full PSRP the OPALS CBCS matrix was approved for Phase 2 As Phase 3 approaches, all agreed-to verifications of hazard controls must be performed, documented, and submitted Any deviations from the agreed-to verifications must be documented and approved by members of the PSRP In addition to the Flight Safety Reviews \(FSRs\und Safety Review schedule is also negotiated and a package is submitted.  This process is very similar to the PSRP one, but the scope of the hazards is limited to ground operations at the launch and processing facilities The key to successfully passing the FSRs has been constant early, and open communication with the PSRP. It has allowed for the quick identification of hazards and it has prevented the project from locking itself into designs that either could have adversely impacted safety or could have made compliance significantly more difficult. The PSRP and everyone involved in the safety side of the interface have shown great flexibility in allowing OPALS design freedom to ensure its mission success while enforcing a high standard for the safety of the ISS and those inhabiting it 5  D RIVERS   C ONSTRAINTS  AND R ESULTING I MPLEMENTATION  OPALS is no exception when it comes to facing the typical challenges that most space flight projects have to overcome throughout their lifecycle. Cost and schedule always seem insufficient. The workforce is sometimes stretched thin. All these challenges create constraints, end up driving the decision-making process and inescapably shape the final product. There are, however, many aspects that set OPALS apart from the average space borne instrument, and they too came with their own drivers and constraints Overall, the drivers and constraints can be classified as internal and external, with each category further divided into process- or technically-flavored This section is dedicated to examples, spanning each of those categories, of drivers and constraints that have in one way or another influenced the implementation of the project Internal, Process-Derived Drivers and Constraints The aspects falling under this section refer to those whose common denominator is the internally-mandated JPL process. The most influential and prevailing of these processes are documented in the JPL Design Principles and JPL Flight Project Practices. These documents provide guidelines on everything from cost, schedule reserves and technical margins to the pedigree of the parts and components used by the flight article and the level of documentation required Class D 227The biggest impact on the project, second only to the stringent cost cap, was the decision to implement it as a Class D payload risk classification per NASA NPR 8705.4 This decision was less of a constraint than it was a driver and it ultimately gave the project more flexibility in making decisions. The ramifications of this decision are many including the risk posture of the project in parts selection sparing philosophy, hardware handling requirements qualification program, fault protection, and extent of formal verification of requirements Early on in its lifecycle, the project sought to define the Class D implementation approach within the guidelines set by NASA procedural requirements. Specifically the project was allowed to 200  Build one proto-flight model with limited engineering models \(EMs\he only subsystem to have a full EM is the avionics. Other EMs include the acquisition camera one motor driver, and the in-house developed power board 200  Limit parts sparing to long-lead items only. The project only purchased one spare actuator and a few of the avionics cards. There are no spares for the laser, power board, camera, or any structural components 200  Use COTS hardware wherever possible. This aspect is discussed in further detail in a subsequent section 200  Forgo radiation or parts support. The extensive usage of COTS components implies, to a large extent, the absence of radiation susceptibility data, along with other environmental information. Thus, as early as the Mission Concept Review, the project and its stakeholders have accepted the potential missionending risk of unrecoverable single event upsets 200  Limit hardware and software Quality Assurance prior to system level integration and test. Typically, HQA/SQA involvement begins early in subsystem development well in advance of system I&T 200  Limit flight tech support to final torqueing and high risk procedures. The philosophy here is similar to the HQA/SQA involvement Requirements and V&V\227 Likely the most unglamorous aspect of producing a space-wo rthy payload is developing the set of requirements that govern its function and behavior. While Class-D status does not give the project a pass on developing requirements, it can shape the way the process is conducted and the extent to which requirements are developed For example, higher-class projects typically develop requirements down to level five or six, and bin them in dozens, if not hundreds of sets or modules. By contrast OPALS currently only has 782 requirements spread over 33 modules, with none of them containing more than 105 items. Of the 694 ISS requirements only 376 are applicable to OPALS, accounting for 48% of the total OPALS set Similarly, of the 117 launch vehicle requirements, only 58 are levied on OPALS. This means that the project has only 


  348 project-specific requirements that it in t verify. Figure 13 breaks down the requirements, including ISS and launc h residing at the various levels OPALS, however, is no poster child f development as it fell into the same trap t h projects\227regardless of size and risk verification and validation \(V&V\ time: it unnecessary requirements At CDR time OPALS realized that requirements it was signing up to verify d and testing, totaling almost 1300 \(796 OP A LV\, had become unmanageable give n schedule and cost-to-go.

  15 manufacturer specification for vibration tolerance.  To deal with this issue, the rigid tray assembly that houses the avionics and fans is mounted on a system of wire-rope isolators designed to dampen random vibrations within the specific frequency spectra produced by the launch vehicle These isolators protect delicate solder joints and other nonrugged components from being torn apart by launch loads Further, in much the same way as the loss of circulation during power outages provides a natural means of insulation against heat loss, the wire rope isolator system\222s poor thermal conductivity also impedes conduction to the outer structure of the sealed container External, Process-Derived Drivers and Constraints While many decisions were internally motivated by the JPL processes and the OPALS paradigm, a significant number also came via the ISS and launch vehicle interfaces, both programmatically and technically As one might anticipate, the ISS interface in particular impacted the OPALS day-to-day operations as well as the design features it implemented. The most clear example of this aspect came via the over 400 requirements imposed by the ISS program on the OPALS payload, followed by the V&V process mandated to demonstrate compliance Requirements 227As one of the first payloads to negotiate both the ISS and Dragon interfaces, OPALS has been routinely involved in technical changes beginning and ending with its interface requirements.  A considerable ongoing effort within OPALS and its partners has been to solidify the understanding of the requirements levied When OPALS began in 2009, the Dragon had neither flown nor been fully designed.  This was best represented in the miniscule 16 provided requirements that were largely placeholders for what would  become the Dragon\222s interface specification.  At that point, expectations were that OPALS would be completed well before its Dragon flight. This schedule disconnect led to a considerable technical disconnect In order to proceed with OPALS development despite the lack of a full set of design requirements assumptions had to be made in three key areas: power, connectivity, and the launch environment.  The first question of power came about for an obvious reason: OPALS has thermally sensitive optics and commercial equipment, and these components need heater power to be kept warm in space.  Without requirements on Dragon power provisions, the project\222s first assumption was that the thermal control hardware designed for the on-orbit ISS environment would also prove valid during a Dragon ascent.  After exhaustive integrated thermal analysis, this assumption, and the resulting engineering implementation, has proven to be valid, and an additional 12 pages of requirements and supporting data now reflect this interface design After requirements were negotiated and an agreement was reached to provide sufficient thermal power during ascent the question remained of how this power would be routed into the OPALS payload.  To direct the efforts towards a solution of connectivity, OPALS turned to the JAXA H-II Transfer Vehicle \(HTV\d Space Shuttle designs that powered FRAM-based payloads similar to OPALS.  These additional carrier requirements allowed several connectivity options and it was thus taken to be a valid assumption that the Dragon team could design around OPALS\222 desired cabling pin assignments.  The OPALS design was thus submitted to SpaceX and, as this was the first request for a specific option, the OPALS connectivity solution has become the primary power distribution option amongst external Dragon cargo requirements The project\222s greatest challenge, however, was the need to design the FS prior to receiving any validated launch  Figure 15: Early design of the sealed container did not optimize component pl acement or airflow  Figure 16: CFD analysis led to a new component layout that allowed for more efficient heat removal 


  16 loading requirements.  To address this, OPALS began with JPL and NASA\222s extensive historical data on expected launch loads, amended with ample margin and overlaid with standard levels on workmanship. The resulting crude spectrum was then supplied to the ISS and SpaceX dynamics teams who over the course of several months helped refine test plans to a conservative but agreeable level, which again proved to be valid \(and indeed conservative\via integrated analysis and testing. At the time of this writing OPALS had successfully completed vibration testing Lastly, the project has dealt with the uncertainty that comes via requirements variability from the ISS interface. Since OPALS began, 37% of the 694 ISS interface requirements have changed. Even though only 376 of them are applicable to OPALS, the project has had to maintain cognizance in this regard over the full set.  Despite the fact that the ISS is an operational facility and many components have been flying in orbit for several years, both OPALS and the ISSP are still learning about the function and performance of these components.  As such, there have been ample updates to the electrical and robotic interface requirement segments These requirement changes are executed methodically in a thoroughly reviewed manner.  After internal ISS coordination, pending requirement updates are quickly disseminated amongst payload developers.  After external review by existing and prospective payloads, signatures are requested and requirements are enacted V&V 227Verification and Validation includes the final work done to certify both that the payload meets the word of the requirements, and that it performs the intended function 55% of OPALS\222 requirements to be verified are provided by its external interfaces, including the ISS and Dragon Though verified along with all other project requirements these interface requirements demand a different balance of focus.  As these requirements are provided by external entities they are managed outside of JPL and subject to external verification.  OPALS, therefore, has no formal validation program for these requirements beyond ongoing interface systems engineering diligence.  While this externalized approach minimizes internal efforts, it simultaneously increases verification  overhead Verification of each external interface requirement falls under the cognizance of an external Discipline Engineer DE\d the OPALS verification program is built around this external approval process, which is diagramed in Figure 17.  These external engineers represent the external hardware expertise necessary to ultimately understand validate and approve all interactions with their hardware.  It is important to note that these engineers support a multitude of projects across geographic boundaries, and their ability to provide dedicated attention to OPALS is attenuated by the breath of the projects they support Internal to OPALS, an abundance of verification data is generated for these DEs in the verification of the 452 external requirements.  The planning, technical coordination, and direction of this work is coordinated between the OPALS External Interface Engineer and the cognizant engineers within OPALS. As data and plans have been generated over years of interaction among these organizations, it is incumbent upon the EIE to ensure internal consistency and remedy problems across evolving interfaces External, Technically-Derived Drivers and Constraints The ISS-imposed requirements provide the specification for the physical interface to the station, and, via the PSRP process, also provide direction on meeting the safety considerations that come with the Class A status of the ISS This section will highlight how technical specifications from the ISS impacted aspects of the OPALS design Mass & Power Budgets 227Most payloads will find the ISS allocation for mass and 28V operational power to be quite generous at 490 lbs. \(excluding the top half of the FRAM\227 the ExPA plate\d 504 watts, respectively. The ISS also provides 750 watts on a 120V operational line and an additional 300 watts of power on a 120V heater line Expected to come in under 400 lbs., OPALS fits well within its mass allocation. In fact, at no point in its development did the OPALS mass margin\227calculated as \(AllocationCBE\llocation\227fall below 15%, and since CDR it has been hovering around 30%. The 28V ops power margin has been even more generous, hovering at or above 60% for much of the projects lifecycle, while the 120V ops and 120V heater lines have seen equally generous margins of over 60% and 70 %, respectively In space, mass and power are drivers more often than not For OPALS the opposite has been the case, to the point where the excess allocations has been used to solve problems in other areas. One such example has been the  Figure 17:  The OPALS ISS requirement verification process is built around th e ISS approval process

  19 turn lead to a design that required forced convective cooling and vibration dampening, both uncommon for modern-day space payloads. Furthermore, it allowed the project flexibility in tailoring its verification and validation program for non-ISS requirements to save cost and schedule The focus of space-borne instruments is usually on the flight articles, which in the case of OPALS is the FRAM-based payload to be externally installed on the ISS. However most, if not all, projects must also develop a ground infrastructure to support the operations of the flight asset For OPALS, despite being more akin to an instrument than a spacecraft, that was certainly the case as significant development was required for both the optical ground station to enable the transmissi on of a beacon and receipt of the optical downlink for the former, and for the MOS to support commanding and telemetry The use of the OCTL facility in California greatly reduced the amount of development required to receive and process the optical downlink, and to transmit the beacon needed by the FS to locate the ground station. The development was thus restricted to the optics needed to condition the light beam for processing by the hardware receiver and the software decoder The design of the MOS was, by and large, dictated by the interface to the ISS\222s expansive payloads operations infrastructure located at Ma rshall Space Flight Center Because the interface was already mature and well understood, the project\222s efforts were primarily focused on ensuring compatibility rather than developing its own capability. The savings afforded by leveraging the existence of the already operating infrastructure cannot be understated A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The authors express their gratitude to the entire OPALS team for their dedication and hard work, and to the mentors that have guided the team on a path to success.
