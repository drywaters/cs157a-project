Scalable Network Trafìc Visualization Using Compressed Graphs Lei Shi   Qi Liao   Xiaohua Sun   Yarui Chen  and Chuang Lin  Abstract The visualization of complex network trafìc involving a large number of communication devices is a common yet challenging task Traditional layout methods create the network graph with overwhelming visual clutter which hinders the network understanding and trafìc analysis tasks The existing graph simpliìcation algorithms e.g community-based clustering can effectively reduce the visual complexity but lead to less meaningful trafìc representations In this paper we introduce a new method to the trafìc monitoring and anomaly analysis of large networks namely Structural Equivalence Grouping SEG Based on the intrinsic nature of the computer network trafìc SEG condenses the graph by more than 20 times while preserving the critical connectivity information Computationally SEG has a linear time complexity and supports undirected directed and weighted trafìc graphs up to a million nodes We have built a Network Security and Anomaly Visualization NSAV tool based on SEG and conducted case studies in several real-world scenarios to show the effectiveness of our technique Keywords Security Visualization Graph Compression I I NTRODUCTION There has been a recent surge of the network trafìc in both the Internet domain and the local area network such as enterprise private networks and data center networks Measuring and analyzing these trafìc is made convenient lately through the development of Software-Deìned Networking SDN and protocols such as OpenFlow In the process of dealing with the network trafìc the visualization of overall connection patterns assumably as node-link graphs is vital in many scenarios For example in a companyês virtual private network the administrators need a way to get access to the latest trafìc patterns to maintain situational awareness Upon security alerts they need to conduct interactive trafìc analysis to issue responsive mitigation and relevant troubleshooting However it is challenging to visualize the network trafìc graph scaling to a large number of hosts and complex  State Key Laboratory of

the quadratic-complexity forcedirected drawing methods for the general graph can not calculate a good layout in real time   1s for a graph with more than a hundred nodes Meanwhile the number of hosts in an Ethernet can easily reach multi-thousands without counting different ports Second even if faster large graph layouts can be computed in servers through optimizations  4 the visual clutter in the node-link representation as in Figure 1\(b mainly the edge crossings prohibits the user from understanding the network trafìc in details Third the graph clustering algorithms with cohesive or distance based measures also known as community detection algorithms can greatly reduce the visual complexity by the multiscale graph abstraction approaches 6 Though quite successful in analyzing social networks these methods can lead to poor results when communities are not prevalent which is the case for most network trafìc graphs An visual example is shown in Figure 1\(c Moreover the clustered top view hides the context and topology details which are critical to trafìc pattern analysis and discovery In this paper we introduce a new graph simpliìcation method to the network trafìc visualization problem based on the concept of structural equivalence 8 well-kno wn in the social network research eld Rather than detecting communities structural equivalence classiìes the network nodes into categories by their position taken in the network depending merely on the network graph Empirically this can be better than the community-based clustering methods in both reducing the graph size and preserving the connectivity information due to the high-frequency subgraph patterns in the network trafìc such as singletons hubs and connectors Figure 1\(b As shown in Figure 1\(a a 3460-host trafìc graph is reduced to 18 grouped nodes and 28 edges while the same graph by the modularity clustering generates 50 intermediate cluster nodes a maximal depth of 4 939 unclustered nodes and 15438 edges in the top view The similar node pairing or grouping ideas have previously been studied in 11 as summarized in Section II b u t none of them develop and explore the method in an interactive network trafìc visualization context In more detail we propose our main algorithm Structural Equivalence Grouping SEG in Section III SEG completes in linear time for sparse trafìc graphs Beyond the undirected graphs we extend SEG to support the directed and weighted graphs We also develop the fuzzy SEG method to control the visual complexity in a ner granularity The visual 2013 IEEE International

a Original graph b Compressed graph Figure 2 SEG on an undirected graph glyphs encoding the type size and speciìcation In the large graph drawing context the property of neighborhood set is applied in an iterative coarsening process to reduce the graph to smaller ones and layout recursively by the multilevel drawing approach 4 The latest w ork in 15 applies the node grouping to the representation of graph adjacency matrices for visualizing gene regulatory networks For a comprehensive survey in the area of large graph visualization readers can refer to the paper in III A LGORITHM A Structural Equivalence Grouping Intuitively SEG aggregates the graph nodes with the same neighbor set together into groups and construct a new graph for visualization For example in the trafìc graph of Figure 2\(a the host 192.168.2.23 can be combined with the other three surrounding hosts with exactly the same connection pattern The new graph after SEG Figure 2\(b is called the compressed graph  The compressed graph has two kinds of nodes the single-node remaining from the original graph drawn in hollow and the mega-node grouped from multiple sub-nodes in the original graph drawn with lled colors Before we formally describe the algorithms graph terminologies throughout this paper are rst deìned Deìnition Let G   V  E  be a directed weighted and connected original graph where V   v 1  v n  and E   e 1  e m  denote the node and link set Let W be the graph adjacency matrix where w ij  0 indicates a link from v i to v j  with w ij denoting the link weight In each row of W  R i   w i 1  w in  denotes the row vector for node v i  representing its connection pattern The compressed graph after SEG is denoted as G   V   E    The compression rate is deìned by   1  V     V  1  E     E  in Section III-D The basic SEG algorithm takes the graph as a simple undirected and unweighted one by setting w ii  0 and w ij  w ji  1 for any w ij  0 Structural Equivalence Grouping On graph G  for any collection of nodes with the same row vector including the single outstanding node aggregate them into a new meganode/single-node Gv i   v i 1  v i k   All Gv i form the node set V  for the compressed graph G   Let fv i  v i 1 denote the rst sub-node in Gv i  The link set E  in G  are generated by replacing all fv i with Gv i in the original link set and removing all the links not incident to any fv i  SEG is singlepass on any graph as any two nodes in the compressed graph have different row vectors Directed Graph The adjacency matrix W is transformed to encode the both connection directions for each node Each row vector R i  i  1  n  becomes R i   w i   n    w i   1   w i 1  w in  having w i   j   w ji for j  1  n  Weighted Graph The adjacency matrix W is switched to the weighted one by mapping a numeric data attribute of link  i  j  e.g ow count in the trafìc graph to w ij in the matrix To further increase the compression rate discretization of the link weight is allowed transform all link weights into w ij   0  1  by either linear or non-linear normalization and then pick a bin count B  B  1  and regenerate link weights by w ij   w ij  B   Supporting Clique By the basic SEG the sub-nodes within a mega-node do not have any intra-group link However it is also useful to group a clique of nodes with the same external connection together Speciìc rendering can be applied to differentiate between mega-nodes with isolated and fully connected sub-nodes We devise a twostep approach to achieve that in the rst step the graph adjacency matrix W is set to w ii  0 allowing the grouping of isolated nodes In the second step W is reset to w ii  1 and all the original nodes not aggregated in the rst step are grouped again B Controlling the Compression Rate SEG is a deterministic algorithm in that for the same original graph it always produces the same compressed graph In the real usage the user would like to exibly control the visual complexity after the compression Fuzzy Structural Equivalence Grouping The basic idea of fuzzy SEG is to group nodes with not only the same but also the similar neighbor set The compression rate can be increased with bounded compensation on accuracy The key is to deìne the pairwise similarity score between graph nodes Here we adopt the standard Jaccard similarity between two sample sets A and B by J  A  B   A  B    A  B  For the directed and weighted graphs we introduce a uniìed Jaccard similarity computation between node v i and v j in graph G by     k min  w ik  w jk    k max  w ik  w jk   Note that for the directed graph k   n   1  1   n  Fuzzy SEG is achieved by setting a similarity threshold   The pair of nodes with    are grouped together iteratively C Implementation Structural Equivalence Grouping The core step of SEG to group nodes with the same row vector is achieved through an appropriate hash function H  R i  over the row vector identiìers The row vector identiìer is created by splicing the positive cells in the row into a string This hash-based implementation has a computational complexity of O  ND   608

graph D is the average node degree for the complexity to splice and hash each row vector identiìer Therefore the basic SEG has a linear complexity and will perform well even for very large graphs Fuzzy Structural Equivalence Grouping We introduce an improvement by the shingle-ordering on the fuzzy SEG implementation For each row vector R i  construct the element set A i   a  w ia  1   Given any permutation    1   n  1   n   the shingle of the row vector R i is deìned by M   A i    1  min   A i         By shingle properties the probability that shingles of set A and B are identical is precisely their Jaccard coefìcient J  A  B   The corresponding fuzzy SEG algorithm still works in a greedy manner to scan each node in a order Each newly scanned node without a group is selected as an anchor node and also create a new group around the anchor node together with the other nodes similar enough Using shingle-based method we do not need to compare pairwise similarity Instead we pre-compute and record k shingles for each nodeês neighbor set using k orthogonal permutation functions At most kN lists are created each holding the nodes with a same shingle result 1  N  by one permutation function Then for each anchor node we can get the set of similar enough nodes by scanning the k corresponding list according to the shingle property The overall complexity is O  kND  kN  D 2   where kND is the complexity to pre-compute shingles D 2 is the average size of the 2-hop neighbor set of each node also the upper bound of the average length of each list to scan In most graphs the complexity is signiìcantly below N 2  D Performance We evaluate the SEG performance in terms of the visual compression rate by the number of edges the compression time and the layout time before and after SEG All the experiments are carried out on the same 64-bit Windows desktop Intel Core i7@3.40GHz with 8GB memory Table I and II show the results on two trafìc graph datasets Figure 3 User interface for compressed graph visualization Left SEG controllers Right main panel for trafìc visualization Data set is from VAST Challenge 2011 Notably for both cases SEG achieves a more than 95 compression rate with the basic algorithm or applying a fuzzy setting The compression time is mostly below 0.5 second reaching up to 10 4 edges The layout time after SEG is signiìcantly reduced from that of the original graph We also experiment on one type of extreme-scale graph the twitter social graphs with up to millions of edges Table III Because these graphs are beyond the application domain of SEG we only report their running time for the purpose of a scalability study The basic SEG compresses the largest graph in half a minute the fuzzy SEG with the shingle implementation supports graphs with up to 10 5 edges and returns results in 25 seconds IV V ISUALIZATION A Compressed Graph Visual Encoding The right panel of Figure 3 gives an example of the SEGcompressed graph visualization As shown in the gure the mega-nodes are differentiated from the single-nodes by the ll color The single-nodes have no ll and the mega-nodes have standard ll colors with the color saturation mapped to the number of sub-nodes in the group The larger group is lled with the more saturated color By default the ll color hue is blue e.g the top-right node 192.168.1.10 For the mega-nodes created by the fuzzy SEG e.g the node 192.168.2.11 on the right the ll color will gradually shift from blue to green and then to brown according to the smallest pairwise similarity score within the group The mega-node containing totally dissimilar nodes will lead to a pure brown ll color We do not use the node size to represent the group size of the mega-node since the group size normally has a rather biased distribution The large groups can introduce unnecessary visual complexities which counters our initial design goal Labels of the mega-node are created by aggregating the labels of the sub-nodes in the original graph Due to the space limitation an abstracted label is drawn on each meganode as the node identiìer The full label will pop-up upon 609 


a mouse hovering or a click action e.g the one on the node 192.168.1.10 The group size of each mega-node is drawn below the visual node together with the intra-group similarity score when it is below one By default straight lines are used to represent the links in the compressed graph with thickness mapped to the sum of counts of all the corresponding links in the original graph Compressed graph attributes can also be mapped exibly into the visuals For example the node label can be the host types Figure 1\(a or the alphabetical anomaly icons Figure 3 indicating the type of anomalies happening on the host B Graph Interaction Design Except the basic graph interactions more controls over the SEG setting are accessible through a control panel as in the top left of Figure 3 In the Compression Options section multiple checkboxes work as switches for the basic directed and weighted SEG For the weighted SEG the link weight mapping from the graph attribute can be speciìed For normalized link weight a bin number can be selected to discretize the weight In the Compression Level and Compression Similarity sections a larger or smaller compressed graph is tunable by the LOD control and the fuzzy SEG Complementary to the automatic SEG operation we also introduce the manual node grouping/splitting interaction as in many cases the users have their own criteria towards a best trafìc abstraction The user can either select a collection of nodes and click the group button in the navigation panel or use drag-and-drop to group one node into another once per time In the drag-and-drop process the pairwise similarities with all the other nodes are shown as visual hints In a manual splitting process the user can either select some mega-nodes and click the split button or just double-click one mega-node The mega-node grouped by the fuzzy SEG will collapse to mega-nodes by the basic SEG and further collapses to the original sub-nodes C Network Security and Anomaly Visualization Tool In the integrated NSAV tool Figure 1\(a the compressed trafìc graph visualization functions as the major view in the central panel Meanwhile there are several other panels illustrating other facets of the network trafìc Graph Node/Edge Filtering and Selection This is in the lower-left corner of the control panel in Figure 3 In the node tab the user can lter the graph according to various criteria of the host importance A host importance distribution is shown on top of the slider to suggest a better lter setting In the edge tab the graph is ltered according to the connection importance respectively The mapping of the node/edge ltering criteria can be manually adjusted according to the available attributes Finally in the List panel any individual host can be quickly selected from a list so that the host will be highlighted in the trafìc graph  Data Center  Vlan 10  192.168.1.x/24 Internet Cisco 3750E Switch Mail Server EX01 192.168.1.6 Shipping/Routing

list of all the anomaly types occurred during the speciìed time range Selection of any anomaly types from the list will highlight in the trafìc graph all the hosts on which such anomalies have happened The second middle panel consists of mappings between anomaly icons and their anomaly type description much like a legend for the anomaly timeline visualization below The third bottom panel shows anomaly events as timeline plots of all the interesting hosts under investigation Each unique anomaly event at a speciìc time will have an anomaly icon to encode its type and count orange color represents the source and gray color represents the destination for an anomaly connection Time Range Selector The double-end slider at the bottom of the tool allows the user to interactively select

Processing The NSAV tool reads and automatically correlates several standard network trafìc and management data Netîow is the industry standard in network management to collect and monitor network activities Each Netîow record contains information for a packet ow e.g src/dst IP addresses and port numbers protocol ow size start and end timestamps etc Intrusion Detection System IDS like Snort is a fully functional and customizable system to monitor different types of network trafìc IDS log includes all kinds of intrusion detection events Acceptable Use Policy AUP of each organization is about what activities/services are allowed within its network AUP can be transformed into a good rule set for visual anomaly detections 610

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
