Humanities ëBig Data Myths, challenges, and lessons Amalia S. Levi College of Information Studies University of Maryland College Park, MD 20742, USA amaliasl@gmail.com   Abstract This paper argues that there have always been ëbig dataí in the humanities, and challenges commonly held myths in this regard. It does so by discussing the case of transnational research on dispersed communities. Concluding, it examines the lessons humanities and sciences can learn from each other  Keywordsóhumanities; transnational; diasporas; archives communities; web resources I  T HE T HREE MYTHS OF HUMANITIES SCHOLARSHIP  Big dataí are hailed as a novel phenomenon, a wave of data so voluminous that we need new methods of inquiry. But in humanities, there have always been ëbig dataí. Anyone who has ever stepped inside a museum, conducted research in an archives, pulled a book from a library shelf, or even wishfully looked at old family photos can attest to this fact. Piles upon piles of documents, objects, images, books, and the information they contain are eloquent sources of indomitable big data.í Navigating, using, and making sense out of these big dataí is what humanities scholars have always done Humanities scholarship is then characterized by three myths. The first is that ëbig dataí is the purview of the sciences and that humanities must embrace this novelty in order to stay relevant in a world where the constitution of knowledge itself is being challenge  T h e s econ d is th at never mind ëbig data,í humanities scholarship is a continuous struggle to overcome the scarcity of primary sources especially if oneís research is outside ìmainstreamî histories The third is that everything humanities scholars need for their research exists in archives and museums These myths have been prevalent in the case of historical research on transnational populations such as diasporas immigrants, ethnic minorities, or refugees. Research in transnational communities is characterized by dispersion of resources among institutions, and countries; inconsistency of formats, languages, and material; lack of a central ìauthority institution\ collecting such resources, and, today, the dominant role of the Web in the communication flow among members of such communities Communication on the Web produces vast corpora of online data. In fact the Web is so integral in the lives of transnational populations that it has given rise to the term of eDiasporas, i.e., collectives that are sustained and re-created as globally imagined communities A t th e s a m e ti m e con t en t  generated by communities on the Web has only exacerbated the issue of dispersion of resources in yet more places and formats In their article, ìCritical questions for Big Data Provocations for a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon,î boyd and Crawford question the assumptions embedded in Big Data, approaching the subject as social scientists and media studies scholars. In this article, I would like to contribute to this discussion as a historian and archives scholar. The points I raise are based on my research on and interaction with ethnic and diasporic communities and the scholars who study them. I believe that the particular sometimes extremeóissues scholars face when conducting research on such communities can highlight concerns considerations and challenges of humanities ëbig dataí and enrich the dialogue on this with other disciplines  II  T RANSNATIONALISM AS A SOURCE OF  BIG DATA  Transnationalism, as a term, overcomes the limitations of the term migration that traditionally reflected a one-way process. Transnationalism denotes circular and dynamic crossborder mobility of people or groups between two or more locations over time Big dataí in the context of historical research on transnational populations can be understood in two ways 1  Retrospective ëbig data Analog resources in libraries archives, and museums \(LAM\ate collections that lend themselves to a retrospective creation of big data through digitization. The issue with this kind of ëbig dataí is that not everything is digitized, and especially in the case of marginalî histories exist out in the wild. In an era when users expect to find everything online, the disconnection between what is really there and what is visibleóand readily availableóis obvious 2  Realí big data Resources created in abundance today that already at their inception are digital, networked ëbig data e.g., Twitter, Facebook etc  They are quantifiable and computationally malleable, but present challenges for humanities scholars, because they require new methods of analysis. The emphasis in this category of data is not on the bignessîóthey are without doubt hugeóbut in the way their value as data, their ërecordness,í is understood as such. ëReal big data exist, but for the time being do not form part of historical scholarship, and the alarming speed with which they disappear, leaving considerable lacunae in our understanding 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 33 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE 


about our very recent past, is currently the prerogative of information professionals, and not scholars  In the case of historical scholarship, there is currently a disjunction between what kinds of primary sources are currently being produced, and what is preserved for the futureóand in what ways.  More specifically, in the case of transnational communities that span localities there is never a single, ìauthoritativeî institution able to create representative archives out of all these data. It is only humanities scholars and social scientists conducting research in these communities who are able to create conceptual links between dispersed materials. Such links are externalized through published scholarship \(journal articles, monographs, lectures etc., or in scholarsí personal archives What is important in humanities ëbig dataí today is not the uniqueness of one record, but the volume of many. For community research, itís not even the records that matter but the network of relationships that constructs community consolidates its identity and shapes its memories [4  Furthermore, online ëbig dataí exemplify the ways that individual lives coalesce on social network platforms to form virtual personal and community archiv t t h e s a m e  time, todayís cult of ìnetworked individualism h a s  forever changed the notion of belonging to a community  III  T RANSNATIONAL H UMANITIES RESEARCH  Today, it is mostly social scientists use web content as data corpora of ìnaturally occurring, textualized interactionsî from which they harvest text and metadata and which they compile into web archives for systematic, fine grained analysis Historians who have different research questions might approach such archives with different methods, but for the time being the Web plays a limited role as a source material for them creas ing l y  thou gh th e y  w i l l be ex pected to tackle dispersed and uneven web material and produce research that synthesizes inconsistent data into something that makes sense. What happens when humanities scholars that traditionally developed historical discourse by blending individual documents encounter ëbig data The greatest issue for humanities scholars conducting transnational research was up to now the limitations of the physical world. Before the wide availability and use of computers, constraints such as geographical distances different institutional policies, and analog resources humanities scholarship was doomed to be a monastic and laborious work. It was necessarily a close reading of our cultural heritage. With the advent of digitization and the Internet, humanities research has become data intensive and collaborativ  Cultural heritage institutions have tried to solve these limitationsóand in the process, gain greater physical and intellectual control over recordsówith pragmatic approaches that at the same time are consistent with the aesthetic sensitivities, ideological background, and belief systems of people. In an institutionís physical space, or online presence what got to be exhibited or highlighted was not statistical representations of its holdings, but one out of many: an item that was unique in its quality to excite our senses, to capture our interest, to appeal to ou r ideological sensibilities, and to reinforce the institutionís preeminence and superiority among others as the authoritative source of the story that it presented What we lacked were ways to computationally exert control over analog cultural heritage material. Metadata was one way that LAM employed in order to tame humanities ëbig data classifying data into categories made description and navigation relatively easy. At the same time it named things and tried to fit the diversity of our world into predetermined bucketsî that reflected more the biases of the classifying entity rather than our reality T h e qu es t f o r t h e u n i q u e an d the limitations of the physical space led to the myth that everything humanities scholars need for their research exists in archives and museums, and in fact that there is a scarcity of primary sources if oneís research is outside ìmainstream histories. Scarcity though boils down to the findability \(and malleability\ of material, and findability is a direct result of the human limitations of reaching dispersed material and making sense out of them  IV  C HALLENGES OF  BIG DATA  HUMANITIES RESEARCH  In the face of ëbig data,í historians researching dispersed communities face a series of challenges A  A balancing act In their research, humanities scholars deal with dichotomous, multidimensional and multidirectional ëbig data.í Their scholarship must keep a fine balance that 1\pans borders and institutions, 2\ amalgamates existing LAM cultural heritage collections with ëbig dataí produced in social media platforms, and 3\ not prioritize online data over offlineî ones, or vice versa.  Data that span borders might refer to the same subject, but might not be homogeneous in terms of format, language, or unit. Their contextual background might exist in a previous, analog world. In fact offline and online data exist interwoven, ìmutually contextualizing,î and scholars cannot rely only on one or the otheróor if they do so, they have to justify their choice of one kind of data over the other reov er, qu an tif iable big  dataí are usually seen as more authoritative or accurate Scholars today have to keep in mind all of the above in order to give a balanced representation of the history of transnational communities B  The datafication of ëun-data Using the term ëdataí in humanities is an oxymoron Humanistic data are as un-data as they can get. For a start they are never raw. Humanities data are not generated by instruments, but by people in the process of going about their everyday life. They are data because we tell so. They are important because people imbue them with significance, and as such they are always value-laden, representative of the time and place they are created in. They empower, and at the same time they create silences [12 T h ey acqu i re s i g n i f i ca n c e in increments, and produce reality in four crucial moments: ìThe 34 


moment of fact creation \(the making of sources e moment of fact assembly \(the making of archives he moment of fact retrieval \(the making of narratives d the moment of retrospective significance \(the making of history in the final instance  If facts are factual because we tell so, then to what extent does the datafication process of our lives truly represent reality? In the online world, individuals can choose to interact with whomever and however they want through selective exposure to material consistent with their pre-existing attitudes an av oidin g th e m en ta l an d intellectual discomfortî that accompanies information that does not fit with what they think they know or believe in  If the creation of ëbig dataí in humanities is in itself a decidedly human process, then we need humanistic methods for their study, now more than ever. Humanities ëbig data cannot be understood simply as data, independent from the process of their datafication, i.e., the process of turning human lives into facts and narratives. If we think that ëbig dataí will solve all our problems in humanities scholarship, we run into the danger of a ìmorality-free engagement with a positivist understanding of human history  C  Recordness What constitutes a ërecordí in historical research today has dramatically changed in recent years. The dynamic and complex structures of communities and their cultural expressions warrant an ìexpandingî and ìexpandableî view of the record as including not only traditional documents, but also oral expressions, performances, monuments commemorations, community festivals, parades, and even mo u t ìm i n or n a rratives the untold stories, the traces the whispers and the expressions of marginalized identities might not always be deemed valuable and archivists are urged to ìembrace new ways of seeing and understanding records to ìrecognize and accept this evidence into the archivesî by extending traditional boundaries of recordne Previously historians relied on LAM holdings, particularly diaries, family letters, associational and congregational records, or newspapers, that today are increasingly replaced by born-digital material \(e.g., diaries by blogs, and letters by emails\nd while previously building cultural heritage collections was a systematic, but also to a great extent a serendipitous process, today the fragility of the digital medium exacerbates the serendipity of what will be remembered in the future What is a record today then? Are ëbig dataí corpora to be statistically mined for meaning or trends, or are they archives from where we can extract individual digital objects? New kinds of records require that scholars use new computational methods when dealing with them D  Violence Retrospectively, it is not surprising that humanities ëbig dataí are seen as an oxymoron. To date, we have done everything possible in order not to have ëbig dataí in humanities. Humans have systematically and selectively destroyed what they did not like or agree with based on their ideological, political, or religious beliefs. Human history is a continuum of random acts of violence that shape our cultural heritage 1  Catastrophic violence When it was not natural disasters \(such as fire, earthquakes, and floods\aging our cultural heritage, we did it ourselves either by the law or by the swordóin wars, ethnic cleansing, and civil strife. And while scientific ëbig dataí requiring computational manipulation in order to yield meaning remained relatively unperturbed, humanities ëbig dataí deemed ìdangerousî or corruptingî were obliterated  2  Archival violence We have also consistently appraised: through what Derrida has called ìarchival violence,î we have selected what would be preserved in archives \(thus, in perpetuity\ and what would disappear. We have also selected what would be taken out of the storage and exhibited in museum showcases, so as to tell our story. These were mostly done based on biases and values, and not on the needs of future users. Today, many LAM appraise Web resources for inclusion into their holdings with the aim of enhancing existing collections [17  b u t th is ap p r o ach ris k s to  perpetuate biases and skewed practices of the past  3  Cyber-Infrastructural violence As previously seen human lives become ëbig dataí through an intricate process of datafication. Today, transnational mobility is being carried out on physical, as well as virtual platforms facilitated by technology. Such powerful and complex knowledge-based systems shape and constitute the ways transnational populations produce and consume ëbig dataí in networks around the wo t t h e s a m e  ti m e W e b res o u r ces  are  unstable and scholars in the future will have to make do with material that is incomp te llect u a l coh e ren ce a n d  meaning significantly damaged from having been migrated from one hardware or software platform to anothe  V  SOME AFTERTHOUGHTS  The above challenges demonstrate that things that were always considered as given in humanities have profoundly changed: ërecordsí are not anymore what they have always been, and humanities are not really the serene and peaceful endeavor everyone thought it to be. Quite opposite, it is a charged and multidimensional process of interpretive dilemmas Recent scholarship critically examines ëbig dataí as a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon as  information ov as af f ecti ng ou r h i storical methodology r as in trodu cin g et h i cal dile mm as i n th e  way we interact with history Hum a nities  an d scien c es  have a lot to learn from each other, and such dialogue will enrich our understanding of the notion of ìhumanities ëbig dataí.î Sinceóas we hope this paper has rendered obvious humanities have always had ëbig data,í humanities scholars contribution in this dialogue can be enriching and constructive, even though in many Big Data debates they are usually sidelined by an existing ìarrogant undercurrentî [1    35 


What sciences can learn from historians working on transnational communities is that sometimes data spread all over the globe are too big to be interpreted or tamed even with hard,í computational methods. When confronted with such infinite un-data, one needs a certain humility in order to explore them "effectively, efficiently, and as comprehensively as possible ili t y  in f ron t o f data t h at are too big  is  one of the values that humanities scholars know well, because they have always been dealing with such data Conversely, humanities scholars have a lot to learn from scientists: Not in the ways they understand dataóas we previously saw, humanities data are foundationally different from scientific data. They are complex, imbued with multiple meanings, carrying layered identities, and open to interpretation. In fact, humanities must not seek to imitate sciences in order to become more ìscientificîówe have enough scientific data to deal with. Scholars working on transnational communities need to adopt scienceís exuberant approach to collaborating, sharing data and practices. They also need to learn to look more at the network level, rather than individual stories, and to interweave online data \(data that already are ëbig dataí\ into their scholarship. By redefining the methods of humanities scholarship, they find new ways of creating links among cultural heritage material. Through this process we begin to contextualize online community data through existing cultural heritage material, and conversely, we include cultural heritage material into contemporary discourses. If ëbig dataí can sometimes be ëtoo much information, then we need to involve scholars and communities of practice in a critical curation cy o r t h e  contextualization of such data Finally, humanities scholars need also to embrace and promote technologies that can help bring to light the ëbig data already inherent in humanities. Technologies that already information professionals are experimenting with, such as Linked Open Data and the Semantic Web, or research and applications stemming from Computer Sciences, such as machine learning and wikification, or new Internet architecture initiatives, such as the NDN project, may help to bring to surface entities and emphasize the links among them The next frontier in humanities scholarship is then to enhance the humanities cyber-infrastructure through novel ways of accessing and presenting humanities ëbig dataí to the users   R EFERENCES   1  d. boyd and K.

Architecture of CLAaaS 
       
and visualization models and execution of workflows Focus on user role, context and business aspects in providing customized GUI and services Expandable graphical view of high level compact workflows Minimum data movement Data security and privacy An AaaS should provide custom interfaces for different user groups or roles, which would typically include Have knowledge about analytical tools and methodologies, may or may not have knowledge about the data domain, e.g. st atistician/data mining experts Requires access to most of the functionality provided by CLAaaS including software tool definition/import workflow template design, scheduling, and execution visualization, and collaboration Know the data very well and understand the implications of the various data values usually guide the analyst and help to draw inferences from the results, e.g. medical doctors, meteorologists. Requires access to functionality such as pre-defined template-based simple workflow definition by data binding and execution collaboration, visualization and analytic requirement specification Have partial understanding of the data values and run pre-defined workflows as end users, e.g nurse practitioners Require access to functionality such as execution of simple workflows with new or updated data query analyzed results, visualization and collaboration Make secondary inferences to derive business values, and thereby, take administrative actions e.g. sales or staff administrator. Require access to functionality such as informat ion requirement specification query analyzed results of specific data, visualization and collaboration Make long term strategic planning based on corporate goals, and accordingly request for specific information or insights on various aspects, e.g. CEOs Require access to functionality such as information requirement specification which may call for predictive analytics or multi-source data analytics, query analyzed results of specific data, visualization and collaboration A user can have multiple roles and belong to multiple data domains. An AaaS should, therefore, show customized GUIs for different domains and user roles. The SLA will dictate the various user groups and the corresponding access policies of a registered service consumer, which will typically be an organization of multiple individuals. Once the SLA is signed, users belonging to the organization will individually register against the corporate SLA with their role and other personal information IV CLAaaS We propose CLAaaS, a cloud-based AaaS provisioning platform, which would address the shortcomings of the existing systems and include the required features as discussed in Section 3. Fig. 3 shows the conceptual architecture of CLAaaS. As for any cloud service, the internet traffic passes through firewalls and is directed and distributed via web proxy and load balancers. The main parts of CLAaaS are the set of front-end portals and the core computing platform hosting the back end components. The compute and storage clusters on the right hand side imply scalable cloud resources that are used by CLAaaS as needed We describe the components of CLAaaS below under three functional categories  and The modular architecture of CLAaaS allows specific components to be replicated for scalability or proximity to data Figure 3

Usability, customizability and SLAs are the key components of any service provisioning system. The comprises a set of web portals customized for different data domains and user groups, which provide rolebased controlled access to CLAaaS for user registration collaboration, data query and workflow design and execution. Therefore, they encompass all three functional categories. The rest of CLAaaS back end components on the core platform are described below The SLA Manager, Security Manager, User Manager, and Service Manager perform the service management tasks. The Service manager is responsible for the overall status and functionality of the system. It oversees the requests maintains session information and coordinates the functions of the different components by communicating with them as necessary. The SLA manager handles negotiation of SLAs for the different levels of services and user groups and monitors the compliance of the SLAs. The User manager helps in user registration, maintenance of user accounts, and the definition and authorization of user groups. Security of the system is ensured by the Security manager according to the pre-defined system access policies and those specified for the user groups The Data Manager, Workflow Manager, Deployment Manager Visualizaton Manager, Collaboration Manager Recommender, Provenance Manager, and the Cloud Resource Manager together constitute the workflow management system. The Workflow manager helps to create a new workflow or to modify existing workflows. The Deployment manager is responsible for the mapping of the workflow on cloud resources. It then executes workflows transparently using cloud resources provisioned by the Cloud Resource manager, and handles failures and recovery The Data manager helps users in managing, importing and linking data sources, and specifying data dictionaries metadata and ontology. Assistance for the design and deployment of workflows for different data domains is provided by the Recommender. The Provenance manager tracks the parameter values and steps during a workflow design process and monitors execution trails. This information is used by the Recommender to create recommendations and the Deployment manager to detect and recover from failures. Visualization manager helps users to design templates for viewing data and results of the analysis in a preferred format, which is particularly important for high resolution image data. Finally, the Collaboration manager allows offline messaging or live collaboration among members of predefined user groups The analytic and data processing software suite and the three data stores on CLAaaS are grouped under this category as they all perform data management or processing tasks. The software suite can consist of proprietary and custom data processing or query application software, including external data or software services. It can be further customized by the platform users as needed.  The three main data stores on the platform contain a Includes commonly used domain-specific analytic tools, links to services workflow templates, ontology, and data sources which are catalogued to facilitate query and re-use b Includes general system related data, metadata, list of cloud resources and concurrent users, pre-defined rules and policies, logs, and portals for the service operation c Includes personal data of the users registered under a corporate or individual SLA uploaded or linked data for analysis, analyzed data and visualization models, and analytic models and workflows Our initial implementation of CLAaaS platform will be in the Virtual Computing Lab \(VCL\oud environment   T h e analy tic s o f t w a re suite will primarily include SPSS, Cognos, InfoSphere BigInsights and InfoStreams from IBM [12  S P SS  is w i d e ly used in  p r e d ic tive an aly tics  and offers a rich set of statistical and data mining algorithms which are used to define analytic models. Cognos is the IBM business intelligence software an d offers rich collaboration and reporting features. InfoSphere BigInsights is built on the Hadoop framework and offers the power of parallel computation for big data and supports Apache data analytics tools [1 In f o S t r eam  en a b les p r o ces sin g of la rg e d at a streams [12 Tog e th e r  th ey pr ov i d e a ri ch  t o ols e t  f o r d a t a  analytics. We would also like to include popular open-source tools such as R [19  a nd W e ka  25] in the so ftw a r e suit e   We plan to adapt one of the open source scientific analytic workflow systems depending on its support for the necessary features and available example data and workflows as in myExperiment and B i o M art   2   T h e  a d a p t a ti o n  w ill be  necessary to support multi-tenant data management and scalable mapping of the workflows on the cloud virtual machines \(VM\ for execution is a commonly used technique in the cloud environment where multiple customers share a single software or hardware resource as tenants. It allows cost effective on-demand use of resources with some compromise in the design and implementati on effort, performance, and security. A provides simultaneous access to multiple users or te nants transparently through customized interfaces. A maintains data from multiple users in the same storage system for costeffective use of compute, memory, and storage resources Different approaches are used by both multi-tenant software and data stores to keep each user unaware of the existence of the other users, and to protect security and privacy of users data. For software, separate servers ensure maximum separation of usersê data but the most cost-effective approach applies multi-threaded approach o n a shared VM. However in the latter case the software must be designed to ensure separation of the data of different users. Otherwise, separate application servers can be used for the users on a shared VM or separate VMs can be used to run multiple instances of the application for different users. We will adopt the multiple

instance approach to multi-tenancy for the single user software tools For data store, maximum user data isolation is guaranteed by using separate physical storage servers for different users More cost effective solutions in the cloud apply one of the following approaches listed in the order of decreasing isolation of user data: a\ a single server hosting multiple VMs, each running a separate storage system for a user; b\ a server with a storage system hosting multiple databases, one for each user; c\ a server with a storage system containing a shared database where each user has a separate schema, and d\ a server with a storage system containing a database with a schema that is shared by multiple users, and the userspecific keys are used to identify the corresponding rows of data. We intend to apply the last one, shared database and shared schema, approach to multi-tenancy for the system and some user specific data such as user profile, user-specific software configurations, and syst em usage. For the user data that need to be analyzed, we plan to use the shared database and separate schema, or the separate database approach to multi-tenancy as applicable base d on the variations in data types CLAaaS will be accessible through the front-end services and web portals running on one or more VMs. We will configure a number of VM images with an interface to CLAaaS platform and likely combinations of the software To support specific level of users and running workflows the platform VM will configure and instantiate other VMs as necessary with the appropriate machine image [15  1 8   Analytics is used widely in todayês digital world. In the case of calamities or emergency situations, CLAaaS can be of particular help where users do not have to go through system setup and can immediately launch the required analytic platform on the cloud. For example, in the case of a sudden deadly attack at a national event,  analyzing the data about relevant factors such as the organizers, the guests collocated events, the venue, attack strategy, and used firearms can reveal important information about the possible suspects and their motivations. CLAaaS can be used to integrate and process data from multiple sources such as police, government sources, hospitals, news sources and the internet. Anonymization techniques n be app l i e d t o sensitive personal data if nece ssary prior to uploading it on the cloud, or CLAaaS can also be implemented on a private cloud. The integrated data can be made accessible to experts such as police chiefs and gove rnment intelligence. Analysts will use CLAaaS, define analytic models and workflows to discover further information with guidance from the experts and high officials.  Selected analyzed information can be published for the guest reporters and other concerned groups as needed. Analytic models providing the most effective information can be saved for re-use. For a data source containing sensitive data that cannot be uploaded on the cloud, external data services can be invoked by the workflow management system in CLAaaS to execute the requested analysis externally and retr ieve the results such as information about foreign citizens The experts, analysts, and executive officers can use CLAaaS collaboration tool to discuss the findings, request for further information and annotate important observations As new information about th e suspects are uncovered further analysis is called for to find probable accomplices which results in a multi-step workflow. The workflow template can be saved to analy ze similar data sources in the future. The high commanders can access CLAaaS to receive updates, communicate with specific groups, issue orders, or request for special reports On the service providerês en d, the investigating office can be the main customer to sign the SLA, which will ask its designated personnel to register with CLAaaS in different roles. CLAaaS will be configured with necessary big data analytic software such as BigInsights, collaboration and reporting software such as Cognos, and domain specific data such as police offices, city, and postal codes. Each registered user can then log in to carry out individual tasks in the designated roles, i.e., data analyst, domain expert, guest reporter, executive officer, and the high commander. After the job is done, the service can be unsubscribed but the analytic workflow templates an d other relevant data can be downloaded in a persistent storage for future use V C ONCLUSION  Analytics is crucial in providing insights on big data for efficient decision making. Analytic workflows compose the various data processing and analysis steps needed to extract values out of the data. Resear chers have developed multiple workflow systems [4  u r i ng the la st  d e c a d e w h ic h w e r e  initially geared towards specific data domains and had different design objectives. Several industrial    21   and open source   s olu tions exist as well. In this paper, we present a taxonomy to identify important features of analytic workflow systems, possible user groups, and propose CLAaaS, a cloud-based AaaS provisioning platform Researchers are already sharing some data and workflows on the cloud 17 W e int e nd t o l e ver a ge thi s  further by provisioning Analytics-as-a-Service on the cloud using CLAaaS platform infrastructure as shown in Fig. 3. It would a\ implement multi-tenancy for a wide range of analytic software tools and back end data sources; b\ provide SLAs and customized interfaces for different groups of users; c\ enable scalable data management and workflow execution for big data, and d\romote web collaboration Concerns for data privacy in the cloud  c a n be  ad dr e s s e d by implementing CLAaaS in a private cloud, applying security mechanisms [7   an d d i st ri bu te d en ac tm en t of  th e  workflows using 3 rd party services [4  C o nsi d er ing th e huge amount of data that exists on the web today, CLAaaS would lead the way with a scalable ubiquitous access to the power of analytics  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The research is supported by the IBM Canada Research and Development Center and the consortium of Southern Ontario Smart Cloud Innovation Platform \(SOSCIP

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Todayís cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlightís data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlightís hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlightís method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
