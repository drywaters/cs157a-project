Enhanced User Data Privacy with Pay-by-Data Model Chao Wu Department of Computing Imperial College London London, UK chao.wu@imperial.ac.uk Yike Guo Department of Computing Imperial College London London, UK y.guo@imperial.ac.uk   Abstract Personal data collection is becoming pervasive these days, these data has the risk of being abused by current application and application marketplace model, because only the price of application is explicitly indicated without clear agreement on usage of data, and the granularity of data access authentication is not enough to protect users privacy. In this short paper, we propose a new model of user data privacy Data usage of the application is explicitly shown, and controlled by an authentication service, to protect users from the abuse of their data, especia lly in mobile application Keywords-User data privacy, Pay by data; application marketplace; mobile privacy I   I NTRODUCTION  There emerged a large amount of applications, especially mobile applications, harnessing user-generated data, to deliver values to either users or organizations \(or both distribute these applications, a ll major platforms now provide their application marketplaces. Although such model has been proven to be easy for user to find and install application and helpful to prosper the a pplication development, there still exists some important issues including the one we are targeting in this paper: the risk that the application can collect the user data without letting users know. This problem comes from two aspects Firstly, applications are labeled with their price in money as either free or paid. Actually, lots of applications, which labeled ìfreeî, consume valuable user data, and even make profit from it. An shown in Figure 1, the applicationís behavior of collecting usersí data is not explicitly shown, and only could be found in the user agreement, which most users would not pay attention to. Secondly, even in some marketplace, the access of user data by the application is indicated, the granularity of data access authentication is not enough. For example, as shown in Figure 2, although it indicates the application would access the userís data like location, it doesnít state how much and how frequently it  d demonstrated that with over 4 location records, we can precisely identify a user. Such example shows that the amount of data matters, while collecting a couple of user location records cannot trace the user, collecting more data woul d cause a violation of user privacy. There is lack of authentication service to solve this problem. In popular authentica tion protocol like OAuth, only the scope and period of user data access are set   Figure 1  Mobile application in App Store    Figure 2  Data access control in Google Play Store  These two problems drive the work in this paper. We try to design a new pay-by-data model in which the usage of user-generated data are explicitly indicated, and the access to userís data is controlled by new authentication service which supports more detailed granularity  II  R ELATED WORK  As the user data collection becomes more pervasive, the privacy issue gets more attention recently.

among 825 examined apps for the iPhone and its operating system iOS, 21 percent forward the ID number, four percent the current location, and 0.5 percent even copy the address book. Last year, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Yelp and 14 other companies have been h it with a lawsuit accusing them of distributing privacy-invading m  nd people have heard lots of new about applications abusing users privacy. For example, in February 2012, Path, a mobile social networking service, was widely criticized for uploading contacts from iPhone us ers without permission and in February 2013, the company was fined $800,000 by the FTC for storing data from underage users and will be required to have its privacy policies assessed every two years for the next 20 years [7 Facing this issue, some research has been done on investigating and enhancing the privacy mechanism  surveyed the privacy issues in location-aware mobile devices   people's concern for location privacy and compared the  understand usersí attitudes and behaviors towards privacy as they interact with mobile applications, and to explore technologies that empower user s to more effectively and  investigated the privacy issue in mobile photo sharing proposed an anonymization model to ease the issue of  ssed the context for mobile privacy through an empirical study of mobile social networking  III  S YSTEM  In this section, we presented our design of pay-by-data model and its system implementation. The work has four different components: data coll ection service, data pricing agreement, authentication service, and interface to application and application marketplace. The overall architecture is shown in Figure 3, the data collection component provides an infrastr ucture where user can store and manage their data in a secure manner. User can view and control all their data, instead of distribute the data in various applications. The data pricing enables the agreement between application and user on how user-generated data would be consumed by the application. The application developer provides the data price while submitting the application to the marketplace When a user purchases the application, the data price is explicitly shown. Once the agreement is made, the access to the data is controlled by the authentication service; only serving data within the scope and amount in the data pric ing agreement. Interface to application and application marketplace provides a way for current application and marketplace to integrate with pay-bydata model.  We would now present these four components in detail  Figure 3  Architecture of Pay-by-data model  A  Data Collection Service The data collection service is built upon WikiSensing platform, a sensor data repository developed by us. Its design is suitable to store and manage user-generated data on a large-scale. The architecture of it is shown in Figure 4. For each type of user data, user registers a data source for it, and can send and retrieve the data in real time. These data are encrypted and secure accessed in WikiSensing. The storage layer is built upon based on mongoDB 1 cluster, and it has good performance on scalability. All the data are stored in mongoDB as Json documents without fixed schema. Such schema-less storage architecture decouples the storage layer from the data schema, enabling storage layer flexibility To support data management, the data collection component provides ontology suppor t, thus all the data are described by an ontology schema We adopted a hierarchical category for all the ontology in the system. So the users data could be categorized in namespace like ìlocationî, ìsocial networkî, etc. Such data structure offers the capability of ontology-based querying over the data, as well as the hierarchical granularity for data access Some other functions include the user management which can be integrated with OpenID service, Web interface for data management, etc  1 MongoDB: http://mongodb.org 54 


 Figure 4  Architecture of WikiSensing  The functionalities of data collection service are accessed through authenticated Web services. Figure 5 and 6 shows the Restful Web Service \(http and https data source and submit data to it  Figure 5 API to register user data source   Figure 6  API to submit data With this component, user can view and manage all their data sources and data in a centralized and secure manner Figure 7 shows the Web interface where user can get the visualized and geo-indexed data created by them  Figure 7  Visualization of user data  With such data collection and management service, the user-generated data are moved from multiple applications without user control, to a cent ric, independent and user fully controlled place. And we need to mention that, such data collection component is replaceabl e, users are able to choose any appropriate data storage services to achieve similar functions  B  Data Pricing Agreement We define a new type of price for applications, which is the data. As data is valuable for user and application, they could act as a kind of currency, that user pays they for utility gain from the application, as shown in Figure 8. For example in a crowdsourcing navigation application, users created traffic data is valuable for application to get the overall traffic level, and applicationís utility to smart navigation is desired for users. In such case, users can make agreement with the application, to buy the utility of navigation, by paying their travel data  Figure 8  From pay by money to pay by data  The price of data is defined as an agreement of data usage, with the elements listed in Table 1 55 


TABLE I  E LEMENT IN DATA PRICING AGREEMENT  Element Description app_id  The identification of application \(namespace of marketplace + application identification in the marketplace url The url that has the description of the application scope The set of scopes where the application consumes the user-generated data, each scope is defined by the data cate g or y in data collection service frequency The allowed frequency of data access for the a pp lication amount The maximum amount of data \(the number of data records valid_time The valid time for application to access the data operation The permitted operation on the data by the a pp lication, such as read, insert, and u p date  When an application is submitted to the application marketplace, the agreement of data usage is also submitted Here is an example of such agreement, in the format of Json  app_idî: ìios.1154431 urlî: ìhttp://wikisensing.org/client/appexample scope   frequencyî: 21600000 amountî: 10 valid_timeî: 684000000 operationî: ìread_only  This agreement indicates that an application from iOS apple store would read usersí lo cation data at most 4 times a day, within 10 days, and it can only get 10 location records totally. Such data agreement would be explicitly shown in the marketplace, as shown in the case study section If user agrees with it, he can confirm to purchase the application, and the agreement is sent to authentication service for access control  C  Authentication Service The authentication service acts as a gateway to control the application access to userís data in data collection service during the runtime The authentication service extends the specification of OAuth 2.0, with additional request parameters of elements including frequency and amount mentioned before. The authentication server is built with oauthlib 2  Figure 9 shows the interaction between user, application authentication service, and data collection service  2 oauthlib: https://github.com/idan/oauthlib Figure 9  Interaction for authentication  Figure 10 shows the sequential diagram for a data access by the application if the request is allowed by data pricing agreement  Figure 10  Sequential diagram for sucessful data access   Figure 11  Sequential diagram for illegal data access  When the access of data is out of data pricing agreement the data access would be blocked as shown in Figure 11 with error message sent to the application HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request Warning: 299 ServiceName "Data agreement error access is not allowed with associated data agreement  56 


D  Interface to Application and Marketplace We provided the interface for both application and marketplace to adopt the pay-by-data system, as shown in Figure 12 For application, the interfaces are provided as a set of Web services for the following functions   Getting the data through the authentication service   Getting the anonymized identification of user   Sending message to data collection service, if user doesnít have enough data required For marketplace, the interfaces provides following functionalities   Sending user notification about change of data pricing agreement, and asking user to accept or decline it   Getting userís available categories of data sources The application developer donít need to install new SDK to enable pay-by-data model but just change their methods like getting data to interacti ng with above Web services  Figure 12  Interface to application and marketplace  To facilitate the development of application based on these interfaces, we also provide an online workflow editor AppEditorî  which encapsula tes these interfaces as the workflow elements, as shown in Figure 13  Figure 13  AppEditor  For the application marketplace, more efforts are required to adopt pay-by-data model: it should provide a new interface for developers to submit their data pricing agreement, and a repository to store them. New user interface for users to view th e agreement, and purchase it are also required   IV  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we presented our work on enhancing data privacy for user in pervasive data collection era, by proposing a pay-by-data model and system, where the data price is explicitly shown and authentication has more detailed granularity. We showed the design and implementation of four core components in the system. We believe our work provides a new approach to protect users privacy, especially while for th e application from application marketplace R EFERENCES  1  Lane, Nicholas D., et al.

the corresponding sizes are 4 to 5 times larger and reach around 20 GB The training work is performed on a threelayer perceptron with the structure as 784-40-10 meaning 784 neurons in the input layer 40 neurons in the hidden layer and 10 neurons in the output layer 2 System Setup cNeural The client node and master node of cNeural both run on the master machine Each slave machine consists of 8 computing nodes and one storage node Each storage node is maintained by an RegionServer daemon in HBase Thus there are 288 computing nodes in total As each slave machine is conìgured 16 GB memory each computing node has 2 GB memory and it is enough for storing the training data subset in use MapReduce Approach The master machine acts as the JobTracker and NameNode And each of the rest 36 slaves both act as TaskTracker and DataNode Each machine is conìgured 8 slots There are also 288 slots in total and each slotês Child JVM is also conìgured 2 GB as each computing node in cNeural B Performance of Training Data Loading In this experiment cNeural is build up by 1 2 4 up to 36 machines respectively Its inner HBase consists of 36 region servers During data loading the computing nodes access HBase concurrently The experiment is performed on cNeural with different number of machines each with 8 computing nodes and different size of dataset The curves in Fig 5 shows the load time for the different sizes of training samples respectively The experiment with 2 million training samples on 1 machine failed to proceed due to insufìcient memory to load all training data Obviously as the size of input samples increases the time cost on training data loading increases too When the input sample size is xed the loading speed increases almost linearly with machine number This is because that the inner HBase provides concurrent data access and when new machines added in the system they takes a share of loading the training dataset However when the number of machines increases to some degree etc 20 in the case of test with 1 million training samples the performance of data loading can hardly be further improved This because the network transmission I/O blocking on storage nodes in HBase become bottlenecks To get valid results neural network training usually needs to run thousands of epochs And in cNeural the computing nodes only need to load data from HBase once Fig 6 illustrates the percentage of time cost on training data loading with varying training epochs The time cost on training data loading is xed Therefore the proportion of training data loading time decreases as training epochs increases With 36 machines when training epochs reach 200 the time cost in training data loading accounts only 0.3 of the total execution time The experimental results demonstrate that the time cost of data loading is very little in cNeural  0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 30 32 34 36 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80     Number of machines \(each has 8 cores Load time \(seconds       Load 0.5 million training samples   Load 1 million training samples Load 2 million training samples   Figure 5 Performance of training data loading with different number of machines on different size of training samples The experiment failed to load 2 million training samples with only one machine This is the case that the training work can not be processed on a single machine 1 5 10 20 50 100 200 500 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 Percentages of time cost Number of training epoches Data loading Training Figure 6 Percentages of time cost of data loading and training with different training epochs on 1 million training samples and 36 machines C Performance of Executing Training Process The performance of executing training process is in shown in Fig 7 We can see that with the same number of machines training 0.5 million samples is always about one time faster than training 1 million samples and three times faster than training 2 million samples This indicates that time cost of our parallel algorithm increases near linear with the number of input training samples On the other perspective if the size of training data is xed the training speed of cNeural is much improved when more machines are utilized For 1 million training samples when the numbers of machines are 2 4 8 16 32 the respective time costs of one training epoch are 18.3 seconds 9.2 seconds 4.7 seconds 2.4 seconds 1.3 seconds almost getting half of time cost decrease This shows that the training process of 382

overhead of job initialization in Hadoop is much larger than cNeural VIII C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK The past several years have witnessed an ever-increasing growth speed of data To address large scale neural network training problems in this paper we proposed a customized parallel computing platform called cNeural Different from many previous studies cNeural is designed and built on perspective of the whole architecture from the distributed storage system at the bottom level to the parallel computing framework and algorithm on the top level Experimental results show that cNeural is able to train neural networks over millions of samples and around 50 times faster than Hadoop with dozens of machines In the future we plan to develop and add more neural network algorithms such as deep belief networks into cNeural in order to make further support training large scale neural networks for various problems Finally with more technical work such as GUI done we would like to make it as a toolbox and open source it A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work is funded in part by China NSF Grants No 61223003 the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China 863 No 2011AA01A202 and the USA Intel Labs University Research Program R EFERENCES  C Bishop Neural networks for pattern recognition  Clarendon press Oxford 1995  J Collins Sailing on an ocean of 0s and 1s  Science  vol 327 no 5972 pp 1455Ö1456 2010  S Haykin Neural networks and learning machines  Englewood Cliffs NJ Prentice Hall 2009  R Hecht-Nielsen Theory of the backpropagation neural network in Proc Int Joint Conf on Neural Networks,IJCNN IEEE 1989 pp 593Ö605  Y  Loukas  Artiìcial neural netw orks in liquid chromatography Efìcient and improved quantitative structure-retention relationship models Journal of Chromatography A  vol 904 pp 119Ö129 2000  N Serbedzija Simulating artiìcial neural netw orks on parallel architectures Computer  vol 29 no 3 pp 56Ö63 1996  M Pethick M Liddle P  W erstein and Z Huang P arallelization of a backpropagation neural network on a cluster computer in Proc Int Conf on parallel and distributed computing and systems PDCS  2003  K Ganeshamoorthy and D Ranasinghe On the performance of parallel neural network implementations on distributed memory architectures in Proc Int Symp on Cluster Computing and the Grid CCGRID  IEEE 2008 pp 90Ö97  S Suresh S Omkar  and V  Mani P arallel implementation of back-propagation algorithm in networks of workstations IEEE Trans Parallel and Distributed Systems  vol 16 no 1 pp 24Ö34 2005  Z Liu H Li and G Miao Mapreduce-based backpropagation neural network over large scale mobile data in Proc Int Conf on Natural Computation ICNC  vol 4 IEEE 2010 pp 1726Ö1730  M Glesner and W  P  ochm  uller Neurocomputers an overview of neural networks in VLSI  CRC Press 1994  Y  Bo and W  Xun Research on the performance of grid computing for distributed neural networks International Journal of Computer Science and Netwrok Security  vol 6 no 4 pp 179Ö187 2006  C Chu S Kim Y  Lin Y  Y u  G  Bradski A Ng and K Olukotun Map-reduce for machine learning on multicore Advances in neural information processing systems  vol 19 pp 281Ö288 2007  U Seif fert  Artiìcial neural netw orks on massi v ely parallel computer hardware Neurocomputing  vol 57 pp 135Ö150 2004  D Calv ert and J Guan Distrib uted artiìcial neural netw ork architectures in Proc Int Symp on High Performance Computing Systems and Applications  IEEE 2005 pp 2Ö10  H Kharbanda and R Campbell F ast neural netw ork training on general purpose computers in Proc Int Conf on High Performance Computing HiPC  IEEE 2011  U Lotri  c and e a Dobnikar A Parallel implementations of feed-forward neural network using mpi and c on  net platform in Proc Int Conf on Adaptive and Natural Computing Algorithms  Coimbra 2005 pp 534Ö537  Q V  Le R Monga and M e a De vin Building high-le v e l features using large scale unsupervised learning in Proc Int Conf on Machine Learning ICML  ACM 2012 pp 2Ö16  J Ekanayak e and H e a Li T wister a runtime for iterati v e mapreduce in Proc of the 19th ACM International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing  ACM 2010 pp 810Ö818  Y  Bu B Ho we M Balazinska and M D Ernst Haloop Efìcient iterative data processing on large clusters Proc of the VLDB Endowment  vol 3 no 1-2 pp 285Ö296 2010  M Zaharia M Cho wdhury  T  Das A Da v e  J  Ma M McCauley M Franklin S Shenker and I Stoica Resilient distributed datasets A fault-tolerant abstraction for in-memory cluster computing in Proc USENIX Conf on Networked Systems Design and Implementation  USENIX Association 2012 pp 2Ö16 384
