A Novel Integrated Method for Human Multiplex Protein Subcellular Localization Prediction  Hong Gu School of Control Science and Engineering Dalian University of Technology Dalian, China guhong@dlut.edu.cn Junzhe Cao School of Control Science and Engineering Dalian University of Technology Dalian, China caojunzhe@gmail.com   Abstract Protein subcellular localization prediction based on machine learning is a research focus in bioinformatics. The fast growth of protein sequences in d atabases leads to be hard to label enough protein samples only by experts for training a learner to get satisfying prediction result. This paper proposes a novel integrated method for human multiplex protein subcellular localization prediction. In this method, to avoid artificially evaluating and labeling the big data of unseen proteins, an active sample selection algorithm is presented to pick out protein samples with non-experimental la bels as supplementary training data to help train an ensemble predictor, which includes a protein identifying module, a single-label classifier and a multilabel classifier. The numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach Keywordsóprotein subcellular localizaiton; big data  multiplex protein;  active learning;  transductive learning I   I NTRODUCTION  Knowledge of protein subcellular location is very significant for deducing protei n function, revealing disease pathogenesis, identifying drag target and so on. Comparing with traditional biology experime nts, prediction methods based on intelligent computation for pro tein subcellular localization are superior for significantly sa ving time h ere have been many computationa l methods to predict protein subcellular locations [2, a nd this kind of technique is m o re and more significant for this field. However, rapid growth of new protein sequences brings many new challenges. Especially the discovery of multiplex proteins which can be localized at more than one location is a sign that the study on protein subcellular localization has stepped into a new stage On challenge is big data. According to the record of UniprotKB \(release 2013_08 ere are 41991850 protein entries in this database, wh ere the number of data with reviewed subcellular location co mment is 322023 and the other 41669827 protein data are unlabeled. It is impossible to label such huge number of proteins merely via experiments or manual work, therefore, computational approaches are the best choices. Nevertheless, computational methods always need a large number of reliable lab eled data for training feasible classifiers, but the number of available labeled protein sequences in many tasks are not enough to learn a good classifier for pr F o r example, the virus benchmark  207 data. This proble m is m a inly caused by two reasons, one reason is existing methods only use the proteins labeled by experime nt, which is a small part of entire reviewed data; the other reason is most of collected data are abandoned for redundant or homologous reason. It needs more labeled protein samples to supply enough information for prediction, but if people evaluate all unseen samples in such a big dataset to select some data to label, it also costs too much Another challenge is, when a predicting algorithm learns sample information, singplex prot eins and multiplex proteins interfere with each other and it leads to be hard to get highaccuracy results for both two types of proteins. Conventional predicting methods always try to use the approaches based on multi-label learning to uni formly predict singplex and multiplex proteins. But the localizing mechanisms of the two types of proteins are very diffe rent, therefore, a single multilabel classifier is hard to get satisfying results on both of them Human proteins have the most complicated localization mechanism, and above mentioned two challenges also exist in human multiplex protein subc ellular localization prediction Hum-mP um 13] are two of the best  predictors for human proteins, but they also suffer from the two problems. In this paper, a novel integrated method is proposed for human multiplex protein subcellular localization prediction to deal with two above challenges. Instead of traditional proteins labeled by experiments we focus on another type of reviewed proteins which are labeled by non-experimental  Be different fr om uns een data without labels,  this kind of proteins have non-experime ntal labels which have high confidence level but a part of them may still have some inaccuracy. Therefore, we first propose an active sample selection algorithm to evaluate and select non-experimental proteins in a sample pool. The selected proteins are most valuable and added into origin al small training dataset to be new training data. They do not n eed to be labeled manually and their non-experimental labels are deemed to be real labels to be directly used for training. Based on the updated training dataset we then present an ensemble predictor composed of a protein identifying module, a single-label classifier and a multi-label classifier. When the predictor works, a query protein is first identified whether it is a multiplex protein. If the answer is yes the protein will be dealt with by the multi-label classifier otherwise, it is dealt with by the single-label classifier 58 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE 


II THE P ROPOSED METHOD The proposed method includes an active sample selection algorithm for updating training set and an ensemble predictor for multiplex protein subcellular localizatio n prediction. The ensemble predictor actually is a frame which is based on the preliminary identification for query protein and the identifying module is the key of this predictor,  and the types of singlelabel and multi-label classifier are not fix but adjustable according to practical problems. The work process of the integrated method is illustrated in Fig. 1 A Active Sample Selection Let 12 x,x  x l ln D represent the original training set consisting of l n protein samples classified in m different subcellular locations.

Let 1 t Num t T be the number of the samples in the tth interval, and the preferred proportion can be calculated as  1 2  11 1 arg min Gt i tT iGt t R Num  7 where 1 0  0,0 t j j Num t Gt t 8 B Protein Identification Algorithm This part we present the identification algorithm based on transductive learning tinguish singleplex protein and multiplex protein. Let t D be the testing set including t n query protein samples. Denote 12 x,x  x lt n DD D is the union of l D and t D where the first l n l nn proteins are labeled and the remaining proteins are unlabeled query proteins For convenience, suppose 1 2  l Ln is the index set for the labeled protein samples and 1 2  ll Un n n  for the unlabeled query samples, therefore we have  LU DDD  Let i Q denote the number of subcellular locations for a protein x i in D The values of i Q on L D can be directly fixed i.e  1 y y  iijij iji i Qyy y iL  and the i Q values on U D will be estimated for identifying the query proteins which is our goal We build a weighted neighborhood graph  GVEC to characterize the relation between similar proteins, which consists of a set of vertices V on D a subset edges E of VV and a nonnegative weight function 0,1 WE If a sample x i is among the k nearest neighbors of another sample x j we will have 0 Cij and say that there is an edge between x i and x j We define an nn weight matrix C to describe the similarity degrees among the whole protein samples  if  x x   0                   ,    otherwise ki ji XNX Sij N Sik Cij 9 where x  i N is the k nearest neighbor set of x i and 1 1 n j Cij for each sample x i   Sij is the similarity between x i and x j which is defined as 2 2 xx exp 2 ij Sij 10 Here is empirically learned by the average distance between protein samples Based on the smoothness assumption, we propose an optimization framework to deduce the optimal estimations of the location number for query proteins 1 2  xx min 0 1   y n ji iijj QQ iU N i ii QCQ Qi n st QiL   11 where is a slack variable 0 is fixed when y1 i and is a non-negative integer when y1 i  In order to simplify the optimization problem, we have 2 2 xx ji iijjU iU N QCQHQCQ  12 where 00 0 U U nn H I and  TT 12   nLU QQQ Q QQ  Thus, the optimization problem \(11\be rewritten as 1 2  min 0 1   y n U QQ i LL HICQ Qi n st Q  13 It is a quadratic programming and a global solution exists because the objective function and the constraints are all convex For convenience, let LL LU UL UU AA AIC AA  and ignore the constraint 0 i Q Thus, the Lagrange function for \(13 2 T 1 y 2 ULL FQ HAQ Q  14 where 0 The optimal condition for Q can be derived TT TT 0 0 L UL UL UL UU U UU UL UU UU Q AA AA F Q Q AA AA  15 Thus, we have 60 


T 0 UU UL L UU U AAQAQ 16 Here UU A can be guaranteed to be invertible for a connected graph. Considering the constraint  y LL Q we can get the optimal solutions of \(13 solving following linear equation 1 y UUUULL QAA 17 And then we can obtain the optimal solution i Q of each query protein sample x i and its number of the subcellular location is predicted as the closest integer to i Q If the value of i Q equals to 1, the query sample x i will be identified as a singleplex protein to be dealt with by a single-label classifier otherwise, it will be identified as a multiplex protein to be dealt with by a multi-label classifier. Our method does not fix the types of the two classifiers, which are adjustable and will be determined according to practical problems. The choosing and combining pattern of single-label and multi-label classifiers will not be discussed in this paper III EXPERIMENTS In this section, the performance of proposed method is evaluated on the human proteins data by independent test. The human benchm is adopted as the original training dataset, which includes 3106 human protein sequences and 14 different subcellular location classifications 1213 human non-experimental proteins are collected from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database by us to constitute the supplementary training sample pool. 321 new proteins labeled by experiments construct a testing dataset. In order to reduce the redundancy and avoid homology bias, none of the proteins in the entire three datasets has 25% sequence similarity to any other. Table I show the general information of each dataset TABLE I G ENERAL INFORMATION OF EACH DATA SET Datasets Number Singleplex Protein Multiplex Protein Total Orignial training set 2580 526 3106 Non-experimental protein data pool 921 292 1213 Testing dataset 192 129 321 The concerned 14 subcellular locations are as follows: centriole cytoplasm cytoskeleton endoplasmic reticulum endosome extracell golgi apparatus lysosome microsome mitochondrion nucleus peroxisome, plasma membrane, and synapse In the numerical experiments, the amphiphilic pseudo amino acid com is adopted as the feature  extraction technique to represent protein sequences. The protein sequences can be formulated with a valid mathematical expression by this method through a public online server named PseAAC at: http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/PseAA In our experiments, amino acid characters are empirically chosen to be hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity and mass; weight factor is 0.4 and lambda parameter is 5. We employ the popular  ork  as the m u ltilabel classifier and combine it with a classic KNN single-label classifier for each prediction task, where the ML-RBF classifier is trained on the whole training set and the KNN classifier is trained by all the singleplex protein samples. The parameters of ML-RBF are assigned the same values as the original paper the value, and the number of nearest neighbor is 10 k The slack variable in our method is 2 for multiplex proteins, and all the parameters in the experiments are fixed Learned by the same training sets, we compare our algorithm with Hum-mPLoc 2 n d iLoc-Hum 13 which are two popular web-server predictors for the subcellular localization prediction of human multiplex proteins. Besides since the ML-RBF classifier is incorporated into our integrated method for the prediction task, we observe the prediction result of using this algorithm alone for comparison too. We also test the performance of our ensemble predictor without the active sample selection, which includes two cases using no nonexperimental proteins and directly using all the nonexperimental proteins in the supplementary training sample pool. 3 global indices: accuracy, MCC, F1-sore, and 4 popular multi-label indices: average precision, ranking loss, coverage and one-error are employed as evaluation metrics The comparison result is as shown in Table II, and the preferred proportion of non-expe rimental samples selected is 40 It can be seen our method achieves the best results in all the 7 evaluation metrics. The superior performance to ML-RBF classifier means the proposed method can sufficiently utilizes the individual strengths and abilities of single-label and multi-label classifiers and indeed gets the improvement for an individual multi-label algorithm of multiplex protein subcellular localization prediction. Here, we just select and integrate two common classifiers, and the proposed ensemble predictor has achieved better prediction result than existing two best human predictors. If more suitable classifiers replace the two classifiers  used in the experiment, our method will become more powerful. Moreover, the better performance of our method than the same ensemble predictor with no nonexperimental proteins indicates this kind of proteins indeed can help to retrain and improve basic classifier, and the better prediction result than the ensemble predictor directly using all non-experimental proteins means not all the non-experimental proteins are proper to update classifier and we should use this kind of proteins selectively. Therefore, the active sample selection is indeed useful and necessary for human multiplex proteins subcellular localization prediction A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by a Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education \(Grant No 20120041110008 National Science and Technology MegaProject Program of China \(Gra nt No. 2011ZX09101-008-09 National Natural Science Foundation of China \(Grant No 61174027\National Science an d Technology Mega-Project Program of China \(Grant No 2010ZX04007-0115\; Program for Liaoning Excellent Talents in University \(Grant No LJQ2012005\ Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education \(G rant No. 20120 041110008 61

In Re ynolds suggests that the data source selection process should be selective in terms of the data needed Given the scale of the data handled by the knowledge cubes architecture the proposed suggestion by Reynolds aligns with knowledge cubes Reynolds suggests two types of vocabularies to express the data 1 Link vocabulary to provide a common representation for links and 2 Imprecise value vocabulary to provide a common representation for common vocabulary Given the knowledge cubes architecture the vocabulary proposal by Reynolds can be a viable solution where each cube includes its own vocabulary However we need to allow for cross-talk e.g by maintaining relations among existing vocabulary terms from the various vocabularies and providing enough provisioning in order for the relations to still hold The spatial and temporal dimensions of the knowledge cube data form a rich facility in solving some uncertainty challenges For example we can disambiguate two named entities if both belong to the same spatial location or time slot C Challenge 3 Data Partitioning Scheme Deìning an efìcient scheme for partitioning depends on the semantics of the data For example speciìc snapshots of the data may mandate that the data be partitioned according to the named entities contained in the data Another scheme might see that partitioning based on people who are politicians or soccer players might generate a good scheme More sophisticated schemes might involve both entities and relations or a combination of both An important aspect to consider is how big the data is given each scheme and whether there is a form of overlapping among the generated partitions We believe that the data is the main driver of the partitioning scheme Employing some form of data analysis over the acquired data may reveal interesting properties that can aid in deìning efìcient partitioning schemes For example semantic relationships can be learned in an unsupervised fashion from the search queries and their results This means that the statistics gathered based on user queries can be an asset that aids in identifying an efìcient partitioning scheme In turn this requires that the system starts with an initial scheme that can evolve over time based on gathered statistics D Challenge 4 Storage and Indexing The database and semantic web communities have a number of solutions for storing and querying Linked Data ranging from centralized to distributed data stores W e describe four main categories that have been adopted by both communities and discuss the challenges associated with each of them The rst category called Triplestores stores RDF triples in a single relational table The attributes speciìed are either triples subject predicate object or quadruples subject predicate object context Even though disk space for Triplestores is not a major concern in terms of size a real concern is in maintaining a reasonable RAM and database ratio which is exempliìed in the case of Big Data scale The second category is vertically-partitioned tables where systems maintain a table per property as many triple patterns have xed properties One variation is to use a column store that captures the column entries of the same type The objective is to avoid reading an entire row into memory in the event that only a few attributes are accessed per query This approach has scalability problems when the number of properties in an RDF is high 23 The study in 22 23 suggests that Triplestores outperform the vertically-partitioned approach when having a larger number of properties The third category is schema-speciìc systems that capture subjects with overlapping properties These systems have a query processing advantage as the subjects may be accessed together In  Le v andoski and Mokbel claim that property tables can outperform Triplestores and vertically-partitioned tables for RDF data One concern is the storage overhead because subjects may contain multiple objects The second and third categories also raise an important concern regarding the increased cost of integration quality An open question is Which of the three categories is best suited for embodying the semantic aspects proposed by the knowledge cubes architecture One proposed direction is to adopt all three categories and apply the most optimum based on the current semantics of the data This step occurs as the knowledge cube evolves over time Deìning a suitable index over the data is also a crucial challenge An index may need to include spatial temporal relational or textual aspects An advantage of knowledge cubes is that the index would be deìned over well-structured information with rich semantics In turn this aids in deìning a more meaningful indexing structure The structural integrity of the index would also affect the query processing performance E Challenge 5 Communication among Cubes There are many forms of communication in knowledge cubes One is when a cube needs to know further information about a query that it is processing Another is when a cube needs to be updated about what other cubes have Deìning an efìcient communication protocol that considers the overhead of contacting and retrieving content from other knowledge cubes is vital Knowledge cubes may co-exist on the same machine i.e embedded communication or on separate machines i.e stand-alone A knowledge cube should be intelligent enough to decide when to cache content that it usually retrieves from other knowledge cubes In turn this should signiìcantly decrease the communication overhead Adaptive Replacement Cache ARC is one candidate algorithm that can be used to keep track of frequently used and recently used data It can also be used to maintain historical data regarding eviction for both scenarios A challenge would be to see if the algorithm will adapt to both data and structural evolution of the knowledge cube F Challenge 6 Spatial and Temporal Extraction Published articles or web pages will need to be segmented into individual units of information termed statements For each statement we need to identify the topic of the statement 


the subject the person the event the time interval or the location that this statement is about who authored the sentence where and when this statement is made and whether that statement is extracted from some other internet source etc For example in the time dimension we need to capture two notions of time for a given statement 1 when that statement is published or written i.e its transaction time and 2 when the facts in the statement took place i.e its valid time The same applies for the space dimension Two space dimensions need to be extracted 1 the physical location of the person who published the statement i.e the statementês transaction location and 2 the location where the facts in the statement took place i.e its valid location The same is true for the person who wrote the statement and the person that the statement states facts about etc G Challenge 7 Data Change Frequency It is important to identify when a knowledge cube updates its Linked Data Linked Data is very dynamic in nature where its resources are added removed or updated very frequently especially in the Web of Data Therefore it is important to investigate measures of freshness for the content and interlinked resources For example the Linked Data of the cube may indicate certain properties for triples that might conîict with others that are later retrieved as new data Identifying these conîicts and creating policies of how to handle them is a crucial issue Adding provenance can be one solution to this issue However it raises another question of what version of the data to present as an answer to the query A study by Umbrich et al identiìes the characteristics of change over Linked Data and compares the change frequency in the Web of Data versus the traditional Web HTML documents  VII C ONCLUSION We present a vision for the knowledge cube architecture that motivates understanding the semantics of the data as a means for solving some of the research challenges we face today speciìcally in Big Data We motivate the use of Linked Data as a mean for achieving this target given the rich semantics that Linked Data provides We present a strawman design that sketches the possible components of a knowledge cubes system Each presented component conveys a high-level overview about its potential usage scenarios We illustrate some of the challenges and potential solutions associated with the knowledge cubes proposal Finally we demonstrate how the proposed architectural components can be used to tackle the ve pillars of Big Data A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was

   9 extreme radiation environment could induce faults i n these components that can only be cleared by the removal and reapplication of power termed off-pulsing The FM S implements an off-pulsing architecture that provide s offpulsing capabilities to clear faults in the transce iver IEM and PDU. Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earthís orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraftís orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the missionís product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
