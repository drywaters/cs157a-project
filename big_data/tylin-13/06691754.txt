In particular, fetal growth curves built by means of ultrasound images and reference charts \(defining the normal and pathological sizes for each biometric parameter and for each gestational age\ted to track fetal sizes from the early phases of pregnancy up to delivery. In literature a large variety of reference charts are reported to consider the differences among different ethnic groups, but they are up to five decades old and they do not consider environmental factors such as f oods, lifestyle, smoke, familial aspects, physiological and pathological variables, temporal parameters etc., which cannot be disregarded in a correct diagnosis. Therefore, current reference charts are rapidly becoming inadequate to support the melting pot of ethnic groups and lifestyles of our society, while customized reference charts can provide an accurate fetal assessment for the different fetal anthropometrical variables. Starting from a detailed analysis of the limits of classical reference charts, the paper presents a new method, based on multidimensional analysis for creating personalized fetal growth curv es. A simple implementation based on Open Source software and simulated data, shows the need of Big Data techniques in order to scale up the problem KeywordsóCloud computing fetal growth; personalized diagnosis; multidimensional analysis I   I NTRODUCTION AND B ACKGROUND  In obstetrics and gynecology, data coming for medical tests are often used for diagnostic and documentation purposes, opening the stage for a systematic data analysis to improve patient care and to develop new health-assessment techniques For example, throughout pregnancy ultrasound scans of the maternal abdomen are routinel y used to track fetal growth and to assess fetal health. This is pursued by collecting fetal parameters such as Bipariet al Diameter \(BPD Circumference \(HC\inal Circumference \(AC Length \(FL\p Length \(CRL whether growth parameters lay within normal ranges measured values are compared to statistical data \(i.e. reference charts with fetal growth curv es, showing average values of such parameters as a function of the gestational age Abnormal fetal growth parameters often are indicators of potential fetal pathologies The im Usher and Mc  five decade ago is supported by a huge amount of scientific literature and by the clinical ev idence, but the same literature clearly shows its main constraints   the number of patients considered in the studies \(some thousandth newborn per year \(about 140 ML in 2012\orld   the patients considered in the studies are not representative of the variety of anthropometrical factors related to ethnicity, to familial aspects a nd to other relevant internal and external factors   the commonly used growth curves are up to five decades years old, they are not updated for the current population and they are not suitable to investigate temporal trends and dynamic aspects in fetal growth curves Indeed, fetal growth is influenced by a variety of factors racial, social and economic among others, as well as specific medic conditions that may preexist or that may develop during pregnancy. Hence, it s not surprising that fetal biometric parameters show a de gree of variation from country to country and from area to area within the same country Beyond ethnicity, others factors affect fetal growth including fetus gender, physiological and pathological variables maternal height and weight, dr ug or tobacco exposure, genetic syndromes, congenital anomalie s and placental failure 15], [16], [20 Some authors addressed th ese problems providing an increasing number of fetal growth charts for specific groups and subgroups of population, but their studies suffer from a considerable methodological heterogeneity making them difficult to extend them on the large scale  adjust growth curves for most of the influential factors and introduced the idea of individualized fetal growth charts according to specific maternal and fetal characteristics. After about 20 years the interesting proposal, based on proprietary software and on a centralized application, did not produce results documented in th e scientific literature From a theoretical point of view the creation of personalized reference charts fo r fetal growth curves can be formulated as a multidimensional analysis problem on the biometric dataset, routinely co llected by doctors for fetal health assessment during pregnancy.

maternal sizes, familial aspects etc.\pacting the fetal growth can be modeled as cubes dimensions and each homogeneous group of patients \(with respect to a given set of dimensions mentioned biometric dataset. In the multidimensional analysis the requirement of personalized chart can be also expressed in the form which is the normal range associated to the X biometric parameter of a Y-weeks old fetus belonging to the subcube defined by the Z dimensional parameters  An important constraint, in order to design a system able to dynamically answer to these questions, comes from the problem size, which is a functi on of the number of newborns per year. In this case, considering the storage space needed for the biometric dataset and for the other related data \(order of magnitude of some PB ributed nature of the system and the number of operations per newborn \(order of magnitude of millions or more\e will demonstrate that Big Data techniques  must be adopted to satisfy its requirements The paper is organized as follows: after the presentation of the background and of the problem \(Section II and III will show how a conventional open source data warehouse DW\ system can be effec tively used to compute the personalized fetal growth curves \(Section IV\e will show why DW systems are insufficient to effectively manage the whole dataset needed to supply the ìPersonalized Fetal Growth Curvesî service on global scale, and how the problem can be overcome using Big Data techniques \(Section V Section VI is for conclusions and future works II  B ACKGROUND   Mc  decades ago, fetal growth asse ssment is a well established and mature research field in obstetrics and gynecology  5], [6 The proliferation of studi es on specific subgroups of patients \([23], [24], [25], [26], [27 of an ever increasing number of reference charts was characterized by a considerable methodological heterogeneity making difficult to normalize them and generally reuse for diagnostic purposes. As a consequence in clinical practice generic reference charts are preferred to specific ones, or to more complex approaches based on suitable mathematic m To preserve the simplicity of the approach without loss of diagnostic power, some authors proposed the adoption of purposely developed software tools \(Web Applications Mobile Application, Ö\ to cr eate customized growth charts    odel fitted to a very large group of newborns.

This kind of fetuses will be referred, in the following of the paper, as Homogeneous Fetal Groups \(HFG  a fetus with growth parameters different from those of its HFG is potentially pathologic  Figure 1: Fetal-Infant Growth Chart as presented by Fenton TR in Pediatrics, 2003 Dec 16; 3\(1  Monitoring is performed by measuring the length or the circumference of specific parts of the fetal skeleton \(the above cited BPD, HC, AC, FL and CRL trans-abdominal ultrasound pictures \(Figure 1 purposes of this paper, for each given HFG at each gestational age \(in weeks\ to find a given length can be approximated by a Gaussian distri bution. This is justified by the natural anthropometric variability we can observe in normal fetuses and by the errors associated to the measurement procedure For diagnostic purposes we assume that fetuses are healthy if their sizes are between the 10th and the 90th percentile of the cumulative distribution func tion. They are pathologic if their sizes are out of the interval 3rd ñ 97th., otherwise they are borderline  Figure 2: Gaussian curve generated with 100 samples, given a predefined parameter \(head circumference gestational age The Gaussian curves are effective for diagnosis purposes if their variance is small and the Gaussian bell is strict around the average. It is evident that if the sample for calculating the curve is small it is not repres entative of the whole population while if they sample is too large it can present considerable anthropometric variability, which will be represented with a wide variance, and the corresponding Gaussian curve will be little effective for diagnostic purposes Therefore the right statistic sample with the smallest possible variance is the HGF we can obtain with the largest sample of patients. Moreover, itís easy to see that all HGFs can be dynamically extracted from the whole dataset by means of multidimensional queries where fetal sizes are the measures  h ile the dim e nsions are the param e ters \(ethnicity maternal weight and height familial aspects, foods etc impacting the fetal growth   Figure 3: Dimensional fact model of an ultrasound monitoring visit As shown in Figure 3, in collaboration with a research group on obstetrics and gynecology we identified 9 main dimensions of analysis and 6 m easures for the biometric fetal sizes.

arrive from the hospitals or fr om the patients \(20 ML per year about 2 every 3 seconds eans that this problem largely exceeds the computation capabilities of a classic multidimensional analysis system, such as the one included in the Pentaho suite. In order to produce updated HFG in a reasonable time, specific technique s must be investigated. For example Pentaho community has developed a specific project for high-performance, scalab le and distributed memory clustering cache, called Community Distributed Cache \(CDC The project allows to clear the cache of only specific Mondrian cubes. This feature allows to update each single HFG without impacting on the ot her cubes. Another approach can explore advanced clustering techniques for multidimensional datasets based on MapReduce Framework  the be very effective to solve the problem at a reasonable price by means of Big Data techniques running on cloud infrastructure IV  D ATA LAYER DESIGN  For the purposes of this paper, fetal biometric data and maternal data are created by means of a simulator, but in a real scenario, for a fully functional system, we should consider that medical data comes from a number of heterogeneous sources hospitals, EHR repositories, patients etc channels \(web services, web app lications, mobile applications etc.\at \(H L7 or proprietary formats  Figure 4: Data model of Data4GO This aspect brings to design a data layer made up of a distributed data architecture \(F igure 4 integrates transactional data coming from the sources and normalized against a shared reference model \(DB4GO DataBase for Gynecology and Ob stetrics DB4GO is transformed in the DW4GO, which is the repository for the multidimensional datamarts of HFG  A  The DB4GO layer For modeling the maternal and fetal data we started from the HL7 Reference Information M Universal Data M point in healthcare. Moreover, we analyzed the HL7 Common Data Model based on the Data Model Harmonization Process for the integration phase Two fragments of the adopted model, used to prepare data for the multidimensional analysis phase, are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6. The fragment in Figure 5 represents a model more suitable for the initial phase in which doctors collect all the data by means of anamnesis interviews. The fragment in Figure 6 represents a part of the Entity-Relationship diagram used for the multidimensional analysis phase  Figure 5: A fragment of the ER patient-oriented diagram  Figure 6: A fragment of the ER report-oriented diagram   B  DB4GO data partitioning The partitioning is due to the fact that each country is regulated by specific laws on health data management privacy, security, accountability etc.\ the granularity of data sources cannot be greater than that of the countries involved in the experiment. In general we can expect e much lower granularity, from the hospital size to the single user \(via web application or mobile\oreover, in several countries data protection laws require knowledge of where data are stored. For example this limits the adoption of the cloud in countries like Spain France or Italy until cloud providers allowed obligatory data storage in a specific geographic location [12 This aspect is important because, for further developments we can imagine to exploit the distributed query capabilities typical of several modern clouds to index the ultrasound images and the other data and metadata produced for the fetal growth test and to retrieve it according to specific criteria  DB4GO 1 DB4GO p DW4GO HFG DB 3 Data2 Data3 Data1 Data n DB4GO 2 Data2 Data1 Data m DB4GO 3 Data2 Data1 Data 3 Data 4 Data n HFG DB 4 HFG DB 4 HFG DB 1 HFG DB 5 HFG DB 2 Staging area Sources Multidimensionalized datamarts 26 


This has the potential to improve the diagnostic process included in the fetal growth te st and to support the inductive statistic approach which is typical of Big Data research C  Problem  size Each year 140 millions of newborn come to the World \(4.4 from US and 5.5 from Europe Considering a Fetal Growth Tracking \(FGT\ 50% of newborns from Europe and US, a record size of 10 KB for each pregnant woman plus 2 KB for each fetus and a running window of 6 year to track mother s with 2 or more children, the global storage space sum up to about 360 GB of online multidimensional data \(and about 1.5 PB including also ultrasound images From the computational point of view, to generate the custom growth charts, the FG T system should run about 20 millions \(5 millions pregnant women x 4 tests multidimensional queries per year, i.e. about 2 queries each 3 seconds, which largely exceed the capabilities of a standard business intelligence suite \(normally adopted for multidimensional analysis Existing Big Data solutions focus on addressing the Volume aspect of the 3-Vís of  technologies including distributed databases [30], Hadoop [31   scalable data storage and on-demand querying over large volumes of data. These systems usually provide high read performance for data that has been persisted and properly indexed V  T EST A RCHITECTURE  To have a first indication about the resources consumed by the FGT service and about how they scale with the problem size we created two dataset representative of the Italian demographic population \(60 m illion inhabitants, 21 main ethnic groups ts, including respectively 100.000 and 1.000.000 records, we re produced by using the inverse Gaussian distribution f unction, generating respectively 500 and 5.000 Homogeneous Fetal Groups The 2 dataset were loaded on a Pentium 5 machine running at 2.5 GHz with 8 GB of RAM and 2 TB of storage space SATA Disks Community Edition, running 500 random queries to generate 500 different Personalized Fetal Growth Charts. The average elapsed times are shown in Fig 3. They clearly demonstrate that even with a small fraction about 3 processed in the fully working system, a single machine is far from satisfying the temporal constraints of processing 2 queries each 3 seconds defined in the previous section As a second option we considered a recent evolution of the commercial version of Pentaho, called ìPentaho Business Analytics for Big Dataî, which interfaces with Hadoop and other NoSQL and Analytic databases, permitting to create MapReduce functions and to visualize the results in Pentaho  Figure 7: Processing time with respect to the patientsínumber The detailed comparison between the results are shown in Figure 7 and they show a significant performance improvement, sufficient to m eet the previously defined temporal constraint at a reasonable price Two more options are under evaluations  the adoption of a different processing strategy, based on the clustering of multidimensional dataset with Hadoop as described in [28  the adoption of tensor-based computation, which is a very effective way to manage multidimensional datasets on distributed and parallel machines VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORKS  The fetal growth assessment is a relevant problem since it concerns about 140 ML of newborns per year. Due to the population and ìethnicity reshufflementî, itís by nature a global phenomena which can benefit from the adoption of Big data techniques and cloud infrastructures. The goal is to obtain personalized Fetal Growth Curvesí computation within a about 360 GB of multidimensional data In order to have some pr eliminary figures about the resources consumed by FGT serv ice we performed 2 different experiment based on Pentaho and Hadoop The first results show that the problem can be solved at a reasonable cost and in an acceptable time. More promising results came from the adoption of 2 advanced approaches based parallel clustering algorithm and on tensor-based computation In the future we plan to deeper explore these solutions comparing them with the Pentaho-Hadoop approach R EFERENCES  1  Babson S.G., Benda G.I.

C A Use Case Scenario 
 
instance approach to multi-tenancy for the single user software tools For data store, maximum user data isolation is guaranteed by using separate physical storage servers for different users More cost effective solutions in the cloud apply one of the following approaches listed in the order of decreasing isolation of user data: a\ a single server hosting multiple VMs, each running a separate storage system for a user; b\ a server with a storage system hosting multiple databases, one for each user; c\ a server with a storage system containing a shared database where each user has a separate schema, and d\ a server with a storage system containing a database with a schema that is shared by multiple users, and the userspecific keys are used to identify the corresponding rows of data. We intend to apply the last one, shared database and shared schema, approach to multi-tenancy for the system and some user specific data such as user profile, user-specific software configurations, and syst em usage. For the user data that need to be analyzed, we plan to use the shared database and separate schema, or the separate database approach to multi-tenancy as applicable base d on the variations in data types CLAaaS will be accessible through the front-end services and web portals running on one or more VMs. We will configure a number of VM images with an interface to CLAaaS platform and likely combinations of the software To support specific level of users and running workflows the platform VM will configure and instantiate other VMs as necessary with the appropriate machine image [15  1 8   Analytics is used widely in todayês digital world. In the case of calamities or emergency situations, CLAaaS can be of particular help where users do not have to go through system setup and can immediately launch the required analytic platform on the cloud. For example, in the case of a sudden deadly attack at a national event,  analyzing the data about relevant factors such as the organizers, the guests collocated events, the venue, attack strategy, and used firearms can reveal important information about the possible suspects and their motivations. CLAaaS can be used to integrate and process data from multiple sources such as police, government sources, hospitals, news sources and the internet. Anonymization techniques n be app l i e d t o sensitive personal data if nece ssary prior to uploading it on the cloud, or CLAaaS can also be implemented on a private cloud. The integrated data can be made accessible to experts such as police chiefs and gove rnment intelligence. Analysts will use CLAaaS, define analytic models and workflows to discover further information with guidance from the experts and high officials.  Selected analyzed information can be published for the guest reporters and other concerned groups as needed. Analytic models providing the most effective information can be saved for re-use. For a data source containing sensitive data that cannot be uploaded on the cloud, external data services can be invoked by the workflow management system in CLAaaS to execute the requested analysis externally and retr ieve the results such as information about foreign citizens The experts, analysts, and executive officers can use CLAaaS collaboration tool to discuss the findings, request for further information and annotate important observations As new information about th e suspects are uncovered further analysis is called for to find probable accomplices which results in a multi-step workflow. The workflow template can be saved to analy ze similar data sources in the future. The high commanders can access CLAaaS to receive updates, communicate with specific groups, issue orders, or request for special reports On the service providerês en d, the investigating office can be the main customer to sign the SLA, which will ask its designated personnel to register with CLAaaS in different roles. CLAaaS will be configured with necessary big data analytic software such as BigInsights, collaboration and reporting software such as Cognos, and domain specific data such as police offices, city, and postal codes. Each registered user can then log in to carry out individual tasks in the designated roles, i.e., data analyst, domain expert, guest reporter, executive officer, and the high commander. After the job is done, the service can be unsubscribed but the analytic workflow templates an d other relevant data can be downloaded in a persistent storage for future use V C ONCLUSION  Analytics is crucial in providing insights on big data for efficient decision making. Analytic workflows compose the various data processing and analysis steps needed to extract values out of the data. Resear chers have developed multiple workflow systems [4  u r i ng the la st  d e c a d e w h ic h w e r e  initially geared towards specific data domains and had different design objectives. Several industrial    21   and open source   s olu tions exist as well. In this paper, we present a taxonomy to identify important features of analytic workflow systems, possible user groups, and propose CLAaaS, a cloud-based AaaS provisioning platform Researchers are already sharing some data and workflows on the cloud 17 W e int e nd t o l e ver a ge thi s  further by provisioning Analytics-as-a-Service on the cloud using CLAaaS platform infrastructure as shown in Fig. 3. It would a\ implement multi-tenancy for a wide range of analytic software tools and back end data sources; b\ provide SLAs and customized interfaces for different groups of users; c\ enable scalable data management and workflow execution for big data, and d\romote web collaboration Concerns for data privacy in the cloud  c a n be  ad dr e s s e d by implementing CLAaaS in a private cloud, applying security mechanisms [7   an d d i st ri bu te d en ac tm en t of  th e  workflows using 3 rd party services [4  C o nsi d er ing th e huge amount of data that exists on the web today, CLAaaS would lead the way with a scalable ubiquitous access to the power of analytics  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The research is supported by the IBM Canada Research and Development Center and the consortium of Southern Ontario Smart Cloud Innovation Platform \(SOSCIP

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Todayís cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlightís data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlightís hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlightís method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
