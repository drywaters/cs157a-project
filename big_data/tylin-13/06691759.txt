BIG DATA Infrastructures for Pharmaceutical Research Christian Seebode, Matthias Ort ORTEC medical ORTEC medical GmbH Berlin, Germany seebode,ort}@ortec.org Christian Regenbrecht, Martin Peuker Charit  Universit‰tsmedizin Berlin Charit  Universit‰tsmedizin Berlin Berlin, Germany christian.regenbrecht,martin.peuker}@charite.de Abstract  Big Data is an emerging paradigm covering production, collection, processing, analysis, access and presentation of huge data-sets: Big Data infrastructures represent an opportunity to approach this paradigm on an organizational level. We describe challenges and opportunities of big data infrastructures for the pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical research and product development are huge investments and require intense exploration and analysis of data. Future trends show that pharmaceutical companies need to develop new methods of data and information processing to quicker and more precisely respond to changing markets and the need of patients and providers. The individual case and patients will become more influential in healthcare delivery and in consequence for the rationale behind these decisions. Our approach of a platform for semantic exploitation of BIG DATA supports a knowledge based infrastructure for deep analysis of clinical information from structured sources and clinical narratives. This infrastructure is able to pave the way towards the necessary big data-management possibilities. Example applications for cancer research will be given Keywords-bigdata;pharmaceutical research;outcome oriented medicine;semantic information processing I I NTRODUCTION The pharmaceutical industry faces deep challenges [1  R&D efforts that lead to successful products blockbustersî\ are unlikely to repeat in the future. Ma ny of the successful drugs will run out of patent protection in the next few years. Pharma has to re-invent itself and work on new therapeutic strategi es and improve the existing ones. Comparative trials are much more difficult and costly than just proving an effect initially Mainly it is the economic perspective that drives new inventions. Clinical cancer research for example is required to be very specific and targeted on individual characteristics. Sometimes the differential information is just not available or known. It is a huge effort to identify exact genetic conditions or biomarkers that characterize the sub-class of tumors successfully Pharmaceutical companies are desperately looking for innovation and new business models. It is fairly probable that the pharmaceutical industry will not survive based on the same strategy to produce drugs that target a symptom or illness that is accompanied by a low probability for success. There is a tendency to personalize therapies or to follow outcome oriented strategies II O UTCOME O RIENTED M EDICINE We define outcome as the final result of all medical interventions, procedures and collaborations in medicine Outcome has indeed always been the main driver behind medical science. However it has been measured in a very coarse scale. Medical science applies statistics and scientific procedures like randomized controlled trials to produce and describe outcome measures. The notion to understand medicine in terms of a population is not wrong but implies that experience with many patients tells a story about individual patients too This notion is changing and picks up possibilities inventions and models from a broad scale of sciences Looking at the individual in a more precise and straightforward way is an approach that is included in approaches like personalized and/or patient-centered medicine. The level of detail needed to perform individual or personalized medicine is much higher. The results are not measured in terms of large groups but for any individual patient. For example the result of a therapy may be to extend the life of a patient for some month on average. This may not be relevant for an individual patient Identifying the goals and characteristics of individual patients requires much more analysis and collaboration between healthcare providers and patients On the other hand more data and information is needed to identify individual traits of patients in order to separate them from a population. Outcome oriented approaches consider genetic information they may be linked to the health record of the patients in order to stratify a population for a therapy [2  III F ROM BIG DATA TO BIG INFORMATION IN THE FIELD OF CANCER RESEARCH According to the data management criteria listed below not every medical discipline delivers the needed precision or detail to perform deep personalization. The other crucial dimension is diversity and origin of data. The human capability to integrate huge amount of diverse information is incomparable. It is difficult to do this integration with 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 59 


computerized information systems. The example of cancer research shows that diagnostics and procedures are already available to produce a greater level of detail to power personalized medicine A State of the art of on cological research data administration The amount of data acquired during patientís medical treatments is immense. For example, data of tissue analyses, medical imaging, and haemograms, etc. add up to terabytes of medical data depending on the specific diagnostic approach. On top of that the often very long medical history of cancer patients adds additional volume and complexity. Especially in large hospitals and university medical centers lots of additional data is generated by the scientific staff These data become more and more relevant as it is often generated from patient specific tumor tissue. The big challenge today is an ìiro n curtainî separating clinical from scientific data. Scientific data is usually administered within individual, separate working groups, eventually uploaded to project specific servers and private clouds In smaller projects, data management is often realized using wikis or similar content management systems systems managing arbitrary contents of web pages. For large-scale projects, more professional solutions are needed. In cases where pharmaceutical companies participate in these projects their proprietary in-house solutions are commonly used B Current topics and their relationship to data management All of the following topics are influencing the requirements on management of big data. We mention a few of them to document that there is no generic way to understand big data management. Origin, structure and processes are influencing the way how big data management should be analyzed and understood High throughput of sequencing data  Within the next 10 years sequencing cancer genomes will become clinical routine in Germany and large parts of Europe. Today these technologies are mainly applied within a scientific environment meaning that the processes and data management procedures are largely established by the needs of scientist and not by medical practitioners and/or patients International collaborations Large, multinational research projects have been shown to be way more effective than smaller initiatives. Yet, their full potential has still to be unleashed by cross-national unified, data management and data protection strategies Data protection and security Data protection is a challenge in many ways. Indeed there are so many diverse aspects regarding data security that this justifies a separate discussion. To mention just a few that show the influence of data security aspect on big data management. These aspects strike process, quality and intention of big data usage and management 1 Incidental finding must not be reported to the treating physician or the patient directly 2 Different countries hav e dissenting laws of the degree of data protection 3 In Germany there is no opt-out for this Again there is no generic way to handle access and management of big data-sets for data security. The requirements need to be analyzed for particular applications in the big data domain C Future goals of oncological research Genomics is surely one of the most important influences on the outcome oriented and personalized clinical research. The tendency to understand and integrate clinical records with information from the patientís own genome sequence together with the transfer of innovation back to medical services will lead to a stratified medicine 2  3  St ra tif ic ati on  br eak s  d o w n a po pu l ati on in t o  dist in ct  subpopulations where each population may receive different treatments for the same diagnosis. It is not very improbable that todayís notion of diagnosis based on the population as a whole may have to be revisited too IV BIG DATA All these influences from clinical medicine pharmaceutical drug development and medical research require huge quantities of data and information from heterogeneous sources. BIG DATA is a term that describes data-sets that are too big to be managed with common tools and procedures used for smaller data-sets. Not only origin but also processing may include spatial distribution of data and of course different data formats. Based on the above description of practices the goal of management strategies should always be defined according to the use case supported. Big data management inherits more generic tasks from general data management like Collection Storage Integration, Curation Access, Retrieval Scalability, Distribution of data However in order to deliver the value proposition of innovation and improvement for the pharmaceutical industry or cancer research the data-management alone is not enough. The value delivered by big-data sets comes from in depth comprehensive and value generating processing cycles with constant exchange and update of the informational value extracted from big data-sets [4  60 


 automatic data collection e.g. harvesting data from distributed repositories support for conversion to standard formats. E.g special markup languages used in a particular domain upload to public repositories data organization and modeling  like data warehouses and semantic web. E.g. support for tagging and annotation of data in RDF [5  or O W L  6  Access control. E.g. controlling and auditing access across organizations Possibility for extension of functionality to access and process more data-sources. E.g. text-mining to access information from unstructured texts Support for collaboration across organizations Figure 1 BIG DATA Process We document such s cycle in Figure 1. It shows the iteration on data collection in a structured way collect data from various sources based on domain models extract information based on the application or research question according to the domain model associate or link the information with the already existing fact base optionally update domain models or ontologies if there is new information contained in the data that has not been recognized so far discover new information according to model change integrate and update information in fact base and prepare new iteration Being able to collect and process big data-sets in a value-oriented process supports a continuous cycle of discovery of new information. This is mainly what drives technological development behind the big data paradigm Among the many aspects of the big data revolution in healthcare the value-oriented processing and seamless integration of data and  information generated by machine with those authored by human beings has the biggest impact on innovation in healthcare [7   Human contribution is independent of its intention, e.g text, speech, collaboration. Everything may be processed according to the contributing value it contains It is necessary to rethink organizational models and governance structures of all organizations participating in healthcare and scientific research in order to maximize the value. The separation of clinical and scientific data \(ëiron curtainí\ is just one example of a barrier to innovation Another one is the traditional exclusion of patients from shared decisions or participation in healthcare delivery Patient participation and empowerment together with the improvement of health literacy in healthcare delivery will boost outcomes [8    V A PLATFORM FOR SEMANTIC EXPLOITATION OF BIG DATA Our approach for a platform that integrates and processes big data-sets is based on the semantic exploitation of clinical data collected from various resources like hospital information systems, clinical narratives, scientific literature and collaboration platforms This platform is developed within a joint project with CharitÈ and Vivantes Europeís leading healthcare providers - and ORTEC medical GmbH. Main driver for development is the support for cohort identification in clinical trials for recruitment and feasibility studies but is not limited to specific use cases. It supports the flexible and just-in-time exploitation of clinical data from various sources, including clinical texts, to leverage unlimited clinical or patient-centered use cases. Knowledge is represented by ontologies and engineered by the domain experts themselves in a straightforward manner in a semantic workbench. Semantically enriched facts are processed by domain-specific applications that support specific use cases. Semantic exploitation of clinical data from structured HIS records and clinical texts provides an up-to-date evidence base for medical research and healthcare delivery 61 


 Figure 2 Platform architecture Physicians and medical experts are able to engineer ontologies and adapt the knowledge needed by an application or use case. For example, patient recruitment scenarios require knowledge that represents study criteria for case selection. The knowledge engineering process itself is always done by validating data and ontologies in an iterative fashion supporting a round-trip engineering Ontologies can always be validated and tested against the real data flowing into the system from structured sources or clinical texts. E.g. experts identify ontological concepts in texts by just scraping and annotating them Cross-cut concerns like collaboration on individual facts, semantic patients records or ontologies support the required flexible administration and collaboration across organizations The data integration and annotation possibilities of this platform address lots of the requirements for the management of big data Platform and applications are currently piloted in various departments of  CharitÈ and Vivantes [9   VI C ONSEQUENCES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH Given that scientific progress in oncology is a good candidate for improvement of medical procedures on a more detailed level the results provide a powerful force to drive change regarding the challenges for pharma. The tendency to support individual aspects in clinical research and drug development is reforming the way healthcare is delivered and the pharmaceutical industry may focus on their core competencies to drive that change. The technical possibilities are available however the intelligent application and iterative deployment in changing disciplines is an ongoing challenge Achieving conditional licenses based on trials performed on small cohorts [10  1 1   is on ly th e begin n in g   of a tendency to Figure 3 Ontology Engineering Process close the information gap between scientific reasoning and the methods that help to approve and market the products of these efforts. We believe the possibilities to digest and enrich information is a crucial step in rightsizing clinical research and healthcare delivery. The technical requirements for that is the possibility to manage big datasets with the aspects listed above. However innovation can only be successful if it picks up the necessary culture and promotes innovative people and mind-sets. For the pharmaceutical industry this might imply Rethink the provision for the pharmaceutical industry away from drug delivery alone [1  Promote collaboration and value-oriented research between all stake-holders in healthcare Cooperate to establish new regulatory models and procedures that follow the proposition of valueoriented and personalized medicine Educate and perceive patients as partners in healthcare and research There are already some examples that adopt models of shared innovation [13 1 4    O n e im po rt ant asp e c t s of th es e  models is also the collaboration with patients. PatientCentered-Infrastructures  a r e t e c h no l o gi c a l pe r s pe c t i v e for patient-oriented and outcome-oriented services in research and healthcare delivery. Information as a first level resource in healthcare reaches the significance of therapies as it directly influences outcomes. The tendency to break down the risky model of information silos which are based on the false and dangerous understanding of values and markets is under wa y. To appreciate patients as a partner and a valuable source of information at least in chronic conditions influences outcomes [8 an d is a w a y t o  change the economic situation of the healthcare system too[15 VII C ONCLUSION Establish big data strategies for the pharmaceutical industry may unlock a multitude of possibilities. The goal of outcome-oriented research and medicine directly applies these possibilities to improve outcomes and the 62 


economic impact of research and healthcare in general However the transition from a drug research oriented market approach and clinical trials culture that addresses big markets to a fine grained and personalized development of market offers is not easy. The required technology is available. We propose a platform for semantic exploitation of big data which may contribute to a large-scale integration of data from various sources in the healthcare domain. Finding the right way to apply these technological possibilities in order to drive innovation is still to be done. Patients should perceived as a partner and collaborate in research, innovation and healthcare delivery. Breaking down the informational barriers of information is a necessary step to learn about the possibilities for applying big data strategies for innovation A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported in part by Technologiestiftung Berlin \(TSB\ and by Europ‰ischen Fond f¸r regionale Entwicklung \(EFRE R EFERENCES 1 J  Ca tte l l S C h il uk ur i a n d M   L e vy  How big data can revolutionize pharmaceutical R&D 2013 http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/health_systems_and_services/h ow_big_data_can_revolutionize_pharmaceutical_r_and_d 2 R  Ba r n e s  Where Treatments Meet Genetics: Making Stratified Medicine a Reality in Scotland 2013 http://www.aridhia.com/opinion/where-treatments-meet-genetics 3 H  Sc ow c r oft  Our Stratified Medicine Programme  what is it and how will it work  2011 http://scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org/2011/11/21/our-stratifiedmedicine-programme-what-is-it-and-how-will-it-work 4 W  W r uck, M  P e uke r  C R Re g e nbr e c ht Data management strategies for multinational largescale systems biology projects Brief Bioinform. 2012 Oct 9, pp 1-14 5 W3C Resource Description Framework \(RDF  http://www.w3.org/RDF 6 W3C OWL Web Ontology Language  http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref 7 B  K a y y al i , D  K n o tt a n d S   Van Kuiken, ìThe big data revolution in healthcareî, 2013, downloadable pdf, p. 19 http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/health_systems_and_services media/mckinsey/dotcom/insights/health%20care/the%20bigdata%20revolution%20in%20us%20health%20care/the_big_data_r evolution_in_healthcare.ashx 8 A g e n c y f o r Hea l t h c a r e R e s e a r c h  a nd Qu a lit y  U S Dep a rt m e n t of  Health and Human Services Health Literacy Interventions and Outcomes: An Updated Systematic Review March 2011 http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/tp/lituptp.htm 9 C S e e b o d e  M  T r autw e i n  M.

semantic domain knowledge to address data variety  We not only consider online querying over data streams but also from a completely new perspective use CEP as a dynamic stream storage for on-demand querying Database systems which may seem appealing to implement the hybrid query model is also relevant Distributed databases and in-memory databases 7 support ef\002cient on-demand queries at high reading rates Realtime databases and active databases 21 de v eloped schedule or trigger mechanisms to perform online queries over dynamic data We extend CEP to support hybrid online and on-demand queries with a query-over-query paradigm This allows 003exible stream storage provisioning which is extremely important for applications supporting heterogeneous data and users In addition our approach inherits intuitive temporal query speci\002cation and ef\002cient online query processing capabilities from CEP systems Different to relational and NoSQL query models CEP provides explicit temporal operators such as time window and temporal order to correlate realtime data Designated algorithms such as NFA are used for high-throughput query matching over data streams Realtime and active databases can perform online relational queries but do not scale to such highrate inputs or queries Stream databases such as 22 offer powerful query languages with sliding windows and sequence operators but also do not scale to high data rate VII C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we introduce a stateful Complex Event Processing framework to meet the needs of emerging realtime Big Data applications across all 3-V's The proposed system supports semantic-level query speci\002cation over realtime data to deal with data variety  It inherits CEP systems high performance online querying capabilities to deal with data velocity  Furthermore we extend traditional CEP systems to support on-demand querying to deal with data volume on streams The formal query algebra we proposed captures the stateful and containment semantics of realtime data queries which form the basis for the hybrid query paradigm Various query processing techniques we introduce work toward ef\002cient execution of this hybrid model including online query evaluation query-based stream storage provisioning dynamic data life-cycle management and on-demand query evaluation There are several implementation issues to be considered further as we complete our prototype based on these formal abstractions One of them is the scalability of the in-memory state persistence model When the stateful CEP system processes a large number of long running online queries the system memory may be drained out To address this issue we are exploring scale-out opportunities by distributing the H2O query model over the network The detailed performance evaluation will further validate our proposed models and optimizations R EFERENCES  Big data gets rea l-time Oracle White Paper  2013  A Adi and et al Comple x e v ent processing

   9 extreme radiation environment could induce faults i n these components that can only be cleared by the removal and reapplication of power termed off-pulsing The FM S implements an off-pulsing architecture that provide s offpulsing capabilities to clear faults in the transce iver IEM and PDU. Mechanisms are provided to allow individua l offpulsing of any of these components in Operational M ode. In addition to address a safety net for unknown fault s the FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mo de In general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault while the off-pulsing of all three components is ha ndled in Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the ha rdware command loss timer i.e the spacecraft has not re ceived a specific command from the ground in 3.6 days  All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU with the PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequen ce for each off-pulse type The off-pulse mechanism is  designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault r esulting in at most a single off-pulse cycle  The FM architec ture utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM requ est to offpulse transceiver via software command loss timer SWCLT    t r a n s c e i v e r  r e q u e s t  t o  o f f p u l s e  I E M   v i a  RF CCD command transceiver request of off-pulse PDU via RF CCD command and hardware command loss timer HWCLT request to off-pulse PDU IEM and transcei ver as shown in Figure  8   Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture  2.4.2.3  Limited Instrument Fault Management The final high-level requirement that drives the mo des and safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is decoupled from the science instruments Instrument FM  is limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw power down request and heartbeat The instrument generat es and provides the spacecraft with status information in the Interface Transfer Format ITF Instrument status includes power-down requests and an instrument aliveness cou nter An instrument power-down request or frozen alivenes s indicator results in the removal of operational pow er from the instrument within a pre-defined number of secon ds In the event of an instrument over-current/over-power condition the instrument is immediately powered of f with no advanced warning Over-current/over-power protec tion is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and  resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU To protect against hard shorts the PDU monitors current and i f the load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circ uit breaker opens the switch and power is immediately removed f rom the instrument Autonomy rules protect against soft  shorts by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer duration  In addition spacecraft anomalous conditions such a s low battery state of charge low voltage sense or exte nded loss of communication result in all instruments being immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown warning Therefore instruments must be designed to  be immediately powered-off from any internal mode in t he event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft a nomalous condition For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-lin e angle the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warnin g before being powered off. Any additional FM measure s that are specific to the instruments are the responsibil ity of the instruments themselves 2.4.3  Ground Intervention Concept The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives the ground intervention concept In an effort to ke ep the FMS as simple as possible on-board FM is minimized  by taking advantage of inherent mission design charact eristics and spacecraft design decisions The spacecraft are  spin stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun Th e nearSun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect the prime science measurements and requires only pe riodic precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the mission in order to be maintained The periodic pre cession maneuvers are dictated by the Earthís orbital motio n around the Sun with maneuvers performed when the total Su n offset angle reaches maximum value This orbit offe rs a number of design advantages 1 when combined with antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of s pin-axis frequent ground contacts more than 1/day with neg ligible communication delays are possible, 2\ the near-Sun pointed attitude ensures adequate power generation when att itude is maintained within the maximum offset angle and 3 the inherently stable spin state requires infrequent ad justments to maintain the spacecraftís orientation allowing for openloop attitude control  Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spi nners inherently stable with open-loop attitude control  there is no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to autonomously point the spacecraft which significan tly reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required I n general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicate d rules that take simple actions such as powering off a com ponent or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS me asures are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board autonomy rule set Finally the frequent ground con tacts with negligible communication delays allow the burd en for fault correction and recovery to be placed on the g round 


   10 3  Verification  As a distributed system the verification of the RB SP FM requirements was also distributed Verification of subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in th e various subsystem verification plans with buy-in f rom the RBSP FM lead engineer Verification of system-level  FM requirements were performed on the spacecraft and l ed by the FM lead engineer  Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized hierarchically, based upon the missionís product br eakdown structure as shown in Figure 9 Requirements are d efined from the mission-level directly to the element-leve l in order to avoid the creation of too many documentation lay ers In addition to the requirement level the requirements  tree is also organized according to requirement type i.e  performance/measurement mission assurance environmental, and interface requirements  Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure  The FM requirements are distributed and flow down f rom the Mission Requirements Document MRD to the element-level and then to the subsystem-level The FM requirements are categorized as performance/measure ment requirements which are captured in various requirem ents documents or as interface requirements which are ca ptured in interface control documents ICD Figure 10 sho ws the hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization  of those requirements   Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management Requirements  Although FM requirements may be verified using test  analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combin ation of these the preferred verification method for FM requirements is test. The verification of FM requir ements is accomplished through an integrated hierarchical app roach comprised of a series of verification activities D uring the Integration and Test I&T phase verification prog resses from individual components and subsystems to integr ated segments and upward to the entire mission system Individual components are verified by their provide rs against the corresponding component and subsystemlevel fault management requirements The FM lead engineer  has oversight authority over these lower-level FM verif ication activities and has access to all generated verifica tion records and reports. In addition, the FM team performs syst em-level scenario testing and supports mission simulations a nd I&T special tests in order to verify the system-level  i.e mission- and element-level\ FM requirements  The FM team has oversight authority over lower-leve l FM verification activities and reviewed the verificati on plans for spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams which were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM requirements are adequately verified FM requiremen ts allocated to hardware \(i.e., spacecraft or ground are verified during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance tes t The individual subsystem teams are responsible for desi gning and running tests that verify these subsystem-level  fault management requirements FM requirements allocated to spacecraft flight software or ground software are v erified by independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed level The Independent Acceptance Test IAT team i s responsible for designing and running the tests tha t verify these subsystem-level FM requirements The tests us ed to perform the verification are typically black box requirements-based tests FM requirements allocated  to spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight  software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulator s, and the spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two phases autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path verification phase Autonomy unit testing is perfor med on the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy development and involves standalone testing of the individual autonomy objects i.e rule macro com puted telemetry, and storage variable\. The goal of the u nit testing is to identify defects such as coding errors before  the autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deli verable autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit tes t phase the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the path verification phase begins Note the autonomy path verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM scenario testing The autonomy path verification t esting takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware a nd verifying all of the sensor interfaces i.e senso r data used by autonomy rules and computed telemetry and all 


   11 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flig ht hardware from autonomy macros The paths are independently verified on both spacecraft rather th an endorsing a verification by similarity approach FM requirements allocated to the ground system are ver ified by operational procedure, operational constraint, or b y mission simulation Verification of requirements using oper ational procedure are performed by inspection of the signed off procedure document Verification of requirements us ing operational constraint are performed by inspection of the RBSP Operations Constraint Document Finally verification of requirements using mission simulati ons are performed by test at the observatory level or the h igh fidelity hardware simulator  The FM team has overall responsibility for coordina ting the mission- and element-level verification plans and a ctivities The resulting verification program ensures that the  FMS satisfies the functional requirements and is in con formance with the mission and operational concepts defined f or FM The FM team is responsible for establishing, review ing, and approving all FM verification activities and method s planned for requirements specified at the mission and element-level. All mission- and element-level funct ional and performance requirements will be verified by one or  more appropriate methods prior to launch with closure s tatus tracked in the DOORS requirements database system Whenever possible FM requirements at the mission and element-level are verified by test The FM team is responsible for designing and performing system-lev el scenario tests that verify the mission- and element level FM requirements In addition some FM requirements are  verified using mission simulations which are led by  the Mission Operations Team MOT or I&T special tests which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenari o tests are developed, designed, and performed by the FM te am to verify mission and element-level FM requirements  The system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that  are similar to mission simulations except that one or m ore faults are injected during the simulation the scenario te sts are black-box requirements-based tests For each scena rio the test must 1 prove that the spacecraft can perform  the scenario correctly \(i.e., without fault injection and \(2\ prove that the spacecraft can recover from the injected f ault to a state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal operations  As a distributed system the FM test campaign is di vided into two distinct phases as shown in Figure 11 Th e first phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which th e individual subsystems design and run tests to verif y and close their subsystem-level FM requirements \(i.e hardware flight software and autonomy At the conclusion o f the subsystem-level test phase the subsystems are cons idered ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are ava ilable for the second phase of the FM test campaign The secon d phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The syste m-level tests serve two purposes 1 verification of missi on and element-level FM requirements and 2 validation of  subsystem-level FM requirements Note  subsystem-l evel FM requirements are verified and closed at the subs ystemlevel prior to I&T      Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview   System-level scenario testing is performed by the F M team and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios T he objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify mission and element-level FM requirements in addi tion many of the subsystem-level requirements are also v alidated as a result of verifying the system-level requireme nts The FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of test ing Tier one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times baseline and launch site are included on the incompressible test list and are regression tested  on both spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two t ests must be performed on both spacecraft at least once \(base line\, are included on the incompressible test list and are r egression tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or t he affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration cha nge or a significant FSW change affects the test Finally t ier three tests are performed on both spacecraft once \(baseli ne  The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when the spacecraft bus is complete with a goal of havi ng instruments integrated The test platform for the b aseline FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS \(i.e., space craft bus hardware C&DH flight software autonomy and ground/missions operations\ to be exercised as a wh ole and permits the verification of all interfaces between components all autonomy commands via autonomy macros to flight hardware and flight software and  all hardware i.e PDU commands to flight hardware T he high fidelity hardware simulator section 3.1 is u sed whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify and correct procedural errors and for regression te sting of tier two tests  


   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earthís rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
