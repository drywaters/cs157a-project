Constructing E-Tourism Platform Based on Service Value Broker A Knowledge Management Perspective Yucong Duan   Yongzhi Wang  JinpengWei   Ajay Kattepur   Wencai Du    Hainan University Haikou P.R.China  Florida International University Miami USA  INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt Paris France Email duanyucong@hotmail.com  ywang032 weijp  cis.ìu.edu ajay.kattepur@inria.fr wencai@hainu.edu.cn Abstract In our previous work we have introduced various service value broker SVB patterns which integrate business modeling knowledge management and economic analysis In this paper working towards the target of maximizing the potential usage of available resource to achieve the optimization of the satisfaction on both the service provider side and the service consumer side under the guidance of the public administrative we propose to build the E-Tourism platform based on SVB This paper demonstrates the mechanism for SVB based ETourism framework The advantages of employing SVB include that the SVB can help to increase the value added in a realtime and balanced manner which conforms to the economical goal of both long run and short run An experiment is shown using a personnel recommendation system Keywords knowledge management service value value added Big Data broker I Introduction A The service value broker Software design patterns  ha v e b een pro v ed proposed and veriìed successfully in the modeling processes of multiple technical domains However for modeling for modeling service oriented computing SOC applications design patterns have to be adapted according to value of Quality of Service QoS or business contractual aspects We refer to this as the Service Value Broker  SVB  pattern SVB has already been proposed for cloud service brokerage whic h w e f oresee as an important characteristics of the optimization of the EService composition of E-Service E conomics T he related deìnitions are as follows   Service Value Broker  SVB  driven by a value based goal when a direct service composition cannot meet some required constraints from the service contract o r service l ev el agreemen t\(SLA suc h as response time location license area available period currency format If the introduction of a intermediate service can help to solve these problems and enable a service composition to be qualiìed the introduced intermediate service is a SVB   Direct Service Value Broker  DSVB  direct SVB is a special type of SVB resulting from a composition of services This composition must bring more value to the stakeholder who introduces the DSVB By value we mean not only monetary value but also non-monetary such as reputation and brand value etc From the perspective of value analysis a simpliìed formulation of the dierence between constructing a traditional broker and a SVB is as follows 1 Quality driven For constructing a traditional broker a composing service is chosen based on the order of the quality of its functionality And for a set of composing services the priority is in ratio to  integration  quality  i...n  2 Price/quality driven For constructing a SVB a composing service is chosen based on the order of the price/quality of its functionality And for a set of composing services the priority is in ratio to  integration  price/quality  i...n   valueadded  B Building E-Tourism on the brokerage To cope with the challenges of E-Tourism systems such as multiple sources of data processing high dimension of database large linked data huge amount of sensor data collection and realtime response etc we propose to alleviate the problem solving from a knowledge management perspective in combination with a SVB based framework SVB directly centers service value implementation and service value optimization We have collected demonstrative SVB in I n t his p ap er we propose to use SVB as the base to integrate three important sides of a service ecosystem service provider service customer and public administration  E ac h o f these three sides maintains an independent interest or value system and at the same time relates to others as an element of an global value calculation system SVB is expected to function as an important source of value added for optimizing the whole system under the comprehensive evaluation/measure in terms of value 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 17 


The expected contributions of this architecture include the follows  Enhanced knowledge management granularity From knowledge management perspective SVB based architecture will leverage the abstraction level of the knowledge decomposition since problem description can be decomposed or mapped to knowledge pieces represented by various SVB elements above the data map stage in a MapReduce framework a nd the r esult c an b e in tegrated as a general solution through the SVB based knowledge pieces above the level of data level of the reducing stage of a MapReduce implementation as well  Value added focused SVB is designed to bridge the barrel of both functional and QoS sides in both individual service select and service composition to reach a measurable value increase Under a well managed knowledge management implementation a balanced result in terms of the comprehensive value can be fairly expected The rest of the paper is organized as follows SectionII presents background knowledge and the general scenario Section III presents the analysis of the sources of value added brought by introducing SVB and the comprehensive analysis Section IV presents an experiment on a personnel recommendation system This is followed by relatedworkinSectionVandconclusionswithfuture directions in Section VI II The background and scenario A Demonstration of E-tourism related SVB Here we demonstrate some SVB and DSVB  whic h compose an E-Tourism system We assume the existence of E-Contracts among stakeholder We denote the contract on the source end of an exchange as CS the contract on the target end of an exchange as CT the input of SVB/DSVB contract as iSVB and the output of a SVB/DSVB contract as oSVB 1 Weather forecasting  WF  D B  weather forecast is a costly and challenging task however a lot of organizations might need this service with speciìc precision request Target  WF  CS WF  CT SV S 0   WF  CT WF  CS  weather forecasting broker  by subcontracting the weather forecasting to a professional service it actually implement a reuse of resources including professional knowledge etc Similarly we can identify numerous application level brokers such as vender broker data cleaning broker etc Solution  WF  task   CS  WF  task   SV B 2 Operation security  OS  D S he completeness and reliability of a series of operations and behaviors of a service transaction is deìned as operation security Operation security broker  a service which checks the atomic actions and monitors implementation of the sequence of execution or protocol of interactions can play the broker Solution  OS  CS  check  atomic   iSV B  AN D  OS  CT  monitor  protocol   oSV B  3 Information privacy  IP  D S  during a transaction some pieces of information which are not required or are not necessary for a transaction mightberequiredorleakedwithoutnotice Information privacy broker  a service which checks and restricts the usages of service information based on a necessary-only policy may play the broker Solution  IP  CS   check  access   iSV B AN Dvalidate  necessary   iSV B  B Composition of SVB TherearevarioussituationswhereSVBsarecomposed with dierent cardinalities of 1:1 1:n m:n and sequences We classify the composition modes as follows 1 Vertical composition Wetakethe Location broker as an example.If requests are restricted to be from China while the customer want to visit as much nations of Europe Union as possible without additional registration Then a solution can be built on the integration of Location broker which takes request from China while has the authority to issue the pass for only one nation Solution  LC  CS   LC  iSV B  1 n  AN D   LC  oSV B  1 n  LC  CT  AN D    coverage  LC   oSV B  coverage  CT  2 Horizontal composition Wetakethe Currency broker as an example The payment is restricted to be Czech Koruna while the customer has only Thai Baht If a Currency exchange broker a which exchange Thai Baht to Euro and a Currency exchange broker b which exchange Euro to Czech Koruna are available The connection of the two brokers will construct a solution from this customer to the provider Solution  CE  CS  CE  iSV B  a   AN D  CE  oSV B  a   CE  iSV B  b   AN D  CE  oSV B  b   CE  CT  3 Intelligent composition  For an agent SVB  to increase its general proìt for providers it will consider the provider side situation such as the real time sales data and yearly historical sales record at dierent seasons After a comprehensive calculation it will oer probably a discount strat18 


Figure 1 The SVB based processing egy or advertisement plan such as a case that if a customer can purchase several services as a bundle there will be a 30 percent discount which will be mutual beneìcial to both customers and the provider Also at customer side if negotiation is permitted among customers they can form Service federations to jointly collect and build their purchase items into service bundles to beneìt from the discount oer from the provider side Figure 1 shows the state diagram of a E-Service in a SVB composition process A traditional process is embedded as a comparison During a traditional process a service is rstly discovered and then it will go through a sequential process of  matchmaking  selection  composition  The result is a local solution which does not fully take advantage of the potential of the exibility of E-Services in a scalable cloud environment When the business value is given the highest priority the subcontracting relationship implemented by SVB could bring potentially higher value SVB based solution can fully explore the potential of the available resources for the processing only when one of the conditions of a the assigned search time is nished b the cost reaches limit and c all possible subcontract scenarios have been explored has been met the search will end The result will be a global best value in terms of business gains on all parties C The general business scenario Figure 2 shows the general scenario of multiple service values from mainly three sources We summarize them as follows 1 Provider value PRV At service provider side business value need to be considered from the temporal dimension as short run vs long run target which will decide speciìc business strategies such as new product advertisement promotion sell out etc Among providers the value can be classiìed into two categories  Negative competitive cost Negative competitive cost occurs when other business competitors who oer similar services bid for the same order or market  Positive cooperative wins When service vendors who oer related or similar services agree on some xed conditions such as market share sells area etc they can build some cooperations to proìt from the customer side such as lifting the price of services or charges of maintenance etc 2 Customer value CSV Service customers in general have independent views on the value of the targeted services However customers can socialize with other customers to query the quality of a service from others experiences and comments The experience information or news/advertisment propagated through social media among customers is playing an increasing role in promoting sales and adjusting commerce behavior Customers can also build federations to protect their shared interests against malicious service providers with shared cost Small scale of customer cooperation can cooperate to win promotion sale packages from providers in a win-win manner 3 Public value PUV The public administration is the third party which can play the juridical role for solving the argumentation The public administration also has other critical responsibilities i monitor the service market through economical analysis to avoid the competition between the provider and customer side to enter an Zero-Sum game ii employ public policies to intervene the strong cooperation against customer interests at the provider side or collusive customers  e tc These dierent sources of values are weaved together in a business transaction Using E-contract of services as the media the work ow can be described as follows Firstly on the service provider side PRV will be arranged to document the content and SLA of to be provided E-Services in the form of E-Contracts Secondarily customers will nd and do matchmaking of the available E-Contracts of available E-Services During this stage SVB can be introduced to enlarge the scope of the choice space on the customer side while increasing the chances on the provider T he k e y f actor o f t he SVB 19 


Figure 2 Integrating value considerations from multiple stakeholder with value brokerage practice lies in making full use of the available/assigned computational resource from the customer side and the permitted sub-contract relationship to explore an optimal  result in terms o f v alue measure D Domain knowledge based classiìcation of SVB From the domain of E-Tourism we have identiìed many application areas which can be implemented with SVB in dierent c whic h i s s ho wn in Figure 3  Information category Related brokers include the translation broke whic h d eals with the l anguage mismatching situations in multiple language information query multiple language route planning etc the information broker whic h p ro vides optimal choices to customers for hotel reservation ight booking car renting local weather forecast trafìc control daily care etc and the proxy broker  whic h t ec hnically supp orts xing m ismatc hing situations such as location mismatching time mismatching and IP mismatching etc  Data category Related brokers include the format broker whic h i n t egrates t he data or le f ormat for channeling the information ow among various institutes and organizations and provides realtime currency exchange  for p a y men t calculation etc and the data QoS broker which deals with mismatching situations of the usage policy of data privacy of data copyright of data based usually on the data contract   Operational category Related brokers include the operation broker which deals with price faulting disaster rescue optimization food safety surveillance restaurant sanitary monitoring medical care resource optimization insurance recommendation etc and the service QoS broker which helps to cater the mismatching situations of availability latency and throughput restrictions e tc  Intelligent implementation category Related brokers include the optimization broker which deals with the compositional issues of service competition and service federation under r elated v a lue t argets Optimization surpasses the scope of individual services which focuses on speciìc functionalities or quality properties and the business broker which deals with the judical issue of service compensation trust infrastructure and reputation brokerage malpractice security brokerage local public policy enforcement global business value calculation and balancing and personalization based on Big data analysis etc III The analysis on value added A Sources of value added Building an E-Tourism architecture on top of SVB are expected to have several possible advantages if well managed including the following basic situations  Added value of PRV On the provider side SVB can bring more business chances through relating otherwise not related business together such as creating an international language translation platform which can redistribute translation request to individual translation service providers The added 20

Figure 4 The metamodel of the brokerage supported value added attaining processing new usage discovery and SVB application Dierent from traditional brokers which focus on functional value and QoS the value which is implemented by SVB requires the composition of business value and functional value B Tradeo on long run vs short run 1 Inîuence factors In classical economics the proìt mode of a business transaction will be distinguished as long run vs short run I n a long run factors such as cost and price will be modeled as variables in contrast to being modeled as xed amount in a short run This dierence will be reîected directly to value added accumulation towards proìt-maximization For a short run mode the value added of  PRV or  CSV or  PUV will be positive as long as the marginal cost is lower than the marginal revenue which represents the added proìt corresponding to the increase of a unit of production Similarly a production decrease strategy can be made There are several variability which should be taken as knowledge rules to guide the attaining of the proìt-maximization considering both long run and short run  Cost/price adjustment by taking advantage of the timely processing of E-Contracts SVB can realize timely adjusting price to balance the ratio of price/cost for a short run  Marketing plan SVB can be composed to implement complex price strategies of a long run such as at the beginning of a business the marginal cost is allowed to be greater than the marginal price to implement the marketing strategy of advertisement the price can be increased since after to gain the main proìt and a sold out can be planned to recollect the money ow for an investment with higher reward business etc The general evaluation can be positive as long as the average proìt in a long run is positive  History based prediction the transaction history of customers/providers can be analyzed based on the added value calculation on the top of SVB to make decision on the adaptation of price and production  Public policy implementation the public side can employ the power of Big Data processing to analyze added value from various sources covering both  PRV and  CSV  Corresponding encouragement policies can be made when the    PRV   CSV  is decreasing or the acceleration of the increase of the     PRV   CSV    time is decreasing Intervention can also be introduced to interfere the situation that the provider side dominates the price making against customer side through the monitoring of the ratio of    PRV      CSV  2 The general proìt We formulate economic formulas to highlight the general proìt calculation in comparison with traditional business Traditional economics max prof it   max  capitalspace  bussineslif ecycle  marginal  price   marginal  cost  SVB enriched E-Service Economics max prof it   max  capitalspace  strategyspace  bussineslif etime  f strategy  price   marginal  cost   f strategy  cost  SV B  strategyspace  capability  V alueAdded  subcontract  SV B   budeget   budeget   budeget    project time plan   dispensable capital  resource of i computation ii storage and iii network 22 


IV Experimentation We implemented a prototype system to show the proof of concept of SVB  We pick the personalization right lower corner of the Figure 2 as an example to show how the SVB can collaborate with Big Data analysis on PUV to improve both the PRV and the CSV  In the E-tourism business recommending suitable restaurant for the tourist will increase the degree of their satisfaction At the same time a good restaurant recommendation will increase the proìt of restaurant and tourism company reducing complaining Our system oers a value based brokerage service to make personalized restaurant recommendation for new customer based on previous customerês rating history It is developed on Mahout Recommender 1  Mahout is an open source data mining framework based on MapReduce computing model Its recommender class is extended to support multiple recommendation algorithms We use item based recommender and dierent similarity measurements to perform personalized recommendation We use  Restaurant  ConsumerData  data set 2 from UC Irvineês machine Learning repository We only use its rating  f inal.csv  which records 1161 instances of rating information Each instance represents a rating of a customer towards a restaurant The possible rating values are set as 0 1 2 We preprocess the data set and parse the following format to the Mahout recommender  customerid  restaurantid  customer  srating  The output produces top ten most preferable restaurants for each customer The system partitions the data set into two parts The rst 80 of data is fed to the recommender to generate the preferable restaurant The remaining 20 of data is used to evaluate the recommendation We use Mean Squared Error MSE to evaluate the recommendation result For each customer if his rating for a certain restaurant appears in both the 20 of evaluation data and the recommendation result we compute the MSE of those ratings We generate the average MSE for each recommender method Intuitively the lower value of MSE a method can get the higher SVB value we will get In the real business scenario the tourism company may delegate the recommendation service to multiple SVB When results return from SVB the tourism company can use its evaluation data set to measure the accuracy of the recommendation and choose the result that brings highest value added of PRV  i.e lowest MSE in this case To simulate such scenario we perform the Mahout item based recommender with dierent similarity measurements The generated mean square error is shown 1

propose to build a problem solving framework from a knowledge management base on the SVB The general target is to easy the complexity of the E-Tourism system building and the comprehensive improvement of the proìting on the service provider side the satisfaction and acceptance on the customer side and the eciency and precision of the market surveillance and control from the public administrative side In the future we will improve the added value modeling modules on each parties and consider comprehensive business application We would like to apply the prototype system to collect rst hand feedback from the ETourism markets in speciìc agencies in Hainan province for further modiìcations and deeper Big Data analysis The future work will also include exploring the direction of SVB

 Even using a 2Gbps optical fiber, five parallel encryptions suffice to the requirement of max speed of 250MB/s. The max speeds are also illustrated in Fig. 13 as dot lines Since the speed bound line ascends linearly, it  s easy to determine, as the method above, how many parallels should be deployed to achieve the maximum transmitting speed of bandwidth  Figure 13  Speed bounds comparing to max transmitting speed b  Analysis of Key Generation Since key generation occurs only once for a new torrent file, it  s easy to determine that generating ten thousand keys consumes only 11 seconds \(multiply 0.11 milliseconds to 10,000\. So it  s safe to argue that the cost of time is negligible 3  Efficiency of IVCSD According to the results and analyses above transmission in IVCSD is as efficient as original BT meaning that adding these functions and schemes will not affect the overall performance in BT network V  C ONCLUSION  This paper proposes a scheme, Identity Verification and Cipher System Distribution \(IVCSD\, to address secure problems in distributing big data. Identity verification protects the network in the aspect of peer admittance and data spreading, by assigning authority to torrents and peers, blocking unauthorized behaviors and keeping track of peers  actions. Cipher system protects the transmission in the aspect of data security and transmitting efficiency. With data encryption, intermediaries are allowed to participate into network without getting original data, sustaining the advantage of BT protocol After implementing IVCSD in testing machines experiment is performed and the results are analyzed Functionality and efficiency is positively demonstrated in the experimental results. As a conclusion, IVCSD is a feasible scheme to distribute big data, with some compromises between security and complexity There  re still some imperfect conditions. \(1\lthough behavior of intermediaries are proposed, implemented and tested, details about how or who to trigger or stop these actions are still absent. \(2\ The code implementing IVCSD for experiment in this paper uses Java. It may have some effects on evaluating efficiency. Other languages may be used in realistic deployment to achieve better performance 3\ Restricted by facilities an d environments in lab, all experiments and evaluations are completed within the local area network, instead of wider one such as Internet This fact may result in inaccuracy of experimental results but according to the analyses in Part IV, the functionality won  t be affected and the efficiency will still be acceptable in future implementation A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This paper is supported by the Hi-tech Research and Development Program of China \(863 Program\ under Grant No. 2011AA01A205, the Open Research Fund of The Academy of Satellite Application under grant NO SSTC-YJS-01-03, the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant No. 61232009, the Doctoral Fund of Ministry of Education of China under Grant No. 20101102110018,Beijing Natural Science Foundation under Grant No. 4122042, the fund of the State Key Laboratory of Software Development Environment under Grant No. SKLSDE-2012ZX-06 R EFERENCES  1  The Coming Data Deluge, IEEE Spectrum, February 2011 2  The data deluge, www.economist.com/node/15579717, Feb 25 2010 3  Arun Chokkalingam, Firasath Riyaz.
