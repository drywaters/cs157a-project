attacks. Many well-known cybersecurity solutions are in place to counteract these attacks. However, the generation of Big Data over computer networks is rapidly rendering these traditional solutions obsolete. To cater for this problem, corporate research is now focusing on Security Analytics, i.e., the application of Big Data Analytics techniques to cybersecurity. Analytics can assist network managers particularly in the monitoring and surveillance of real-time network streams and real-time detection of both malicious and suspicious \(outlying\tterns. Such a behavior is envisioned to encompass and enhance all traditional 
security techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the state of the art of Security Analytics, i.e., its description technology, trends, and tools. It hence aims to convince the reader of the imminent application of analytics as an unparalleled cybersecurity solution in the near future Keywords\227cybersecurity; big data analytics; security analytics survey; real-time; suspicion fraud; outliers; network streams I  BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION  The internet is a global network of interconnected systems which serves billions of users worldwide. Its popularity and rapid growth have come at an expensive cost, i.e., loss of 
information and resources due to cyber threats and attacks. The first cyber crime was reported in 2000 and infected almost 45 million internet users [1  Ov er th e f e w p a st y ears cy b e rcrimes have increased rapidly with cyber criminals continuously exploring new ways to circumvent security solutions to get illegal access to computer systems and networks. Some important cyber attacks are as follows 
200  Spamming Spamming is sending unsolicited bulk messages to multiple recipients [2 B y 2 0 1 5  th e  spam volume is forecasted to be 95% of all email traffic  M unging  a c c e s s filte r i ng a n d  c o nte n t  filtering are important anti-spam techniques. Munging makes email addresses unusable for spammers, e.g 
abc@gmail.com munges as \223abc at gmail dot com\224 Access filtering detects spam based on IP and email addresses while content filtering recognizes predefined text patters in emails to detect spam 
200  Search Poisoning Search poisoning is the dishonest use of Search Engine Optimization techniques to falsely improving the ranking of a webpage [4 Typically, frequent search keywords are used to illegally direct users towards short-lived websites. The first poisoning case was reported in 2007 followed by many others 200  Botnets Botnets are networks of malware-infected 
compromised computers managed by an adversary 6 A t t a c k er s use  b o t soft w a r e eq ui ppe d w i t h  integrated command and control system to control these zombies \(bots\ and group them into a network called the bot net     
200  Denial of Service \(DoS A DoS attack makes a system or any other network resource inaccessible to its intended users.  It is launched by a large number of distributed hosts, e.g., bot net. Many defensive techniques such as intrusion detection systems, puzzle solution, firewalls etc. have been developed to prevent DoS attacks [8  200  Phishing 
Phishing fraudulently acquires  confidential user data by mimicking e-communicatio  m a i nl y through email and web spoofing   I n e m a i l  spoofing, fraudulent emails direct users to fraudulent web pages which lure to enter confidential data. In web spoofing, fraudulent websites imitate legitimate web pages to deceive users into entering data. Many anti-phishing solutions are in corporate use to counteract this threat 
200  Malware Malware is software programmed to perform and propagate malicious activities, e.g viruses, worms and Trojans. Viruses require human intervention for propagation, worms are self 
propagating, while Trojans are non-self-replicating Damage from malware includes corruption of data or operating system, installation of spyware, stealing personal credentials or hard disk space etc 
200  Website Threats Website threats refer to attackers exploiting vulnerabilities in legitimate website infecting them and indirectly attacking visitors of 2013 2nd National Conference on Information Assurance \(NCIA 978-1-4799-1288-9/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 129 


these sites. SQL injections, malicious ads, search result redirection are the few techniques which are used to infect the legitimate sites [11   The extensive damage caused by these cyber attacks has lead to the design and implementation of cybersecurity systems Cybersecurity refers to the techniques, processes and methodologies concerned with thwarting illegal or dishonest cyber attacks in order to protect one or more computers on any type of network from any type of damage [12  T h e i m po rt an t  goals of cybersecurity are: 1\ecurely obtain and share information for accurate decision-making, 2\find and deal with vulnerabilities within applications, 3\ prevent unauthorized access and 4\ protect confidential information. Some of the well-known cybersecurity solutions are being provided by Accenture, HP, Invensys, IBM, EADS, CISCO, Unisys etc More recently, the focus of cybersecurity has shifted to monitoring network and Internet traffic for the detection of bad actions as compared to the traditional approach of the detection of bad signatures Specifically, traditional cybersecurity is focused on catching malware by scanning incoming traffic against malware signatures which only detect limited-scope threats that have been already encountered in the past. Also, the development of signatures lags far behind the development of cyber attack techniques. Thus, techniques like intrusion detection systems, firewalls and anti-virus softwares can be easily rendered ineffective by hackers. This scenario has become more crucial in the presence of big data within computer networks \226 petabytes and exabytes of information being transferred daily between nodes make it very easy for hackers to enter any network, hide their presence effectively and cause severe damage efficiently. These big data problems are stressed in the following points 200  Corporations are now extending their data networks to allow partners and customers to access data in different ways to facilitate collaboration, hence making networks more vulnerable to cyber attacks The advent and extensive use of cloud and mobile computing have also generated novel cyber attack methods 200  The advent of big data has seen a corresponding increase in the hacking skills of cyber attackers, and evading traditional security measures such as signature-based tools is now a thing of the past 200  Due to big data, it is possible only to collect a relatively small slice of security information, e.g network logs, Security Information and Event Management \(SIEM\ alerts, access records etc Hence, damage done by novel hacking methods could be realized only after an attack 200  Big data also prevents most security data from being analyzed due to its complexity, e.g., data could be coming from different sources, it could be stored in different formats on different machines, or  could be generating too quickly to make any type of analysis feasible through traditional techniques, computer hardware and software architectures Security Analytics addresses these issues by reinventing the wheel of cybersecurity. It employs techniques from Big Data Analytics \(BDA\o derive useful information for thwarting cyber attacks [13  It is n o w pos s i b l e du e to th e p r og res s in  hardware and software technology that can cope up with big data \(see Section II\ It provides the following unique features 200  A more agile decision-making approach for networks managers with surveillance and monitoring of realtime network streams 200  Dynamic detection of both known and previouslyunknown suspicious/malicious behavior, usage access pattern, transaction or network traffic flow applicable to all types of cyber threats 200  Effective detection of suspicious and malicious behavior  \(least possible false positive rate 200  Ability to deal with suspicious and malicious behavior in real-time 200  Appropriate dashboard-based visualization techniques to provide full visibility \(360 0 view\ of network progress and problems in real-time 200  Appropriate big data hardware and software to cope up with the aforementioned requirements The need for the applications of BDA to cybersecurity is just starting to be realized even in developed countries like USA. In this paper, we present a survey on the BDA cybersecurity applications, focusing mainly on the BDA solutions available and its importance according to the network landscape of the future. This paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we present the basics of BDA and in Section III, we detail the BDA cybersecurity issues and applications. We conclude the paper and present future work in Section IV II  B ASICS OF BIG DATA ANALYTICS  BDA  Big data is data whose complexity hinders it from being managed, queried and analyzed through traditional data storage architectures, algorithms, and query mechanisms. The 223complexity\224 of big data is defined through 3V\222s: 1 volume 226 referring to terabytes, petabytes, or even exabytes \(1000 6 bytes of stored information, 2 variety 226 referring to the co-existence of unstructured, semi-structured and structured data, and 3 velocity 226 referring to the rapid pace at which big data is being generated. . Some researchers have added the 4 th V, i.e veracity to stress the importance of maintaining quality data within an organization. Some primary sources of big data transactions are data from computer networks telecommunication networks, finance, healthcare, social media networks, bio-informatics, E-Commerce, surveillance etc. The domain of Big Data Analytics \(BDA\oncerned with the extraction of value from big data, i.e insights which are nontrivial, previously unknown, implicit and potentially useful These insights have a direct impact on deciding or manipulating the current business strategy and drives what is being called \223From Data to Decision\224 initiative [14  Th e  assumption is that patterns of usage, occurrences or behaviors exist in big data. BDA attempts to fit mathematical models on these patterns through different data mining techniques such as 130 


Predictive Analytics, Cluster Analysis, Association Rule Mining, and Prescriptive Analytics   I nsi ght s fr o m t he s e techniques are typically represented on interactive dashboards and help corporations maintain the competitive edge, increase profits, and enhance their CRM It is important to note that the term \223big\224 in big data is relative; even gigabytes of data can be \223big\224 if it is not being managed or queried efficiently. In such a situation, BDA is largely supported by Apache\222s Hadoop framework, which is an open-source, completely fault-tolerant and a highly scalable distributed computing paradigm. Hadoop is able to distribute BDA tasks across commodity hardware nodes through the MapReduce algorithm \(of Google\.  At an abstract level, data is first \223mapped\224 in a domain-specific format and then processed at different nodes; results from each node are then \223reduced\224 to produce the final result. Hadoop is being used by big companies like Yahoo!, Facebook, Twitter, eBay, and Amazon and some notable Hadoop-based BDA solutions are currently being offered by IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Talend, Cloudera Greenplum, Hortonworks and Datameer. Along with this notable names providing big data hardware architectures are Teradata, HP \(Vertica\, Infobright, Aster Data and ParAccel The basic stages of BDA process are shown in Fig. 1 Initially, data to be analyzed is selected from real-time streams of big data and pre-processed \(cleaned\. This is called ETL Extract Transform Load\pically and is a strenuous activity that can take up to 60% of the effort of BDA, e.g., catering for inconsistent, incomplete and missing values, normalizing discretizing and reducing data, ensuring statistical quality of data through boxplots, cluster analysis, normality testing etc and understanding data through descriptive statistics correlations, hypothesis testing, histograms etc.\Once data is cleaned, it is stored in BDA databases \(cloud, mobile, network servers etc.\d analyzed with analytics with a possible use of Hadoop if required. The results are then shown in interactive dashboards using computer visualization techniques. It is important to note that BDA is a \223trial-and-error\224 activity driven by feedback to any of previous stage in order to refine the outputs through \223tuning\224 of analytical approaches             Fig. 1 Basic BDA process Fig. 1 also shows well-known corporate solutions \(in parentheses\ that are available for different BDA stages, e.g Informatica for ETL, Netezza for analytics etc 1  III  SECURITY ANALYTICS WITH BDA  Compared to traditional approaches, security analytics provides a \223richer\224 cybersecurity context by separating what is 223normal\224 from what is \223abnormal\224, i.e., separating the patterns generated by legitimate users from those generated by suspicious or malicious users A  Big Data Sources for Security Analytics The concept of \223data\224 for security analytics is expansive and can be categorized into passive and active sources [1   Passive data sources can include 200  Computer-based data, e.g., geographical IP location computer security health certificates, keyboard typing and clickstream patterns, WAP data 200  Mobile-based data, e.g., GPS location, network location, WAP data 200  Physical data of user, e.g., time and location of physical access of network 200  Human Resource data, e.g., organizational role and privilege of the user 200  Travel data, e.g., travel patterns, destinations, and itineraries 200  SIEM data, e.g., network logs, threat database application access data 200  Data from external sources, e.g., rogue IPs, external threats Active \(relating to real-time\ata sources can include 200  Credential data, e.g., user name and password 200  One-time passwords, e.g., for online access 200  Digital Certificates 200  Knowledge-based questions, e.g., \223what is your typical    activity on Saturdays from 3 pm to 6 pm?\224 200  Biometric identification data, e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition, voice recognition, handwriting recognition 200  Social media data, e.g., Twitter, Facebook, internal office network etc Analytics applied on passive and active sources collectively will provide a 360 0 view of network traffic, e.g., by singling out an abnormal behavior in the access pattern of a given user. Appropriate prevention techniques can then be applied e.g., lock accounts, quarantine, modify network settings multiple authentications, alert on an on-going fraud etc    1 Description of these solutions can be obtained from their respective websites 131 


B  Security Analytics Model A security analytics model has the following primary characteristics   200  Diverse Data Sources Data can be acquired from many sources \(as mentioned in \(A\. The frequency and complexity of data sources should have no effect on the final BDA outputs 200  Enterprise-level Data Warehouse All network security data should be stored in an enterprise warehouse, with network performance measures stored in fact tables, and query data in dimension tables \(time, location, customer etc.\. This is important as data mining \(BDA\ solutions are now strongly coupled with a warehouse, e.g., Oracle, SQL Server, DB2 etc. Different managers \(requiring different analytics\ can generate their own security analytics warehousing process 200  ETL Tools These tools can help perform ETL at two levels, i.e., at a generic level over a complete data source, and at specific level over selected data in order to apply one or more BDA techniques on it. Some common names are Talend, Informatica, Pentaho etc 200  BDA Engines These engines combine Hadoop sophisticated hardware and analytics softwares to process real-time network streams. As mentioned above, these engines are typically coupled with a warehouse allowing network managers to employ warehouse resources, e.g., ETL, dashboards, data maintenance etc. for the BDA tasks as well 200  Monitoring Systems These system monitor network traffic and compare it with behavior and risk models discovered by BDA, or those given by security experts based on their experience 200  Advanced Security Controls These are used to impart appropriate security measures in real-time e.g., additional user authentication, blocking highly suspicious transactions, calling customers while the transaction is in progress etc 200  Interactive Dashboards These apply Business Intelligence techniques to display the real-time cybersecurity status using interactive tools, e.g graphs, charts, tables etc. A lot of research work is being carried out to develop novel visualization techniques which are at par with BDA outputs [1   200  Robust Security Infrastructure This should be able to facilitate efficient communications between different locations or regions along with efficient execution of queries using BDA architectures 200  Big Data Integration Infrastructure This will facilitate integration of data from diverse number of data sources, which are quite common as mentioned in \(A C  Security Analytics for Threat Detection The largest application of security analytics is in threat monitoring and incident investigations, which is of major concern to both financial and defense institutions. The focus is on discovering and learning both known and unknown cyber attack patterns, which is expected to remarkably influence the efficiency of identifying hidden threats faster, track down attackers and predict future attacks with increasing accuracy \(minimum false positive rate\.  Some examples of how BDA can help with respect to different security dimensions are as follows 200  Network Traffic Detecting and predicting suspicious sources and destinations, along with abnormal traffic patterns 200  Web Transactions Detecting and predicting abnormal user access patterns, particularly in the usage of critical resources or activities 200  Network Servers Detection and predicting abnormal patterns related to server manipulation e.g., abnormal or sudden configuration changes non-compliance with pre-defined policy etc 200  Network Source Detecting and predicting abnormal usage patterns of any machine, e.g related to the type of data the source transmits processes and receives 200  User Credentials Detecting anomalies with respect to a user, or a group of user not complying with its inherent access behavior, e.g., abnormal access time or transaction amount These activities are bringing a revolutionary change in the domains of security management, identity and access management, fraud prevention and governance, risk and compliance, e.g., through centralization of threat data and alert management system, correlating hundred thousands of network events per second, real-time continuous assessment of risk, distinction between legitimate and abnormal activities, along with appropriate prioritization of risks D  Steps for Implementing A Security Analytics Solution BDA is a relatively novel field. The corporate sector in Pakistan is typically more tilted towards the use of traditional simpler\nalytical techniques as compared to advanced ones 2  Hence, it could be some time before the Pakistani network companies embrace the BDA technology whole heartedly. A major reason for this trend is the uncertainty with respect to the usefulness of BDA outputs, as acquiring useful outputs is a strenuous recursive activity which requires appropriate BDA expertise \(data scientists\. There is also a lack of in-depth technical knowledge regarding basic BDA concepts, e.g Hadoop, Predictive Analytics, Cluster Analysis etc. Finally there are not many proprietary BDA cybersecurity solutions that are well-known in the cybersecurity world. With these    2 This statement is derived from the first author\222s experience of training and consultancy with various Pakistani companies 132 


limitations in mind, we propose the following steps to the corporations for adopting a security analytics solution [15   200  Develop Security Analytics Business Strategy The first step is to create a business strategy for implementing the analytics platform. For this, CIOs and CTOs need to initially build the domain knowledge by looking at some of the successful analytics-based security solutions \(detailed in next section\ to determine their feasibility, impact and value for their own organizations 200  Participate in Analytics Trainings and Workshops  The real impact of threat detection can only be realized by C-level executives if they understand the technical details of BDA. Hence, attending BDA workshops and training sessions is particularly recommended. Especially because several opensource analytical tools, e.g., Rapid Miner, allow users to experiment with a host of BDA techniques through simple drag-and-drop functionality. Hands-on experiments with these tools on security data sets can provide in-depth knowledge of the expected BDA outputs and aid in developing the analytics strategy 200  Implement a Centralized Data Management Infrastructure This should allow seamless integration of network streams from various sources along with tools to support ETL, stream processing data warehousing, data storage and query execution mechanisms. The infrastructure should be flexible to extension as well as to modification, e.g., a change of ETL tools 200  Implement an Analytics Platform This should support experimentation with a diverse number of BDA tools, techniques and algorithms. An efficient communication medium should be provided with the data repository to acquire the data and to store BDA outputs 200  Hire Data Scientist as Consultant As acquiring BDA outputs is typically lengthy task requiring background knowledge of many domains, it is advised to hire a data scientist as a consultant who can guide the execution of the BDA process at different stages 200  Implement a \223Network Monitoring\224 Layer This layer monitors the network streams at run time by employing the set of mathematical models that have been mined by BDA. It can also employ any type of security knowledge given by the system designers based on their experience, or knowledge from some governmental database regarding new types of external threats. This layer should always be \223live\224 as network streams are monitored 24/7. It intimidates the 223Suspicion Alert\224 later if any suspicious behavior is detected 200  Implement a \223Suspicion Alert\224 Layer This layer implements all the measures that can be taken to ensure cybersecurity, e.g., alert authorities of an ongoing suspicious transaction, lock access, crosscheck user identity etc. It must be ensured that this module is always \223live\224, even if the analytics platform is not being used at a given time 200  How to Streamline Analytics with Current Workflow This is the most important question facing C-level executives. Due to the uncertainty which accompanies BDA, it is advisable to complete the aforementioned steps within a minimum level of resources initially. These steps should also be implemented independently of the current workflow with collaboration occurring only where needed. For instance, a team of 4-5 people along with the data scientist should be given 5-6 months to implement the analytics solution, as an organizational project. Once the managers are satisfied with the outputs, steps can be taken to infuse the analytics platform gradually in the current workflow E  Corporate Security Analytics Solutions In this section, we list some of the important corporate cybersecurity solutions.

We have shown how Security Analytics \226 the application of Big Data Analytics techniques to derive actionable intelligence and insights from streams in real-time \226 is rapidly becoming a strong need for cybersecurity setups. Although the current adoption of analytical solutions is by no means revolutionary \(as shown by this study by Teradata [2 th e a w arenes s of adoption is in creas i ng rapidly. To support this cause, in the paper, we specifically mention the different types of big data sources for such an analytics solution, the primary components of a security analytics model, some examples of security analytics outputs steps for implementing a security analytics solution, and finally, the corporates which are offering analytics solutions for cybersecurity along with their features. We are currently applying security analytics techniques on network-related datasets of our institute in order to try and decrease the false positive rate of a predictive model for fraudulent transactions  R EFERENCES  1  MessageLabs Intelligence: 2010 Annual Security Report, Symantec 2  M.T.

Table XII Size of SPT on Random Graphs   For unweighted graphs we can deploy Breadth First Search which can compute the single-source shortest path problem in O\(m+n To compute the all-pairs shortest paths we can directly use Dijkstra n times or Floyd-Warshall algorithm which all need time These algorithms are all not suitable for large scale graphs The 2-HOP algorithm proposed by Conhen et al adopts labeling mechanism to answer reachability and distance query Each vertex u records a list of intermediate vertices which it can reach along with the shortest distance and a list of intermediate vertices which can reach it along with the shortest distance To compute the shortest distance between u and v we simply check all the common intermediate vertices between and and choose the vertex s such that s,v is minimized for all  In recent years a lot of algorithms have been proposed for graph reachability queries 6 7 8 9 10 These algorithms mainly discover the connectivity of relevant vertexes but cannot compute the shortest distance between them Vertex cover approaches has lately become the mainstream 10 Through the selecting an approximate minimum vertex cover and constructing an index the reachability query can be answered ef“ciently However they still do not consider the distance computing Ruoming Jin et al put forward a highway-centric labeling approach in which is our counterpart in e xperiment They deploy a novel labeling scheme which select a group of vertices to construct a tree-like highway index structure for answering distance queries in large sparse graphs It can provides better labeling size than 2-hop However in our experimental result we can nd that this method cannot handle large graphs ef“ciently in compare with our algorithm VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we propose a new index construction approach SPTI to answer the shortest path distance query We nd that the distribution imbalance of the edges between the vertices in the real world graphs and utilize the vertices which have more connection with others as index to answer the shortest path distance query To nd a near optimal salutation we propose to selectively choose a group of vertices from the original graph to create a trunk for preserving the shortest paths information and compact the index size Compared with existing methods such as 2HOP online BFS and HCL our algorithm can reduces the index size signi“cantly and answers the shortest path distance query ef“ciently In the future we plan to apply our index structure on dynamic graphs A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was supported by the Normal Project Foundation of Education Department of LiaoNing Province Grant No L2012045 R EFERENCES  E W  Dijkstra A note on tw o problems in conne xion with graphs Numerische Mathematic 1\(1 Dec 1959  Richard Bellman On a routing problem Quarterly of Applied Mathematics 16 8790 1958  Eric W eisstein Flo yd-W arshall Algorithm W olfram MathWorld Retrieved 13 November 2009  Edith Cohen Eran Halperin Haim Kaplan and Uri Zwick Reachability and distance queries via 2-hop labels SIAM J Comput 32\(5 2003  Haixun W ang Hao He Jun Y ang Philip S Y u and Jef fre y Xu Yu Dual labeling Answering graph reachability queries in constant time In ICDE 2006  Y angjun Chen and Y ibin Chen An Ef cient Algorithm for Answering Graph Reachability queries In ICDE 2008  J Cheng J X Y u X Lin H W ang and P  S Y u F ast computing reachability labelings for large graphs with high compression rate In EDBT 2008  J Cheng J X Y u X Lin H W ang and P  S Y u F ast computation of reachability labeling for large graphs In EDBT 2006  Ruoming Jin Ning Ruan Saikat De y and Jef fre y Y u Xu SCARAB Scaling Reachability Computation on Large Graphs In SIGMOD 2012  James Cheng Zechao shang and Hong Cheng K-Reach Who is in Your Small World In VLDB 2012  Ruoming Jin Ning Ruan Y ang Xiang and V ictor E Lee A Highway-Centric Labeling Approach for Answering Distance Queries on Large Sparse Graphs In SIGMOD 2012  W asserman S and F aust K Social Netw ork Analysis Cambridge Cambridge University Press 1994  J Scott Social Netw ork Analysis A Hand-book London Sage Publications 2002  F  Chains Karinthy  Ev erything is Dif ferent Atheneum Press 1929  P  Sanders and D Schultes Highw ay hierarchies hasten e xact shortest path queries In 17th Eur Symp Algorithms\(ESA 2005  http://k onect.uni-k oblenz.de/netw orks/citeseer  accessed May 18 2013  http://snap.stanford.edu/data accessed May 18 2013

Innovation stakeholders’ social effect and industrial effect can be obtained upon ij B  and ij G set according to relation between innovation stakeholders  Model 4.1 points out  that the value of Gij  directly affects social benefits and sector benefits. Large Gij  can lead to increasing benefits of the entire industry and the entire social growth Bij reflects big organization’s impact on businesses. Only strengthening the inter agent association within big organization and enhancing the str ategic partnership between enterprises can jointly promote the development of the entire industry, and bring more social benefits, so that each agent can be improved   5 Summary This paper puts forward the concept of the big organization based on the CSM t heory. It introduces the basic implication of the big organization and theoretical framework of the big organization including: the big organization's perspective  overall perspective, dynamic perspective, and new resource perspective; the big organizat ion’s sense  the purpose of the organizational structure is innovation, organizational activities around the flow of information, breaking the traditional organizational structure, encouraging self run structure, and blurring organizational boundaries; the big organization’s platform  the platform ecosystem of the big organization ; the big organization’s operation mode  borderless learning mode, and cluster effect; the big organization’s theory  active management theory  leading consumers, and culture  entropy reduction theory  negative culture entropy and humanistic ecology theory  inspiring humanity, and circuit theory  a virtuous circle, and collaborative innovation theory  collaborative innovation stakeholder. This paper also discusses culture entropy reduction theory of the big organization  negative culture entropy, and coordinated innovation theory  innovation stakeholders collaboration. Culture entropy change model and collaborative in novation model are constructed   The research has just begun for the big organization. It also needs further improvement but remains the trend of the times   Reference  1  Gordon Pellegrinetti, Joseph Bentsman.

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor For example, consider the following ASRS report \(ACN 1031837 Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 m iles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of ri ght rolling… I selected a max rate climb mode in the FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900 We asked ATC for the type ahead of us and reported the wake encounter. The 900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were  Synopsis  B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900 with resultant roll and moderate chop What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that could be applied to future predictive applications CAUSAL FACTORS Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation  Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware  Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently  There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics  Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency  Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information  When structured, validated and linked these data sources become significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually  Today’s cloud based technologies offer a solution CONCLUSIONS 


Conclusions:  Our Approach  masFlight’s data warehouse and analysis methods provide a valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based analytics of aviation data sets  masFlight’s hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and scale requirements of the industry  masFlight’s method is well suited for airline performance review competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in airline and airport operations as well as government applications CONCLUSIONS
