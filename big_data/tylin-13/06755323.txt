High performance image analytics is an important challenge for big data processing as image and video data is a huge portion of big data e.g. generated by a tremendous amount of image sensors worldwide This paper presents a case study for image analytics namely the parallel connected component labeling \(CCL\which is one of the first steps of 
image analytics in general. It is shown that a high performance CCL implementation can be obtained on a heterogeneous platform if parts of the algorithm are processed on a fine grain parallel field programmable gate array \(FPGA and a multicore processor simultaneously. The proposed highly efficient architecture and implementation is suitable for the processing of big image and video data in motion and reduces the amount of memory required by the hardware architecture significantly for typical image sizes

I I NTRODUCTION One of the big data challenges are image analytic tools applicable to photos, surveillance videos and e.g. scientific data from sensors that can reach massive proportions over time 1 h o w t h at 2  5 q u intillio n b y tes are generated every day and 90% of all data was generated sin  Gen e ral l y  bi g dat a i s def i n e d bas e d on i t s  main characteristics which are growing in three dimensions volume, velocity and variety [2  In this ne w co ncep t, th e volume of unstructured data is in the scale of petabytes, and creation of them is in the fraction of the second In the literature big data in motion is defined as continues data 
streams at high data transfer rate. Such big data represent data sets that cannot be analyzed with conventional algorithms and standard hardware platforms [1 4 Du e to  the typical memory capacity and bandwidth limitations which determine the overall throughput, the processing of the continuously increasing amount of data is done online and locally on the streamed data. The new scale of volume velocity and variety requires redesigning a number of infrastructure components and algorithms to support the large-volume, complex and growing data [4 5   Modern high performance heterogeneous computing approaches based on field-programmable gate arrays FPGAs\d general-purpose computing on graphic 
processing units \(GPGPUs\ combined with general purpose processors enable the processing of large scale problems in the field of e.g. genomics, bioinformatics, graph analytics social network analytics, etc. which was not possible before s  o r i n s t an ce Con v e y  C o m p u t er propos ed a high-performance hybrid core system which pairs Intel processors with a coprocesso r of FPGAs which is able to execute data-intensive problems much more effectively IBM has also established Netezza as an advance high performance data analytical tool which has led to an exponential growth in the field of big data analytics Netezza is based on IBM blade architecture and uses FPGAs 
to filter the input data before processing it [1 Scientific data are defined in four different types: raw data, structured data, published data and data linked to the publication [5 t yp e o f  the scie nti f ic d a ta is ra w d a ta  which is generated from observation and experiment of different phenomena. For inst ance biological, climate and life sciences generate massive am ounts of scientific data [5  ag e s an d v ideos h a v e t h e h i gh es t a m oun t of  v o l u m e  among scientific data and are analytically prepared to gain additional value [8 9 T h e p r ep aratio n is d o n e b y  extracting various properties of the image such as objects 
and movements The first step in analytic image processing for many video-based applications is segmentation which is followed by connected-component labeling o n n ect edcomponent labeling performs the task of labeling all connected image pixels in a binarized image in order to identify objects or extract certain features of an object. The throughput of the CCL can strongly influence the performance of the whole image processing system as it is one of the first complex processing steps in image processing applications. For this reason, a parallel CCL algorithm with memory-efficient architecture is proposed here suited for high performance image processing 
applications such as image analytics. It is based on a scalable single pass CCL algorithm which is memoryefficient and therefore esp ecially suited for FPGAs. By using the proposed architecture and algorithm it is possible to achieve a high processing throughput for performing connected component labeling of streamed images without the need of buffering a full image, which would cause a performance limitation either due to limited FPGA-internal memory or due to limited FPGA-external memory bandwidth

In the next section, the state of the art and related algorithms which cover memory-efficient and scalable CCL algorithms are presented. In Section III the video and image analytics framework are presented and the proposed algorithm and architecture are discussed. In the fourth Section experimental results are shown and compared to existing approaches in the literature. Fina lly, the paper is concluded in Section V II R ELATED W ORK Connected component labeling \(CCL\ one of the first steps in image analytics algorithms As an alternative to the classical two-pass CCL algorithm more sophisticated single pass algorithms have gained interest for reconfigurable computing recently. The classical CCL algorithms are completed after two scans of the same image and have sequential dependencies. Therefore a high amount of storage and memory for storing full images is requir  In order to store the full im age and labels, a memory with the same size as the original image is required. The labels are characterized by the position of the pixel within the image. If the pixel belongs to the background area of the image a special background label is used, otherwise its label is determined by the labels of adjacent pixels However, Baily et al. proposed FPGA based single pass architectures T h e pro posed arch itectu r e h a s t w o  drawbacks: Its worst case memory requirement is related to the height and width of the processed image, and also due to the lack of parallelism one pixel is processed per clock cycle causing a performance bottleneck in stream processing Ma et al. reduced the memory requirements significantly  t h e alg o ri t h m des c ri be d i n 14 by reu s i n g th e l a bels As a result, the required worst case memory is proportional to the width of the processed image. Kumar et al. proposed a parallel architecture and enhances the single pass algorithm used in  T h e m a in idea i s t o st ore the w h o l e i m a ges in  prior to processing. In order to gain performance speed-up the image is divided in to several slices, and different CCL units have to independently process them After that, each line from the image slice is fetched sequentially at a time in a round robin manner, and each CCL unit sends a vector to a global FIFO memory which acts as a vector collector. The vector mainly describes the regions of the processed image slice excluding the edges. In the next step a coalescing unit CU determines whether two regions of adjacent slices are connected and belong to the same object by processing one or both border of the image slice For the merge operation it is essential to connect the CCL units to the CU and perform the merging operation of neighboring image slices in a round-robin manner Additionally, to have a succes sful merging each edge region needs to have a unique, distinguishable label in its image slice. In order to overcome with the limitations of  [1 a modified version was proposed  [1 hic h r e d uc e s drastically the amount of memory required for processing by using two types of labels, slice local label and slice global labels. In this paper, a CU was introduced which improve real-time processing of CCL architecture by merging the results of image slices in a memory-efficient way III V IDEO AND I MAGE A NALYTICS F RAMEWORK Image analytics requires the processing of videos and images to transform pixel level information to object based information for the analysis of certain properties specific for the considered application domain like science industrial measurement techniques or life science applications. Videos are considered as sequence of images with a specific frame rate For high-speed scientific applications the frame rate may reach up to several hundred or thousand frames per second or more such that the video data of a single image sensor are in the range of 1 to 10 Gigabytes per second or 0.1 to 1 Petabyte per day To cope with this big data in motion, a high performance reconfigurable computing framework is proposed in this section Th e overall framework is composed of a high-speed input data stream a heterogeneous platform based on high performance reconfigurable computing devices using field programmable gate arrays \(FPGA and multi-core CPUs to which the image processing functions are mapped jointly. As shown in Figure 1, the input data stream is connected via several high speed links to the FPGAs which are able to acquire and analyze images as well as videos with a very high frame rate in real-time. Therefore, the framework based on the heterogeneous platform is equipped with integrated image processing capabilities such as segmentation component labeling and feature extraction Figure 1 High performance reconfigurable computing framework for proccessing real-time image stream processing The following image processing steps, which enable a massive data reduction from GBytes of Pixel data to only KBytes of abstract object descriptors - so called feature vectors, are transferred to the multi-core CPU. This reduction enables the framework to output information on every object in every frame even in real-time for very high frame rates The amount of data which has to be transferred from the FPGA is reduced by several orders of magnitude in this way The image processing architecture realized on the FPGA has the tasks of image segmentation and feature extraction For segmentation which is the process of separating the

Figure 2 Grayscale raw image taken by image sensor and its histogram object from the background, thresholding is applied. By using this method all pixels ha ving an intensity value over a certain threshold are considered as an object and converted to black and all pixels below this threshold are converted to white and considered as background Accordingly, a binary image is generated from the origin al image. In this case, the threshold value for separating the objects from the background is of major importance. In this work the method proposed in is used f o r se gm e n ta tio n b y ge ne ra ting a histogram of the captured grayscale image of a scientific application in the field of spray process, as seen in Figure 2 The threshold value is calcula ted by using the arithmetic mean value of the two peaks detected in the histogram representing the objects and the background The next step is feature extraction based on connected component labeling The main challenge is processing high image frame rate in real-time which requires high bandwidth in the range of 10 to 100 Gbit/s. To overcome this problem, a highly optimized and sophisticated architecture is used. Due to the limited resources in embedded systems, algorithms which are especially dedicated to FPGA architectures have been proposed [12 13, 14, 16  The connected component labeling architecture proposed in this work is based on Bailey d Ma 13  w i t h a  parallel processing extension Figure 4 shows the architecture for sequential processing d i t c on s i s t s of several components which are described as follows: the neighborhood context block provides four registers A, B, C and D containing four previously processed pixels connected to the current pixel A, B and C contain the label of the previous row and D contains the previous pixel label The row buffer block is used for caching the new labels since they are not saved in a temporary image The key difference from  is t h at t h e labels are reused in every row, and cause the reduction in the need for memory The merger table decides any equality as a result of mergers on the previous row. The translation table modifies a label allocated to the pervious row to the current new label. The label for the current pixel is selected in the label selection block based on the labels of its neighborhood Figure 3 Segmentation of grayscale image with calculated threshold value The data merging unit records the features of each region by monitoring the labels of the pixels in the neighborhood context block. Each region has one entry in the data merging unit indexed by the region's label. Whenever a region is updated, its entry in the data merging unit is updated as well Figure 4 Connected Component Labeling Architecture proposed in [13  A bounding box is defined by two coordinates A and B Coordinate A indicates the upper left corner and coordinate B indicates the lower right corner. In order to extract the bounding box for each object the structure and the merging process within the data merging unit is proposed [4 ,6 The data merging unit has to be changed as shown in Figure 5 to provide bounding box extraction The modified block has two inputs a and b, one for providing the currently processed pixelís coordinates and the other one for giving information on the neighbor pixe ls label. The input data is read from the corresponding data table. For each extracted object a merging unit as well as a data table is necessary. To

find the bounding box for two entries of the data table the following equations are used 1 2 3 4 Figure 5 Data Merging Unit for extracting several features of the image objects simultaneously In order to handle high data throughput a parallelization approach is proposed. Thus, the image is divided into several slices, and each slice is processed separately in parallel.  In each slices the objects are identified and merged by a central unit called the coalescing unit As a result several pixels are processed simultaneously and speedup based on the number of image slices can be obtained Figure 6 through Figure 8 show the processing steps for feature extraction. Figure 6 shows the binary image after segmentation. In the next step, the image is divided into several image slices for processing in CCL processing units which are working in parallel As it is shown in Figure 7 the bounding box is extracted by each CCL proceeding unit In the last step, the bounding boxes touching the slice borders will be merged together to have the correct result This step is depicted in Figure 8 Figure 6 Binarized image after thresholding Figure 7 Extracted object features for all sub-images Figure 8 Merged object features for input image IV E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS In the following, experime ntal data to examine the potential of heterogeneous systems consisting of reconfigurable logic devices and general purpose processors GPP\ the context of an image processing system for big data analytics is provided For this examination the approaches from  n d [16] are ev al u a t e d on bot h  reconfigurable logic devices and in software on a general purpose processor The approach in a i n s a s p eedu p f r o m di v i ding t h e  image in several vertical slices using the architecture from  s lice process o rs an d m e rg i n g th e res u lt s  u s i n g  a coalescing unit.

In general, the irregular data structures and the sequential algorithm of the coalescing process are better suited for a GPP software implementation. Considering the performance results of both slice processing units and the coalescing unit on a heterogeneous platform, the conclusion is that the slice processing units should be implemented on a FPGAs and Figure 9 Achievable frame rate for an image with 0.5 Megapixels Figure 10 Achievable frame rate for an image with 2.1 Megapixels Figure 11 Achievable frame rate of maximum 800 fps for an image with 6.3 MegaPixels and a throughput of 5 Gigapixels per second the coalescing unit should be implemented on a GPP in order to achieve maximum performance for big data image analytics. Achieving a throughput of 5 Gigapixel/s is equivalent to 0.4 Petabytes per day, so the implementation on a heterogeneous platform with a single mid-sized FPGA

The hardware architecture is highly optimized to the FPGA structure while for the presented software solution further research has to be done to enable a proper comparison, but no decrease in speedup by less than one order of magnitude can be expected.  This enables the FPGA architecture to process an image stream consisting of several different image slices simultaneously in real-time. For the case of processing a single image, only one slice processing unit of the SPU array can be used. Still the FPGA architecture accelerates the processing by approximately a factor of 2 compared to a single GPP core. By using the parallelization scheme from  e v e ral s l i ce proces s i ng  u n i ts can be used to process a single image in parallel enabling a higher throughput. Figure 9 through Figure 11 show the results for this approach where the coalescing unit is realized for FPGAs. Depending on the image size up to 4.5 GPixels/s can be processed. To study the performance of the coalescing process on a GPP, a prototype implementation of a software version of the coalescing unit was realized. The result for the throughput given in Table 2 can be achieved for the case that the feature vectors provided by the slic e processing units are already stored in the systems RAM and can be accessed at full memory bandwidth TABLE II SOFTWARE COALESCING THROUGHPUT IN GIGAPIXEL PER SECOND

can be scaled up linearly with a several FPGAs and processor cores under the cond ition that several different images are processed in parallel. Beyond these performance considerations, mapping the irregular data structure and the sequential part of the algorithm, which is the coalescing algorithm, to the GPP is of advantage because of its higher processing frequency. For the regular data structures used in the slice processing units carryin g out the parallel part of the algorithm, the FPGA achieves a higher throughput due to its parallel architecture V C ONCLUSION Images and videos have the highest amount of volume among big data and therefore high performance image processing plays an important role for image analytics. In this paper we have investigated a parallel component labeling algorithm including feature extraction with a broad set of features as an important part of an image analytics framework. It is shown here that the performance of the proposed parallel component labeling algorithm with generalized feature extraction is accelerated and optimized if it is mapped to and executed on a heterogeneous hardware platform based on a fine-grained field-programmable gate array and a multi-core processor. For the parallelized connected component labeling \(CCL\orithm of this paper, the required memory compared to the requirement of algorithms known in the literature is reduced significantly on a heterogeneous hardware platform for typical image sizes even when compared to similar sliced parallel single pass CCL algorithms and architectures such that memory size nor memory bandwidth of the hardware platform has an impact on the performance The basic structure of the algorithm and architecture is a set of parallel CCL units generating feature data of image slices being coalesced in a separate and subsequent coalesci ng unit. In order to achieve highest performance, it was shown that the parallel CCL units should be implemented on fine-grained FPGAs and the coalescing unit should be implemented in software on a multi-core processor. With the achieved throughput of 5 Gigapixels per second or 0.4 Petabytes per day the implementation on such a heterogeneous platform with a single mid-sized FPGA can be scaled up linearly with a plurality of FPGAs. Thus, the concept has been proven to be ideally suited for high performance image analytics for big data in motion A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the German Research Foundation \(DFG\or the financial support.

overhead of job initialization in Hadoop is much larger than cNeural VIII C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK The past several years have witnessed an ever-increasing growth speed of data To address large scale neural network training problems in this paper we proposed a customized parallel computing platform called cNeural Different from many previous studies cNeural is designed and built on perspective of the whole architecture from the distributed storage system at the bottom level to the parallel computing framework and algorithm on the top level Experimental results show that cNeural is able to train neural networks over millions of samples and around 50 times faster than Hadoop with dozens of machines In the future we plan to develop and add more neural network algorithms such as deep belief networks into cNeural in order to make further support training large scale neural networks for various problems Finally with more technical work such as GUI done we would like to make it as a toolbox and open source it A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work is funded in part by China NSF Grants No 61223003 the National High Technology Research and Development Program of China 863 No 2011AA01A202 and the USA Intel Labs University Research Program R EFERENCES  C Bishop Neural networks for pattern recognition  Clarendon press Oxford 1995  J Collins Sailing on an ocean of 0s and 1s  Science  vol 327 no 5972 pp 1455Ö1456 2010  S Haykin Neural networks and learning machines  Englewood Cliffs NJ Prentice Hall 2009  R Hecht-Nielsen Theory of the backpropagation neural network in Proc Int Joint Conf on Neural Networks,IJCNN IEEE 1989 pp 593Ö605  Y  Loukas  Artiìcial neural netw orks in liquid chromatography Efìcient and improved quantitative structure-retention relationship models Journal of Chromatography A  vol 904 pp 119Ö129 2000  N Serbedzija Simulating artiìcial neural netw orks on parallel architectures Computer  vol 29 no 3 pp 56Ö63 1996  M Pethick M Liddle P  W erstein and Z Huang P arallelization of a backpropagation neural network on a cluster computer in Proc Int Conf on parallel and distributed computing and systems PDCS  2003  K Ganeshamoorthy and D Ranasinghe On the performance of parallel neural network implementations on distributed memory architectures in Proc Int Symp on Cluster Computing and the Grid CCGRID  IEEE 2008 pp 90Ö97  S Suresh S Omkar  and V  Mani P arallel implementation of back-propagation algorithm in networks of workstations IEEE Trans Parallel and Distributed Systems  vol 16 no 1 pp 24Ö34 2005  Z Liu H Li and G Miao Mapreduce-based backpropagation neural network over large scale mobile data in Proc Int Conf on Natural Computation ICNC  vol 4 IEEE 2010 pp 1726Ö1730  M Glesner and W  P  ochm  uller Neurocomputers an overview of neural networks in VLSI  CRC Press 1994  Y  Bo and W  Xun Research on the performance of grid computing for distributed neural networks International Journal of Computer Science and Netwrok Security  vol 6 no 4 pp 179Ö187 2006  C Chu S Kim Y  Lin Y  Y u  G  Bradski A Ng and K Olukotun Map-reduce for machine learning on multicore Advances in neural information processing systems  vol 19 pp 281Ö288 2007  U Seif fert  Artiìcial neural netw orks on massi v ely parallel computer hardware Neurocomputing  vol 57 pp 135Ö150 2004  D Calv ert and J Guan Distrib uted artiìcial neural netw ork architectures in Proc Int Symp on High Performance Computing Systems and Applications  IEEE 2005 pp 2Ö10  H Kharbanda and R Campbell F ast neural netw ork training on general purpose computers in Proc Int Conf on High Performance Computing HiPC  IEEE 2011  U Lotri  c and e a Dobnikar A Parallel implementations of feed-forward neural network using mpi and c on  net platform in Proc Int Conf on Adaptive and Natural Computing Algorithms  Coimbra 2005 pp 534Ö537  Q V  Le R Monga and M e a De vin Building high-le v e l features using large scale unsupervised learning in Proc Int Conf on Machine Learning ICML  ACM 2012 pp 2Ö16  J Ekanayak e and H e a Li T wister a runtime for iterati v e mapreduce in Proc of the 19th ACM International Symposium on High Performance Distributed Computing  ACM 2010 pp 810Ö818  Y  Bu B Ho we M Balazinska and M D Ernst Haloop Efìcient iterative data processing on large clusters Proc of the VLDB Endowment  vol 3 no 1-2 pp 285Ö296 2010  M Zaharia M Cho wdhury  T  Das A Da v e  J  Ma M McCauley M Franklin S Shenker and I Stoica Resilient distributed datasets A fault-tolerant abstraction for in-memory cluster computing in Proc USENIX Conf on Networked Systems Design and Implementation  USENIX Association 2012 pp 2Ö16 384
