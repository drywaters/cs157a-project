attention. Although there have existed a variety of labeling schemes such as prefix-based la beling interval-based labeling and integer-based labeling and as well as their variants, these labeling schemes show weakness in one asp ect or another Interval-based labeling schemes can answer AD PC and DO queries efficiently and can be created fast, but they can’t process SR and LCA Prefix-based labeling and integer-ba sed labeling can process all of common structural relationship queries, but they are far less efficient than interval-based labe ling for AD and DO queries. In this paper, we propose a new in terval-based labeling scheme called Triple code, which has a good performance on construction time, storage cost and query cost. In addition, to optimize the 
performance of LCA computation in XML data with big depth we propose iTriple code \(Triple code with information of ancestor nstrate the benefits of our proposed labeling schemes over the previous approaches 
I I NTRODUCTION The rise of XML as a de fact o standard for data exchange and representation has generated a lot of interests on querying XML documents modeled as an ordered tree. Query languages such as XPath and XQuery have been designed to process XML data, which include queries of structural relationships among nodes such as Parent/Child \(PC\Ancestor/Descendant AD\bling Relationship SR\ocument Order \(DO 
Keywords—Labeling scheme struct ural relationship queries styling; XML Database 
Moreover, to facilitate users to search XML Data, lots of algorithms for XML keyword search have been proposed, in which computing Lowest Common Ancestor \(LCA\s the core operator. To speed up processing of these common structural relationships queries, a lot of labeling schemes have been proposed. Hence, a good labeling scheme should have the following characteristics 
002 002 
Compact: it must be enough compact and fit in the main memory Flexible it can support all kinds of structural relationship queries including AD, PC, SP, DO and LCA 
002 
Efficient the structural relationships can be computed fast using the labeling and it can be created efficiently Existing labeling scheme can be classified into three major classes interval-based labeling 1 003 4 prefix-b ased lab elin g  5    and i n t e ger-based l a bel i n g 7 8 Thes e l abel i ng schem e s show weakness in one aspect or another Interval-based labeling schemes are efficient and compact which have been a huge success in XML twig pattern matching Another significant advantage of them is that this type of labeling is independent of the structure of the tree like depth of a tree. However, this kind of scheme is not flexible, which 
can’t support the determination of SR and the computation of LCA. Prefix-based labeling schemes are flexible, which have been widely adopted in XML keyword search processing Dewey labeling scheme [5 th e represen tativ e o f th is k i n d o f schemes, which has an outstanding performance in computing LCA. However compared with interval-based labeling, this kind of labeling isn’t compact and isn’t efficient for AD, PC and DO. Moreover, because they are influenced by depth and fan-out of nodes, this kind of schemes doesn’t work well for deep and complex trees. Integer-based labeling schemes are flexible and more compact than prefix-based labeling schemes 
But, this kind of labeling has the longest construction time in the three kinds of labe ling. In addition, because, in testing the structural relationship of nodes, they will use arithmetic operations among big integers, such as mod and subtraction they are less efficient than interval based labeling. The state-ofthe-art labeling scheme, Branch code 7 bel o ngs t o t h i s ki nd of  labeling Finally, in Table 1, we summarize these typical labeling schemes as well as our two new labeling schemes in term of their storage cost and query time based on worst-case analysis Here, N is the number of nodes and d is the depth of the tree From Table 1, we can see that interval-based labeling 4  
has satisfied two characteristics \(Efficient and Compact good labeling. In fact, we find that interval-based labeling scheme has the most query performance for AD and DO in three kinds of labeling schemes. Moreover, the effect of size and structure of XML documents on construction time and query cost of this kind labeling is very small. Can we design a labeling scheme which not only can inherit the advantages of interval-based labeling, but also can overcome the shortcoming that interval-based labeling can’t support SR and LCA queries Inspired by this, we propose a new labeling, Triple code, which

So we propose another novel labeling called iTriple code with information of ancestors TABLE I C OMPARISONS OF LABELING SCHEMES First, we propose a new interval-based labeling scheme Triple code, which satisfies the tree conditions of a good labeling scheme. As shown in experiment section, Triple Code has excellent performances on construction time storage cost and query cost The influence of tree size and depth on it is very little. Moreover, it is easy to be extended to support updates of leaf nodes and interval nodes To further optimize performance of LCA query of Triple Code, we propose another labe ling scheme, iTriple Code For XML data with big depth, the effect of tree depth on construction time and query performances of it is very small and it has good query performances We implement Dewey code, Branch code and our two new labeling schemes and conduct extensive experiments on both real data and synthetic data, on three benchmarks construction time, storage cost and query time The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews Background and related work. We present our new labeling scheme Triple code in Section 3. Section 4 describes another new labeling scheme we proposed, iTriple code Section 5 discusses how to extend our labeling schemes for dynamic XML trees Section 6 gives the experiments result We conclude in Section 7 II B ACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORK Parent/Child \(PC\ncestor/Descendant \(AD\, Sibling Relationship SR Document Order \(DO\owest Common Ancestor \(LCA\are five classes 000\003 of common structural relationship queries among nodes, which have got lots of 000\003 intentions from researchers. The First Four are the core operators of XPath and 000\003 XQuery recommended by W3C. The last is the core operator of XML keyword 000\003 search. In XPath and XQuery, there are 13 kinds of axes and most of them 000\003 are related with the structure of XML document. In them, self axe is easy to 000\003 process. Ancestor, ancestor-or-self, descendant and descendant-or-self axes can 000\003 be transformed into AD queries to process. Parent, child and attribute axes can 000\003 be transformed into PC queries to process Following and preceding axes can be transformed into DO queries to process. Following-sibling and Preceding-sibling 000\003 can be transformed into DO and SR queries to process. In addition, Predicates 000\003 of XPath and XQuery have structural queries related with the position of nodes 000\003 This kind of queries also can be transformed into SR and DO to process. For example 000\003 bookstore/book[position 000\003  the thir d book elem en t 000\003 that are children of the bookstore element. For this query, we first use PC query 000\003 to find all of book nodes with a bookstore parent. Then find all book nodes sets 000\003 with sibling relationship query in got results through SR. At last, find the final 000\003 results in those book nodes sets, through DO query. In XML keyword search 000\003 the core operation is to find the lowest element node which can includes all of 000\003 keywords. Obviously, this is a LCA query Existing labeling schemes can be classified into three major classes: interval 000\020 based 000\003 labeling 000\003 1 000\020 4 p r efix b ased lab elin g 5 and i n t e g e r-based l a bel i n g 7, 8  000\003\000\003 The first Interval-based labeling is proposed by Santoro, et  l 000\003 the XML tree based on the interval-based scheme, different tree traversal methods 000\003 e.g. pre-and-post orde  an d ext e nded preo rder  ling 000\003 proposed widely used, in which each node is assigned three 000\003 values: start, end and level. Utilizing these values, we can determinate various 000\003 structural relationships except for SR and LCA\between two nodes efficiently 000\003 In our two labeling schemes, the processing of DO and AD is the same as 000\003 zhang labeling. But, for PC, our two labeling schemes are more efficient than 000\003 zha ng labeling, because we only need compare if the parentid values of two nodes 000\003 are equal Moveover, our labelings can process SR and LCA efficiently In 000\003 Prefix-based labelings, the label of a node is its parent’s label Prefix-label\catenated 000\003 with its own label self-label Dewey code [5 ica l p r efix b ased 000\003 labeling scheme which has been widely adopted in XML keyword search. The 000\003 label size of each node is influenced by the depth of tree. So the query performance 000\003 and storage cost are influenced by the depth of trees. Integer-based 000\003 labelings use integers to label nodes and determinate the structural relationship 000\003 of nodes by arithmetic operations among integers. Prim and  000\003 code belong to this class. Branch code is the state of the art of scheme. It has 000\003 been proved that Branch code is more efficient than Prime code. In most of cases 000\003 this kind of labeling is more compact than Dewey code, but its construction 000\003 time is the longest in three kinds of labeling schemes 000\003\000\003 In this paper, we propose two new labeling schemes Triple Code and iTiple Code, which can support AD, PC, SR DO and LCA efficiently. From experimental results, we can see they have better performances on construction time and query time than previous labelings. The influence of tree size on construction time, storage cost and query performances of Triple Code is less than Dewey Code and Branch Code. The influence of tree depth on query performances of iTriple Code is the least III T RIPLE C ODE   of a node in an ordered XML tree is a triple where is the first value of an interval is the second value of

Any two intervals only have two kinds of relationships that one interval is contained by another interval or one interval doesn’t intersect with another interval. As an example of Triple code we label the XML tree in Fig.1 \(a\by Triple code Fig. 1 Example Results in real datasets In Triple Code, the determinations of AD and DO are the same as interval-based labeling scheme.

We take the tree in Fig.1 a\r example, which is labeled by Triple code, to show the correctness of our approaches Node is an ancestor of Node 0 12 and 17 12 Node is not an ancestor of Node since 9 12 Node is a parent of Node since parentid 0 Node is not a parent of Node since parentid 0 004   Node is a sibling node of Node since 0 0 i s not a sibling node of Node since 6 0 Node is a preceding node of Node since 1 3 Node is a following node of Node since 7 3 The LCA of Node and Node is Node since 4 8 7 v3.start 4\ and 0 4 In constructing Triple, we only need depth-first traverse once, so its construction cost is   Triple Code consists of three integers In fact, each integer must be less than 2 So the storage cost is  The query cost of SR, PC, AD and DO is 1\ For LCA, in the worstcase, we need access at most d times labels of nodes. Because all of labels reside in memory each access cost is 1\the worst-case query cost of LCA is  Here is the size of a tree and is the depth of a tree IV I T RIPLE C ODE From example1, we can see that computing LCA needs to access ancestors’ labels many time s. The processing of LCA is deep influenced by tree depth. For deep trees, the LCA query will needs much time. To overcome this disadvantage we propose a new labeling scheme, iTriple Code, to optimize the LCA query performance from    where is the depth of a tree Instinctively, if we construct an ordered list with the information of its ancestors for each node, the LCA query cost will be greatly reduced by the binary query. However, that will increase label size largely. Then we find an approach that we only need construct ancestor lists for leaf nodes. As shown in Fig.1\(b the ancestor list of a leaf node v only stores the start value of v 003C s ancestor from the root to its parent. Here, the list must be ordered because the star t value of an ancestor must be less than the start values of its descendants The iTriple Code of a node in an ordered XML tree is a quaternary < start, end, parentid pt where is the first value of an interval is the second value of an interval is the node ID of s

Fig2.\(b\ws an example of iTiple Code. The determinations of AD, PC, SR and DO of iTriple Code are the same as Triple Code Following, we will present how to compute the LCA by iTiple Code, shown as Theorem 5\(find the LCA of two nodes\and Theorem 6\(find the LCA of a set of nodes   node and let Then the LCA of and      and  Let    be the path corresponding to  where is the root of a XML tree  and is a leaf node First, for any node  1  w must be a descendant of Then  So  must be a node 1 1\.

So, the construction cost is  the worst case. iTriple Code consists of three integers and one pointer\(space cost   cost for leaf nodes is  the worst case. So, the total storage cost is  he query cost of SR, PC, AD and DO is 1\own in Algorithm 2, the worst-case query cost of LCA is   V D ISCUSSION So far, there have existed lo ts of approaches to process updates of labeling schemes, such as Float-point  C D BS  D DE 9  and Branch C ode. The fi rst two can be use d t o  support updates of interval-based labeling scheme. CDBS and DDE can support updates of prefix-based labeling scheme Branch Code uses splay tree to support updates of labels However, they only considered updates of leaf nodes and the updates of interval nodes were rarely discussed in the past Actually, the insertion or deletion of an interval will result in an error in answ ering LCA, PC and SR. For prefix-based and integer-based labeling schemes, the label of a node depends on labels of its parent and its ancestors. So when inserting or deleting an internal node, the labels of its descendants must be changed Using the method of CDBS, our labeling schemes are easy to be extended to support efficient updates of interval nodes and leaf nodes and make sure th at our labelings can answer AD PC, SR, DO, and LCA correctly after updating. Here Like CDBS, we use bit string to represent start and end, but parentid is still represented with an integer. Then, Triple code can process updates of leaf nodes without relabeling existing labels and can process updates of internal nodes only with relabeling its children. iTriple code also support updates of leaf nodes without relabeling existing labels. In deleting or inserting an interval node v besides relabeling labels of v’s children iTriple code only need update ancestor lists of v’s leaf descendants. So, for updates of internal nodes, iTriple code is less efficient than Triple code, but still more efficient than previous labeling schemes VI P ERFORMANCE S TUDY In this section, we empirically evaluate the performance of Triple code and iTriple Code proposed by us. In particular, we are interested in following as pects: 1 the performances of Triple Code labeling in three important measures: query time storage code label size\c onstruction time, 2 the influence of tree size/depth on construction time, storage cost and query performance of Triple code, 3 the performances of iTriple Code in three important measures in processing deep XML data and 4 the influence of tree depth on construction time storage cost and query perf ormance of iTriple code Here, we use five real XML datasets i n cl udi ng Si gm od Num. of node:11526 avg./max.depth:5.14/6\niv \(Num.of node: 66729, avg./max.depth: 3.95/5 TPC \(Num.of node:20001, avg./max.depth: 2.9/3 \ Mondial \(Num.of node:22423, avg./max.depth: 3.6/5\nd Nasa \(Num.of node 476646, avg./max.depth: 5.58/8 two kinds of synthetic datasets.

with and each tree has 105 node s. In constructing them, we first generate a tree with 100 l eaf nodes with the specified depth as a seed, where other nodes except the root have one child and the root has 100 c hildren. Then randomly construct the left parts of the tree. The node size of the other set is from 105 to 106. We randomly select N-1 edges which can generate a tree, where N is the number of nodes. To evaluate the performance of query, we randomly generate 105 node pairs for each XML tree and each kind of query. Here, we only show the results of AD, DO and LCA. One reason is that Triple Code and iTriple code can answer SR and PC by comparing two integers and they are more efficient than other kinds of labeling schemes obviously. The other reason is the limitation of space For comparisons, we implement Dewey code \(a typical prefixbased labeling\ and Branch Code \(the state of art of labeling an integer-based labeling\. We don’t implement typical interval-based labeling, because it can’t support SR and LCA We run all experiments on a PC running Ubuntu 11.03 with an Intel Quad 2.53GHz CPU and 8GB memory and implement four labeling schemes with C++. In them, Triple code and iTriple Code are supposed by us As shown in Fig.2 \(a\.3\(a\d Fig.4\(a\e construction time of Triple code in all of data sets is the least. For deep XML trees shown in Fig.5 \(a\he construction time of iTriple code is far less than Dewey code and Branch Code and is very close to the time of Triple Code Fig. 2 Results in real datasets As shown in Fig.2\(b\g.3\(b\g.4\(b except for Univ and Nasa, the storag e cost of Triple code is the least in all of trees. For deep XML trees shown in Fig.4\(b\, the storage cost of iTriple code is less than Dewey Code while the depth is more than 10, and in 60, its storage cost is less than Branch Code. Here, the storage code of iTriple code includes the cost of ancestor lists of all of leafs. We represent storage cost by total bytes/node size, and it is the same in the following parts in this paper As shown in Fig.2 c-e\Fig.3\(c-e in all of XML data Triple Code has the best Query Performances including AD, DO and LCA. For deep XML trees shown in Fig.4\(c-e\, Tripe Code and iTriple Code have the best query performances including AD, DO and LCA.

tree depth on construction time of Triple Code is the least in four labeling schemes. The influence of tree depth on construction time of iTriple Code is more than Branch Code and similar with Dewey Code As shown in Fig.4\(b\, the influence of tree depth on storage cost of Triple Code and ITriple Code is less than Dewey Code and Branch Code. The influence of tree depth on storage cost of Triple Code is the least Fig. 4 Influence of tree depth As shown in Fig.4\(c-e\e influence of tree depth on query time of iTriple Code is the least in four labeling schemes. For AD and DO, the influence of tree depth on query time of Triple Code is less than Branch Code and similar with Dewey code. For LCA, the influence of tree depth on query performance of Triple Code is less than Branch Code and a little more than Dewey code In summary, Triple Code and iTriple Code have the much better performances on construction time and query performance than Branch Code and Dewey Code. Triple Code has the least storage cost in most XML data except for Univ and Nasa. For deep XML data, the query performances of iTriple Code are the best in four labeling schemes. Although its storage cost is high it is worthy for its best performance on query time. The Influence of tree size on construction time storage cost and query performance of Triple Code is less than Dewey Code and Branch Code. The Influence of tree depth on construction time and storage cost of Triple Code is the least in four labeling schemes. The Influence of tree depth on query performance of iTriple Code is the least in four labeling schemes VII P ERFORMANCE S TUDY C ONCLUSIONS In this paper, we proposed two new labeling schemes Triple Code and ITiple Code, which can support AD, PC, SR DO and LCA efficiently. From experimental results, we can see they have better performances on construction time and query time than previous labeling schemes. For deep XML data the query performances of iTripl e Code are the best in four labeling schemes. Moreover, the influence of tree size on construction time, storage cost and query performances of Triple Code is less than Dewey Code and Branch Code. The influence of tree depth on construction time and query performances of iTriple Code is the least Moreover, the two labeling schemes proposed by us are easy to be extended to support efficient updates of interval nodes and leaf nodes A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was partially suppo rted by the grants from the Natural Science Foundation of China \(No.61070055 91024032, 91124001 National Science and Technology Major Projectof the Ministry of Science and Technology of China under grant \(No.2012AA010701, 2013AA013204\d the Research Funds of Renmin University\(No.11XNL010 R EFERENCES  P F Dietz  Mai n taining order in a linked list In Proc. of the 14th Annual ACM Symp. on Thery of Computing pp.122-127 1982  Q  Li and B Moon Indexing and Querying XML Data for Regular Path Expressions,” In Proc. of The 27th int.

shown in Figure 11 The X-axis is the percentage of the normal completion time of Query 5 when a failure is injected Firstly it is not surprised that ParaLite is about twice faster than Hive One reason for the superiority is that not all the operators are checkpointed in ParaLite Moreover Hive uses sort-join while ParaLite uses hash-join In addition the start-up overhead for Hadoop cannot be ignored Hive uses 3 MapReduce jobs to express the query and each takes 10 15 seconds before all map tasks are started Secondly the slowdown for both system are similar However the slowdonw of Hadoop is limited to the interval of heartbeat message send to the JobTracker\(master from each TaskTracker\(worker After a x time we set it 30 seconds from receiving the last heartbeat if the master does not receive a new heartbeat message it sets the status of the worker failed and re-schedules the failed tasks So for a light-weight job whose execution time is not much larger than the interval the slowdown becomes larger because it needs to wait for the task re-execution On the other hand ParaLite detects the failure immediately after a process fails and then starts the recovery D Scalability To evaluate the scalability of ParaLite we perform TPCH Query 3 on 10 20 and 30 nodes with the s cale factor 100 200 and 300 respectively As Figure 12 shows ParaLite scales well with the increase of nodes The selective checkpointing mechanism adapts to clusters with different number of nodes                   0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 400 10 20 30 Execution Time\(s of nodes Fig 12 The scalability of TPC-H Query 2 VI C ONCLUSION To ef“ciently support intra-query fault tolerance for longrunning queries we propose a selective checkpointing mechanism which automatically chooses necessary operators whose output data are worth being checkpointed to minimize the expected runtime of the query in a failure-prone environment The mechanism provides a cost model to simulate the execution of the query plan and takes a divide-and-conquer approach to solve the problem The mechanism is implemented in a share-nothing parallel database ParaLite and evaluated with several TPC-H queries The experimental results rstly show that different fault-tolerant strategies affect the overall runtimes of queries Our selective checkpointing can choose reasonable operators to be checkpointed and outperforms other fault-tolerant strategies In addition the divide-and-conquer algorithm taken by our mechanism has a smaller overhead than brute-force approach while keeping a

   12 The scenario tests are designed through a process o f grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The pr ocess is performed using a requirements-to-test allocatio n matrix in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of tests The selection of which tests form the incomp ressible test suite is performed through consultation and it eration of the core test list with the systems engineering tea m Following the allocation of all requirements to the  various tests, individual test plans are developed that inc lude a set of starting conditions and high-level outline of test and verification activities. Each test plan includes th e following information test name document number tier desig nation test objective, requirements fully or partially ver ified by the test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the test, initial conditions for the test, required sup port, planning notes, and the high-level test outline   Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario  test during the system-level test phase  Following the development of the system-level verification and te st plan individual test procedures are generated for each t est. A test procedure is a configuration managed document that describes the detailed information necessary to run  the test on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to ex ecute the test. The test procedure is also the as-run documen t used by the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the major milestones of the test When possible the te st procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simu lators to identify and correct procedural errors. The test pr ocedure is then executed on the observatory during I&T \(eventu ally the procedure is run on both spacecraft Any deviation s from the test procedure are documented within the test p rocedure as red lines \(i.e., permanent changes to the test p rocedure\ or black lines i.e changes for the current procedur e If the test fails due to test procedure errors the test p rocedure is corrected and the process is repeated However if the test fails due to an implementation error in flight hard ware flight software or autonomy a formal discrepancy is documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting  APFR system any changes or corrections to autono my flight software, or hardware are implemented and th e test is re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test r uns to successful completion After the completion of each  test a review of the test procedure as-run information a nd spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer signs the test procedure confirming that the test w as run and the review accurately described the success or fail ure of the test  n	\r\n\n  n        n   n\r     n r\r\n\r r\n\r r\r\n\r    0/-1  23  n  4      Figure 12:  Fault Protection System-Level Test Proc ess Flow 4  CONCLUSION The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for mul tiple years in the extreme environment of the Earth’s rad iation belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management system is integrated into the system architecture f rom the earliest stages of the design.  This fault manageme nt system was rigorously tested during I&T and the results o f this testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against on-orbit fault conditions and therefore have a hig h probability of meeting the mission objectives  The  RBSP fault management design, implementation and test ap proach demonstrate that robust fault-tolerant designs are  achievable for complex systems operating in harsh environments even for systems with only limited or  selective redundancy 5  REFERENCES  1  J   S t r a t t o n  a n d  N   F o x   R a d i a t i o n  B e l t  S t o r m  P robes RBSP\ Mission Overview Proc. of the 2012 IEEE Aerospace Conf.
