I I NTRODUCTION Currently, different kinds of information systems have been widely deployed in logistics field. However, with fast development of technologies \(e.g. computer networking mobile internet, GPS, image processing, etc.\ and 
continuous increasing customer demand, conventional logistics information systems indicate disadvantages due to a few realistic limitations 1 System Elasticity  Conventional logistics systems have to consider the purchase of hardware and software on maximum need, and make further update according to the dynamic requirement 1  This in cr eas e s IT  in f r ast ru ctur e expens e 2 Real-time Tracking Service  Real-time logistics tracking service has been achieved via implementation of RFID technology, as described in 2  Ho w e ver  th is c o u l d  n o t be  w i dely  d e ploy ed du e  t o  high expense of RFID hardware 3 Vehicle Routing Optimization 
Although researchers in academia and industry have investigated Vehicle Routing Problem \(VRP\ and proposed corresponding approaches, they are basically not efficient in real system which consists hundreds of vehicles due to limitations of computing and storage capabilities in system server side 4 Information Sharing and Inter-working High degree of corporation is a basic requirement for logistics system in Quality of Service \(QoS\enhancements well as cost reduction [3  Ho w e ver  exis ti n g log i s tic s  systems are designed case by case and usually do not consider information sharing and inter-working issues The usage of cloud computing platform might 
overcome above limitations. Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, on-de mand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources \(e.g networks, servers, storage, applications, and services\ that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction [4   Cloud computing has several advantages, such as its elasticity, widespread accessibility, shared resource pool service on-demand and service calculable [5  Addi ti on all y   cloud based computing model is capable to provide more secure services than traditional business models as 
analyzed in [6   Mobile cloud refers to the service mode that access cloud services with mobile devices. This, on one hand, is an extension implementation of cloud computing, and on the other hand, is the capability extension to mobile devices [7  In th is  pa pe r  w e in v e s tig at e and  pr o p o se a  mobile cloud-based architecture for enrichment of existing logistics systems to achieve the target to be elastic compatible, and intelligent. In Section 2, we describe system architecture and its corresponding technical issues The prototype implementation and evaluation are presented in Section 3 and finally the paper is concluded in Section 4 
II A RCHITECTURE D ESIGN In this section, we describe a mobile cloud-based system architecture for intelligent logi stics system. Following the introduction, we consider issues related to customer interaction, distributed storage, logistics vehicle scheduling, MapReduce-based C-W algorithm Restful-based mobile interaction and transmission security and mobile payment 
The proposed architecture invo lves three main characters User Terminal \(UT\, Vehicle Terminal \(VT\ and Logistics Cloud Gateway \(LCG User Terminal, which can be mobile phone, laptops 
A System Overview 
PC, etc., uses a web browser or a software interface to get access to logistics cloud gateway. The connection between UT and LCG could be through either mobile or fixed network. With terminal a user could log in LCG anytime and anywhere to submit order ap plication. After validation a unique dimensional barcode will be generated and sent back to identify a specific order. User also could use UT to complete mobile payment via third-party payment service and track real-time state of corresponding commodities Vehicle Terminal, which can be a simple mobile phone or other handled devices with built-in GPS contains two

main aspects of functions. On one hand, it recognizes commodities through scanning corresponding QR code; on the other hand, it is capable to collect vehicle location information and upload it to logistics cloud. Additionally VT could be directed to corresponding task points in optimized path Logistics Cloud Gateway is the key element which acts as a bridge between front-end terminal and back-end cloud computing platform. Inside LCG there are five main modules for handling different services, shown as Figure 1 a User Management. This part interacts with user terminal to manag order and provide real-time tracking service b Vehicle Management. This module mainly deals with collection of vehicle location information and direction of vehicle path according to logistics scheduling module c Logistics Scheduling. This component analyzes all possible vehicle paths and decides which one could be the most suitable with consideration of distance, time, expense and other factors d Security Provisioning. This module ensures connection \(between UT/VT and LCG\security data confidentiality and integrity e Mobile payment This module offers two possible mobile payment solutions based on either SMS payment or online payment. Both of them have been widely deployed in our daily life Figure 1 System Architecture We propose a novel interaction mode which customer is capable to handle most logistics related issues online, as described in the following  a A customer login LCG anywhere and anytime via user terminals \(laptop, mobile phone, etc  b An online form which contains logistics elements original address, destination, available time, etc should be filled. After that, customer will receive a specific 2D QR code related with the specific order c Logistics vehicle arrives at appointed time to check and receive corresponding commodity  d Vehicle Terminal uploads GPS information to LCG periodically  e Customer is capable to track state of corresponding commodity in real-time  f After accomplishment of distribution task customer pays either with SMS or online payment Cloud computing platform provides distributed storage services for logistics related data, including order information, vehicle location information and so on Specifically, logistics data is stored based on Hadoop DFS Distributed File System\hich could create multiple replicas of data blocks and distribute them on a set of cluster nodes [8 DFS h as rel ia b l e extr em ely rap i d  computations and it could reach load balance \(shown in Figure 2\. DFS also makes a balance in performance between input and output. The performance is to automatically distribute data blocks on the datanodes whose free-space is greater than a threshold value Figure 2 Structure of DFS There might be a multitude of orders in a certain period of time. Therefore, it is necessar y to define an efficient and reasonable logistics vehicle scheduling mechanism for management of existing Vehicle Route Problem \(VRP which is described in the following [9  Assume that a logistics distribution center serves customers, each of which \(customer has a commodity with weight the number of vehicle is and each vehicle has a load capacity VRP could be mathematically presented through a complete weighted graph where is a set of nodes representing logistics distribution center and customers  is a set of arcs that stands for distance between customer and  Each vehicle starts from and returns logistics center In our approach, we consider vehicle routing problem with time windows \(VRPTW\. More precisely, each customer  has to be served in a time window  otherwise extra penalty cost will be generated. Therefore the question turns to how to minimize total cost during

logistics distribution process, as represented in following mathematic formulas 1  2  3  4  5  Where represents transportation cost from customer i to customer j equals to 1 if vehicle k travels from customer i to customer j and otherwise equals to 0 represents extra cost caused in case that vehicle k arrives at customer i before  represents extra cost caused in case that vehicle k arrives at customer i after  represents the time when logistics vehicle arrives at customer i  equals to 1 if requirement of customer i is completed by vehicle k an d otherwise equals to 0 We also propose a MapReduce-based Clark-Wright \(C-W saving algorithm for handling vehicle routing problem. On one hand, MapReduce-based computing model is capable to split a big task into multiple sub-tasks and then assign them to a set of interconnected cloud nodes for distributed and parallel computing [10  On th e  o th er h and  C W saving algorithm considers the savings that could be acquired by linking pairs of customer nodes in a system that is composed of a central depot serving customer nodes 1 W i t h  co m b in at ion  of M a p R e d u c e an d C W s a vin g  mechanism, it is possible to acquire the most suitable vehicle path with optimized cost. The handling process is described in the following \(as illustrated in Figure 3 a According to list<i Where the key represents customer and the value represents the position of customer Map 001\011 calculates saving distance between any two customers using C-W saving algorithm. After that, Reduce 001\011 sorts the result and outputs list < \(i, j ordered by  b On the other side, Map 001\012 with the same input as Map 001\011  considers time windows constraint between any two customers. If connection between customer and iolates time windows constraint the connection is marked to be false, otherwise, it is true Reduce 001\012 sorts the results by either 0 or 1 According to the result of Reduce 001\011 and Reduce 001\012  Map 001\013 constructs vehicle path via adding customer pairs and then checks its feasibility. After that, Reduce 001\013 is capable to sort the vehicle path and select the most suitable route Figure 3 MapReduce-based handling mechanism Due to realistic limitations \(e.g. kernel, network, storage etc.\ of mobile devices, we suggest a lightweight restful protocol [1 m o bi l e cl o u d i nt e ra ct i o n a n d da ta transmission. Compared with traditional SOAP-based web service approach, restful-based solution is capable to provide simple, efficient, and more stable services. It offers lightweight connection and data transmission via removing most of redundant affiliated xml related element This greatly reduces size of transmission message and RTT time We suggest implementation of Trust Computing Platform TCP\ith active security defense capability in vehicle terminal. Before accessing to logistics cloud gateway \(for example, every time starting on\, we propose an embedded TPM \(Trusted Platform Module\ardware, combined with encryption / decryption technology and trust chain transfer technology for measurement of user's identity and s state. If measurement result meets the predefined security policy, then vehicle terminal is allowed to access to logistics cloud gateway. Otherwise, it is forced to connect to a specific isolated area for security improvement Besides, the connections among user terminal, vehicle terminal and logistics cloud gateway should be securely encrypted We suggest the implementation of certificate based security approach. On one hand, certificate proves legitimacy of the specific node and helps establish secure session; on other hand, it provides data confidentiality integrity and authentication among different parties Additionally, user should input the right user identity and password in order to g et access to logistics cloud gateway

Today, it is very common to use mobile devices for payment. In order to realize mobile payment, we proposed to use SMS payment and online payment. In SMS payment solution, logistics cloud sends payment information to customers via SMS and customers can pay for the cost directly with replying the message. The online payment solution relies on mature third-party payment platform, such as PayPal III I MPLEMENTATION AND EVALLUATION We have built a logistics cloud platform testing bed in four PCs \(one for logistic cloud gateway, three for cloud computing platform nodes\ Huawei U8825 mobile phone with Android v2.2\, Lenovo A2105 \(with Android v4.0 Lenovo A2107 \(with Android v 4.0\, Iphone 4S and IPAD 4 are selected as user terminal and vehicle terminal testing tools. VMware Server 2.0.2 and Hadoop 1.0.2 are used to simulate cloud distributed environment. HBase 0.92.0 is used as a distributed data storage solution. We do test on campus network Before testing, we manually configure user profiles in logistics cloud gateway. We create two users \(Alice and Bob\ with user identity and password. This ensures that mobile agent is capable to pass security protection of logistics cloud platform. We assume that Alice wants to send a commodity to Bob and track the real-time information of order. It is possible to create more user profiles for more tests In some cases of experiment, two-dimensional codes camera in Android device is not capable to identify captured 2D QR code. In our testing, Both Alice and Bob are capable to acquire real-time tracking information However, it takes at most 60 seconds to show update because we set refresh time as 60s. Although this is enough for normal usage, it might reduce user experience We also find that in some cases our implemented platform could not obtain accurate location information of the vehicle. The distance deviation could even reaches at most 2000 meters. This problem might be in situation when GPS signals are too weak to acquire accurate location information. Overall, the prototype works well Figure 4 Prototype interface User Login. User inputs username and password The current tab pops up a toast to inform customer the login state. After been certificated, the main menu displays on the screen of mobile phone  Add order with user terminal. User fills in an order application form, and then price will be pre-evaluated. User can choose SMS payment or online payment Generation and recognition of two-dimensional code A dimensional barcode is generated for indentifying specific order. Through scanning and recognition of two-dimensional code, customer and logistic vehicle terminal are capable to achieve corresponding order information  Logistics vehicle scheduling. Cloud platform calculates and gives a suitable vehicle route  Real-time tracking. When user clicks tracking request button, logistics cloud returns current location of corresponding commodity  We simulate a simple vehicle scheduling scenario through creating \(manual configure in logistics cloud gateway component\ one distribution center, four vehicles and nine customer nodes \(randomly\ in order to evaluate differences between two cases: without consideration of time windows and with consideration of time windows \(our proposal\In both cases, four routes are generated respectively \(see Figure 5\. With comparison, it is capable to draw conclusions that our proposed vehicle scheduling mechanisms not superior to traditional C-W with aspect of travelling distance and cost; however, our proposal has its own advantages, especially when considering timeliness and satisfaction of users

We also evaluate our proposed restful-based approach from aspect of Resource Response Time \(RRT\, which is defined as total latency between request forwarding and file transfer. For comparison, we use open source testing tools soapUI [13  to exe cute SOA P bas e d w eb se rv ice f o r  mobile negotiation and data transmission between user terminal and logistics cloud gateway. According to our experiment, through restful-based interaction and data transmission, it is capable to save 40%amount of transmission data and reduce 50% of Resource Response Time, shown in Figure 6 Figure 6  Comparison between restful-based and SOAP-based approach Table 1 gives comparison among conventional logistics system and our proposed solution.  The comparison shows that due to advantages of cloud platform and proposed optimization approaches, mobile cloud-based logistics system is superior in many aspects to conventional logistics systems Table 1. Performance comparison between conventional system and proposed system Conventional Logistics System Proposed logistics System Elasticity Poor, must consider purchase of hardware and software on maximum need Good, can be automatically and rapidly expanded to dynamic changes Customer Interaction Experience Poor, customer need go to logistics distribution center fills in logistics form and pays bill Good, all subfunctions are completed online with selfservice Realtime Tracking Fair, could achieve part of tracking however, not real-time Good, realizes full visualization Interworking and Data Sharing Poor 002 Future work will consider security issues with special focus on possibility of a vTPM \(Virtual TPM\ for security enhancement, as proposed in paper. In this solution, a virtual TPM \(vTPM\ framework provides a set of trustworthy services in software point of view. This framework allows multiple mutually distrustful and unaware guests to share a TPM without requiring modifications. This may be implementable in our proposed logistics system A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS This paper is supported by the National Natural Science Fo undation of China under Grant No. 61103175 and No.1127 1002, the Key Project of Chinese Ministry of Education un der Grant No.212086; the Technology Innovation Platform Project of Fujian Province under Grant No. 2009J1007; th e Key Project Development Foundation of Education Com mittee of Fujian province under Grand No.JA11011 and J A12016 R EFERENCES 1 L i X  W a n g Y  C h e n X   Co l d  ch ai n l o g i sti c s sy ste m b a se d o n  cloud computing[J Co nc ur r e ncy an d Co m p u t a tio n P r act ice a n d  Experience, 2012, 24\(17\2138-2150 2 Z hang Y  RF I D  G P S  G P RSb as e d l o g is t ics  m o ni to r i ng a n d  management system[C    E lect r o n i c S y s t em I n t egr a t i o n  Technology Conference \(ESTC\012 4th.

heuristic to execute BC on just 4 workers in roughly two-thirds the time as the baseline using 8 workers providing users with cost-performance tradeoffs in a pay-as-you-go cloud environment. The automation offered by the adaptive heuristic to the end user also eliminates the guesswork of picking a static baseline or any potential non-uniformity in sampling using the sampling heuristic C  Given the need to run computation as a series of smaller \(optimally sized\at hs, is important to decide when we initiate the next swath. Our initiation heuristics attempt to overlap execution of multiple swaths to flatten the resource \(memory, network, CPU\ usage variations causes by different supersteps within a single swath. In BC and APSP, we observe a triangle waveform with a central peak; this heuristic is not relevant for applications like PageRank with uniform resource usage. Besides improving resource utilization, overlapping consecutive swath iterations also reduce the cumulative supersteps required and thus reduces the total overhead spent on synchronization between supersteps Figure 6 compares the relative performance of our initiation heuristics for the BC application normalized to a baseline approach that runs strictly  non-overlapping iterations. These run on 8 workers Figure 7 shows the corresponding messages transferred between supersteps over time, spanning swath iterations. The initiates a new swath every supersteps while the  performs initiation when it detects a peak in the number of messages exchanged. Static-Ns performance depends on the graph and the value of that is chosen.  If the average shorte st path is greater than  we will be initiating new heur istics before the previous swath has hit its peak, thereby exacerbating the resource demand. If the average shortest path length is well distributed or is \(just\ shorter than it leads to better performance. So 4 for the larger CP graph actually works best. Our dynamic he uristic eliminates this guesswork as it picks the initiation point at runtime without user input or graph preprocessing. Using this dynamic initiation heuristic we achieve up to 24 speedup vs. sequential initiation for the WG graph. The message transfer plot in Figure 7 corroborates this While sequential shows the message transfers peak and fall to zero \(thus showing more variability and poorer utilization\, Static-6 \(which is optimal but handselected\ maintains a higher message rate while dynamic is a bit more conservative, but automated VII E VALUATING I MPACT OF G RAPH P ARTITIONING ON P REGEL NET Our Pregel.NET framework is agnostic to how the graphs are partitioned and assigned to workers. The default mode performs a simple hash over the vertex ID to determine the target worker partition. Several works have shown that intelligent graph partitioning can improve the performance of distributed graph algorithms [19  26 a nd i t is relevant to examine if these benefits carry over to the Pregel/BSP model also METIS is a commonly used strategy that provides good quality in-place partitioning that minimizes edge-cuts across partition  Rec e n t w o rk o n a p pr o x im ate partitioning using a single graph scan offers an alternative for partitioning online as the graph is read from storage P a ge R a nk is o f t e n used in l iter a tur e  to validate the effectiven ess of these partitioning strategies. However, as we have seen, PageRank implemented using Pregel/BSP has a uniform message profile while BC and APSP have a triangle waveform message profile. We analyze the consequence of this on the performance gains from intelligent graph partitioning Clearly, the benefit of partitioning comes in reduced communication time since messages to remote vertices incur additional delay due to serialization and network I/O when compared to in-memory messages sent to local vertices. Since many distributed graph algorithms are dominated by communication rather than computation, partitioning can improve overall performance However, the barrier synchronization model in Pregel/BSP means that the total time spent in a superstep is determined by the slowest worker in the superstep. Hence, the balance of work amongst workers in a superstep is as import ant as the cumulative number of remote messages generated in a superstep. Since vertices communicate with their neighbors along edges in the Pregel/BSP model and partitioning seeks to collocate a majority vertex neighbors in the same partition, there may arise local maximasŽ in specific partitions where more vertices are active during the course of execution of a graph application. This difference in workload can cause underutilization of workers that wait for over utilized workers at the superstep barrier  
Relative time taken by PageRank, APSP and BC to run on WG and CP graphs partitioned using METIS and Streaming, normalized to Hashing approach. Smaller is better

We evaluate the impact of graph partitioning using the best-in-class METIS partitioner as well as the best heuristic \(linear-wei ghted deterministic, greedy approach partitioner from [26 an d com p a r e  them against a baseline that uses simple of vertices by their IDs. We run PageRank, BC and APSP over the WG and CP graphs on 8 workers for this evaluation. Hash, METIS, and Streaming produce 8 partitions whose percentage of remote edges are 87 18% and 35% for the WG graph and 86%, 17% and 65% for the CP graph; smaller this number, lower the edge cuts across partitions, and METIS proves a low edge cut for both graphs. Given the large sizes of the graphs, we run these experiments on the same set of vertices as our other experiments \(50 vertices for CP and 75 vertices for WG\. We report these results when using Pregel.NET without our swath heuristics however, the trends we observe are consistent even with heuristics turned on, though the absolute performance is uniformly better Figure 8 shows the relative time taken when using the METIS and streaming partitioning normalized to hashing for PageRank, BC and APSP running on WG and CP. We see that the WG graph sees a relative improvement of nearly 42-50% for METIS for the three applications, while this improvement drops to 24-35 for the streaming partitioning. When running Pregel.NET with heuristics turn ed on, we see a best case improvement of 5x in relative time taken by METIS for BC on WG compared to hashing \(graph not shown These are consistent with results reported in  However, we also see that the CP graph does not show such a marked improvement in performance due to better partitioning, despite its edge cut ratios from different partitioning being similar to WG. In fact hashing is faster than METIS and Streaming for APSP on this graph. It is worthwhile to investigate this consistent lack of improvement for the CP graph as opposed to WG. Figure 9 shows the runtime for BC broken into compute+I/O time and the synchronization barrier wait time components for the WG graph and Figure 12 does the same for CP. The plots also show the VM utilization %, calcul ated as the time spent in compute and I/O communication against the total time including barrier wait time\ on the secondary Y-axis We see that the VM utilization % for hashing is higher though the total time taken is also higher, for both WG and CP. METIS shows the inverse property, having lower utilization but also lower total time. This is explained by looking at the number of messages emitted by workers in a supe rstep for both hashing and METIS, shown in Figures 10 and 11 for WG, and in Figures 13 and 14 for CP. We expect that a hashed assignment of vertices to a partition would spread communication roughly evenly over all workers, while also increasing the number of remote communications required. The latter contributes to the increased total time while the former leads to a uniform number of

messages seen for all workers in a superstep \(Figures 10 and 13\. When looking at the messages sent by workers in a superstep for METIS, we see that there are message load imbalances within work ers in a superstep, caused due to concentration of vertices being traversed in that superstep in certain partitions This variability is much more pronounced in CP as compared to WG \(Figures 11 and 14\ E.g. in superstep 9 for CP, twice as many messages \(4M\ are generated by a worker compared to another \(2M\.  For Pregel BSP, the time taken in a superstep is determined by the slowest worker in that superstep. Hence increase d variability in CP causes even goodŽ partitioning strategies to cause an increase in total execution time wh en using the Pregel/BSP model VIII A NALYSIS OF E LASTIC C LOUD S CALING  Cloud environments offer elasticity … the ability to scale-out or scale-in VMs on-demand and only pay for what one uses [28   On th e f l i p s i de  on e en ds u p  paying for VMs that are acquired even if they are underutilized. We have already shown the high variation in compute/memory resources used by algorithms like BC and APSP across different supersteps. While our earlier swath initiation heuristics attempt to flatten these out by overlapping swath executions, one can consider leveraging the clouds elasticity to, instead, scale up and down the concurrent workers \(and graph partitions\ allocated in each superstep The peak and trough nature of resource utilization combined with Pregel/BSPs synchronous barrier between supersteps offers a window for dynamic scaleout and …in at superstep boundaries. Peak supersteps can greatly benefit from additional workers, while those same workers will contribute to added synchronization overhead for trough supersteps We offer an analysis of the potential benefits of elastic scaling by extrapolating from observed results for running BC on WG and CP graphs, using four and eight workers.  To provide a fair and focused comparison, we turned off swath heuristics in favor of fixed swath sizes and initiation intervals Figure 15 \(Bottom\ plots the speedup of BC running on eight workers when normalized to BC running on four workers, at corresponding supersteps.  The number of workers does not impact the number of supersteps We also plot the number of active vertices \(i.e. vertices still computing for a given swath\these supersteps which is a measure of how much work is required \(Fig 15 \(Top\. We find that we occasionally get superlinear speedup spikes \(i.e. >2x\ that shows a strong correlation with the peaks of active messages, for both WG and CP graphs. At other times, the sp eedup is sublinear or even a speed-down \(i.e. <1\responding to inactive vertices.  The superlinear speedup is attributable to the lower contention and reduced memory pressure for 8 workers when the active vertices peak \(similar to what we observed for the swath initiation heuristics Similarly, the below par speedup during periods of low activity is contributed by the increased overhead of barrier synchronization across 8 workers. Intuitively, by dynamically scaling up the number of workers for supersteps with peaking active vertices and scaling them down otherwise, we can leverage the superlinear speedup and get more value per worker Using a threshold of 50% active vertices as the threshold condition for between 4 and 8 workers in a superstep, we extrapolate the time per superstep and compared this to the fixed 4 and 8 worker runtimes. We also compute the best-case run time using an oracleŽ approach to i.e. for each superstep, we pick the minimum of the 4 or 8 workers time.  Note that these projections do not yet consider the overheads of scaling, but are rather used to estimate the potential upside if we had an ideal or an automated heuristic for scaling.

observed time taken using 4 workers, are plotted in Figures 16\(A\ and 16\(B We see that our dynamic scaling heuristic using the percentage of active vertices achieves nearly the same CP\ or better \(WG\ performance as a fixed 8 worker approach. Clearly there is benefit of using fewer workers for low utilization su persteps to eliminate the barrier synchronization overhead. Also, the dynamic scaling heuristic performs almost as well as the ideal scaling. Finally, when we consider the monetary cost of the proposed approaches, assuming a pro-rata normalized cost per VM-second plotted on the secondary Y axis, we see that dynamic scaling is comparable \(CP\ or cheaper \(WG\ than a 4 worker scenario while offering the performance of an 8 worker deployment IX C ONCLUSION  In conclusion, we introduce optimization and heuristics for controlling memory utilization and show they are critical to performance.  By breaking computation into swaths of vertices and using our sizing heuristics we achieve up to 3.5x speedup over the maximum swath size that does not cause the a failure.  In addition overlapping swath executions can provide a 24% gain with automated heuristics and even greater speedup when a priori knowledge of the network characteristics is applied This evaluation offers help to eScience users to make framework selection and cost-performancescalability trade-offs. Our he uristics are generalizable and can be leveraged by other BSP and distributed graph frameworks, and for graph applications beyond BC. Our work uncovered an unexpected impact of partitioning and it would be worthwhile, in future, to examine the ability to pred ict, given certain graph properties, a suitable partitioning model for Pregel/BSP It may also be useful to perform such evaluations on larger graphs and more numbers of VMs. At the same time, it is also worth considering if non-linear graph algorithms are tractable in pr actice for large graphs in a distributed environment B IBLIOGRAPHY  1  F  L i lj er os C   Ed l i n g L  A m a r a l H  S t an ley   and Y    berg The web of human sexual contacts

All rights reserved  Issues and Observations Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours Optimizations  Write data in batches  Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Deploy a higher performance machine  Use load instead of insert  Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables  Database tunings Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Use a mutable data structure to create data strings  Original application created the SQL statement by appending elements to a Java String  It was taking five hours \(of the seven hours Strings  Instead Java StringBuilder used  Java Strings immutable  Time savings of 71.4 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Deployed on a higher-performance machine  Application ported from IBM Blade Center HS21 \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core Xeon 5130 processor to Dell M4500 computer \(4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core Intel Core i7 processor  Reduced the time to thirty minutes Bulk loading instead of insert  Application was modified to write CSV files for each table  Entire day worth of data bulk loaded  Reduced the time to fifteen minutes 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Range-Partitioned tables \(RPT  To limit the size of tables, the original code created multiple tables per table type  This puts burden on the application to query multiple tables when a range crosses several tables  With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries when a range crosses a table boundary  Increased the time to thirty minutes  Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning enabled time savings during queries 


Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved  Optimizations Database tunings  Range periods changed from a week to a month  Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 512KB  Buffer pool size decreased  Decreased the time to twenty minutes Overall, total time savings of 95.2
