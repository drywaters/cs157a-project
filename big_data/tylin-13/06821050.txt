Abstract 
Computer crime investigation and forensics is an important research work to combat criminal activity in cyberspace. But the complexit y of computer criminal groups makes the computer crime forensics to be a challenge. Email is an important communication mean in computer crime communication. So the email forens ics is needed to organized crime. This paper proposed 
an email forensics method based on graph clustering method and social network analysis \(SNA We analyze and mine emails data of the suspicious users accounts using the new method, which can create email communication network graph for suspicious computer criminal organizations. The algorithm developed can analyze computer organizationís structure and core members. The effectiveness of the method propos ed has been proved by our experimental data and results The research may help investigators to find more email evidence and case clues and improve investigatorsí email forensi 
c capability, especially to the investigation for organized crime

I I NTRODUCTION In recent years, the computer network crime activities are more and more, which bring great threat to network security. How to fight against computer crime effectively is a major concern of society. As an important means to combat computer crime, digital forensics \(also known as computer forensics\become to be an important 
component for the investigation and forensics of criminal cases, especially in cases related to computer crimes Now email becomes to be one important mean of daily network communications At the same time, email has also become be a tool for computer crime. Members of a criminal organization can contact with each other by email. So the investigation and evidence co llection of email data is an important task for computer forensics analysis  We mainly study the organized crime investigation for email forensics. In this paper, we proposed a method to 
achieve email forensics based on social network analysis called SNA\to find the relationship communication network corres ponding to a criminal organization. Furthermore we study the structure of Criminal organization to identify core members and the relationship between them. In this way, we may be able to find more evidence clues data to pro vide more digital evidence II R ELATED W 
ORK TO C OMPUTER FORENSICS To combat computer crime, digital forensics becomes to be an important research task. FBI of United States of laboratory set up computer forensics lab in 1984. In 1993 the first International C onference on computer forensics held The IOCE \(International Organization on Computer Evidence\was founded in 19 95. Then many countries promulgated laws and regulations related to digital evidence 
and digital forensics, specially set up their government computer forensics departments  Many famous information security companies and organizations successfully developed excellent products for

The existing email forensic functions mainly focus on the basic processes modules including email data collec ting, email decoding and simple relationship graph drawing  III F ORENSIC A NALYSIS OF O RGANIZED C RIME After 911 events in United States, all national governments come to realize the significance for prevention and control of organized crime. If y ou ignore the purpose of their actions, organized crime network and other common social groups have the same structural characteristics Members in a group and thei r communication relationships can be seen as the basic units of social network. To prevent and combat 000\003 organized crime, we not only should explore the characteristics and behavior of the criminal, but also analyze the gang organization and its structure, especially core members of it  If the forensic analysis work of criminal organization primarily uses manual analysis, so data collection, storage analysis and visualization woul d spend a lot of manpower and material resources. Social netw ork analysis tool makes forensic analysis of criminal orga nization into intelligence analysis phase. We use social network analysis methods and tools to gain insight into th e structure and organization mode of the criminal organization  Social network analysis is used to analyze these networks effective theory and methods. Social network analysis can provide a set of norms and methods to analyze the structure of social relations and their properties in a social group. SNA method can be used to study forensic analysis of organized crime. Thereby the results can more effectively guide the administration of justice with technical means There is a lot of research work for the analysis of social groups based on SNA. Hisato Tashiro  e thod for finding leadership in e ma il network using betweenness and in-degree network centralitie  a geRank Haibo Wa ith m to detect the community structure in weighted email net works by deleting all the boundaries. In order to measure how much an edge could be a boundary between two co mmunities, a composite index named mediumness is defined, which is derived from betweenness centrality. Many researchers studied the small groups and their structure in communication network, like  plex network res earch works, many researchers  also use centrality method analyzed the structure of complex networks, and identify an important member of small group like [6,7  Some research work for criminal network analysis based on SNA occurred. The main contents of organized crime forensics based SNA method include the modeling of criminal organizations, computing organizational size analyzing organizational structure, finding membership composition and identifyi ng suspicious targets  Jennifer oped a criminal network intelligence analysis system \(called CrimeNet Explorer which consists of four part s: network creating, network segmentation, structural analysis and network visualization This system uses a variety of advanced technologies including the concept space me thods and social network analysis methods, which can automatically analyze the number of criminal gangs in a criminal network and identify core criminal members   and his team m e m b ers developed a tool  to build network structure of terrorist organizations \(called   NETEST\based Bayesian reasoning.

terrorist organizations in online forums and built social networks and organi zational structure IV E MAIL F ORENSIC S NALYSIS F RAMEWORK Current research work related to criminal organization communication contact focus on email communications content analysis, such as EMT and MET. The two tools mainly analyze the message traffic and mine message subject to provide decision support to investigations Another scholar proposed a method to mine sensitive content and message subject to identity message authentication using support vector machine learning me But these resea rch work for email forensics is not involved the entire system framework. It is hard to achieve comprehensive email fo rensic work without system framework. So study of the framework for email forensics is important to email evidence investigation. Rachid Hadjidj designed and i m p l em ented a co m p rehensive software toolkit called IEFAF to assist investigators gather clues and evidence in an investigation forensics for email communication. The framework offers several functionalities including email storing, editing, searching querying and email account localization. The IEFAF achieves a static forensics and analysis for email communication and has a good practical significance. But IEFAF tool can not achieve a complex mail network association analysis  rty posited a fra m ework for the forensic investigation of em ail data, focusing on the triage and analysis of unstructured data to identify key actors and relationships within an email network. The researchers demonstrated the applicability of the approach by applying relevant stages of the framework to the Enron email corpus The work is only for a specific case, but no complete theoretical framework  Based on existing frameworks, this paper proposes a new email forensic analysis framework to solve the email dynamic relationship analysis, especially in email communication relationship and structure analysis. The new framework also achieves static forensics and analysis for email communication  The new framework of the email forensic work is as Figure 1  000\003 address address    etc. Using these attributes, we can study and discover the relationships between multiple email accounts. An d also the investigator is able to retrieve the specified email relevant to the case Next we construct a relationship graph of email accountsí communications, in which the vertices represent 
from to cc subject received date 
Figure. 1 Email forensics framework The main work of framework includes email decoding attributes extracting, searching, email communication network graph generating, data filtering, email clustering finding suspect criminal organization and identifying core members of criminal organization  According to this framework we collect email data from mail clients \(e.g. Foxmail, a Chinese version of the email client software\nt clients may use different mail storage file format and em ail accounts organizational methods. We need to find the relationship between email data files and email accounts. But also we need to separate out every single email from one email account. So we can get all the user message data According to different mail protocol format specifica tion \(e.g. MIME, UUencode and Binhex\we can decode all messages For each email message, we can extract its attributes be required for email forensics, and store email attributes into the MySQL database. These attributes mainly include

email account and a directed edge is established from a node with address to another node with address. The number of email between address and address is as the value of corresponding edge In the email forensics frame work, it is important to find criminal organizations and their core members. We proposed filtering algorithm and clustering algorithm for email network graph, which help us to analyze email network structure and obtain more forensic clues  The following sections of this paper describe several important functional mo dules for email forensics framework V E MAIL N ETWORK G RAPH G ENERATING For original email data set we first have to apply subject-based and content-based filtering methods \(e.g Bayesian algorithm\ to retriev e related messages for specified cases by investigator. Then it due to store messages data needed for email forensics  For these email data, it is a basic development work to construct the email communication network graph. With this email network graph, we can further study the criminal organizations and their core members  In order to show the relationship between the communication relations more directly, we realize email communication network graphic using extended JUNG framework JUNG is a software package and a support tool Java library. We extend the JUNG framew ork and use it to design an email relationship graph and its operation algorithms  The steps of realizing the visualization of email relationship network graph are as follows Initialize graph and adding vertices and edges Create a Layout objects fo r the corresponding graph Layout<String, Stri ng> layout = new CircleLayout\(g Create a VisualizationViewe object VisualizationViewer<St ring,String>vv=new VisualizationViewer<String String> \(layout A visual object is placed in a container object and displayed. Thus, the network diagram of graph can be drawled in the window The network graph is a directed graph. Here each vertex represents an email account; an edge represents an email communication. An edge can be given a value which is the number of email communication. Using the email network graph, we can clearly identify and analyze the communication relationshi p between email accounts An email communication network graph is as follows Figure.2. Here we choose the 500 emails of the CCERT Dataset \(a Chinese email dataset  000\003

Figure. 2 An email network graph From Figure 2, it shows the correspondence of email accounts. By dynamically selecting a special email account and dragging it to the appropriate location, we can identify the communication relationshi p the special account and the others more clearly VI F ILTERING M ETHOD B ASED ON M INIMUM T RAFFIC In a suspected criminal gangs, if the value of an edge is smaller, it shows the relationshi p of two email accounts be connected with the edge is not very close.

than the specified communica tion threshold, we delete the edge. Then that we can keep the email accounts vertexes be linked closely related to crime group  The communication network graph of Figure 2 can be processed to the result as shown in Figure 3. Here the value of communication threshold is 100. In the process, we have deleted some redundant edg es and related email account vertexes. As shown, the visual test result is clearer  000\003 
002 
Figure. 3 Email network graph after filtering From Figure 3, we can find the email accounts of more traffic. But it can be igno red the email accounts have complex communication relati onship and some email accounts be concerned may be deleted. If there is such a case it is difficult to find the real suspicious accounts. In order to find more complex communi cation relationship in email network, we need to use more effective clustering method VII C LUSTERING A NALYSIS OF E MAIL N ETWORK G RAPH B ASED ON M INIMUM T RAFFIC When the number of Email communication data is large the email communication net work shown in Figure 2 become to be very complicated. From Figure 2, we can not identify suspicious email accounts and small computer crime gangs. In order to solve th is problem, we proposed a clustering method based on communication traffic. Using this method, we can cluster the email accounts and distinguish the di fferent small groups The basic process of clustering is as follows  Return clusterSet Create a set U, storing all the vertexes of G U is empty Yes Choose a vertex v in U No Create a set Cluster storing a cluster Create a queue Add v to Cluster and Q removed vfrom U Read a vertex vi from the Q , and remove it from the Q Q is empty Locate vertexis  connected to vi in G,add to set N N is empty Read is a vertex vn from N , Add vn to Cluster, and remove vn from the N No Yes Create a set clusterSet, storing clustering results Add Cluster to clusterSet No Yes Figure. 4 Clustering flowchart based on minimum traffic Using the clustering method the email graph of figure 2 will be changed to figure 5 000\003 Figure. 5 Email network graph after clustering As shown in Figure 5, we found 500 email edges were clustered into 3 clusters, in cluding one complex cluster structure and two relativ ely simple clusters

VIII C LUSTERING A NALYSIS B ASED ON B ETWEENNESS C ENTRALITY When the cluster has a nu mber of edges, the edges will influence our judgments. In the case, we also need to delete the redundant edges, making the cluster more closely. How to determine which edge of the graph is the most distant relative? We will use the method based on Centrality analysis to solve this probl em. Centrality analysis is one of the most important methods in social networks analysis. The centrality of a member reflects his ro le in the social network Here we use the Betweenness centrality method   a m e a sure of a vertex's  centrality. If the value of betweenness centrality of a vertex is larger, the vertex can be an important communication vertex. It also shows that there is more communications traffic need to pass this vertex so this vertex can be the center vertex in the small group Here we design an algorithm based on betweenness centrality for the cluster analysis of email graph, digging out the important members and their relationship in small groups The formula for calculating the betweenness centrality of the vertex are as follows Here is the number of the shortest path between vertex and vertex through the vertex  is the number of the shortest path between vertex and vertex  The algorithm of calculating the weight of edge based on betweenness centrality as shown in figure 6 Create edgeScore,store  weight results and is initialized to 0 Remove vertex v from G Figure G traversal over N\(vj\= 0, d\(vj\ = 0,vj is a vertex of G N\(v\ = 1 Calculation N\(v Backtracking from the reverse of each reachable vertex to v Remove edge e from  G and its two vertexes w,x Backtracking is finished Pd =N\(v,w\ /N\(v,x * \(1.0+d\(x d\(w\=d\(w\Pd score=edgeScore.get\(e 002
