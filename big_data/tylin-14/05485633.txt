Geovisualization of knowledge diffusion A case study in data minin Chenyao Li 1 Fang Li 1 Yangge Tian 1 correspondence author 1 International School of Software Wuhan University, 129 Luoyu Road Wuhan, China tiandebox@126.com Abstract The diffusion of knowledge and technology is a complex spatial process. Using geovisualization technology to visualize and analyze diffusion and dissemination of knowledge from the spatial view is of great value. Selecting the field of data mining as research subjects, we bring forward a new way to visualize knowledge diffusion of SCI papers based on the combination of scientometrics and geovisualization technology. Through converting relevant factors of knowledge diffusion into feature layers, we can use all kinds of thematic maps to visualize the factors and process of knowledge diffusion. Based on it, we find some interesting result of knowledge diffusion in this field. It shows the method is helpful to discover the law of knowledge diffusion and will lay the foundation for further studying of data mining Keywords-geovisualization; knowledge diffusion scientometrics; data mining I I NTRODUCTION Visualization is a powerful strategy for integrating highlevel human intelligence an d knowledge into the KDD process [1   Gr a p h i cs pr ov i d e an ex cel len t  v i s u al ly  a p p r oa ch  for exploring data and are essential for presenting results [2   and has got a wide variety of applications in many fields Gaining insight and constructing knowledge demand careful consideration of how the data is to be displayed or visually encoded [3   B u t so me p r o b l e ms  ma y c o mp r i se ma n y  mo r e  data dimensions than what can be displayed simultaneously using conventional methods, or indeed than what can be analyzed with current parametric statistical techniques [4 The diffusion of knowledge and technology is such a problem. It is an importance problem in the fields of scientometrics, but most of the researches concentrating on statistical authors, keywords, citation and so on [5   w h ile  failing to give sufficient attention to the spread of geographical space of these knowledge and technologies. In fact, the dissemination of knowledge and technology is a geographic process  E x ist i ng stud i e s ha ve sho w n tha t  spatial distance is the primary impact on knowledge and technology diffusion [7 c ientific  co llabor a t io n ne tw o r ks  and other social network have a close link with geographical spac   But, it is not very helpful to add the map simply in many cases. For example,  if we only simply add the travel path of knowledge to the geographic base map, as the diffusion process progresses, the paths become more and more thus it is difficult to identify each other and even harder for researchers to find out valuable disciplines inside them. As shown in Figure 1 Consequently, it is important to find a way to geovisualize the feature and process of knowledge and technology diffusion. Based on scientometrics and GIS Visualization technology, we propose a method to implement spatial visualization of knowledge and technology diffusion so as to provide the basis for further analysis and research II  D ATA P RE P ROCESSING We choose data mining and other related literature in the SCI database as our research data source. The SCI database is the most frequently used and highly authoritative database in the research of Bibliometrics [9  Da ta m i ning and its  synonyms \(such as data mine, KDD, exploratory data analysis, information discover y, information extraction intelligent data analysis etc.\ we re used as the search topics All the information was obtained on July, 16th, 2008 when the SCI search process for this study was conducted. The total number of papers related to data mining research in the ISI web database was 10286, after deleting the repeated records, the total number was 9808, which were published between 1962 and 2008. These were published with 13 document types with the distribution analysis. There were 8930 regular/research articles, which accounted for 91.07% of the total production, followed by reviews \(303 3.09%\eeting abstract \(214; 2.18%\ editorial materials 194; 1.97%\, book review\(78; 0.8%\, letter \(26 0.27%\news items \(14; 0.14%\, note\(14; 0.14%\, correction 9; 0.09%\Biographical-Item \(5; 0.05%\and reprint \(2 0.02 In scientometrics research, keywords are often selected to identify the diffusion of knowledge and technology   There are 32968 keywords in all the data mining literature Among them, we selected 50 keywords with highest frequency as our object of study. The 50 keywords are clustering, classification, machine learning, Knowledge Discovery, association rules, information extraction exploratory data analysis, bioinformatics, neural networks decision trees, feature selection, pattern recognition, rough sets, genetic algorithms, informa tion retrieval, text mining visualization, genetic algorithm, database, neural network algorithms, support vector machines, gene expression cluster analysis, knowledge discovery in database microarray, fuzzy sets, privacy, self-organizing map, time series, intrusion detection, feature extraction, Web mining principal component analysis, artificial neural networks, data visualization, data warehouse, fuzzy logic, natural language processing, association rule mining, knowledge V2-590 978-1-4244-6349-7/10/$26.00 c  2010 IEEE 


management, sequential patterns, artificial intelligence ontology By processing contact addresses of corresponding authors in original data, we obtained all the residential city of the authors. According to th e statistical result, there are 788 cities which are involved in our study. We marked these cities on map, inputted their corresponding name, and saved the results into city as a separate layer after geo-coding. On the other hand, we establish a keywordSet table, which record the keywords relevant information, such as the papers name, the year, the auth ors, the authors residential city, the publication etc Through geo-coding, we can establish a linkage between the points in layer city and records in keywordSet table After that, it is convenient for us to generate the required thematic layer and do the geovisualization analysis based on the data III M ETHODS In order to study the law of knowledge diffusion, we need to describe the generation, spread process and distribution status of these technologies. Through selecting appropriate layer data, we use GIS visualization method to spatially present the distribution status, innovation center research trends and other related information in this study A Research Distribution Visualization To some extent, the accumulated number of published paper in a city reflects its level of activity in scientific research. Consequently, the c ities with a large cumulative number of published papers can be regarded as research centerŽ of its kind. In this study, we got the statistics of each citys and countrys total published paper number in the field of data mining, and make use of the GIS technology to draw thematic maps, as shown in Figure 2. In the figure, a greater dot notation indicates a larger number of publications of a city, and the deeper the blue is indicates a larger number of publications of a country. It shows in the map that the United States and China are the two countries with the most research concentration, and Hong Kong, Beijing, Seoul Singapore, Taipei, New York London are the most highly productive cities. We also notice in the map that there are focus areas of data mining research in Europe and the mideast United States. While in Asia, the research concentration only falls on several single cities despite of the large number of publications in these countries Through dividing time into four stages \(1991-1995 1996-2000 2001-2005, 2006-2008\nd processing statistical number of published papers in each stage, we obtained the individual publication situation of the four stages and save the result into four feature layers. As shown in Figure 3. The map indicates that research of data mining firstly emerged in some European and North American cities and it was not until 1996 that East Asia became important research area in this field. Ac cordingly, the cities with most publications turned from Beer Sheva, Regina, London 1991-1995\ to Hong Kong \(1996-2000\ Beijing \(20012005\ and Seoul \(2006-2008 B Innovation Center Analysis In scientific research, the innovation achievements are often more important than the mere number of publication We obtained the statistics of the cities in which the selected 50 keywords first appeared, and then ranked these cities in accordance with the frequency of the first-appeared keywords. The cities with a better ranking indicate that they more easily tend to generate and accept new concepts and ideas, which are the major sources of innovative ideas and technologies in the research area Similarly, we displayed the cities with classification according to the number of first-appeared keywords. In Figure 4 it shows that some of the large research centers quietly disappeared from this map, the city survived are mainly in the Unit ed States and Europe, which are the traditional academic areas. As shown below, San Jose Denver, Porvo, London, Beer Sheva are cities which can be considered as innovation center If we produce a superimposed layer of innovation cities and research cities, we can find some more interesting phenomenon. That is, most of the innovation centers in the United States are not the ones with the most publications while although many Asian cities have a large number of publication, they typically show less innovation achievement European cities are somewher e in between. As shown in Figure 5 C Knowledge Diffusion process Visualization Keywords in scientific literature generally indicate key technologies applied in the research [11 As m e ntio ned above, the spatial distribution of researches could be studied through spatial statistics, which aims at analyzing the number of the same keywords of different cities. Further, if we add the time dimension for each city, we could study the spatial diffusion of the keywords. As a result, we can study the spatial diffusion of related knowledge \(technologies\ by selecting suitable keywords However, how to visualize the diffusion phenomenon might be a problem. As shown below, Traditional approaches typically connect the cities involved in knowledge diffusion process by line segments. Yet, with the passage of time, spatial line segments will increase more andmore so that its hard for researches to find out laws through this After testing several methods, we find that it is relatively a better choice to represent the passage of time by color. As shown in Figure 6, dots and areas with deeper color represent cities and countries which get earlier involved in using the clustering technology. The map indicates that several cities, mainly in the Un ited States, made the greatest contribution in the early research of clustering technology before 2000. They include Pilani \(India Londonderry \(UK\, and \(the rest are American cities Wellington, Madison, Redmond, Redwood Shores, Ithaca Seattle. And then the research cities spread out in the world Volume 2 2010 2nd International Conference on Computer Engineering and Technology V2-591 


but still keep concentration in United States and Europe. The diffusion also seems highly pertinent to spatial distance when a city begins to use clustering technology, shortly later the surrounding cities start to use this technology too. It leads to the spatial concentration of corresponding research in the technology. This phenomenon is very obvious in Europe and the United States. We obtained similar result in the study of other related technology in the field of data mining IV C ONCLUSION Aiming at solving the difficult problem in knowledge diffusion, this paper proposes a method of combining scientometrics and geovisualization technology to visualize related factors of knowledge diffusion in spatial dimension so that it will provide conveni ence to observe and analyze the trend and result of knowledge diffusion. Taking a case study in data mining, we undertook research in how to construct thematic map layer using original SCI data, then solved the technical problems in generating the thematic maps, and finally obtained a series of interesting results. Our study shows that using this method, we can overcome the deficiency in traditional scientometric research, and make it easier for researchers to discover the hidden information in large amount of data, as well as provide convenience in follow-up study. Therefore, this method deserves a further and deeper value of research R EFERENCES 1 H J Mil l e r  J H a n, G e o g r aphic D a ta M i n i ng  a nd K n o w le dg e  Discovery , CRC Press, 2009.2.ed 2 C Ch e n  W H rd le  A Un w i n  Ha n d b ook Of Da ta Vi s u a l i z a t i on  Springer, 2008 3 W a r e  C   2 000   I n forma t i on Vi s u a l i z a t i o n  Pe rc e p t i o n for De si gn  Morgan Kaufmann, Los Altos, CA 4 L andg r e be D   1 9 9 9   I n f o r m atio n e x tr ac tio n pr in ci pl e s an d m e t h o d s  for multispectral and hyperspectral image data.

T2 6 the construction accidents of level III, the effective and value strong association rules could be expressed as Bad command, instrument failure ? collapse accident Support= 10%, Confidence= 1 OO Other person-factors, no protection ? collapse accident, \(Support= 10%, Confidence= 1 OO In construction process, a bad command plus instrument failure often make collapse accident happened Under other person-factors and no protection devices situation, collapse accident would take place. According to the result, in construction sites, the management officials should pay more attention on commanding 


equipment failures and safety measures N. TEST RESULTS Based on 387 safety accidents of level III during the construction accidents accrued from 1997 to 2006 among the whole nation, this paper selects the four dimensions Type, Person, Instrument and Environment, to find the association rules. Let min-sup be 2.5% and min-conf be 70%, valuable results are listed below Frequent predicate sets are those followings CD high fall, instruction, no protection instrument operation at high position \(support account is 12 collapse, operation contrary to instruction, no protection instrument, complicate sites \(support account is 15 collapse, no security check, no protection instrument, complicate sites \(support account is 14 poisoning, bad commanding, no protection instrument, poisonous gas \(support account is 18 Strong association rules are those followings CD operation contrary to instruction, no protection instrument, operation at high position ? high fall \(the value of confidence is 80 1080 operation contrary to instruction, no protection instrument, complicate sites ? collapse \(the value of confidence is 88 no security check, no protection instrument complicate sites ? collapse \(the value of confidence is 93 bad commanding, no protection instrument poisonous gas ? poisoning \(the value of confidence is 100 From the valuable strong association rules, the workers who operate in high during the course of construction without protection equipment would have an accident of high-falls with 80% possibility. Sometimes the constructors conduct some construction without safety equipments at complex sites would be in the accident situation of collapse contrary to instruction with 88 possibility. After construction, perhaps 93 percent of the workers who then do some operation in the complex construction sites without certain security checks and 


protection equipments would be injured under the situation of caving-in. Otherwise, along with the poisonous gas leaking out, the construction operators get poisoned, however, the management officials commit some bad commanding at the construction sites, then the operators still do their work without security equipments so that the accident of poisoning happen almost If other reasons exist, using frequent predicate sets summarized by construction accidents can find other potential rules with more than 80% of confidence in the data, which also have proved the summarized rules are reliable V. CONCLUSION Due to the construction of accidents, finally accidents records on construction increase sharply. With the aspect of Data Mining, this paper tries to provide a kind of decision support tool for construction units. Having established a model of multidimensional association rules this research could figure out why so many accidents took place by using the relevant records on construction through the relationship between the types of construction accidents and the dimensions of "person-instrument environment". In practical applications, the two significant parameters, minimum support and minimum confidence, influence the accuracy of association rules during the process of data mining. Therefore with the help of related experts or experienced personnel jointly, the parameters can be defined properly. That mining some relationships among construction accidents, can in a certain extent have some assistants for helping change the present situation of construction accidents occurred frequently, and plays a role of the warning, which help make correct and effective decision REFERENCES I] Xiao-wen ZHU, "Analysis on Present Safety Situation of Chinese Construction Industry," China Public Security no.12, pp. 27-29,2008 2] Jia-wei HAN, Bo KAN, Technology and Concepts of Data mining.

The proposed algorithm is tested on all the five datasets prepared by Roberto Bayardo, from UCI and PUMSB datasets. The datasets are available at http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi. The characteristics of the datasets are shown in Table 6. The first column contains the names of the datasets. The second column shows the number of items contained in each dataset. The third column shows the average length of each transaction and the last column indicates the total number of transactions in each dataset TABLE 6 DATABASE CHARACTERISTICS Datasets Items Avg. length Records mushroom 119 23 8,124 chess 75 37 3,196 pusmsb* 2,088 50.4 49,046 connect 129 43 65,557 pusmsb 2,113 74.0 49,046 In order to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, BitApriori is compared to the fast Apriori implemented in Ferenc [20], and another similar recently published, algorithm Index-BitTableFI proposed by Song [16]. In order to show the efficiency of the pruning technology employed in BitApriori another algorithm BitAprioriNE, which is the same as BitApriori, except that it does not use the special equal-support pruning, is designed. All of the above four algorithms are implemented in C++ and compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The experiments are performed on a Windows XP PC equipped with a Pentium 2.0 GHz CPU and 1.5 GB of RAM memory  For each dataset, a mass of different support thresholds are tested, and the five most important of them are chosen for reporting in this paper. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3-7. In the figures, the y-coordinate denotes the execution time \(in seconds while x-coordinate denotes the support threshold 0 100 200 300 400

In this dataset, the special equal-support pruning works efficiently. In Fig. 4, BitAprioriNE beats Apriori and Index-BitTableFI. In Fig. 5, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified, especially when the minimum support is low. In Fig. 6, BitAprioriWE exhausts the memory when the support threshold is lower than 0.8, but BitApriori does not. That means the special equal-support pruning contributes to save the memory. In Fig. 7, when the threshold is larger than 0.725, Apriori beats the BitApriori. But BitApriori outperforms the Apriori, when the threshold is lower than 0.725  


Apriori does not use the binary string and the special equal-support pruning. The BitTable is employed in Index-BitTableFI, but there is no special equal-support pruning, except for the frequent 2-itemsets BitAprioriNE outperforms Apriori in Fig. 3-5, but not in Fig. 6-7, because of the limitation of memory BitAprioriNE does better than Index-BitTableFI in Fig 4 and Fig. 5. In the mushroom, there is a vast number of equal-support itemsets for frequent 2-itemset. So Index-BitTableFI outperforms BitAprioriNE  On one hand, the special equal-support pruning is a useful technique for improving efficiency. The performance is improved significantly, especially when the databases contain many equal-support itemsets, such as the mushroom. It also reduces memory requirement On the other hand, the technique of binary string in BitApriori improves the efficiency of Apriori. These two techniques combine perfectly in BitApriori. So BitApriori has very good performance. It is the best for all of the five datasets  6. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, two effective techniques are employed to improve the performance of Apriori, by reducing the cost of candidate generation, and by support counting The two effective techniques are integrated perfectly in BitApriori, and improve the computational efficiency significantly. Experimental results have shown that BitApriori outperforms the fast Apriori and Index-BitTableFI, especially when the minimum support threshold is low  When the database is large, the BitApriori may suffer the problem of memory scarcity. So how to solve the memory problem will be the question addressed in one of our future works. And another work is to improve Bitwise And Operation on the binary string, or replace it by some more effective techniques  REFERENCES
