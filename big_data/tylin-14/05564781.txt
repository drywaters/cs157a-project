framework outperforms other frameworks in terms of both the average classification accuracy and the stability of performance. The results indicate that our proposed framework can capture the correspondence between spatial patterns and the developmental stages, and thus is quite useful to improve the classification performance    4. Conclusion In this paper, a MCA-based multi-class classification framework is proposed to classify the ISH images based on the developmental stages  By using MCA-based correspondence analysis, a set of rules is generated for each class. Each testing data instance is evaluated using the rules. The coordination module is incorporated to address the no labelŽ and ambiguityŽ issues by integrating the information from the previous step Experimental results show that our proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms and other common classifiers significantly, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework 5.

have been generated randomly using uniform distributions on the respective domains. A single fact table suffices for the objectives of our experimentation While, in fact, the characteristics of the database instance e.g., total database volume and data distribution determinant in order to study the behavior of mining algorithms, this is not so when we are up to study incremental algorithms. Indeed, as simple complexity considerations point out, the important parameters from the viewpoint of the performance study of incremental algorithms are the selectivity of the mining constraints \(which determine the volume of data to be processed from the given database instance of the previous result set  Fig. 3  Item dependent incremental algorithm \(constraint selectivity Vs execution Fig. 3 reports the performances of the item dependent incremental algorithm \(ID mining constraints changes. The experimentation is carried out for different constraints on the item dependent attributes letting the constraints selectivity vary from 0% to 100% of the total number of items The Fig. 4 presented tests the same algorithm, but it lets vary the number of rules in the previous result set. Again we sampled twenty points \(in the range 0  220 figures report the total amount of time needed by the algorithm to complete In particular, the bars, which represent the single experiments, are divided in two components: the preprocessing time \(spent in querying the database to retrieve Incremental Update Strategy for Indexed Item Set Mining  522  and store in main memory the items that satisfy the constraints needed by the algorithm to read the previous result set and to filter out those rules that do not satisfy the constraints any more Fig. 5 and 6 report the performances of the context dependent CD time, specifying how much time was spent for preprocessing and for the core mining task 


  Fig. 4  Volume of previous result Vs execution time for Item dependent incremental algorithm It is worth noticing, that the CD incremental algorithm performs a greater amount of work with respect to the ID algorithm because the problem it solves is far more complex In fact, in the preprocessing phase the algorithm must retrieve all the group/item pairs satisfying the constraints and access to them in order to build and update the BHF data structure Only then, it can retrieve the results from the BHF structure  Fig. 5  Context dependent constraint selectivity Vs execution The execution times of both algorithms increase almost linearly with the increase of the two parameters \(constraint selectivity and previous results item dependent incremental algorithm runs much faster than its counterpart  Fig. 6  Volume of the previous result Vs execution time Both the algorithms are faster than the IMine algorithm which, is incapable of solving a class of more difficult problems of mining item set extraction from contextdependent constraints. IMine, as the most of the algorithms operates starting from scratch. Hence, comparisons of incremental update strategy with other mining algorithms on the field of context dependent constraints show better performance quantifying to 7% improvement Must be in two column format with a space of 4.22mm 0.17 V. CONCLUSIONS The proposed incremental update approach to constraintbased mining makes use of the information contained in previous results to answer new queries in frequently updating databases. The beneficial factors of the approach are that it uses both the previous results and the mining constraints, in order to reduce the item sets search space. It comprises of item dependent and context dependent constraints for extracting item sets Proposed approach makes a significant usage of available results of previous queries \(if the incremental approach results effective with respect to a conventional execution 


incremental option for a data mining algorithm is of course preferable in an inductive database system, since it allows the exploitation of all the available information in the system in order to speed up the response time The better performance of incremental algorithm depicted in the result section  worked on problems with item and context dependent constraint present a solution for item extraction from frequently updated database. This is done by running first the  Proceedings of the International Conference on Communication and Computational Intelligence 2010  523  mining algorithm of our choice \(on the problem defined by the query but without the context dependent constraints then applying the incremental algorithm on top of it \(with the addition of context dependent constraints whenever the mining constraints select a very small part of the original dataset, proposed incremental update strategy is likely to be very fast and efficient REFERENCES 1]  G.

frequent, and there is no equal-support pruning in its subsets. So the Bitwise And Operation on binary strings of 0001100011 and 0001100011 is employed. As the result is 0001100011, the support of the itemset {G C, E} is 4, which is equal to {G, C}. E is put into the equal-support set of {G, C}, and does not need to add a new son node. When itemset {C, A, E} is checked, all of its subsets are frequent, and none of them is in the equal-support set. The corresponding two bit strings 0001101111 and 0011101011, are operated by &. The resultant string is 0001101011. The number of 1 in string 0001101011 is 5. So the support of itemset {C, A E} is 5, which is not equal to the support of {C, A}. So a new son node is added to {C, A}. The Trie after generation\(3  5 8 8 G C A E A 4 C 4 E 6 A 6 E 6 E 7 5 E 0001101011 E  Fig. 2.

The proposed algorithm is tested on all the five datasets prepared by Roberto Bayardo, from UCI and PUMSB datasets. The datasets are available at http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi. The characteristics of the datasets are shown in Table 6. The first column contains the names of the datasets. The second column shows the number of items contained in each dataset. The third column shows the average length of each transaction and the last column indicates the total number of transactions in each dataset TABLE 6 DATABASE CHARACTERISTICS Datasets Items Avg. length Records mushroom 119 23 8,124 chess 75 37 3,196 pusmsb* 2,088 50.4 49,046 connect 129 43 65,557 pusmsb 2,113 74.0 49,046 In order to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm, BitApriori is compared to the fast Apriori implemented in Ferenc [20], and another similar recently published, algorithm Index-BitTableFI proposed by Song [16]. In order to show the efficiency of the pruning technology employed in BitApriori another algorithm BitAprioriNE, which is the same as BitApriori, except that it does not use the special equal-support pruning, is designed. All of the above four algorithms are implemented in C++ and compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The experiments are performed on a Windows XP PC equipped with a Pentium 2.0 GHz CPU and 1.5 GB of RAM memory  For each dataset, a mass of different support thresholds are tested, and the five most important of them are chosen for reporting in this paper. The experimental results are shown in Fig. 3-7. In the figures, the y-coordinate denotes the execution time \(in seconds while x-coordinate denotes the support threshold 0 100 200 300 400

In this dataset, the special equal-support pruning works efficiently. In Fig. 4, BitAprioriNE beats Apriori and Index-BitTableFI. In Fig. 5, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified, especially when the minimum support is low. In Fig. 6, BitAprioriWE exhausts the memory when the support threshold is lower than 0.8, but BitApriori does not. That means the special equal-support pruning contributes to save the memory. In Fig. 7, when the threshold is larger than 0.725, Apriori beats the BitApriori. But BitApriori outperforms the Apriori, when the threshold is lower than 0.725  


Apriori does not use the binary string and the special equal-support pruning. The BitTable is employed in Index-BitTableFI, but there is no special equal-support pruning, except for the frequent 2-itemsets BitAprioriNE outperforms Apriori in Fig. 3-5, but not in Fig. 6-7, because of the limitation of memory BitAprioriNE does better than Index-BitTableFI in Fig 4 and Fig. 5. In the mushroom, there is a vast number of equal-support itemsets for frequent 2-itemset. So Index-BitTableFI outperforms BitAprioriNE  On one hand, the special equal-support pruning is a useful technique for improving efficiency. The performance is improved significantly, especially when the databases contain many equal-support itemsets, such as the mushroom. It also reduces memory requirement On the other hand, the technique of binary string in BitApriori improves the efficiency of Apriori. These two techniques combine perfectly in BitApriori. So BitApriori has very good performance. It is the best for all of the five datasets  6. CONCLUSIONS  In this paper, two effective techniques are employed to improve the performance of Apriori, by reducing the cost of candidate generation, and by support counting The two effective techniques are integrated perfectly in BitApriori, and improve the computational efficiency significantly. Experimental results have shown that BitApriori outperforms the fast Apriori and Index-BitTableFI, especially when the minimum support threshold is low  When the database is large, the BitApriori may suffer the problem of memory scarcity. So how to solve the memory problem will be the question addressed in one of our future works. And another work is to improve Bitwise And Operation on the binary string, or replace it by some more effective techniques  REFERENCES
