technology, which is focusing on data analysis, association rules pattern discovery and so on. It is critical to find efficient ways of mining large data sets. In this paper we present a Personalized Travel Information System, called PTIS.  PTIS can automatically link to the travel sites to collect information, and then create new data rules.  According the rules to provides valuable information for tourism to make travel plan.  In addition, we also evaluate the impact of parameters on the algorithm   Keywords-information retrieval; association rules; data analysis; pattern discovery I   I NTRODUCTION 
 Data mining in recent years is a very important issue especially in this decade of information explosion.  How to use information technology to manage and extract data to useful information is currently one of the important researches Marketing of tourist destination has recently become a very interesting field of research.  In particular, how to make the decision from the large information in web sites for the tourists has become a very important issue in the marketing research in the tourism industry, since many countries use promotion and global marketing in the web sites.  Such research is increasingly important since the information of a destination is 
an essential factor in influencing tourist satisfaction and choices \(Castro et al.,2007; Han, 1990; Chin-Tsai Lin 1   However, data mining is very effective for determining destination for tourists.  It also has been widely adopted to predict the tourists behavior \(Giudici & Oasseribem2002\[4    Data mining is one of the most popular methods for identifying potential customer knowledge in business database to improve decision-making in a firm, by automatically or semiautomatically mining and analyzing large amounts of data in a business databases, and discovering potential significant underlying patterns and association rules in the data \(Hsu 
Chen, 2007; Liao, Hsieh   K m e a ns i s w i d e l y use d t o analyze market segmentation and position.  Data mining is undoubtedly an effective way of discovering the destination for tourists Tourism web sites provide a wide range of tourist information, but users do not have all information on demand This study has two main aims: \(1\o adopt data mining to build a model for assessing a destination for tourists and \(2\o help tourism planners to meet their requirements of their target travel.  In this paper, we proposed an algorithm to establish the Personalized Travel Information System \(called PTIS\ which can categorize the information and through the association 
rules establish that can help to find the useful information The article is organized as follows.  In Section 2 we briefly describe the related works.  In Section 3 we present the personalized travel information algorithm and analyze its performance.  In Section 4 we describe several experiments we did with in implementation of our algorithm on large data sets Finally, Section 5 we present our conclusions and future work II  R EALTED W ORKS  Clustering in data mining is a very important technology, it can be a large number of data to identify the distribution of 
data and find its hidden meaning. Clustering analyzes data which gathered similar information together.  The biggest difference between clustering and classification is that clustering is not pre-set categories represent meaning, adding new property prior to cluster similar data elements together into groups of clusters Association rules were first proposed by Agrawal and Srikant [7 m a in l y ex tract th e ite m s o u t o f a d a ta b a n k   that frequently occur jointly in transactions.  Hence, the rules are often used in a market basket analysis. For example, the items within purchase transactions are the purchased items in a market's sales data bank, and a pattern extracted by association rules will be the items often jointly purchased. Agarwal et al 
proposed an Apriori feature: To a frequent itemset, all its nonempty subsets must also be frequent [7   The Apriori algorithm will generate a big volume of candidate itemsets in the Join portion, while using a frequent pattern tree will not. The tree adopts pattern growth style to recursively establish even longer patterns. Since Apriori-like algorithm requires multiple scanning a data bank, Han and Pei et al. proposed a pattern growth concept in 2000 1 0  an d  978-1-4244-7585-8/10/$26.00 \2512010 IEEE

MacQueen,1967 i t  i s a c l u s t e r center of gravity as a cluster of representative points, if the cluster does not necessarily representative of the point, so it can find the best clustering III  P ORPOSED ALGORITHM  The expert traveler agent suggests user traveling package The tour packages available are defined in a Travel Agency application, according to the variations in the supply and demand of tours. Traveler is in charge of offering these tours to customers in a personalized way.  To achieve this, traveler learns about a customerís preferences through different sources The information obtained from the different sources is used to build the user profile.  A user profile comprises: the contentbased user profile, the collaborative user profile and the demographic user profile.  The content-based user profile contains knowledge about the userís traveling preferences obtained from his/her purchases and complaints.  The algorithm is doing research of this part The proposed algorithm is divided into two parts   Data collection   Cluster establish Fig.1 shows the model of the PTIS. A two stage method was used to build the PTIS model.  In the first stage, the contents of travel web sites will be collected.  The second stage uses the K-Means to clustering the data sets  Figure1.  Research Model of Personalized Travel Information  System A  Data Collection Data collection is simply how information is gathered There are various methods of data collection such as personal interviewing, telephone, mail and the Internet. Depending on the survey design, these methods can be used separately or combined In this study the data were collected from 20 Taiwan Tourism Forum and web sites. This initial search resulted in a set of 13,028 WWW pages containing all or most of the elements. These were scanned and the apparently relevant pages were retrieved and stored for further analysis.  The data contain web contents and the information about train, airplane travel packages, climate and hotel price.  Fig. 2 shows the data collection from several web sites   Figure2.  Data collect from several web sites B  Cluster Establish Cluster K-Means is optimized for speed, and is suitable for very large data sets.  Moreover, K-Means can handle different types of variables, especially those that occur in database records.  Clustering is one of the most popular data mining methods.  The goal of clustering to identify distinct clusters in data sets.  We classify the web sites information into four categories: recognize people custom, reverence historical humanity, regard environmental construction and respect recreational element The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters \(assume k clusters\xed a priori. The main idea is to define k centroids one for each cluster. The main idea is to define k centroids, one for each cluster. These centroids should be placed in a cunning way because of different location causes different result. So the better choice is to place them as much as possible far away from each other. The next step is to take each point belonging to a given data set and associate it to the nearest centroid When no point is pending, the first step is completed and an early group is done. At this point we need to re-calculate k new centroids as centers of the clusters resulting from the previous step. After we have these k new centroids, a new binding has to be done between the same data set points and the nearest new centroid. A loop has been generated. As a result of this loop we may notice that the k centroids change their location step by step until no more changes are done. In other words centroids do not move any more.  Finally, this algorithm aims at minimizing an objective function in this case a squared error function. The objective function is shown in Eq. \(1  2 1   1   c x j n i j i k j J     1 Where 2     c x j j i  is a chosen distance measure between a data point x j i   and the cluster centre c j is an  Data Base K Means Cluster 1 Cluster2 Cluster3 Cluster4 Travelersí Destination Data Collection Web sites

The factors include environmental, traffic \(train and airplane\, climate and hotel price, landscape and the culture.  People in cluster 1 are most satisfied with traffic ñ airplane \(mean=2.847\ and hotel price mean=2.684\.  Clearly, this group people tend to use airplane for traveling.   In cluster 2, cluster 3 and cluster 4, travelers like to take train for traveling.

It is critical to find efficient ways of mining large data sets.  The increase in market-driven competition and adoption of information technology causes tourism market conditions and visitorsí needs to change rapidly.  Travelers are no longer satisfied with mass tourism information anymore and mass tourism customization becomes an alternative to destination variety choices that are efficient resources and reasonable cost structure.  The ability to fulfill diverse tourists needs is insufficient to catch the new opportunities if destinations cannot sense the changes This paper applies data mining to analyze enormous data sets, and help defines the customization and contribution, thus formulating the Personalized Travel Information System model application approach.  We proposed the algorithm that gathering the web contents for clustering and filtering the conditions to meet the touristsí need.  Our experiments also show that has a good reference for tourism In the future, our study will focus on the fully automated processes and more extensive information to provide tourist information more accurately R EFERENCES   1  Castro, C.

1349  Haiti  Chile   Fig.2 The graph of maximum cliques of 4-item credible set  3 Data analysis  3.1 Analysis of 2-item credible set Based on the order of cred ibility, we can find from the statistics of the research all the obtained results of 2-item credible set are di fferent in the critical incidents of earthquake disasters in different areas, however, they have some kind of tendency some critical incidents with high credibility in co mmon, such as price inflation supplies scarcity, land traffic jams, shortage of water and power supply and plague epidemic etc. In some special areas there are other incidents that need to be carefully paying attention to such as radioactive pollution. This paper will use the2-item credible set which are high ranking in the order of th e credibility and happen in different areas but still have the universality to analysis and will illustrate in detail of special cases in special places 1\Inflation Supplies Scarcity  It is suggested that demand is a decreasing function ofprice by general microeconomic theory, however demand may become an increasing function of price, due to the prospects of imbalance between supply and demand, and panic of victims after disasters  This theory fully explains the credible association relationship between the two critical incidents, which are price inflation and supplies scarcity respectively. After the unexpected earthquake, it ma y stimulate the public's demand of basic living materials, which grows rapidly in a very short time, for people tend to exaggerate the consequences of the disaster psychologically. Meanwhile the earthquake may affect the production capacity of the relevant materials in disaster-affected regions, which could lead to strategic behavior, such as hoarding, by material supply enterprises and logistics service enterprises. What is more, it will also affect the service ability and costs of transport and logistics network dynamically and uncertainly  which was listed in Table 2, including land traffic jams, waterway congestion and aviation cong estion. These effects will lead to an imbalance of supply and de mand of living materials Simultaneously, the price formation mechanism after the earthquake, should consider the process of interaction behavior among consumers, businesses and government in the seismic environment. To some extent, the price formation process after disaster is decided mainly by the game between the stakeholders but not by the balance of supply and demand. The influencing factors include not only consumer's demand for goods, from basic needs to  disaster requirements, even to panic demand, but also factors in the enterprise leve l, like horizontal competition mechanism and supply chain transmission factors. In addition, government plays a decisive role in price formation process, with price intervention policies, the degree of commodity reservation and the suit able guide 2\Shortage of water and power supply  Plague epidemic Earthquakes will always cause ground cracking which is likely to cause bod y or tube joint damage of water pipes, and result in lacking of water pressure or losing water supply capacity Meanwhile, it might also cause power plants, substations or transmission lines do  Land traffic jams Social chaos  Supplies scarcity  Price inflation Political chaos  Social chaos  Supplies scarcity Price inflation 


1350  not work in particular regions. Power systems as well as water supply systems are im portant components of the lifeline systems, which are directly related to the normal operation of social production and all aspects of life Moreover, in emergency rescue after earthquake, as an important energy supply, power system is not only the source of motive power for lifeline project like communication, but also the ma in guarantee to transport materials and rescue the wounded. Meanwhile, the normal running of water supply system determines the condition of victims' liv ing water and public health situation directly. During 48 h ours after the disaster, the meaning of pure water for the survivors is more important than food, unless enough clean water is supplied by the rescuers quickly, otherwise, survivors may be infected with any diseases one can imagine. In Haiti, the most common diseases of the victims are respiratory disorders caused by heavy smoke and dust inhalation and diarrhea caused by drinking polluted water, which lead to increasi ng risk of suffering from dengue fever, malaria and urticaria. Once the earthquake or epidemic plague occurs, it might not be limited to a certain part, but spread rapidly affecting the entire region threatening the entire country and even other countries Large-scale public health epidemic that has the characters of spreading rapidly, continuity and chain properties, which often make a regional disaster, quickly escalated into a national or even global crisis. And with the development of information age, the link between things become diversification and synchronic, and limited resources can also lead to attend one thing and lose another, forming a "cascade effect", which will increase the impact of the crisis  Therefore, the spread of crisis will be more visible and prominent in globalization and information age. Thus, the stagnation of water and power supply systems, is likely to cause infectious disease outbreaks in a very short time after natural disasters  Therefore, it is impossible to ignore the credible association relati onship between shortage of water and power supply and plague epidemic, and the mining results of this study indeed confirm the relationship between the two critical incidents  3\ Shortage of water and power supply Communications blackout The anti-earthquake ability of a communication system will affect the rescue after the disaster directly without considering the breakdown of the signal propagation which attributes to th e power supply which was destroyed in the earthquake, when the communication equipment such as the signal tower is destroyed, the whole system will crash as well. It probably leads to the situ ation that the information of disaster rescue operation cannot reported to the headquarter in time, the rescue command cannot arrive and the effective rescue cannot be taken place within a short time after the earthqua ke, these will result in the situation expanding to an uncontrollable state  For example, after the earthquake in Wenchuan, China, the communication between the distress area and the outside was cut off as long as 20 hours, it highly increased the difficulty of rescuing. The blackout of communication can be mainly represented as telephone line cutoff or internet cutoff. Based on th e mining results, the situation happened more obviously in the Japan and Taiwan earthquakes than any others, for most of the voice and internet data are transmitted th rough the fiber-optic cable in the ocean, which would be easily destroyed in the earthquakes in the islands areas such as Japan and Taiwan. According to this po int, a higher credibility of the relationship between communication blackout and shortage of water and power supply was concluded. Thus this result indicates the ef fectiveness of CAR and its maximum clique mining algorithm again to a certain degree 4 ioactive pollution In the mining result of 2item credible set of this empirical research, there is a couple of incidents need to be paid high attention, which is the relationship between radioactive pollution and supplies scarcity, the two critical incidents of the ear thquake in March 2011,Japan Due to the earthquake, Fukusgima nuclear power plant got a large-scale nuclear leakage accident, which led to a huge damage to the environm ent, not only polluting the air with radioactive substance s and atomic dusts, but also it caused secondary pollution for the residents in Japan The accident intensified the worry from all the parties about the Japanese food, which is influenced by the nuclear pollution seriously, and unfortunately, it tended to be diffusion. By March 26t h 2011, it had already been 99 kinds of products suffered from nuclear contamination in Tokyo and five other areas 18 In Japan lots of individuals panic bou ght agricultural products and necessaries for living, as a result, the phenomenon of supplies scarcity appeared gradually. Meanwhile, Japan is one of the world's biggest food import state, its domestic resources are limited, what was worse, these limited products would decrease rapidly attributing to the nuclear pollution. Therefore, the import demand of agricultural products would expand to a higher level, it is likely to stimulate the increasing of agricultural products imports in some Asian economies, and then it is entirely possible to push some worldwide food prices to a higher level. Although the effect may be not appear very soon, it indeed confirm the cred ible association relationship between radioactive pollu tion and supplies scarcity  3.2 analysis of 3-item credi ble set and 4-item credible set To observe the results of the maximum cliques shown in Figure 1 and 2, any two vertices, namely any credible association credibility between two critical incidents is greater than 0.2, which means that in many critical incidents of earthquake disasters of the special areas, several events shown in the figure are most likely to occur simultaneously. In the analysis of the 2-item credible set, it has been illustrated the relationships between the incidents and the reasons for them such as supplies scarcity. Therefore, this paragraph would pay 


1351  more attention to explain the credible association relationships between the political chaos, social chaos and other critical incidents in special areas Due to the earthquake, lacking of supplies, the rising prices and other series of crises become inevitable incidents to victims, and it indirectly lead to social disorder and unrest. Wang Hanzhong analyzed the process that the ancient Chinese farmers became the bandits because of their hungry or displaced when disaster came 19 When the farmers did nothing to the disaster, the ending of them was sitting and waiting for death. However, when the farmers became desperate to be the bandits, they might survive from the disaster Although it is rarely to see that victims becoming bandits after disasters in modern society on a global scale, the emergence of critical incident s might inhibit the implementation of the policy to a certain extent, which would affect the peopleês normal production and living order. When a disaster occurs in a country with a unstable political situation, this social disruption would occur, and even eventually lead to violent incidents According to the years of colonial domination and slavery system, there are 3 main political forces in Haiti areas, and due to historical grievances, they have never got a political consensus Therefore, no matter who take office, it is hard to obtain universal supported, and it is difficult to produce a strong internal cohesion in the state  Facing to a disaster, the government is hard to obtain peopleês trust, and people barely can be taken care of the government either. Du ring the period after the disaster, society was disorder ed and looting happened everywhere, besides, limited social relief organizations always seemed too weak to solve the problem. It is difficult to implement national political wills effectively and also difficult to obtain positive responses from other social organizations. After th e earthquake, not only the victims were difficult to obtain drinking water, food basic shelter and social security but also the social contempt for the dead demonstrated a kind of disrespect for life, which caused large-scale post-earthquake humanitarian crisis in Haiti, and violence events occurred frequently. Thus, as the results shows above there are strong credible association among the critical incidents, supplies scarcity price inflation, land traffic jams, social chaos and political chaos  4 Enlightenment of the paper  In recent decades, due to the frequent occurring of the earthquake, different governments all over the world positively formulated diverse emergency response plans for destructive earthquake according to their national conditions. They published relevant policies and took measures to try to decrease the damage of the earthquake into a small range. Considering the analysis above results of data mining based on CAR and its maximum clique mining algorithm inde ed reflect the relationships between different critical incidents of earthquake disaster so it is entirely possible to propose more effective emergency response plans based on this research, that means to observe these relationships of the incidents systematically. The government should fully consider the cascade effect of the critical incidents of earthquake disasters, through the occurring of one incident, they could forecast which one is the most likely to happen next. It would help to avoid suggesting single solution to only one critical incident and overmuch paying attention on lower possible ones, in other words, it is entirely possible to try to suggest more effective and comprehensive emergency response plans. As a result not only can it help to rescue smoothly, but also it is significant to stabilize the society and decrease the negative impacts   5 Conclusion  This paper introduces credible association rule and its maximum clique mining algorithm, combined with the composition of the evolution of risk events, this paper analyzes the data of 9 earthquakes which bring greater impact to the world than any others in recent 4 years as an empirical research. According to related theories and discussions, this paper verifies the exactness of the mining results and the effectiveness of the CAR and its maximum clique mining algorithm under the situation of earthquake. Th e results of data mining represent the credible associati on relationships of the critical incidents of the earthquake disasters, after the global observation, the paper analyzes couples of critical incidents which have the universal properties and higher potential occurring probabilities, and it is significant to conduct the governments in different areas for proposing the emergency response plan scenario for destructive earthquake. However, there is a defect in this paper as well, namely lacking of the research on the incidents which credibility is lower than the threshold, while, they would be analyzed in the future study to avoid omitting o ther constructive significant information  References  1 n g wenxi Response to emergencies and public crisis management.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Our scheme eliminates all redundant rules in the sense of [25, 31], i.e. those association rules that are not in the covers.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
