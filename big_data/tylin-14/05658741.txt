INTRODUCTION Frequent pattern mining is an important task of data mining. It is essential for mining association, relevant and interesting links. In addition, it is widely used in data classification, clustering and other data mining tasks Many effective, scalable algorithms have been developed in terms of frequent pattern mining. The Apriori algorithm is a classical frequent itemsets generation algorithm, and a milestone in the development of data mining. there were many improvements on the original works [1-4]. These methods adopted the generation-and-test approach. They iteratively generate the set of candidate frequent patterns of length \(k+1 from the set of frequent patterns of length k, and then check their support counts in the database. However, there are two fundamental drawbacks [5] with the Apriori-like generation-and-test approach. First, the generation of a huge number of candidate sets is costly. Second, the repeated scanning of the database and the testing of candidates by 


pattern matching is time consuming Aiming at the two problems, researchers put forward a lot of effective methods. From the data structure point of view these methods are broadly categorized as:\(1 on set structure, such as the Apriori-like approach. And space theory based on project set lattice algorithm for mining association rules [6,7].\(2 such as the type FP-growth algorithm [8,9], etc.\(3 based on vertical data layout[10 Compared with the Apriori-like methods, the FP-tree approach is novle and efficient, but it still has something to be improved. First, for the same frequent item,there are duplicated tree nodes on different branches of the tree. Second, the FP-tree structure is rather complicated, and the recursive construction of conditional FP-trees is a nontrivial task Fan-Chen Tseng and Ching-Chi Hsu present another approach to mining frequent patterns without candidate generation: using a simpler linear list structure called the frequent pattern list \(FPL  transaction database into several parts without intersection compress and store transactions in its nodes efficiently However, it has disadvantage in complexity of space because of recursively building sub-FPL, and it is possible to generate repeat mining frequent patterns Closed frequent itemsets [11-14] contain complete information on frequent itemsets, and compress the number of frequent itemset in a high degree. In particular, It has great advantages in the longer pattern mining in densely database, It has became a research focus In this paper, we present an approach to mining closed frequent itemsets with FPL in transaction database\(CFPL CFPL introduces two operations named as signature vertex conjunction and vertex counting. The vertex conjunction operation has the potential parallelism. Operations among signature vertex reduce combinational space of frequent patterns and improve the efficiency of the algorithm The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the construction of the FPL. Section 3 details the CFPL. Section 4 discusses our approach with other related works. Section 5 gives the conclusion II. FREQUENT PATTERN LIST CONSTRUCTION Let I = {a1, a2, , am} be a set of items, and a transaction

Find the frequent items and their corresponding frequencies. Create a linear list of item nodes of frequent items in order of descending frequency. For each transaction Tx in DB, A bit string, called transaction signature is formed from left to right to indicate the existence and absence of frequent items in Tx. When all the frequent items in Tx are examined, the FPL is formed. The example resultant list is shown in table 2. Construction of the FPL and other details of the FPL not elaborate.

Basic concept and properties Definition 1  Itemset A is the union of the items of I, then the support of itemset A is defined as the probability that A appears in DB, written as Sup\(A A A support counting of A is defined as the transaction data that A appears in DB Definition 2  Let 1  arbitrary n-dimensional vectors in Euclidian space, where 0,1i i? ? ? , 1, ,i n= " .The operation ? ??  is defined by  0 0 0, 0 1 0,1 0 0,1 1 1 The operation ? ?? is called the conjunction of vector ? and vector CFPL considers the transaction signature of FPL in same bit and in same node as a signature vector. In Tab.2 for example, among the nodes of frequent item p corresponds to the first, the third and the fifth signature vectors are   the vector takes separately corresponding bit of transaction signature. In FPL, the LSBs \(least significant bits  transaction signature in every nodes are all 1. Its signature vector is The conjunction of arbitrary two signature vectors is the signature vector of the union of frequent itemsets that two signature vectors correspond to. For example, conjunction the first bit signature vector vector  of pattern fc in present node Definition 3 Let 1 as the sum of all components of the vector, written as

The patterns possessing same signature vector in same nodes have same support 2. If two arbitrary patterns, 1P  and 2P , possess the same signature vector in same nodes, it would be  3. The support of the closed frequent itemset of node i can be computed by    DB   Where  contained in transaction database B. Algorithm for mining closed frequent itemsets with FPL In this section, we give the algorithm for mining closed frequent itemsets with the FPL. The example in section 2 is used here for explanation Algorithm \(CFPL mining: mining closed frequent itemsets Input: the FPL, a minimum support threshold t Output: the complete set of closed frequent itemsets Steps: Procedure CFPL-mining \(FPL, t  1 patterns and signature vertexs Item node 6 in the table 2 resultant list, is shown in table 3

C. Experimental Results We test our algorithms on two data sets, Chess and Mushroom, provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository To compare our method with FP-CLOSE [13], we run our program on a Pentium 233-GHz PC with512 megabytes main memory, running Microsoft WindowsXP. The algorithms are implemented with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. The result is shown from Fig. 1 to 2.From the result we see that CFPL-Mining is much faster than FP-CLOSE TABLE 7.

Experimental results in Mushroom IV. DISCUSSIONS Compared with other closed frequent itemsets mining algorithms and the FPL algorithm proposed in literature[5], the efficiency of CFPL-Ming comes from the following aspects First, it adopts a frequent pattern growth method Therefore, it avoids to costly generate and handles a huge number of candidate sets Second, it uses a simpler and more straightforward data structure, FPL. Unlike othermining closed pattern methods, it does not need to scan original database more times or construct a complex FP-Tree Third, an improved scheme is proposed to aim to the space complexity caused by recursively building sub-FPL with FPL-Ming. Seen from example, there are strong complement between the data intersection based on FPL and the mining of closed frequent itemset. The scheme devides patterns into several parts with the signature vertex which are refered to as equivalent class. Operation of the signature vertex conjunction among different equivalent classes reduces combinational space of frequent patterns. Transverse operation using signature vertex as its unit differs from FPL which takes transaction signature as its operation unit. The operation has 


the potential parallelism. This is the main difference of the CFPL and the FPL Generated closed frequent itemset is still frequent after deleting pattern base from it. Thus, when mining closed frequent itemset of other nodes, we only need to consider the support of corresponding pattern, no mining anymore. This is also the difference between the improved algorithm and literature[5 V. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, an improved approach, combined the advantages of FPL and closed frequent itemset mining, is proposed. This scheme can drop scanning space quickly and improve mining efficiency by abstracting dedicate patterns during the process of mining frequent pattern There are several issues related to CFPL- mining. For example, more efficient algorithms for performance improvement should be studied. Also, the CFPL approach can be applied to other applications like the mining of data classification and other data mining tasks ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research is supported by the Fundamental Research Funds for Universities in the Gansu Province of China No.620004 Space of State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping No.509208 REFERENCES 1] R.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
