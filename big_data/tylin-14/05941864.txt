The performance of a faculty of any school or an Institute has been found to be dependent on a number of parameters broadly ranging from the individualís qualifications, experience, level of commitment, research activities undertaken to institutional support, financial feasibility, top managementís support etc.The  parameters which are crucial for assessment of faculty performance range across various verticals, but the paper discusses and  covers the performance of  faculties based strictly on students feedback only. The other assessors of faculty performance being the Management Body which could be a private body or a Government unit, self and peer faculties of the organization or the University. The parameters act as performance indicators for an individual and group and subsequently can impact on the decision making of the individual and also the stakeholders. The idea proposed in this paper is to perform extraction and analysis of faculty performance using techniques of Data Mining. The rationale behind using Data Mining is to cluster faculty performances on various criteria subject to the certain constraints and also extracting the dependencies amongst the parameters which will help finding meaningful associations between them. These associations in turn help to identify new patterns for decision making. The paper restricts to students feedback from Computer Applications Department across accredited institutes. The analysis depends on many attributes and the paper justifies the usage of mining methodologies rather than following the conventional approach Keywords: Data Preprocessing, Analysis, Mining, Clustering Trend Extraction, Performance Prediction, Dependencies I   I NTR ODUCTION  The need of Data Analysis and Mining in higher education is to mine faculty and students data from various stakeholdersí perspectiv h e p r e v ious p a per  we hav e  shown the rationale behind using statistical and mining tools to analyze and extract patterns in faculty performance. The methodology adapted to design the Faculty Performance Assessment and Monitoring framework has been dealt extensively in the previous papers and relevant parameters identified based on which the assessment will be carried out  e ne x t pa p e r a r ound 300 0 st ude n t records we re taken into consideration[1 a w a s  s m o o t h en ed an d profiled, inconsistent data was removed. The data was then subjected to analysis using conventional approach and further by implementing statistical and mining techniques classification and level 1 clustering\certain conclusions were arrived at. In this paper we have shown data preprocessing and clustering based on attribute class and its type and the dependencies between the parameters under the category of student feedback. The faculty performances have also been extracted using clustering techniques with regard to specific timelines. Below is the graph \(Figure 1\depicting the same and the results display normal trends i.e. with time the performance of an individual soars high. The graph depicts the performance based on student feedback for a faculty and encompasses feedback for elective as well as compulsory subjects  Fig.1 Faculty Performance Semester wise The abo ve graph is a snapshot of few faculties and the other snapshots also show a normal trend. The justification of implementing statistical analysis and mining algorithms was required to extract intelligent information and to perform complex calculations, trend analysis and sophisticated data modeling, and reporting. The need was to identify critical information on the not so obvious data that would enable better decision by the academia   Se mester wise performance of a faculty 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 N ame C Sing h A Nik am N et ra  P atil Meghraj  Ch aku r Ga uri Jh a       94 ___________________________________ 978-14244 8679-3  11 26.00 ©201 1 IEEE 


II  DATA CLUSTERING AND ANALYSIS The student feedback data after preprocessing using the WEKA preprocessor was subjected to filter where all the numeric attributes were transformed to the nominal form and the clustering algorithm was applied on the individual as well as the set of attributes/parameters and different cluster statistics were found. The analyses of the different clusters have given some interesting results as shown in the table below. The figure 2 shows the count of students against the lowest and the highest value set for each parameter taken into consideration. The deduction arrived at was that students had given due weight age to subject knowledge and knowledge beyond syllabus \(both being parameters\ and not considered the other parameters to be of much importance and relevance. The parameters which we have taken into consideration are   Su-Subject Knowledge   Te-Teaching with new aids   Mo-Motivating self and students   Co-Communication Skills   Cla-Class Control   Pu-Punctuality and Regularity   Kn-Knowledge beyond syllabus   Ag-Aggregrate Another interesting observation made was the variation in focus of a student while filling up the feedback form. It was seen that initially the parameters are marked with more consciousness and concentration and then it dips down and again goes to a high towards the end. The student concentration, consciousness and effort factors are given much consideration to avoid biased or inconsistent data in the feedback. Currently we are measuring these factors against a recorded scale after testing the feedback form on a group of students whom special instructions were given while filling the feedback form  Fig 2 ñ Students behavior while giving feedback Table 1- Cluster Instances of Faculty Performance       As p er the clustered instances depicted in Table 1 taking into consideration the numeric and nominal attributes the student comments ranged from poor to very good with satisfactory receiving the highest vote. This data is the cumulative performance of all faculties taken into consideration. For faculties in different grades such as Lecturer, Associate Professor the ratio of various comments is shown as below in Figure 3 and each comment category as observed shows a similar trend against each faculty category with the category good and poor having almost the same baseline for both categories of  the faculty           PerformanceIndicators 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 Lecturer Associate Professor Designation Average Ver y Good\(Avg Good\(Avg Satisfactory\(A vg P oor\(Avg  Fig 3 Comment Ratios versus Faculty Category  The extr action of all the above data has been possible by using the data mining classification and clustering technique The correctly classified instances were identified by running the classification algorithm on the training data subsequently generating the confusion matrix which showed the distribution of the comment category across the matrix and also gave the detailed accuracy in terms of True Positive and False Positive rate by class. Next the preprocessed training data was subjected to clustering and for each attribute class based on the lowest and highest value; the feedback count for each value was recorded and depicted through the above graph as shown in Fig 2. Similarly Figure 3 represents cluster results across comment category and across designations. The extraction of different types of result would have been very time consuming or not possible if conventional methods had been followed  III  ASSOCIATION RULE ANALYSIS Af ter the clustering has been performed the student feedback data was subjected to association rule mining. The Association Detection is basically to detect relationship between specific values and extensively helps in finding hidden trends which range from areas of business practice to research. The association rule mining has been implemented to undermine the hidden trends in Faculty performance and their behavior. The Apriori Algorithm was used effectively to find out the best rules or associations. The lower bound and upper bound minimum support range was given between 1 and 1.0 and the algorithm was executed on 2890 correctly classified instances. Following results were derived from mining the database. The minimum support was found to be 0.3\(867 instances\ and the minimum metric confidence was found to be 0.9.The best rules with metric value ranging Stude nt's Marking Pattern 0 1 000  2 000  Lo west\(0 Highest\(5/10 Expon Lowest\(0  Expo n Highest 5/10 Lo west\(0 12  15  17  3 6302135 31  57  Hi ghest\(5/1 0 144 5 114 8 23222164 4 616 Su Te Mo Co  Cla Co  Pu  Kn Ag Classes to Clusters 448 | very good           329 | good 2056 | satisfactory        57 | poor Cluster 0 ñ very good   Cluster 1 ñ good Cluster 2 ñ satisfactory   Cluster 3 - poor 95 


between .9 and 1 are shown as follows in Table2.The association analysis and rule generation algorithm will also help us to find clusters of parameter groups having high confidence and deriving important and meaningful results from the same in future research work. The number of cycles performed by Apriori was found to be fourteen for generating the best rules. With increasing size of the database and with increase in the number of parameters Apriori takes time to generate the associations or rules discussion of which is not within the scope of the paper Table 2- Association Rules Extracted using Apriori  1.CommunicationandPresentationSkills,PunctualityAndRegularity,Kno wledgebeyondSyllabus==>CounselingPersonal Guidance  conf :\( 0.97 2.TeachingAbilitywithuseofnewTeachingAids SubjectKnowledge conf:\(0.97 3.MotivationSelfStudents,CommunicationPresentationSkills,Punctuality AndRegularity==>CounselingandPersonalGuidance  conf:\(0.97 4.ClassControl,PunctualityAndRegularity=5 968 CounselingPersonalGuidance=5 933    conf:\(0.96 5.CommunicationandPresentationSkills,ClassControl CounselingandPersonalGuidance   conf:\(0.96 6.ClassControl,KnowledgebeyondSyllabus CounselingandPersonalGuidance  conf :\(0.96 7.CommunicationandPresentationSkills,KnowledgebeyondSyllabus CounselingandPersonalGuidance    conf:\(0.96 8.CommunicationandPresentationSkills,CounselingandPersonalGuidanc e,KnowledgebeyondSyllabus==> Punc tualityAndRegularity conf:\(0.96 9.MotivationSelfandStudents,PunctualityAndRegularity,Knowledgebey ondSyllabus==>CounselingandPersonalGuidance conf:\(0.96 10.CommunicationPresentationSkills,PunctualityAndRegularity==>Cou nselingandPersonalGuidance conf:\(0.95 11.TeachingAbilitywithuseofnewTeachingAids==> SubjectKnowledge conf:\(1.00    IV  C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK The future work will contain analyzing further trends in faculty performance based on student feedback, changes in faculty behavioral changes and also evaluation of faculty performance across the other verticals as management, peer self and other regulatory bodies.

algorithms is tedious, especially when there is a long pattern ]2[ . Based on the above analysis, this paper proposes an optimization strategy to further reduce the number of candidate items in the candidate item set Ck. In the Apriori algorithm, Ck-1 is compared with the support after its generation, the item sets less than the support will be cut, to generate Lk-1 which will be connected with the Ck-1 to generate Ck. The improved algorithm is to further cut for Lk-1 before the generation of candidate item set Ck, and account for the times all the items in Lk-1 occurred, and delete the item sets which contains the items with occurrence times less than k-1 in the Lk-1, to reduce the number of k-1 item sets participated in the connection, thus to reduce the number of candidate items in Ck. The improved Apriori algorithm implementation process is shown in figure 3  Figure 3.

Experimental results In order to compare performance difference of the two algorithms in large amounts of data, the experimental test data is the data set randomly generated, the random number of items to 256, test data is randomly generated record number, which is 50000, 90000 and 150000. And then using the same minimum support threshold 0.03, 0.05 to test, and record the time required to generate the frequent item sets, to compare with the implementation efficiency of the traditional algorithm and the optimization algorithm, the results as shown in table 1 TABLE I.

Experimental results analysis From the above results it can be seen, when the experimental data is not too much, the implementation efficiency of the improved algorithm is close to the traditional Apriori algorithm, but with the increasing amount of experimental data, the implementation efficiency of the improved algorithm is significantly better than the ordinary Apriori algorithm. This is because that the optimization algorithm has made further cutting for Lk-1 before considering the combination of candidate item set Ck, that is made a count processing for the frequent item set Lk-1 to be involved in the connection ]7[ , and then according to the count results to delete the item set which contains the items with a number of occurrences less than k-1 in Lk-1, thus to reduce the number of k-1 item sets to participate in the connection, to exclude some element do not meet the combination conditions, to reduce the possibility of combination and the number of candidate items in Ck, that is to reduce the number of cycle and judgment. For a large database, this reduction of time cost is obvious in data mining efficiency V. CONCLUSION Data mining technology is mainly used to deal with massive data information, to find hidden, potential meaningful knowledge. Association rule mining algorithms requires to frequently access to the database, which makes the algorithm time complexity high, efficiency low, has become a bottleneck of association rule mining algorithm development. In this paper, through in-depth study of the existing Apriori algorithm and its improved algorithm, an Apriori algorithm optimization program is proposed, and the experimental results show that this optimization program is

158 


 WRAcc  now also perform signiìcantly better than Conìdence and Speciìcity is now additionally outperformed by the F-measure and WRAcc while it no longer performs signiìcantly better than Purity Finally Correlation signiìcantly outperforms Conìdence Obviously some measures might be better than others in distinguishing the top k subgroups from false discoveries when k 1  while others might be better when k  100  The observed changes are not very dramatic and we consider the selection of k a user-derived parameter in the method One of the signiìcant relations that seems somewhat peculiar is the result that for both k 1 and k  100  Conìdence performs signiìcantly better than Purity while the latter is deìned to be max  Conìdence  1  Conìdence   While there is a good theoretical reason to consider the Purity of a subgroup we can see from the deìnition that Purity has a lower bound of 0  5  hence the random baseline will generate higher values with Purity than with Conìdence Apparently the quality of the subgroups found with Purity does not increase enough compared to those found with Conìdence to compensate for this effect By comparing the second and third columns of Table III with the last two columns we can see that  WRAcc   WRAcc and particularly Purity perform better when we restrict the tests to datasets with a binary target These measures beneìt from the fact that in these test cases we have a better balance between positive and negative examples in the data compared to test cases on other datasets We can also read from the table that we have fewer measures that are signiìcantly better than others on datasets with a binary target This is mainly because because signiìcance is hard to achieve in an experiment with only 18 test cases as opposed to 85 or 78 on all datasets With 18 test cases the critical difference for the Nemenyi test with signiìcance level 002 1 is CD 4  496  rather than CD 2  069 with 85 test cases Since the average ranks range from 1 to 12  a critical difference of 4  496 is substantial More signiìcant differences between the quality measures can be expected when tested on more datasets with a binary target The results for the EMM variant were generated on a modest number of test cases As a result the critical difference for the Nemenyi test is quite high and one could not expect to nd many signiìcant results Expensive experimentation may give a signiìcant reason to prefer one measure over another in this setting For now what matters is that this illustrates that our method is applicable in more general settings than just traditional subgroup discovery VII C ONCLUSIONS We propose a method that deals with the multiple comparisons problem in subgroup discovery i.e the problem that when exploring a vast search space one basically considers many candidates for a statistical hypothesis hence one will inevitably incorrectly label some candidates as passing the test Our method tackles this problem by building a statistical model for the false discoveries the Distribution of False Discoveries DFD This distribution is generated by given a dataset and quality measure repeatedly running a subgroup discovery algorithm on a swap-randomized version of the data In this swap-randomized version while the distribution of the target variable is maintained its correlation with the attributes is destroyed Hence the best subgroup discovered on this dataset represents a false discovery The DFD is then determined by applying the central limit theorem to the qualities of these false discoveries Having determined the DFD one can solve many practical problems prevalent in subgroup discovery For any given discovered subgroup one can determine a p-value corresponding to the null hypothesis that it is generated by the DFD refuting this null hypothesis implies that the subgroup is not a false discovery Given a set of quality measures one can use the DFD to determine which quality measures are better than others in distinguishing the top k subgroups from false discoveries This gives an objective criterion for selecting a quality measure that is more likely to produce exceptional results Finally given some desired signiìcance level 002  one could extract from the DFD a minimum threshold for the quality measure at hand When validating single subgroups we see that our method removes insigniìcant subgroups found on datasets that have few numeric attributes From metalearning we nd that on large datasets for instance with more than ve numeric attributes the random baseline is more likely to accept many patterns This is reasonable because of the associated larger hypothesis space Table II shows that our method can remove insiginìcant subgroups on some of the datasets with more than ve numeric attributes but not on all of them When we validate quality measures we have outlined that the method we described determines the extent to which a quality measure is also an exceptionality measure We have seen that of the twelve measures for subgroup discovery we tested 006 2 is the best exceptionality measure and Purity and Sensitivity are by far the worst For the EMM correlation model variant no signiìcant conclusions can be drawn from the modest experiments In this paper we have presented a technique making extensive use of swap randomization Notice that we do not by any means claim to have

data leads to a good model for false discoveries but it comes at a price for every result of a subgroup discovery run one wishes to validate one has to run the same subgroup discovery algorithm an

cc ur ac y   Fig. 4. Accuracy for Model-based clustering and rule-based classification Fig. 5. Distribution of flow attributes in scatter plot matrix In Fig.5, the distribution of IP and ports for source and destination is depicted for Model-based clustering method. For HTTP \(blue traffic to few destination IPs. HTTP behavior is prominent because a number of source hosts are communicating with small number of destination hosts, i.e., HTTP servers. In DNS application, source hosts communicate with a set of DNS servers. Each host interacts with different domains such as www, .org and .net for resolving IP addresses. The DNS behavior is prominent because large group of source hosts communicate with small repeated set of destination IPs. In the IRC application, a group of hosts communicates with other group of hosts. There is roughly one-to-one correspondence between source and destination IP. This behavior is prominent because IRC \(cross with approximately equal number of destination IPs. Moreover, source IP and destination port distribution show that destination port numbers are in the range of 30000 for SMTP green where as HTTP and MAIL have destination ports number in lower range of 1000. Model-based clustering with the Apriori algorithm provides reliable and accurate classification model as compared to K-mean method. The association rules helps us predict flows for particular application with high confidence and lift values IV. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we have presented a classification model that achieves high flow classification accuracy with application behavior profiling. The use of the K-mean algorithm for Netflow classification was shown to be inefficient. On the other hand, Model based clustering with association rule mining techniques provided a much better accuracy. Moreover the rule heuristics are produced automatically, making the algorithm modular and independent of the dataset. In addition

denote the input attribute with the minimum integrated cost after the split, and let the set of allocated sample sizes, computed by the sample allocation method explained later, be ASM . Then DM | children are generated for the node M . For each child CHi, i = 1, . . . , |DM |, the associated query is QN ?{M = mi sample size is asi ? ASM , and potential splitting attributes is PSN ? M . The process of splitting is then recursively applied to children of node N In the process of calculating costs during the strati?cation process, we need to perform sample allocation, i.e., divide the parent nodes sample size among the potential children nodes This is required for calculating the integrated cost for the potential split. This is based on our sample allocation method, which we 328 describe next in Section IV-B. Furthermore, for calculating the integrated cost, the variance of target value ?2i and probability of output attribute A = a, ?i, for each stratum is computed based on the pilot sample Initially, the strati?cation process on the query space begins by calling Stratification\(R, null, F IA, n, null root node. The process of strati?cation would stop if there is no leaf node with integrated cost larger than a prede?ned threshold Each leaf node in the tree is a ?nal stratum for sampling, and the associated sample size denotes the number of data records drawn from the subpopulation of the stratum B. An Optimized Sample Allocation Method Now, we introduce our optimized algorithm for sample allocation which integrates variance reduction and sampling cost As introduced in section IV-A, integrated cost is de?ned by taking into account of variance of estimation and sampling cost The goal of our sample allocation algorithm is to minimize the integrated cost by choosing the sample size, ni, for each stratum In our algorithm, we adjust the value of SampCost and ?2s so that their in?uences on the integrated cost are in the same unit SampCost SampCost SmpCost\(r where SmpCost\(r entire population, and ?r denotes the probability of A = a being true for the entire population 2 2s 


2r where ?2r 2 n denotes the variance of estimation of the target value on the entire population The key constraint on the values of the sample sizes for each strata is that their sum should be equal to the total sample size A vector n = {n1, n2, . . . , nH} is used to represent the sample sizes, where the ith element, ni, is the sample size for the ith stratum By including sampling cost and variance of estimation into the integrated cost, our sample size determination task leads to the following optimization problem Minimize Cost\(n  i\(?s ni i v N2i niN2 2 i subject to  i ni = n 6 where Ni denotes the population size of data records under the space of A = a in ith stratum. Note that this value may not be known if A is an output attribute. However, the total number of records in the ith stratum is typically known, and can be denoted as DNi. Then Ni can be estimated by ?iDNi, and the population size of A = a on the entire population is estimated by N  i ?i DNi For ?nding the minimum of integrated cost, we utilize Lagrange multipliers, a well know optimization method. Lagrange multipliers aims at ?nding the extrema of a function object to constraints. Using this approach, a new variable ? called a Lagrange multiplier is introduced and de?ned by n n  


 i ni ? n If n is a minimum solution for the original constrained problem then there exists a ? such that \(n Lagrange function. Stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of ?\(n n,??\(n 7 In our problem, by conducting partial derivatives on Formula 7 a group of equations are yielded as follows s i v N 2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? = 0 i = 1, ..H i ni = n 8 where the solution n leads to the minimum value of integrated cost in Formula 5 However, it is dif?cult to solve the group of equations directly Thus, we use numerical analysis to approximate the real solution. Newtons method is utilized for ?nding successively better approximations to the zeroes \(or roots Given an equation f\(x x tive of function f\(x method iteratively provides, xt+1, a better approximation of the root, based on xt, the previous approximation of root according to the following formula xt+1 = xt ? f\(xt f ?\(xt The iteration is repeated until a suf?ciently accurate value is reached, i.g. |f\(xt In our problem of Formula 8, there are H + 1 equations F \(xt xt xt n1, .., nH , ?}, where the equations in F \(xt fi\(xt s i v N 


2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? i = 1, .., H fH+1\(xt  i ni ? n The Newtons method is also applied iteratively via the system of linear equations JF \(xt xt+1 ? xt xt 9 where JF \(xt H + 1 H + 1 equation system F \(xt vector xt. The entry JF \(i, j d\(fi\(x dxj where fi\(x xt x From the Expression 9, a better approximation xt+1 is obtained based on previous approximation xt. The iterative procedure would be stopped if ?i|fi\(xt threshold, and then the sample size ni is allocated for each stratum so that the integrated cost is minimized. In reality, we are required to pick an integral number of records from each stratum during the sampling step. Thus, we round down each ni to its nearest integer, ni + 0.5 In the example shown in Table I, suppose we set both weights v and ?s to be 0.5. Further, assume the variance of the entire population, ?2r , to be 80000. The probability of A = a over the entire population ?r is 0.242. By using the proposed optimized sample allocation method, the sample sizes for the three strata 329 are 162, 299, and 139, respectively. In this case, the variance of estimation according to the Expression 2 is 93.66, and the estimated cost is 1943.7. We can see that, compared with Neyman allocation, the sampling cost is decreased by 42.1%, but results some increase in variance. Overall, this example shows that we can achieve lower sampling cost by trading off some accuracy C.

EVALUATION STUDY We evaluate our sampling methods for association mining and differential rule mining on the deep web using two datasets described below US Census data set: This is a 9-attribute real-life data set obtained from the 2008 US Census on the income of US households. This data set contains 40,000 data records with 7 categorical attributes about the race, age, and education level of the husband and wife of each household and 2 numerical attributes about the incomes of husband and wife 


Yahoo! data set: The Yahoo! data set, which consists of the data crawled from a subset of a real-world hidden database at http://autos.yahoo.com/. Particularly, we download the data on used cars located within 50 miles of a zipcode address. This yields 30,000 data records. The data consists of 7-attribute with 6 categorical attributes about the age, mileage, brand, etc, of the cars and one numerical attribute, which is the price of the car Variance of Estimation is estimated for the target value \(i.e mean value in differential rule mining, and con?dence in association rule mining is calculated according to the Expression 2. Since variance of estimation reveals the variation of the estimated value from the true value, smaller variance suggests better estimation Sampling Cost is estimated by the number of queries submitted to data sources in order to acquire a certain number of data records containing target output attributes, i.e. A = a. Larger sample size implies higher sampling costs in a deep web setting where the queries are executed over the internet Estimate accuracy is estimated by Absolute Error Rate \(AER Small AER value indicates higher accuracy. For an estimator on variable Y with true value y and estimated value y, the AER of the estimator is calculated by AER\(y A. Association Rule Mining In this section, we present the results of our method for association rule mining. Using our overall approach, we have created four different versions, which correspond to four different sets of weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling costs. 1 the weight ?v = 1.0 and ?s = 0.0, 2 the weight ?v = 0.7 and ?s = 0.3, 3 v = 0.5 and ?s = 0.5, and 4 weights ?v = 0.3 and ?s = 0.7. In addition, we also compare these approaches with a simple random sampling method, which is denoted by Random We focus on the queries in the form of A = a ? B = b where A and B are output categorical attributes. Other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes Our goal is to estimate Supp\(A=a,B=b A=a association rules are randomly selected from the datasets. Each of the 50 association rules are re-processed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations result is the average result for 5000 executions 


In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
