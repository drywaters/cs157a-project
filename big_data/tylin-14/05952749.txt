A Process Model Oriented to System Service Xin Li Department of Computer Science University of Shantou Shantou Guangdong Province China lixin@stu.edu.cn  Abstract  We present a new conception of process service which is the extension of workflow The separation of process logic from business logic is the key for building such service in system layer However the separation idea is often hard to be implemented because of inherent coupling characteristics in business process applications None of workflow systems including flexible workflow systems is very successful in that aspect We have analyzed WFMC model and find that there exist several defects in it The model lacks necessary criterion 
and some of the elements are so inexplicit that they  re implemented excessively randomly in workflow systems We think that it  s the root of the separation problem We design a new model for process service Compared with WFMC model both the composition and the structure are changed Especially we constitute a framework on the model to realize the separation idea really and truly Keywords-process service process model dynamic association process reconstruction; rule I I NTRODUCTION There  re two kinds of fundamental service furnishments in the computer operating system and net service system called WEB service ordinarily Operating system provides local service for applications running on single machine and 
net service system supports applications running on the network In the view of software architecture net service system is the extension of operating system  2   A s i n gl e computer can be regarded as that there  s only one machine in the network Theappearanceofnetservicesystem,suchas.NETand WEB logic makes it easy to develop distributed applications the developing mode of which is almost the same as that of local applications 3  4   C  S is the t y p i ca l s tr u c tur e o f distributed applications Usually the disposal of the business is mainly on the server and the request is on the client Although the composition of a C/S system may be quite complex it can be divided into one client node and one server node logically namely all of the servers is looked 
upon as one node from the angle of the client However multi-clients will be required when the task becomes huge The task is segmented to several parts Each client is responsible for the operation of one part This mode is called CSCW Computer Supported Collaborative Work A style of CSCW system has been paid most attention to which is process system The segments of the task abide by a basic rule sequence in process system It means that the segments are disposed of step by step as a whole So compared with other CSCW system the collaborative logic in process system is more legible and easier to manage Workflow is the abstraction of business process 5  There  re two sorts of contents in a business process 
application One is the content of the business and the other is the relationship among the task segments Those two aspects have their respective terms in workflow business logic and process logic The idea of workflow is to separate process logic from business logic Thus a common software to manage process logic can be established to support all kinds of business process applications That software is called WFMS Workflow Management System and there have been over 100 WFMSs in the market or in the institute The separation idea of workflow is consistent to former two services operating system and net service Their essences are all of separating fundamental service from the application 6  B u t i t s eem s t h a t n on e o f W F M S s ha s achieved the goal of the separation very well even it can be 
said that they  re still far from the goal The reason will be analyzed in this paper and a new conception called process service will be presented II D YNAMIC ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PROCESS LOGIC AND BUSINESS LOGIC The separation idea of workflow can be illustrated with  Fig. 1   Figure 1 A business process application There  re some activities in  Fig. 1  and the relationship of the activities are expressed by the structure of the flow graph Business logic is inside the activity and process logic is in the relationship among the activities An activity will submit the message to WFMS when it finish the business Then WFMS will schedule successive activities according 
to process logic which has been defined However it will be found that  Fig. 1  is just an ideal circumstance with deeper analysis of the question In fact the association between process logic and business logic is the most simple one whichiscalledstaticassociationinthispaper

Another sort of association also exsits universally in business process applications  Fig. 2  is an example to show it Figure 2 Loan business process This is a loan examination process The business is interpreted as follows 1 Loan application The applicant submits loan form The loaned value and loanee  s credit value are extracted 2 Loan examination Case 1 denotes that loaned value is less than 100,000 and the loanee has good credit Case 2 denotes that loaned value is greater than 100,000 or the loanee has bad credit 3 Responsibility The clerk is responsible for Case 1 and the manager is responsible for Case 2 The association between process logic and business logic in this examnple is more complex than that in  Fig. 1   The applicant and the loaned value can  tbeknownuntilthe loan application is submitted So the route of the business can  t be confirmed when a loan business hasn  t happened Namely the route of the business is associated with business data as is called dynamic association between process logic and business logic in this paper The existence of dynamic association indicates that it  sa native characteristic that the business and the process are coupling together Coupling forms are various and may be quite complicated  Fig. 3  shows another example which is far more complex than that in  Fig. 2   Figure 3 Order business process A commercial company has received an order of some goods The amount of the goods is am There  re some providers which the company can contact with But the providers supply not only this one company but also others So the amount of the goods that a provider can provide for a specific commercial company sometime is uncertain The disposal of the business is described as follows 1 Contacting with providers The commercial company contancts with the providers to get the amount of the goods that they can supply with Suppose the amount of provider i is ami  2 Judgment of the order The company judges whether there  re enough goods for the order Namely judges whether am ami   Ifno,it  ll reject the order Otherwise continue 3 The selection of providers The company selects the providers which can satisfy the order with computing the amount of the supply The above commercial business also has dynamic association between process logic and business logic It belongs to uncertain selection essentially In workflow it haven  t been found that there exists any flow pattern to express such logic So maybe none of workflow systems has implemented the logic directly III T HE DEFECTS OF WORKFLOW SYSTEM AND FLEXIBLE WORKFLOW SYSTEM ON DYNAMIC ASSOCIATION Since there  s no unified framework for dynamic association the methods of the expression and the disposal of the problem are various in different workflow systems 8  T h e f o llow i n g s olu t ion s a r e on l y u s ed to i l lus tr a t e conventional pattern of the development not referring to any concrete system Relative code is for the loan business example in  Fig 2    Fig. 4  shows how to deal with dynamic association problem in workflow system Figure 4 The disposal of dynamic association in workflow system It can be seen that the code of process logic and that business logic are mixed together Even because some workflow systems don  t have the function to support the operation of start\(Activity directly in business code The developer of business process applications has to develop that function outside workflow system himself as increases extra burden for the development  Fig. 5  shows the solution to same example in flexible workflow system It can be seen some progress has been made The rule which is like the form of  if  then  is specifically used to deal with the problem of dynamic association in flexible workflow system  1 0  P r o c e s s logic is separated from business logic in some degree with such mode However the key of the coupling problem hasn  t been solved yet The rule usually uses business information directly and it  s written in the program also as   Reject Provider 1  Provider n Company Order  Case 1 Case 2 Manager Clerk Loan credit=get\(loanee.credit if credit  bad   then start\(managerActivity  Other business disposal loanvalue=get\(loanform.value if loanvalue<100000 and credit  good   then start\(clerkActivity else start  mana g erActivit y  


will yield a lot of troubles especially when the process needs to be reconstructed Figure 5 The disposal of dynamic association in flexible workflow Suppose that the logic of the loan business are varied as follows  Case 1 Loaned value is less than 100,000 or the loanee has good credit  Case 2 Loaned value is greater than 100,000 and the loanee has bad credit The names of some variables are changed either Variable credit is changed to loaneecredit and loanvalue to loanedvalue  Fig. 6  shows the reconstruction of the example in flexible workflow system Figure 6 Process reconstruction with dynamic association in flexible workflow system The rule is rewritten with the business program and they both have to be rebuilt It  s obvious that the solutions to dynamic association in workflow system and flexible workflow system don  t accord with the idea of separating process logic from business logic very well So it  s impossible for present WFMS to become a system service of process management IV P ROCESS SERVICE AND THE PROCESS MODEL FOR IT Firstly we give the definition of process service Definition Process service is a system service which managesbusinessprocess.Itsupportsdynamicassociation and simple process reconstruction In this definition two factors are emphasized 1 Dynamic association between process logics and business logics 2 Simple process reconstruction It  s known that WFMS isn  tfullysuitableforthe requirement of process service The root is that dynamic association hasn  t been adequately considered in WFMC model  Fig. 7  is the sketch of that model 11  Figure 7 WFMC model Workflow relevant data denotes the data which is related with both process logics and business logics This is a ambiguous item There isn  tanycriterionforworkflow relevant data As a matter of fact it  s also impossible to give the criterion because of the variety of business information Another improper item is that transition conditions are put into activity What transition conditions express is the relationship among activities They shouldn  tbelongtoany one activity A new process model is presented in this paper for process service  Fig. 8  shows the model Figure 8 Process model for process service Some new elements which are event state and rule are added to replace workflow relevant data and transition conditions The structure of process model is also reformed accordingly The new elements are expatiate as follows 1 Event The occurrence of the behaviors in process system is abstracted as event There  re two kinds of events in process service system system event and business event System events are predifined in the system and business  Process Refer Activity Rule Has Role Refer Event Has Invoked application Call Refer State Consists of Refer Has Has Refer Workflow type definition Consists of Activity Workflow Relevant data Has Use Role Refer Transition conditions Has Invoked application Call Use Refer loaneecred i t=get\(loanee.credit loanedvalue=get\(loanform.value  Other business disposal Rule if loanedvalue<100000 or loaneecredit  good   then start\(clerkActivity if loanedvalue>100000 and loaneecredit  bad   start\(managerActivity credit=get\(loanee.credit loanvalue=get\(loanform.value  Other business disposal Rule if loanvalue<100000 and credit  good   then start\(clerkActivity if loanvalue>100000 or credit  bad   start\(managerActivity 


events are difined by the developer of business process applications freedomly 2 State Process, activity and role all have states Being similar to event there  re also two kinds of states in process service system system state and business state 3 Rule It  s the expression of process logic There  re two kinds of rules even-state rule and state-action rule The general form of the rule is s ul t Condition Re  Unlike felexible workfolw it isn  t written in the program but in the process templet  Fig. 9  shows that in XML form The rule is interpreted by process service system Figure 9 Rule in XML form All of the elements in process service model have strict difinitions as is different from WFMC model For reasons of space the details of the difinitions are omitted V U NIFIED FRAMEWORK FOR PROCESS MANAGEMENT A unified framework for both static association and dynamic association is established with process service model which is unlike flexible workflow where flexible portion is usually independent of WFMC model 12   Fig 10  shows the sketch of the framework Figure 10 The framework for process management in process service The dashed is the boundary between business disposal and process disposal which incarnates the idea of the separation of process logic from business logic The loan business process in chapter 2 is used to expatiate it  Fig 11  shows the implementation of it in process service system It can be seen that business information doesn  t mixed with process logic any longer and the separation is successful Simple process reconstruction is also realized with the new model  Fig 12  shows the reconstruction of loan process in process service system Only Event-State rule needs to be changed Since there  snomodificationtothe program recompiling and rebuilding of the program aren  t required here Figure 11 The implementation of loan business process in process service Figure 12 The reconstruction of loan business process in process service VI C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK We analyze dynamic association process logic and business logic and find it  sit  s a native characteristic of business process application But the association hasn  tbeen paid sufficient attention to in workflow which leads to WFMC model can hard cope with a number of businesses Flexible workflow has made some progress However there still exist some serious problems First a flexible workflow system often only aims at some specific flexible problems Second flexible workflow usually solves problems of dynamic association outside WFMC model as makes that two schemes exisit in one system at the same time Since workflow system and flexible workflow system both haven  t realized the idea of separating process logic from business logic we present a new conception of process service The conception places process management in the layer of system service firstly The problem of dynamic association is taken into account roundly in process service model New model elements are added and model structure is reformed Particularly a unified framework for both static association and dynamic association is established The scheme of Event-State rule and State-Action rule is the core of process service model The rule is constructed by the means of symbolic logic Yet the contents of process logic exceeds the capacity of basic symbolic logic a lot So it has to be expanded to satisfy the requirement in business process The expansion to symbolic logic will be researched detailed in our future work A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by Science  Technology Project in Shantou No 36 and Open Project of Institute of Equipments for Light Industry in Guangdong R EFERENCES 1 3 1 s s tate e e    Even t State Rule 2 4 2 s s tate e e     credit=get\(loanee.credit loanvalue=get\(loanform.value if loanvalue<100000 then sendevent e1 else sendevent e2 if credit  good   then sendevent e3 else sendevent e4  Other business disposal 1 3 1 s s tate e e    Even t State Rule 2 4 2 s s tate e e    State-Action Rule s tart ity clerkActiv s s tate  1    s tar t ivity managerAc t s s tate  2    Event Event-State Rule Update state Process Schedule Business disposal Send event State-Action Rule Yield action Rule Condition C Condition Result R Result  Rule

And put forward that we could use confidence, category homoplasy and relevancy strength to improve the quality of feature extension modes. We also verified that confidence category homoplasy and relevancy strength are effective through our experiments. In the same time we have drawn the following conclusions: \(1 relationships for short-text can improve their classification performance; \(2 effectiveness of information in the feature extension mode library we should choose the suitable thresholds; \(3 information is too small to meet the demand of short-text feature extension. So we should find out a perfect method which can increase information coverage in the feature extension mode library for short-text classification; \(4 extension library for short-text extension effectively, i.e., choosing a perfect feature extension strategy is also our further work ACKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 60703010 the Nature Science Foundation of Chongqing province in China under grant number CSTC, 2009BB2079, and the Scientific Research Foundation for the Returned Overseas Chinese Scholars of Ministry of Education of China under grant number [2007] 1109 REFERENCES 1] Fabrizio Sebastiani.Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorization, A.ACM Computing Surveys, C.2002.34\(1 2] Fan Xing-hua,Wang peng.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
