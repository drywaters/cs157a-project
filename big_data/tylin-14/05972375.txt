In a world where data is all around us, the need of the hour is to extract knowledge or interesting information, which is hidden in the available data. Association rule mining is concerned with extracting a set of highly correlated features shared among a large number of records in a given database For example on mining the database of a store association rule mining can bring out relationship between the items in the store based on the customers buying patterns. Although classical association rule mining algorithm reflects the statistical relationship between items, it does not reflect the semantic significance of the items T o m eet th e us er obj ectiv e and business value, various weighted association rule mining meth  7  12] a r e pr opos ed bas e d on  the weightage to items. Here the weight is mostly based on utility of an item such as profit  Classification is also one of the most important tasks in data mining. Classification builds a model known as classifier and can be used to predict classes to new records. For example, a risk classification model can be built from a dataset of previous credit card customers and applied to classify the risk levels of new customers   Weighted association rule mining applies unsupervised learning where no class attribute is involved in finding the association rule. On the other hand, classification uses supervised learning where class attribute is involved in the construction of the classifier. Both, weighted association rule mining and classification are significant and efficient data mining techniques. So integration of these two data mining techniques may provide efficient associative classifi 13 w e  h a v e propos ed w e igh t ed  associative classification based on CBA algorithm and weight for each item is generated randomly   In this paper we proposed a new feature which includes 1. Weight for each item is calculated using HITS model. 2. The new compact weighted associative classification \(CWAC\ is proposed. The proposed CWAC algorithm is completely varies from CBA. In CBA, Apriori association rule mining algorithm is directly applied to find the class association rules Whereas Compact weighted class association rule generation algorithm randomly chooses one non class attribute from dataset and all the items are generated only based on that attribute. Thus this algorithm reduces number of itemset generation. Finally the proposed algorithm calculates the weighted support and weighted confidence for each item and determines whether the item is frequent or not    IEEE-International Conference on Recent Trends in Information Technology, ICRTIT 2011 978-1-4577-0590-8/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE MIT, Anna University, Chennai.

 2 II RELATED WORK  A Association Rule Mining   Association Rule Mining \(ARM\ [1  ha s b e co m e  one of the important data mining tasks. ARM is an unsupervised data mining technique, which works on variable length data, and it produces clear and understandable rules. The basic task of association rule mining is to determine the correlation between items belonging to a transactional database. In general, every association rule must satisfy two user specified constraints, one is support and the other is confidence The support of a rule X Y \(X and Y are items defined as the fraction of transactions that contain X and Y, while the confidence is defined as the ratio support\(X and Y\pport\(X\ So, the target is to find all association rules that satisfy user specified minimum support and confidence values  B.  Associative Classification  Associative classification was first introduced in   w h i c h f o c u s on i n t e g r at i n g t w o k n o w n dat a  m i ni ng tasks, association rule discovery and classification. The integration done is focused on a special subset of association rules whose right hand side is restricted to the class attribute; for example, consider a rule R: X  Y, Y must be a class label. Associative classification generally involves two stages. The first stage, it adopts the association rule generation methods like Apriori candidate generation g r o w t h 5] alg orithm s to  generate class association rules. For example CB  method employs Apriori candidate generation and other associative methods such as CPAR M AR 9 and Lazy associative classification m e th ods  adopts FP growth algorithm for rule generation. The above step generates huge number of rules. So in the next stage, generated rules are ranked and the rules that satisfy certain threshold conditions are used to construct the classifier. After rule ranking, only the high-ranking rules are chosen to build a classifier and the rest are pruned  The associative classification method uses support and confidence measures to evaluate the rule quality  Support and confidence are given as  Support \(X  Y\           Occurrence \(X U Y  Total number of transaction    1 Confidence \(X  Y\ Occurrence\(X U Y    Occurrence \(X\      ----- \( 2  Any Item has a support larger than the user minimum support and confidence is called frequent itemset. The support and confidence measures used in association rule mining and associative classification treats each transaction items equally but different transactions have different weights in real-life data sets 12  C. Weighted Association Rule Mining  Classical ARM framework assumes that all items have the same significance or importance i.e. their weight within a transaction or record is the same weight=1 per item\which is not always the case. In the supermarket context, some items like jewellery designer clothes, etc., are of much significant in terms of revenue or profit by the store. Hence weight can be used as a parameter to generate association rule mining called as weighted association rule mining [7, 12 T h e  generation of weighted association rules is based on user specified minimum weighted support and minimum weighted confidence thresholds. The use of weighted support and weighted confidence leads to useful mechanisms to prioritize the rule according to their importance, instead of their support and confidence alone  D. Weighted Associative Classification  In e h a v e propos ed  w e i g h t ed as s o ciati v e  classification, which integrates weighted association rule mining and classification to construct the efficient weighted associative classifier. Weighted associative classifier extracts special subset of association rules called weighted class association rules \(WCARs Weighted association rule mining uses weight as one parameter but here weights for each item item are assigned randomly. But it is very difficult to assign weights to each item  D.  HITS Model   Klein s ed HIT S al g o rithm i n bipartite  graph and weights are derived from the internal structure of the database. This proposed method uses HITS model to derive the weight for each item. Then these weights are used to compute the Weighted Class Association Rules  III PROPOSED SYSTEM  A. Problem Definition  Let database D is a set of instances where each instance is represented by < a 1 a 2 a m C>, where a 1  a 2 a m are attributes and C are class value each has weights. A common rule is defined as x c, where x is a set of non class attributes and c is class label. The quality measurement factor of a rule is weighted IEEE-ICRTIT 2011 1100 


 3 support and weighted confidence where weighted support is \(Occurrence \(x & y c / |D|\* \(weight \(x weight \(y\ + weight \(c\|D| denotes the total number of instances in database and weighted confidence is Occurrence \(x & y c / Occurrence \(x c\* \(weight x\weight \(y\weight \(c\ule items that satisfy minimum weighted support and weighted confidence are called frequent rule items, while the rest are called infrequent rule items. Here the task is to generate the Weighted Class Association Rules \(WCARs\ that satisfies both minimum weighted support and minimum weighted confidence constraints. Then these WCARs are used to construct a classifier based on Confidence Support size-of-the rule Antecedent  B. Weighted Associative Classification Rule Mining  Classification and weighted association rule mining are two different techniques involved in rule mining Integration of classification and weighted association rule mining consist of two steps. In the first step the weighted associative classification rules are generated using Compact Weighted Class Association Rule Generation algorithm and the second step deals with the classifier to order the rules generated in step one  C. Compact Weighted Associative Classification Algorithm  Compact weighted class association rule generation algorithm is shown in Figure 3.1  INPUT: DATA SET OUTPUT: ITEM SET  Step 1: Divide the dataset into training and testing dataset Step 2 : Choose an attribute randomly other than class attribute from the training dataset Step 3: Generate one item based on the selected attribute Step 4 : Calculate weighted support Step 5: If weighted support of item is greater than minimum weighted support then generate two itemset and so forth Step 6: Calculate weighted confidence for all itemset  CLASSIFIER ALGORITHM  Step 1: Rank the rules based on Weighted Confidence Weighted Support and Size of the rule antecedent Step 2:  Classify the test dataset using these ruleset and obtain the classifier accuracy  Fig 3.1 Compact Weighted Associative Classification Algorithm Weighted support and weighted confidence are given as  WSup \(X U Y  C\=\(Occurrence \(X U Y  C / |D Weight \( X\ +Weight\(Y\ Weight\(C     3   W Conf \(X U Y  C\ = WSup\(XUY  C  4 WSup \(X  C  Where X and Y are items in the dataset, C is the set of class label. In frequent rules are pruned to get frequent class association rules. The steps are shown in the Figure 3.2     Fig 3.2 Steps in Compact Weighted Associative Classification  The minimum weighted support and minimum weighted confidence are user defined threshold values The itemset that has weighted support and weighted confidence above the threshold value are called as frequent itemset and others are called as infrequent itemset which are pruned during rule generation process. This is followed by the classifier construction To built the classifier all the generated rules are ranked based on Weighted Confidence, Weighted Support and size-of-the rule antecedent Then best rules are chosen and used in the classifier  IV.

 Figure 4  Compression of the action table from Nursery dataset of size 250Mb into FP-Tree with varying minimum support values VII  C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK  In this paper, we propose the action table as the ideal search domain for action rules mining. The action table transforms the complex problem of finding action rules from a plain decision table, into finding action rules from an action table. As a result, the problem of action rules mining is reformulated into association-mining In practice, we applied FAARM on the Hepatitis and Nursery datasets and compared the results and performances with AAR and ARD. Although the space and time complexity associated with generating the action table are O\(n 2 experiments show that FAARM has a better execution time on relatively small dataset, over ARD and AAR Generating the action table directly into the FP-Tree could mitigate the space complexity associated with action table. As a future work, we propose to look at parallel implementation of Apriori and FP-Growth to test the scalability of using the action table with large datasets R EFERENCES  1  Z.

size are 10 and 4. In T40I10D100K, they are 40 and 10. The numbers of transactions in both two dataset are set to 100K There are exponentially numerous frequent patterns when the support threshold goes down B. Experimental results In order to mine the utility frequent patterns, we randomly generate the count of each item between 1 and 6. In fact, most items are in the low profit range, we synthetically generate utility values of each item from 0.01 to 10.00, using a log normal distribution. For instance, Fig.2 shows the distribution of the utility values of items in T10I4D100K 1432 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 N um be r o f i te m s Utility value  Figure 2.  Utility value distribution in T10I4D100K For selecting appropriate utility thresholds, we use the average transaction utility value to constraint the utility threshold instead of randomly choosing it. For example, in Table 1, where the average transaction utility value is 40. If the utility threshold is equal to 25%, it represents that ? = 10 40  25% =10 We compare the performance of Share-FPM with BUUFM [5], an up to date algorithm for utility frequent patterns 


mining. Fig.3 through Fig.5 show the performance curves of two algorithms on three datasets respectively. We can see that the Share-UFPM algorithm outperforms BU-UFM on all datasets, and the performance gap becomes significant when the minimum support threshold drops low enough 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 Ti m e S ec on ds  Minimum support \(%0 Share-UFPM BU-UFM Utility threshold=5  Figure 3.

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we introduce a utility frequent pattern mining model based on a share strategy to find the combination of items with high frequencies and utilities. This model first find all patterns with a given minimum support threshold. In this step, a share strategy gives a way to share most of the results from the previous mining process instead of separating them distinctively, thereby dramatically reducing the cost of computation. And then all patterns that do not satisfy a minimum utility threshold are pruned The extension of our technique, for maintenance of the already mined utility frequent patterns when updating databases, is an interesting topic for future research REFERENCES 1] R.

the time needed for execution exceeded 100000 seconds Thus, from this analysis we see that FPrep, which uses FCM clustering, clearly outperforms the CLARANS and CURE based methods on the basis of speed. The execution times for CLARANS and CURE mentioned in fig. 7 and Table II do not include the time required to create fuzzy sets, and calculate the membership value  for each numerical data point in every fuzzy set for the numerical attribute under consideration. These times also do not take into account the time required to transform crisp numerical attributes to fuzzy attributes, and derive the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset The fuzzy partitions generated for each of the five numerical attributes for the USCensus1990raw dataset are shown in Table III. Coincidentally, generating three fuzzy partitions for each numerical attribute seemed a perfect fit In addition to the superior speeds achieved by FPrep, as illustrated in fig. 7 and Table II, Table III indicates the semantics and the quality of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. Moreover, the number of frequent itemsets generated by a fuzzy ARM algorithm \(like fuzzy ARMOR and fuzzy Apriori minimum support threshold, is illustrated in fig. 8   Fig. 7. Algorithm, numerical attribute comparison based on speed \(log10 seconds   Fig. 8. Number of frequent itemsets for various minimum support values  B. Results from Second Dataset We have also applied FPrep on the FAM95 dataset http://www.stat.ucla.edu/data/fpp transactions. Of the 23 attributes in the dataset, we have used the first 18, of which six are quantitative and the rest are binary. For each of the six quantitative attributes, we have generated fuzzy partitions using FPrep. A thorough analysis with respect to execution times, has already been performed on the USCensus1990raw dataset \(which is manifolds bigger in size than the FAM95 dataset both on the basis of number of transactions and number of unique values for numerical 


attributes dataset has been done solely to provide further evidence of the quality and semantics of the fuzzy partitions generated by FPrep. The details of the same are in Table IV. In this case, the number of fuzzy partitions is different for different numerical attributes. Thus, the number and type of fuzzy partitions to be generated is totally dependent on the attribute under consideration. A graphical representation of the fuzzy partitions generated for the attribute Age has already been provided in fig. 5, and clearly shows the Gaussian nature of the fuzzy partitions. The nature and shapes of fuzzy partitions for the rest of the attributes are also similar. Last, the number of frequent itemsets generated for different minimum support values is illustrated in fig. 8  C. Analysis of Results With FPrep, we can analyze and zero in on the number and type of partitions required based on the semantics of the numerical attributes, which the methods detailed in [19 20] do not necessarily facilitate. Then, FPrep, backed by FCM clustering, takes care of the creating the fuzzy partitions, especially assigning membership values for each numerical data point in each fuzzy partition. In section 8.A we have already shown that FPrep is nearly 9 to 44 times faster than the CURE-based method, and 2672 to 13005 times faster than the CLARANS-based method. FPrep is not only much faster than other related methods, but also generates very high quality fuzzy partitions \(Table III and IV much user-intervention. We have created a standard way of representing any fuzzy dataset \(converted from any type of crisp dataset efficacy of the same is corroborated by the successful implementation of Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR on the fuzzy dataset \(converted from crisp version of FAM95 dataset an initial implementation of Fuzzy ARMOR, are very encouraging. FPrep, when used in conjunction with these fuzzy ARM algorithms, generates a pretty good number of high-quality frequent itemsets \(fig. 8 frequent itemsets generated for a particular minimum support is same, irrespective of the fuzzy ARM algorithm 


used IX. CONCLUSIONS In this paper we have highlighted our methodology, called FPrep, for ARM in a fuzzy scenario. FPrep is meant for seamlessly and holistically transforming a crisp dataset into a fuzzy dataset such that it can drive a subsequent fuzzy ARM process. It does not rely on any non-fuzzy techniques and is thus more straightforward, fast, and consistent. It facilitates user-friendly automation of fuzzy dataset 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 Age - 91 Hours - 100 Income3 4949 Income2 13707 Income1 55089 Ti m e lo g1 0 se co nd s Numerical Attribute - Number of Unique Values FCM CURE CLARANS 0 500 1000 1500 2000 2500

This methodology involves two distinct steps, namely creation of appropriate fuzzy partitions using fuzzy clustering and creation of fuzzy records, using these partitions, to get the fuzzy dataset from the original crisp dataset FPrep has been compared with other such techniques, and has been found to better on the basis of speed. We also illustrate its efficacy on the basis of quality of fuzzy partitions generated and the number of itemsets mined by a fuzzy ARM algorithm which is preceded by FPrep. This preprocessing technique provides us with a standard method of fuzzy data \(record that it is useful for any kind of fuzzy ARM algorithm irrespective of how the algorithm works. Furthermore, this pre-processing methodology has been adequately tested with two disparate fuzzy ARM algorithms, Fuzzy Apriori and Fuzzy ARMOR, and would also work fine with other fuzzy ARM algorithm REFERENCES 1] Zadeh, L.

The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
