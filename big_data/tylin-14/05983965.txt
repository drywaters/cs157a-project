EDP-ORD: Efficient Distributed/Parallel Optimal Rule Discovery Sahar M. Ghanem Mona A. Mohamed Magdy H. Nagi Computer and Systems Engineering Department Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University Alexandria, Egypt sghanem@alex.edu.eg Abstract  Association rule discovery algorithms generate all rules satisfying minimum support and confidence thresholds These techniques yield too many rules and are infeasible when the minimum support is low. Recently, Li [1 p r o p o s ed t h e  Optimal Rule Discovery ORD\ algorithm that discovers a family of rule sets that maximizes a range of interestingness metrics other than the commonly used confidence metric In addition, the discovered optimal class association rule set is the minimum subset of rules with the same predictive power as the complete class association rule set. Moreover ORD is significantly more efficient than association rule discovery independent of the data structure and the implementation Due to the existence of huge amounts of data, it is important to investigate efficient methods for distributed/parallel mining of rules. In this paper, we propose EDP-ORD an efficient distributed/parallel extension of the ORD algorithm. We theoretically disclose a relationship between locally large and globally large rules and use it in reducing the number of generated rules and the exchanged messages at each site/partition. Moreover, we empirically compare EDP-ORD with a naÔve distributed/parallel ORD version on five benchmark datasets. The experimental results shows that the reduction in number of generated rules at each site can reach 44% while the reduction in total size of exchanged messages can reach 58 Keywords- data mining; association rule discovery; rule-based classifiers; distributed rule discovery; parallel rule discovery I I NTRODUCTION The term data mining is often used as a synonym for the process of extracting useful information from databases. Data mining is the application of specific algorithms for extracting structure from data. Rules are among the most expressive and human-understandable representation of knowledge, so rule discovery has been a major issue in data mining [1  Association rules discovery is the task of inferring rules which states that certain values occur with other values above a certain frequency in data with some pre-specified certainty Association rule discovery generates all rules satisfying some constraints, but yields too many rules and is infeasible when the minimum support is small. Optimized rule discovery is an efficient alternative that generates a smaller set of rules by pruning redundant rules. Classification rule mining aims to discover a small set of rules in the database to form an accurate classifier. For association rule mining, the target of mining is not predetermined, while for classification rule mining there is one ORD [1 i s  a n  o p t i m a l c l a ss a sso c i a t i o n r u l e m i n i n g  algorithm that prunes the candidate rules according to an interestingness metric and is independent of the data presentation.  In addition, the discovered optimal class association rule set is the minimum subset of rules with the same predictive power as the complete class association rule set [2    The development of distributed/parallel algorithms for efficient mining of associative classification rules has its importance because many large databases are distributed in nature. In addition, mining association rules in huge databases or data warehouses\ may require substantial processing power and a distributed/parallel system is a possible solution. This motivates us to extend the centralized ORD to a distributed optimal rule discovery for mining associative classification rules in a horizontally partitioned database. We adapt a local pruning strategy at every site that efficiently finds the optimal rules when compared to a naÔve approach It has been well know that the major cost of mining rules is the computation of the frequently occurring patterns. In a distributed scenario, locally large patterns can be easily computed but they are not necessary be globally large. One possible solution is to broadcast all counts of all patterns no matter they are locally large or small. This is a naÔve solution that might lead to passing huge number of messages The main contribution of our work is that we disclose a relationship between ORD locally large and globally large rules and explore it to generate a smaller set of candidates at each site and reduce the number/size of messages to be passed. In addition, experiments are conducted to study the reduction achieved The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section II we survey the related research; in section III we outline the definitions, notations, and the original/centralized ORD algorithm; in section IV we present a naÔve ORD extension NDP-ORD\, the ORD local pruning theorem and its proof, and the developed EDP-ORD; in section V we detail the experimental setup and results; in section VI we conclude the paper and discuss future research II R ELATED W ORK The benefits of mining association rules and its wide applications have led to several proposals for fast mining of association rules [3   978-1-4577-0681-3/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 956

In addition, its use is extended for association rule mining [3   Th e main  ad v a n t ag e of the IST representation is that the database is read into a data structure that can fit in memory which speeds up its access instead of accessing the file on an external storage device In the proposed work, we adapt the IST as a data structure to be used for support counting in the ORD algorithm Originally, the IST is used for association rule mining that has no class information available. In the proposed work, we use the IST for mining association classification rules. The node structure and the tree construction algorithm are modified to reflect the existence of class information In the process of finding all the frequent patterns, we are not interested in the non-supported items. The non-supported items are the items that have a support less than the userspecified minimum support. The IST is cleaned after its construction \(traversed for removing the non-supported items 3  Th e  r e s u lt ed tr ee  i s c a ll ed  th e  Support Counting Tree SCT\. SCT has a reduced size, where the number of nodes in the tree and the number of items within a node are reduced B Centralized Optimal Rule Discovery \(ORD A pattern is frequent if its support is not less than the minimum support. A pattern is potentially frequent \(i.e candidate\ only if all its sub-patterns are frequent Let CA l be the candidate rules at the l th iteration \(i.e l pattern rules\, and L l be the frequent rules kept after ORD pruning of CA l  L l CA l are represented by a linked list of items; where an item is l pattern P a set of the pattern classes a n d a p a t t e r n  c las s is   c las s  c  cnt  Pc CLASS is a linked list of \(class c  cnt c There is pruning in the candidate generation function CandidateGen\ detailed below. In addition, after counting the support of candidates ORD-Pruning is applied. Because of the possible skewed distribution of classes, a single global support is not suitable for a variant rule targeting different classes. In ORD pruning, it is suggested to use a recall threshold instead of a global support. The recall of rule P  c is defined as sprt  Pc  sprt  c The recall is the support in the data subset containing c  In the ORD algorithm detailed in Fig. 2, any interestingness metric discussed above can be used as a rule-selection criterion and the output rule set is an optimal rule set defined by that metric. We have to consider maximum length for the generated rules to stop the candidate generation process for large number of items An association discovery algorithm searches for all frequent patterns, however ORD pruning significantly reduces candidates for searching. The set of ORD candidates is a very small subset of frequent patterns. This trend is more evident when the minimum support is low. Therefore, ORD has significantly less computational complexity than association rule discovery Consider the dataset in Fig. 1 where a, b, and c are items and y and z are classes. Assume that the minimum recall is 0 i.e. it is required to generate all rules Generating all patterns without ORD pruning we have the z,1   b  y  3  a n d   c   z,1 a t  t h e f i rs t l e v e l    a b  y  2    a c  y  2  z  1     b c   y,1 at th e s eco n d l ev el  a b c   y  1    at th e th ir d l e v e l   I n  th i s  case, the total number of rules is ten Applying ORD, the first-level candidates are used to prune the second-level candidates as illustrated in Fig. 1, where a crossed class is removed and a boxed class is terminated. y in candidates \(a b, y\ and \(b c, y\ is terminated because of sprt a b¨y\=0 and sprt b c¨ y\=0 \(ORD Corollary-2\. Both y and z are removed in candidate \(a c, y z\ since sprt a c sprt c holds \(ORD Corollary-1\. After rules have been formed candidates \(ab, \, \(ac, \ and \(bc, \ are removed As a result, their super candidate will not be generated, and the candidate generation process stops at the second-level. In this case, the total number of rules is only seven \(3 rules less Function CandidateGen L l  returns CA l 1 for each pair of candidates P l 1 s  C s nd P l 1 t  C t L l  insert candidate P l 1  C n CA l 1 where  P l 1  P l 1 st and C  C s  C t  for all P l  P l 1  if candidate P l  C l does not exist in L l  then remove P l 1  C  and return  else C  C  C l endfor  if the target set C of P l 1  C s empty  then remove the candidate  endfor 978-1-4577-0681-3/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 958

It is assumed that the database is horizontally partitioned into n sites/partitions and it is required to mine the same optimal rules as if the whole database is located in a centralized location We first introduce a naÔve extension to the ORD algorithm in the distributed case. Then, we adapt the local pruning suggested in [9 f o r e f f i c i e n t  d i s t ri b u t e d O R D   T h e  l o c a l  pruning is originally suggested for association rule mining and a global support threshold is used.

In addition, let CA l be defined as the candidate set at the l th ORD iteration; i.e CA l CandidateGen L l1  A NDP-ORD: NaÔve Distributed/Parallel ORD For comparison, we outline a naÔve distributed extension of ORD as detailed in Fig. 3. At each iteration, the algorithm generates the candidate sets CA l at every site by applying the CandidateGen function on the set of large patterns L l 1 found at the previous iteration. Every site then computes the local support counts of all these candidate patterns and broadcast them to all the other sites. Subsequently, all the sites can find the globally large patterns L l for that iteration, and then proceed to the next iteration Consider the same centralized dataset is horizontally partitioned between two sites as follows   S 1   S 2  The 1-candidates generated at S 1 are  [a, \(y,1\\(z,1   b  y,1 c  y  1  z  1  a n d t h e  1 c a ndi d a t e s a t  S 2 are   [a, \(y,2    b, \(y,2  c  y  1  A f t e r b r o a dc a s t i n g t h e  l o c a l  s upp o r t counts S 1 and S 2 have the same 1-candidates support counts [a z,1   b  y  3  c  y  2 z  1  T h e  2-c a ndi da t e s  generated at S 1 are [a b,\(y,1    a  c   y  1  z  1    b  c  y  1  a n d  the 2-candidates at S 2 are [a b,\(y,1    a  c   y  1    b  c  y  0   After broadcasting the local support counts S 1 and S 2 have the same 2-candidates support counts a b, \(y, 2 a c    y  2  z  1     b c, \(y,1  S i n ce th e s a m e s u p p o r t co u n t s  ar e a v ai la b l e a t b o t h  sites, the ORD Prunes the same rules B EDP-ORD: Proposed Efficient Distributed/Parallel ORD As proofed in [9   th e r e i s an i m p o r t an t r e l a ti o n s h ip  between large/frequent patterns and the sites in a distributed database every globally large pattern must be locally large at some site\(s If a pattern P is both globally large and locally large at a site S i  P is called gl-large at site S i The set of gllarge patterns at a site will form a basis for the site to generate its own candidate sets. Two monotonic properties can be observed from the locally large and gl-large patterns. First, if a pattern P is locally large at a site S i then all of its subsets are also locally large at site S i Secondly, if a pattern P is gl-large at a site S i then all of its subsets are also gl-large at site S i  Notice that a similar relationship exists among the large patterns in the centralized case Following is an important theorem based on which an efficient technique for candidate sets generation in the distributed case is developed. We assume that initially every site S i  i 1 to n  locally count the local support counts for all classes cnt i  c j for j 1 to k and broadcast those counts to the other sites.

Then we have CG l  CA l and the number of candidates in CG l could be much smaller than the number of candidates in CA l The difference 978-1-4577-0681-3/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 960 


between the two sets depends on the distribution of the classes in the n sites If a class distribution is uniform, rules associated with this class will belong to almost every GL i  l  and the difference between CG l and CA l will be negligible. However, if a class distribution is normal, rules associated with this class will belong to few sites and the difference between CG l and CA l will be significant Let X  L l the set of all large l patterns\. It follows from the above theorem that, there exists a site S i such that all l 1 subsets of X are gl-large at S i Hence X  CG i  l  the candidates generated at the l th iteration at S i and therefore X  CG l We can conclude that L l  CG l The above theorem forms a basis for an efficient generation of the candidate sets as follows 1 Every site S i at the l th ORD iteration locally generates the candidates CG i  l  from its gl-large patterns of previous iteration GL i l 1 and at the same time counts the candidates local support 2 Every site collects the support counts of its candidates from other sites and sums the global support of those candidates to find its gl-large patterns GL i l   3 Based on GL i l  the next iteration candidates can be generated Based on ORD local pruning theorem, some candidates in CG i  l  can be pruned before count exchange starts. If a candidate is not locally large at site S i there is no need to count its global support because that candidate is either small or will be locally large at some other site. Every site is responsible to find the global support only for its locally large candidates However, a candidate could be locally large at more than one site. The next step is added to the outlined steps above 1.1 Prune CG i  l  to find the locally large candidates LL i  l   We can notice that, in order to supply the support count exchanges of step 2, each site must have two sets of support counts. For local pruning, S i has to find the local support counts of its CG i  l  In addition, S i has to find the local support counts of other sites candidates LL j  l  j  i A simple solution is to separate the counting steps but that would degrade the performance. Another solution is to let every site S i broadcasts its gl-large GL i l  set at the end of each iteration. Then at the beginning of the next iteration, every site could generate all candidates for all sites and perform all the counting in one step as detailed in the algorithm Fig. 3. Note that broadcasting a message delivers the same copy of the message to every site While, in exchanging messages, a request message is first sent that contains the required patternsê support and the response message includes only the requested counts to the asking site Crafting the exchanged messages reduces the required communication bandwidth as illustrated in the experiments Consider the same horizontally partitioned dataset above The 1-candidates generated at S 1 are [a, \(y,1\\(z,1   b  y  1   c, \(y,1\\(z,1  a nd a t  S 2 are   [a, \(y,2  b  y  2   c  y  1   S 1 and S 2 request the counts of its generated candidates only after this step S 1 z,1  b   y  3  c   y  2   z,1 a n d S 2 has  the candidates [a, \(y,3   b  y  3  c   y  2      Note that the candidates \(a, z\ and \(c, z\ are not maintained by S 2 and therefore the exchanged message sizes and the computational complexity of the following iterations are reduced In the naÔve case, every local support count of every pattern is broadcast from every site to every other site, i.e the size of the exchanged message for that pattern is O n 2 where n is the number of sites. However, if the efficient ORD is applied, the best case scenario is that every pattern is found to be locally large at one site only and its local support counts are sent to that site reducing the size of the exchanged messages for that pattern to O n An upper-bound pruning could be performed after local pruning \(step 14 at Fig. 3\ and before exchanging the counts. For this pruning, every site has to send the individual local support counts \(at the different sites\ of its gl-large patterns in the broadcast message \(step 17 at Fig.3\.

We do not specify the type of optimal rule set since the same candidate set generates an optimal rule set defined by any interestingness metric discussed in Section III In addition, we employ the minimum recall threshold, which is a ratio for an individual class. A pattern is frequent if it is frequent in at least one class. An empirical estimation of the complexity for a distributed rule-discovery algorithm is the number of candidates it searches and the exchanged message sizes The sizes of the datasets in our study range from 150 records to 4177 records and have number of attributes in the range from 4 to 38. We compare the searched candidates for the two algorithms and the total exchanged messages size for different values of minimum recall and when the number of sites n is 2, 3, and 4. Table II shows the searched candidates by the two versions of distributed ORD algorithms \(N for naÔve E for Efficient\ at each site, while Table III shows the total exchanged messages size. The results show that the local pruning has significantly less computational complexity than the naÔve. The number of candidate sets found in ED-ORD at each site is reduced to 20-44% of that in ND-ORD. The total messages size in ED-ORD is reduced to 16-58% of that in NDORD. The reduction in the number of candidate sets and message size in ED-ORD is significant. The performance gain of ED-ORD is very important in distributed/parallel systems in which the communication is an important performance factor This shows that ED-ORD becomes more effective when the system is scaled up 978-1-4577-0681-3/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 961

We assumed a horizontally partitioned dataset and a message passing communication model. We considered a single class as a consequence but the algorithm can be easily applied for rules with a pattern as the consequence We theoretically proofed a relation between locally large and globally large patterns that is used for local pruning at each site to reduce the searched candidates.  We derived a locally large threshold using a globally set minimum recall threshold Local pruning achieves a reduction in the number of searched candidates and this reduction has a proportional impact on the reduction of exchanged messages. The performance study has demonstrated that EDP-ORD generates a much smaller set of candidate sets and requires significantly smaller amount of messages when compared to a naÔve extension NDP-ORD This shows that EDP-ORD is a scalable distributed efficient and effective technique for ORD in large databases We implemented only local pruning, however we discussed an upper-bound pruning that can help in achieving further reduction. Future extensions include studying upper-bound and polling-site pruning [9  an d  ex t e n d in g th e a l g o r ith m in  ca s e o f  vertically partitioned data set.

ing work because the approach is free from any assumptions on the structure of the attribute and does not have to rely on statistical approximations We evaluate the approach using two synthetic data sets to establish the upper and lower bounds of the covered similarity space We nd that we can cover the whole similarity space and that we are only constrained by the random number generation To validate the method against this constraint we investigate the speciìc inîuence of the random number generation by using the method as a test of randomness Additionally operational systems usually exhibit large amounts of noise in their workload therefore we validate the method against noise as well Our ndings show that it is highly resistant to noise whereas other commonly employed methods yield to the law of large numbers or fail completely Additionally the method can consistently identify dissimilar behaviour as well even though it is not as good at that task which is only partially true for other commonly employed methods The second method uses association rule analysis to identify and quantify the relationship between descriptive attributes of the workload The novel idea of this approach is to eliminate the use of values and instead focus on the attributes themselves and therefore rank the relative usage of the attribute That way the most important building blocks of the workload can be compared directly The algorithm is described and then evaluated using synthetic data sets to establish the upper and lower bounds of the covered similarity space This time we nd that we are only constrained by the amount of learnt rules which follows from the used rule learning algorithm At least 16 rules need to be available to cover the whole similarity space when the apriori algorithm is used The method itself however does not require a speciìc rule learning algorithm We then present our compound measure that can address problematic workload characteristics We use the transfer function concept to weight speciìc events in the waveletmethod based on relative attribute dependencies Then we conduct an empirical study to evaluate all methods on operational workload from seven large-scale distributed systems Two important characteristics stand out First the time and frequency behaviour is surprisingly well-modelled with a wavelet method Second the association rule by itself is seemingly useless However the inclusion of descriptive attributes improves accuracy when determining similarity of workloads We show that the compound measure improves upon existing work by evaluating it against two important scheduling metrics mean waiting time and mean execution time The analysis of descriptive attributes for the similarity in addition to the analysis of the time-dependent attribute yields a compound similarity measure that can improve accuracy by 24.5 At the same time the standard deviation can be reduced by 10.4 We conìrm these results with an independent statistical hypothesis test a twosample Anderson-Darling statistic and show the advantage of the compound measure even at higher signiìcance levels of  0  125 with only 11 dierence Our results strongly reassure our initial expectations that the compound measure is a good choice for large-scale and data-intensive systems that have to deal with enormous amounts of events and previously unknown dependencies in their workload Furthermore even though we only used scientiìc workloads in our evaluations we did not observe any constraint that would limit the use to scientiìc workloads 7 FUTURE WORK As a result of this work we can continue to evolve our simulation eort for DQ2 We will use the similarity measure to evaluate the results of our future workload models to speciìcally address problems like data transfer cycles distributed le caching or popularity-based deletion However the measure can still be improved If it is suspected that dependencies change over time then the rate of change needs to be investigated Extending the association rule measure with time-evolving graphs may prove to be appropriate for such cases Additionally we only used the Haar wavelet as suggested by previous work We are interested in investigating the inîuence of dierent types of wavelets on the analysis of non-periodic burst behaviour An implementation of the similarity measure including already pre-processed versions of the used workloads from the evaluation can be downloaded from our website  8 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are grateful to the following teams for providing

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
