This equation was applied in the NARFO* algor ithm [1  which is an  approach for mining generalized association rules based on fuzzy ontologies. Another co ntribution of this work is

Introduction Data mining is a very important step of knowledge discovery in large databases. In summary, we can say that data mining provides one automatic method for discovery patterns, without the biases and limitation of an analysis based only in human intuition 
One important topic in data mining research is the discovery of association rules   Researchers li k e 4     6  7  h a ve exte n d ed th e process of m i n i ng association rules in order to mining generalized association rules, which are rules with items belonging to any level of the related taxonomy \(is-a hierarchies ontology An ontology is an explicit specification of an abstract and simplified view of the world that we wish to represent   and because th is, th e y ca n be utilized for represent the semantics of the items. Howeve r, crisp ontologies are not capable to represent imprecise situations, because they are 
based on traditional logic, which considers only two Boolean values, 1Ž and 0Ž, i.e  true or false   An alternative for such cases is to utilize fuzzy ontologies, that are a combina tion of fuzzy logic w i t h  crisp ontologies.  Thus, some researchers have used fuzzy ontologies in order to ex tract generalized association rules, like XS an d NARFO al g o rithm  11  XSSDM and NARFO algorithms are based on concept of fuzzy relation  and u s e fu zz y ontologies to identify similarity relation between elements of  a database 
In this sense, the remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present related work. Section 3 explains the NARFO* algorithm and shows the new improvement. Experiments are showed in section 4, and section 5 brings some conclusions 2 Related Work Researchers have used taxonomies and ontologies in mining association rules, in order to enhance the knowledge discovery process. For example, GARPA algorithm a s propos ed  f o r to obtain a c o m p act an d  representative set of rules, using a domain knowledge expressed by taxonomies. In this algorithm the 
generalization process can occur on only one side of a con sequent \(rhs\ sides lrhs\ subset of specific rules will be replaced for a more general rule only if the support or confidence of this rule is t% greater than the highest of the same selected measure in the specialized rules. For example, suppose the rule milk  bread represents a generalized rule and that milk is represented in taxonomy by milk a milk b  milk c  milk d 
and milk e The rule milk  bread will be generalized even if there is not a rule for each kind of milk However, in many real-world applications, the taxonomic structure may not be crisp but fuzzy  For this purpose, [12 in trodu ced  th e problem o f  m i n i ng generalized association rules with fuzzy taxonomic structures  In this context of fuzzy st ructur  pro posed th e XSSDM algorithm. This approa ch uses fuzzy ontologies to extract similarity relations 
existent among database items exploring more semantic enrichment in the rules XSSDM identifies similarity relations based on a userspecified minsim parameter, and if two items have the similarity degree greater than or equal the minsim fuzzy associations are expressed in the association rules extracted by the algorit hm For example, if item 1 and 1 IEEE IRI 2011, August 3-5, 2011, Las Vegas, Nevada, USA 978-1-4577-0966-1/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 


item 2 have the degree of similarity greater than or equal minsim in the fuzzy ontology, a fuzzy association is done and a fuzzy itemset is created \(represented as item 1 item 2  Later, in XSSDM w as e x tended and received the name of  NARFO. NARFO algorithm includes new treatments of redundancy and a process of infrequent itemsets generalization. This algorithm is subdivided into eight steps: data scanning, identifying similar items generating candidates, calculating the weight of candidates, generalizing infrequent itemsets, generating rules, rules generalization treatment and redundancy treatment. In relation to redundancy treatment for example, if both Apple~Tomato  Mutton and Apple  Mutton are extracted, NARFO only considers the first one. In the generalizing infrequent itemsets, if all descendants of an ancestor are infrequent, but if the sum of the descendants support is greater than or equal the minsup value, the algorithm ge neralizes the descendants to its ancestor an d add this generalized itemset to the set of frequent itemsets 3 Calculating the Weight of Fuzzy Itemsets NARFO* is an improvemen t of NARFO algorithm and your contribution is the introduction of a minGen parameter. Thus, all steps of NARFO* are the same of the NARFO algorithm, except by logic involved in the generalization process. In this case, if X of descendants is included in different rules, the generalization is done and the items that are not part of the generalization are showed to avoid wrong information. For example, if minGen value is 0,40 and rules like Apple  Mutton Tomato  Mutton are generated, the algorithm generalizes these rules to Fruit  Mutton since Apple and Tomato are more than 40% of Fruits descendants In relation to calculating the weight of candidates, the database is scanned, and each of its rows is confronted with the set of candidate itemsets, one after one. For each occurrence of a non-fuzzy candidate itemset in a row, its weight is incremented by 1. Otherwise, it is incremented by the fuzzy value. For example, assuming a fuzzy item item1~item2 and supposing that the similarity degree between item1 and item2 is 0.8, each occurrence of item2 in the database can be considered equal to 80% of item1 occurrence. Consequently, for each item1 occurrence we sum 1 item1 occurrence, and for each item2 occurrence we sum 0.8 item1 occurrence. The problem can also be seen in the contrary manner, summing 1 item2 occurrence for each item2 occurrence, and 0.8 item2 for each item1 occurrence. This can be obtained by the weight equation proposed by Equ ation 1   The f factor is obtained through equation 2, which corresponds to the minimum similarity degree involving in the fuzzy association  012     015 1 2  1 f = min  sim  item1,item2  sim  item_n-1  item_n 2 The weight is the number of occurrences of an itemset in the database, and the support of an itemset is the weight divided by the number of transactions. Thus, the weight is completely related to support and confidence of the rules Considering this, we observed that the equation proposed by  h as so m e  li m itatio n s m a i n l y to calculate the weight of fuzzy itemsets with three or more elements, and these limitations can lead to inaccuracy on both support and confidence of the rules In this sense, in order to obtain more precision in the mentioned measures, and improve the equation 1 we will do some adjustments in the same, proposing a new equation \(equation 3 First, this new equation is an average, and for this the denominator will be the number of items involved in fuzzy association. Second, differently to equation 1, we add a n 1\ultiplying the f factor The nŽ variable is the number of items in the association  012     015 1    1   3 The \(n-1\as included because we observed that considering associations with two or more elements, the equation proposed by do es n o t i n clu de a n y  s u m s of  weight\(item\ x f  p l e, co n s ider th e sit u atio n where the number of elements of an association is three and the minimum similarity between item1  item2 and item3 is 0.5 By Equation 1 the weight of item1~item2~item3 would be three, i.e weight item1  weight item2  weight item3   weight item1  f\/2  weight item2  f\/2  weight item3  f\/2  1 0.5 0 5 0 5 0 25  0.25 However, analyzing the Figure 1, for situation A, we have weight item1 0.5 weight item2 0.5 weight item3 2 + 0.5 + 0.5\ = 3 oc currences. For situation B we have weight item2 0.5 weight item1 0.5 weight item3 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5\ = 2.5 occurrences For situation C we have weight item3 0.5 weight item1 0.5 weight item2 1 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 0.5 2.5 occurrences. The averag e of these situations is obtained from [\(situation A + situation B + situation C 3 Organizing the \(situation A + situation B + situation C\expression in commons terms, we would have  weight  item1  weight  item2  weight  item3  2   weight  item1  f   weight  item1  f   weight  item1  f  T h u s acco rdin g to eq u ation  3  th e 2 


weight for these situations would be 2.66, and not 3 as would be obtained from Equ ation 1. The Equation 3 is valid for all nŽ greater than or equal two Figure 1  Fuzzy Occurrences 4 Experiments This section shows some results of NARFO algorithm with the new equation for calculating the weight of fuzzy itemsets and also compares NARFO* to GARPA algorithm. The objectives of these experiments are demonstrated that the new equation for weight of fuzzy candidates provides more accuracy in both the support and confidence of the rules, and also evaluate the performance of NARFO* in the generalization process, in relation to other algorithm. In ours others studies NARFO* was compared only with its previous version i.e. NARFO and XSSDM algorithms In these experiments, data from Brazilian Demographic Census 2000, provided by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics \(IBGE\ were used This database contains information about Years of study Race or ethnicity and Sex The Ont_IBGE ontology Figure 4\  was modeled by Protégé-OWL 14 For demonstrated that the weight can really affect the measures of the rules, and that our new equation provides more accuracy in the same, we compared the values of support and confidence of some rules generated by NARFO* before and after th e alteration of the equation The minsin, minsup and minconf value was defined as 0.1 0.2 and 0.2 respectively. The Figure 1 shows the confidence comparison of this experiment The second battery of tests was performed to compare the NARFO* with GARPA algorithm, and analyze the results obtained. According to  th e sup0% \(measure  t%\nfiguration of GARPA produces the most reduced generalized association rules sets. Thus, all experiments we used the sup-0 best configuration\, and lrhs side of generalization in the GARPA, and adjusted mingen parameter of NARFO* with 0.1. Besides, the rules used as input for the GARPA were extracted from Apriori algorithm with the same parameters minsup and minconf  used in NARFO All experiments were performed considering the generalization of only one level of the ontology, and we created the taxonomy for GARPA based on ontology used in NARFO*. The tests were done with constant values of minconf and minsim  0.2 and 0.4, respectively. The minsup value was varied from 0.5 to 0.15. The Figure 3 demonstrates that, for the smallest minsup 0.15\, the reduction was 60%. One of the reasons for this reduction is that NARFO* finds similarity between the items in the ontology, and this contributes to the reduction of generated rules Figure 2  Confidence Comparison Figure 3  NARFO* and GARPA Comparison  0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 Rule 1 Rule 2 Rule 3 Rule 4 Rule 5 Rule 6 Rule 7 Rule 8 Rule 9 Rule 10 Confidence Rules Before After 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0,5 0,45 0,4 0,35 0,3 0,25 0,2 0,15 Rules Generated Minimun Support NARFO GARPA 60 3

Conclusions The new equation to calculate the weight of fuzzy itemsets provides more accuracy for both support and confidence of the rules. Moreover the experiments prove that the variations in the support and confidence values can impact the amount of rules generated by the algorithm. For example, considering the Figure 2 and assuming the minconf parameter equal to 60%, before of the change the confidence of the Rule 1 was 60%, and the same would be presented to the user, but after our modification this rule would not be presented, because your confidence would not be 60%, reducing the amount of generated rules The experiments proved that NARFO* reduces the amount of rules generated by 60 compared to GARPA algorithm, but, one of the advantages of GARPA algorithm is that it performs the generalization in more than one level of taxonomy, and the NARFO* is limited only to leaf nodes. On the other hand, the rules generated by NARFO* have more expressive semantics, from similarity associations existing in the fuzzy ontology 6. References 1 R.

Members endowments Familys endowments Attitude of families to IT Attitude of neighbours to IT Adoption attention Fig.1.Information technology adoption model based on farmers endowments From the results above, age, education, family income family communication cost and job type affect farmers capacity of information technology adoption. Moreover perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude of neighbors to techniques affect farmers intention. Therefore the data mining of association rules behind will use these 9 factors to study farmers endowments impact on information technology adoption behavior and their adoption mode C. Mode of farmers information technology adoption based on association rules 1 Association rules are to look for the relationship among different variables in the database, and find out the frequent mode [11 Definition 1: Let   be a set of n binary attributes called items. Let transaction T be a subset of I i.e. I?T . Let  be a set of transactions called the database. Each transaction in D has a unique transaction ID. Let A be an itemset, and transaction T contains A, i.e. TA Definition 2: A rule is defined as an implication of the form BA? ?where IA ? , IB ? ,and ??BA ? . The sets of items A and B are called antecedent \(left-hand-side or LHS and consequent \(right-hand-side or RHS respectively Definition 3 : When BA?  is a rule in database D, it has to satisfy the minimum support S and minimum confidence C Support is defined as the proportion of transactions in the data set which contains the itemset, i.e BAPS Confidence can be interpreted as an estimate of the probability  ABP Association rules generation is usually split up into two 


separate steps Step 1: minimum support is applied to find all frequent itemsets in a database Step 2: these frequent itemsets and the minimum confidence constraint are used to form rules 2 In 1994, Agrawal with other scholars worked out Apriori algorithm. The core principle is that the subsets of a frequent itemset are still frequent itemsets and the supersets of an unfrequent itemset are still unfrequent. Moreover, Apriori is a kind of iterative algorithm which is based on a two-stage mining thought for frequent itemsets. In detail, Apriori uses a bottom up" approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time \(a step known as candidate generation groups of candidates are tested against the data. From L1 to Lk the algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found. But one attention of Apriori is that when searching for frequent subset Lk from Lk-1, connection and pruning will be done in the process. And finally association rules will result from the frequent itemsets[12 3 With software Weka3.5.8, some association rules between three information techniques \(call centre, SMS and network platform under the condition of probability=0.5, confidence=0.4 Therefore, some strong association rules with high confidence have been listed typically in Table.2 TABLE II.

The association rules reflect weak relevance between adoption and farmers age and education. And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation. However farmers are still afraid of getting fake information b technique while age = young, job = planting, breeding and selling production, family income = high and public communication channels = wide.

And its adoption is mainly because of the easy operation and its timeliness. However, farmers are still worried about the attitude of neighbors around to their behavior 4.CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION From the mining results, we bring forward following conclusions A. Build various communication channels and provide differentiation information technology Farmers who have few communication channels dont want to adopt new techniques because of their limited family economic ability. We suggest government should try to reduce the risk and cost of technique adoption, promote various communication channels with different charging standards or provide some benefits of different degrees B.  Intensify farmers education and improve farmers certification of techniques Government should undertake some temporary training courses to instruct farmers some new information technologies for rural areas and let farmers be acquaint with these techniques. In this way, first farmers certification and then the information technology adoption rate will be improved C. Reduce technique cost and improve service quality It will do well in the technique promotion when the technique charging is lower and techniques are more various Moreover, considering that the service quality will influence farmers technology adoption intention and behavior information service institutions should try to perfect the quality through better satisfying farmers information demands and more reducing service cost. In this way, farmers information technology adoption will be promoted ACKNOWLEDGMENT The paper is sponsored by Beijing forestry university Scientific and Technological Innovation Project BLRW200922 REFERENCES 1] Artesyn technologies: Ministry of Industry and Information Technology Phone Covered 99.8% of Administrative Villages While Broadband Covered 96% of Villages and Towns. 3      December  2009. 20 June

Rules extracted from the third experiment where the associations between SNP genotypes and geographical regions are identified The M and m refer to major and minor allele at corresponding locus, respectively  6. Conclusion  We demonstrated that the well-refined methods such as TF-IDF term weighting and class association rule mining are applicable to the analysis of SNP genotype data. The proposed method first reduces the dimension of SNP data by selecting only the SNP genotypes with highest TF-IDF scores. It then mines the rules associating SNP sets and the traits using only the selected SNP genotypes The proposed approach is independent of trait types and, thus, is readily applicable to all type of traits without any modification. For example, in consideration of vulnerability to various diseases and responsiveness to diverse drugs, their relations with multiple genotype sets are analyzable. In our future work, we plan to explore various combinations of dimensionality reduction techniques and prediction models for the two phases of our analysis framework We also plan to evaluate some of the significant rules further through wet-lab tests  7.
