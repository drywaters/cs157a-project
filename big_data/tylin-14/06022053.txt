    Fig.3. Sample pairs within a patient case myalgia\ccurs before all the start dates of Enalapril, it does not form a pair with the drug. The ICD-9 code 786.2 \(cough occurs after the first start date of Enalapril in 24 days. Thus a pair is found, i.e., Enalapril \226 786.2. The code 276.7 Hyperkalemia\rs twice after the second start date of Enalapril. A pair is formed between the drug and the closest occurrence of 276.7  After a pair is found, its degree of association is assessed using the fuzzy RPD model. Four cues \(i.e., temporal association, other explanation, dechallenge, and rechallenge are utilized in this process. The temporal association of a pair is determined by the length of duration between drug start date and ADR occurrence date. We let Ta and L represent the temporal association and length of duration, respectively Then the following fuzzy rules are used to infer Ta       Both L and Ta are fuzzy variables, and their fuzzy values short, likely, etc.\ented by triangular membership functions. The universe course for L is set as 0 to 180 days That is, if the ADR occurs within 180 days after the drug start date, the pair is considered as having temporal association Dechallenge refers to the relationship between discontinuity of the drug and abatement of the ADR. We cannot directly evaluate the dechallenge of a pair since the drug stop date is usually unavailable in electronic health databases. However, we can indirectly assess the existence of dechallenge of a pair using the rule \223if the potential ADR occurs after the drug start date and another drug in the same class was prescribed after the potential ADR, then dechallenge is likely intended by the physician for the former drug\224. In medical practice, if an apparent adverse effect is found on a patient and is suspected to be caused by a drug, the physician often stops the drug and prescribes another drug in the same class to avoid the problem and still treat the original disease. Thus, it is very likely that there exists dechallenge between the original drug and the ADR in this situation Rechallenge depicts the relationship between re-introduction of the drug and recurrence of the ADR. That is, the same pair appears again after the drug is taken by the patient again. Rechallenge is defined as a fuzzy variable and its value is determined by the temporal associations of the two consecutive occurrences of the same pair. We let Ta1 and Ta2 represent the two temporal associations, respectively. Then the following fuzzy rules are used to assess the value of the rechallenge of a pair          The cue \223other explanations\224 denotes alternative explanations by concurrent disease or other drugs. Thus, it is drug- or disease-dependent. To make our algorithm as general as possible, this variable is not utilized at present. Note that the other three variables can be easily extended to other applications since they can characterize the causal relationship between two general events After the cue values of a pair are extracted from a case we use the procedure \(called feat ure matching\ introduced in Section III to transform the data of a pair to the format shown in Table II. We then compute the support and causal-leverage  for all the pairs, each of which implies a causal association rule. Instead of setting an explicit threshold for the causal-leverage measure, we rank all the causal association rules in the decreasing order of the measure and return the most interesting rules V  E XPERIMENTS  To evaluate the effectiveness of our new data mining strategy, we retrieved the electronic data of all patients who received at least one of the 8 drugs of our interest in the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Detroit during the time period from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2008. The interested drugs include 6 statin drugs \(i.e., rosuvastatin atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin\ and 2 ACEI \(angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor\gs \(i.e., captopril and enalapril\Event\222 data such as dispensing of drug  office visits and certain  laboratory testing was retrieved for all the patients. For each event certain details were obtained. For example, the data for dispensing of drug includes name of the drug, subject ID quantity of the drug dispensed, dose of the drug, drug start date, drug schedule, and the number of refills  The total number of retrieved patients was 16,206. All the data were stored in a Mricrosoft Access database. The database has five tables, each of which contains one of the five types of information: demographic data, patient visit data, diagnostic data, drug-related data, and laboratory data JDBC  Java Database Connectivity\, an application programming interface for the Java programming language was used to access the database. It can wrap SQL \(Structured Query Language\ment, send it to the database, and retrieve the desired data. Fuzzy rules and fuzzy reasoning were implemented using the freeware FuzzyJess [19  a  Java-based fuzzy inference engine. It allows the user to use Java language to define membership functions, set antecedent and consequent of a fuzzy rule, and make a fuzzy inference This made it easier to integrate the reasoning process with the If L is short then Ta is likely  If L is medium then Ta is possible  If L is long then Ta is unlikely  If Ta1 is likely and Ta2 is likely then rechallenge is likely If Ta1 is likely and Ta2 is possible then rechallenge is likely  If Ta1 is likely and Ta2 is unlikely then rechallenge is possible  If Ta1 is possible and Ta2 is likely then rechallenge is likely  If Ta1 is possible and Ta2 is possible then rechallenge is possible If Ta1 is possible and Ta2 is unlikely then rechallenge is possible  If Ta1 is unlikely and Ta2 is likely then rechallenge is possible  If Ta1 is unlikely and Ta2 is possible then rechallenge is possible  If  T a1 is unlikel y and T a2 is unlikel y then rechallenge is unlikel y 


   other parts of the data mining algorithm which were also implemented in Java To test the proposed data mining algorithm, we select a drug that has high frequency in the database since ADRs occur infrequently. In general, if the occurrence rate of an ADR is greater than 1%, it can be detected in the pre-marketing clinical trials and the drug is not likely to be approved for marketing. Thus, the occurrence rate of an ADR is generally less than 1% in post-marketing surveillance Moreover, to generate a valid signal, the interestingness measure is often used together with another criteria \226 the count of drug-ADR pairs being greater than or equal to That is, even if the calculated interesting measure for a pair is higher than a threshold, the pair cannot be considered as a valid signal if there are only one or two patient cases containing the pair. This requires at least 300 \(3/0.01=300 cases in order to generate a valid signal. The real situation is even worse since the occurrence rate of most ADRs is much lower than 1%. Many more cases will be needed We finally picked the drug enalapril to test the proposed algorithm since 888 patients were found taking the drug at least once in the database and a number of its known ADRs had relative high occurrence rate Causal-leverage values were calculated for each of the pairs between enalapril and all the 3,953 distinctive ICD-9 codes found in the database. All the pairs were ranked in a d ecreasing order according to their causal-leverage values. A pair between the drug and one of its known ADRs, 276.7 \(hyperkalemia\was found to be ranked as 33 out of 3,953. That is, our data mining algorithm classified the pair into top 1% of all the pairs. Note that, in post-marketing surveillance, the primary purpose of using data mining is to shorten the long list of potential drug-ADR pairs. Like the other data mining methods, the signal pairs found by our approach will be subject to further analysis \(e.g epidemiology study\ and case review and interpretation by drug safety professionals experienced in the nuances of pharmacoepidemiology and clinical medicine  VI  C ONCLUSION  Causal association represents an important relationship between two events in many applications. Finding causal associations can help us prevent adverse effects caused by their antecedents. We have introduced a knowledge representation - CAR and have developed a new interestingness measure causal-leverage to quantify the degree of causality of a CAR. Based on this novel measure and an experience-based fuzzy RPD model, we have developed a data mining algorithm to search an electronic health database for ADR signals. Experimental results showed that our method could greatly shortlist the number of pairs between a given a drug and all its potential ADRs A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We would like to thank Ellison Floyd for retrieving the patient information from the VAMC Detroit\222s databases.

repository, a knowledge miner and a case based rule structure In the knowledge miner component, the decision tree technique is used to build trees from a database of cases. The decision tree technique is also used in the Case Based Reasoning Module to find possible solutions to a new child case [11 A decision tree starts with root attributes and ends with leaf nodes. Usually it has several branches which represent classes Below, we show an example of decision tree algorithm that was used for childhood obesity prediction [10 The tree is generated based on information-gain measure The steps are as follows.  Calculate  12  13  where pi is the probability that an arbitrary sample belongs to class C                   Figure 6.  Child weight management counseling system architecture [11      


Then, calculate the entropy E\(Ai based on partitioning by attribute Ai  as follows  14   15  where Pij = sij / | Sj |, and | Sj | is the number of samples in subset Sj. Then by branching on Ai, the encoding information that would be gained is  16 For the root node, the attribute Ai with the highest information gain is selected. Then the branches are built based on different values of aij, j = 1,,q. The tree will grow until all the samples are in same class, at which point the node becomes a leaf and is labeled with that class [10]. Fig.7 shows a graphical example of a decision tree for an obesity problem. S1, S2, and S3 in Fig. 7 refer to the solutions of the obesity problem IV. DISCUSSION In this section, we discuss the effectiveness, efficacy, strengths and weaknesses of the three data mining techniques. We also include the challenge within the problem and its applicability to other adult diseases. Table 1 summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of each technique discussed ANN, nave Bayes classifier, and decision tree are data mining techniques that are applicable for childhood obesity prediction. For ANN, environment is considered as an important factor for childhood obesity prediction. The prediction result can be more promising because environment undeniably plays major role in a childs growth. The nave Bayes classifier focuses more on the childs personal attributes rather than the environment. However, the result of nave Bayes classifier has been proven acceptable for childhood obesity prediction [10       


     Table I.  Data mining methods comparison Technique Strengths Weaknesses Artificial Neural Networks \(ANN  1. Can handle a large amount of input data   2. Fault tolerance and low energy consumption  1.  Efficiencies \(error vs network size problem dependent 2.   The run time speed may be slow when many problems are involved Nave Bayes 1.

Fast learning and classification speed 2.  Results in humanunderstandable rules  1.  Prone to error if there 


are many classes and a relatively small number of training examples 2.  Can be computationally expensive to train  For the decision tree, we see that the technique is easier to build than the other two methods since various attributes can be used for childhood obesity prediction In the future, we will work on hybridizing two or more applicable data mining methods. We hope that the results will be better than current methods available.  Our goal is to increase the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of predictions, and reduce the cost \(time and space methods. We will also increase our efforts to find better solutions to childhood obesity                 Figure 7. A decision tree for an obesity problem [11 The main challenge within this problem is to successfully predict obesity at an early age. As we know, it is difficult to identify potentially obese children when they are still young Their parent\(s become obese when they grow up. Many factors are related to obesity, including environment, family, lifestyle and habits Obesity may lead to many co-morbidity disorders such as type 


2 diabetes, cardiovascular, early puberty, suicide, smoking bulimia, poor self image, social isolation and hypertension [1 If obesity prediction is successful, then early prevention steps can be taken The data mining techniques outlined above have also been used to predict other adult diseases such as diabetes and heart diseases [12][13]. The similarities with childhood obesity prediction are the way data was collected and the risk factors, while the differences are the input and output of the prediction and how the techniques were implemented for that purpose V. CONCLUSION This survey has shown that data mining can be used to successfully predict childhood obesity. The three methods presented  ANN, nave Bayes, and decision tree  are proven applicable to childhood obesity prediction.  These methods each have their weaknesses and strengths; thus, further improvements of the techniques are necessary to fully resolve the childhood obesity prediction problem. This survey also reminds the reader about co-morbidity of childhood obesity and why it is important to prevent it at early age ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank the Universiti Sains Malaysia \(USM REFERENCES  1] A.

follows. From the results of this study, we know which products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research extension would be the setting up of a real marketing campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its performance REFERENCES 1]Dhond, Gupta, A., Vadhavkar, S.
