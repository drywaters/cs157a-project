NTRODUCTION  Digital is a worldwide new technology revolution, it is an inevitable trend in the development of broadcasting and television. In broadcasting and television field,  currently, a major trend that is from analog transmission to digital transmission. Digital broadcasting and TV industry has also become the industry focus. 2006 October 24, the state administration of radio, film formally promulgated the China mobile multimedia broadcasting \(CMMB\ndustry standard determined as the mobile multimedia broadcasting industry standard. After four years of development, now, every municipality directly under the central government, provincial has established CMMB operating companies. CMMB Operating companies and the establishment of the user to service the surge in demand, boosting China's mobile digital 
multimedia broadcasting's fast development. So far, CMMB wireless network are being built, good broadcasting network is CMMB one of the keys to success 1][2  CMMB wireless network construction must carry on the network design, planning and optimization, it must undertake CMMB wireless work testing and analysis of network, so CMMB will be widely used, it is means must intensify analysis, solve this problem. When the network construction took shape, then it into a cycle of construction, road test analyze, optimize the construction process. Only by constantly analyze network, it can cause the network in the best resource utilization next to a higher customer satisfaction. Network analysis is the actual operation system in the process of an essential job. At present, in view of the laboratory testing 
instruments and high-end test instrument expensive faults, it can use software and databases unifies, using data mining association rules technical analysis wireless network  test data it can provide reliable basis for CMMB network optimization II  A SSOCIATION RULES  Data mining is from a lot of, incomplete, noisy, fuzzy and random data, extract implicit in them, people don't know in advance, but it is potential useful information and knowledge of the process. Association rule mining is from a database search itemsets between meaningful connection or related links. It is an important technology in data mining, in recent years, it is widely used in various fields. The essence of 
association rules is extract correlation from large amounts of data or object, it can reveal dependencies between the data according to the correlation, we can get the object information from another data object information. Association rules not only can be directly discovered correlation between the arbitrary itemsets from database, but also can be found implied information from data. This correlation is not dependent on a particular distribution, it is rely on the data in a particular model after multiple iterative fitting, and it is building according to the itemsets in data appeared in probability 3  Therefore, it is different from the traditional statistics method its advantage is clear and easy to explain the results

The minimum confidence degrees threshold\(mincofidence\s expressed minimum reliability 4][5  III  CMMB WIRELESS NETWORK TESTING SYSTEM AND TEST DATA PROCESSING  A  CMMB wireless network testing system and data acquisition In order to analysis CMMB wireless network, We must first get all kinds of data from the network, so, it must establish CMMB wireless network test system. Along the road test using a series of test equipment called road test system. It is using space model analysis method based on the geographical spatial database to offers a variety of space dynamic real-time information. It basically is always test longitude and latitude space planning, graphic structure, weather conditions and other information. CMMB wireless network road test system mainly consists of test vehicles, GPS, receiving antenna and the Japan Shinbashi company of CMMB signal analyzer Tx701A, and testing acquisition software. As shown Figure 1  Figure 1. wireless network road test system of data acquisition Graphical User Interface\(GUI\mainly includes: Map and the wireless network road test data real-time display, the figure of measurement data. The data from GPS and CMMB tester measurements put in a new file for offline analysis used. The contents of the file include: time, Time, latitude and longitude altitude, speed, the signal level, signal-to-noise ratio, RS mistakenly piece rate, synchronization, frequency offset multipath, MER and EVM etc B  Data conversion Association rules mining normally applied in the recording index take discrete values. Test data is continuous fields, so, we need to transform data, to convert data suitable for data mining form. Before association rule mining, we should discrete data\(essence: a particular interval value corresponds to a value\ discretization of data mining is an important steps, before the discretization process whether reasonable, it will directly influence of association rule mining results How to divide the interval is the key to realize the continuous data to the discrete data transforms. There are two key problems: When interval differentiate limits is too narrow it will causes each interval corresponding attribute support is very low, and appear "minimum support degree problem Namely because this classification causes many alternatives can not reach the minimum support degree, so that the corresponding association rule cannot be exhumed Conversely, when interval is too wide range, it will make each interval corresponding attribute the credibility of low, and appear "minimum credibility problem", Namely many alternatives can not reach the minimum confidence makes corresponding association rules were abandoned, it will cause reduce rules, and rule contains information will also reduces correspondingly. Considering the above two factor to divide space, But how to reasonably and effectively division attribute interval, and it can reflect this attribute data in the actual distribution in the domain is the key to mining the quantitative attributes association rule. This paper adopts equally spaced each interval power level 3dbm and each interval signal-tonoise ratio 2db IV  A SSOCIATED DATA MINING  Association rules algorithm is to realize the function Aprior" data mining algorithm. The SNR, the signal level incorrect piece rate form wireless network road testing is a continuous signal, We must disc retization of data according to the interval segmentation. In the CMMB wireless network, the signal-to-noise ratio and the signal level is higher, the signal quality is better. This is a standard of inspection the credibility of the table which frequently sets L 1 signal-to-noise ratio the signal level, mistakenly piece rate First of all, we must remove the interference data, then discretization data according to data range, and establish the topic for SNR, the signal level and Error Block rate. So we can get credibility table, set suitable credibility threshold, obtain the contain relationship between signal level, signal-to-noise and the error block rate. Finally, we will deposit the data from relation table into database A  Improved "Apriori" algorithm The main ideas of the "Apriori" algorithm: First of all find all the frequent itemsets, Namely, the itemsets when 


support minsupportL". Then, Through the user of the given "inconfidence", we can looking for association rules when "confidence minconfidence From the database, we can seen CMMB wireless network test data is multidimensional and multilayer. Due to the Apriori" algorithms only in integrated data model of monolayer on mining, do not suit for multidimensional data model for mining multi-layered. We want to analysis the wireless network test data\(signal level, signal-to-noise ratio error block rate\ it must improve the "Apriori" algorithm The improved algorithm "Apriori" thoughts are as follows Calculation process is as follows S1: L l find_ frequent _1-itemset\(D\/ Scan data set D, find out all of set L1 which is Frequent itemsets 1 S2: for\(k=2  1 k L   k S3: Ck =apriori_gen\( Lk-1,minsuppport S4 T total 0 S5 for each transaction tD  When scanning D conducted affairs, candidate counting S6 Ct=subset\(Ck t\e candidate set by affairs t generated S7 c.count The candidate set in each candidate counting add 1 S8   minsup kk c cout L c C port D    S:9 T total  S:10 Confidence=Lk / T total Support=c.count/Lk B  The realize of analysis CMMB wireless network test data First, produce frequent 1- itemsets L1. The frequently sets L1 = {signal level, signal-to-noise ratio, error block rate}. The test data as shown Figure 2  Figure 2. The test data in the database CMMB network analysis system for data mining, the first should be cleared irrelevant data. This process is selected helpful data from database and discarded extraneous data then, Put the data into a associated data mining need form According to the Beijing CMMB single frequency network testing data, Grading SNR, the signal level, error block rate Setting threshold, SNR classification as shown table 2   T ABLE 2  T HE TABLE OF CLASSIFICATION FOR SNR The classification of SNR Numerical range \(SNR 1 SNR>15 2 13<SNR 15 3 11<SNR 13 4 9<SNR 11 5 7<SNR 9 6 5<SNR 7 7 SNR 5 The signal level classification as shown table 3 T ABLE 3  T HE TABLE OF CLASSIFICATION FOR THE SIGNAL LEVEL  The classification of signal level Numerical range\(PWR 1 PWR>-75 2 78<PWR 75 3 81<PWR 78 4 84<PWR 81 5 87<PWR 84 6 90<PWR 87 7 PWR 90 The error block rate classification as shown table 4 T ABLE 4  T HE TABLE OF CLASSIFICATION FOR ERROR BLOCK RATE  The classification of error block rate Numerical range BLER Signal quality 1 BLER 0.005 excellent 2 0.005< BLER 0.15 good 3 0.15< BLER 0.5 generally 4 BLER>0.5 poor According to the setting threshold, powerlevel=-90,SNR 5, Improved "Apriori" algorithm project set: I={{SNR1 SNR2, Ö... SNR7},{ Signal level 1, signal level 2,ÖÖSignal level 7},{ excellent, good, generally, poor }}. The '111' means SNR 15, POWERLEVEL 75, at this time, RS_BLER 0.005. When A = {SNR1, signal level 1}, B = {excellent}, A B of the containing type means rules: When the signal level than - 75, SNR more than 15, signal quality is good. So only through the signal level and signal-to-noise ratio can be determined signal coverage From the above analysis can see, various mining parameters settings will effect the system efficiency and produce rules. Users can according to their specific needs, set up various parameters, getting what you want mining results  V  TEST ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS  According to the threshold from mining, according to the threshold table, We can get the signal-to-noise score layer figure from signal-to-noise data. As shown Figure 3 Through the EXCEL draw SNR range of percentage figure As shown Figure 4. We can see from the graph, the percentage is 82.71% when the SNR> SNR threshold 13 According to the threshold table, we can get the power level layer figure from power level data. As shown Figure 5 Through the EXCEL draw power level range of percentage figure. As shown Figure 6. We can see from the graph, the 


percentage is 91.48% when power level > power level threshold -75  Figure 3 Signal-to-noise Layered figure  Figure 4 SNR percentage figure  Figure5 Power level Layered figure  Similarly, we can get RS error block rate scope percentage and signal quality percentage In practical application, we can use lower functional testing instruments, such as only measuring signal level and signal-to-noise ratio. According to the threshold, we can be judged signal quality stand or fall through analyzed the data and can optimize the poor signal area. If the signal of poor area is larger, it is needed to add repeater. After optimization network, we are still need to testing wireless network and analysis data, So as to achieve optimal effect The main parameters for covered test are receive power and signal-to-noise ratio. But just depend on network covering power value evaluation is far from enough. The stronger power network performance is better, this is the earliest analog networks used method, for now the complex and changeable wireless network will no longer be valid. In current network analysis and design,  if you want to know exactly what the transmitter cover performance. You must test and analyze the system's receiving power and SNR, error block rate, and so on, and adjust network according to the test result. Such as add repeater in large area covering the place with bad. Designated for network interference analysis in the signal strength with high or Signal to Noise Ratio with high but receiving quality is bad In practical application, we can use different methods to test different areas and divide the area into urban and suburban areas. Using this paperís methods to analyzes the different area we can get corresponding parameters threshold table. It is more accurate to determine network covering the quality situation help optimize network A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The paper is supported by the Science Research Project of Chongqing municipal Education Commission in china under contract no.KJ101114 and KJ111103,it is also supported by the Creative Team of Chongqing three Gorges university in China All authors wish to thank the WiCOM2011 Organizing Committee for providing this template and all colleagues who previously provided technical support R EFERENCES  1  Miehalski.R.S Kuamfna.K..A..DataMining and Knowledge Diseovery A Review of Issues and a Multistrategy APProach Machine Learning and Data Mining Mehtods and APPlications Jo&SonsLtd 1997 92-107P 2  RAgrawal,R Srikant.Fast algorithms for mining association rules[C I n P r o c o f 1994I nt 1  Co nf o n V e ry  L a rg e D a ta Bases\(VLDB'94\.San Francisco:Morgan Kaufman 1994 478 499 3  Srikant.R Agrawal.R.

In this experiment to compare with our approach in mining frequent itemsets with constraint from LG A we incorporate C into the CharmL and Eclat \(well-known algorithms for mining frequent itemsets\. This is done easily by choosing only frequent items that are in C to work in the next steps of those algorithms. Those new versions are called C Charm, and C Eclat The items of the constraints are selected from the set A F  of all frequent \(corresponding to the minimum support MS items of A with the ratios of º, Ω and æ. We have the constraints with the sizes of l 1  A F l 2  A F and l 3  A F For each l i  C is constructed from two subsets C   C 1  C 2 In the reality, the constraints that users are interested in usually contain the high-support items. Thus we will sort all items by th e order of their supports. To determine a constraint C with the size l i firstly, we construct the first subset C 1 of C containing [p*l i  t e m s  randomly selected from the set of high-support items in A F  where p 002 0  t h e r e m a i n e d p a r t  C 2 of C contains  [\(1p i   r a n d o m ly s e lec t e d ite ms f r o m  A F  C 1 For experiments at here, we set p = 0.5 and consider two constraints for each l i  We will do two comparisons. Firstly, in Table VI, we compare the average time for mining frequent closed itemsets and their generators with constraint C by our algorithm MINE_CG_CONS  shown in column T C O   to  the one by C CharmGen column T C C upon P, M, Co, and Ch C CharmGen is the combination of C Charm \(for mining frequent closed itemsets with constraint\ and MinimalGenerators [19  f o r d e t e r m i n i ng t he i r g e ne ra t o rs    The reduction in the mining time is shown in column RT C O  RT C O T C C T C O With the different minimum support thresholds, we see that it is drastic, ranging from a factor of 60 to 316 times! That reduction plays an important role in mining quickly association rule with constraints because, as the discussion on [15, 6 a l l  a sso c i a t i o n  r u l e s c a n b e m i n e d  quickly from frequent closed itemsets and their generators TABLE VI  M INING FREQUENT CLOSED ITEMSETS AND GENERATORS WITH CONSTRAINT   M INE _ CG _ CONS VS CCHARMGEN   DB MS T C C T C O RT C O  Co 75 1.07 0.005 213  65 1.29 0.013 99  55 3.49 0.026 134 Ch 65 1.21 0.011 115  55 6.08 0.055 111  50 10.93 0.111 98 P 80 1.50 0.010 145  70 13.74 0.115 120  65 39.22 0.243 161 M 15 0.16 0.003 60  5 0.84 0.003 316  1 4.80 0.018 264  In the second, the time for mining all frequent closed itemsets restricted on C by our algorithm MINE_FS_CONS  is compared to the one by C Eclat We did experiments on on three databases \(that have many items\o, P, M. The reduction in the mining time by our approach is drastic. It ranges from a factor of 14 to 1063 times and is shown in Fig 5               Figure 5  The reduction in mining time all frequent itemsets with constraint MINE_FS_CONS vs C Eclat  For database P, the reductions are small because the average size of transactions is small compared with the number of all items. Then, practically \(users are usually interested in high-support items\, we should consider the constraints containing many high-support items. Indeed, the bigger of the number of high-support items \(corresponding with the big values of p\ are, the bigger reductions become Table VII showed that. In addition, the output of our algorithm MINE_FS_CONS is classified into disjoint classes. All frequent itemsets with constraint in a class have

Using those attributes, a decision tree was generated which is shown in figure 3 Wheezes was selected as the decision attribute for this tree. As shown in figure 3, the association rule can be easily proven by the use of this decision tree. In the tree the highest numbers of records are shown under the attributes values which were given by the association rule. That node contains 1218 records from the whole data set and that is the highest number of values in the whole decision tree By this decision tree the association rule can be proved Figure 1. Decision tree for diabetes type 2 and edema 374 and that increases the validity of the rule which shows that people who have diabetes type 2, who are female housewives, having normal range of sodium level and diastolic blood pressure and who has edema and has low cholesterol level are having a higher probability of getting Wheezes Gender=F occupation=Housewife Sodium Level=135145 diastolic=60-80 cholesterol <5.17 edema = Yes diabetesType=Type 1 ==> wheezes=Yes conf :\( 0.95 Second association rule selected for diabetes type 1 discovered a relationship between diabetes type 1 and wheezes and that rule was almost similar to the rule generated for diabetes type 2 The decision tree in figure 4 was generated by using the attributes in the association rule and from that the rule can be proved. Here wheezes was selected as the decision attribute for this tree. The edema has the highest number of records than all the other nodes So, another important thing that can be identified by this tree is; the people who have diabetes and edema have the highest probability for originating wheezes than people who havent edema. Edema has a contribution towards wheezes than other attributes.  So, it can be concluded that there is a higher relationship between edema and wheezes 3 and FBS level After generating decision trees with different attribute 


combinations, one was selected as the optimal decision tree which contains the best attribute combination. When analyzing this decision tree there was a branch which has the attribute combination as BMI= 18.5-24.9, Occupation=Housewife, Gender Female, Systolic blood pressure= 90- 120, Diastolic blood pressure= 60-80 There were 600 records in the selected dataset which belong to the patients who are housewives having BMI range of 18.5-24.9, systolic blood pressure between 90- 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between 60-80 mmHg. Out of those patients there were 494 patients whose FBS level was above 125 mg/dl. It was out of the 1947 patients who have more than 125 mg/dl FBS level This attribute combination was selected as the best combination among all the combinations in this tree because it was the attribute combination which the highest number of patients had and among them about 83% had more than 125 mg/dl FBS level Because of these reasons it can be proved that the people who are the housewives having BMI range of 18.5-24.9 systolic blood pressure between 90- 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between 60-80 mmHg have  highest risk of having more than 125 FBS level. But these BMI range Systolic BP range and Diastolic BP range are the normal levels which should be there in the human body When analyzing much more about this the best rule generated by the decision tree, with the patients dataset, it was identified that 93.82% of those patients were in the range of 39  75 years. Therefore the age which has most possibility of having more than 125 FBS level can be proved as more than 39 years Also in the dataset 85.90% of the patients with this attribute combination had wheezes. Patients with above attributes and age range of 39-75 years, 76.72% had wheezes. As mentioned in earlier sections, as well as results generated by the association rules also prove this situation that there is a link between wheezes and increased FBS level Also among the patients with above attribute collection there were 95.87% patients with primary or secondary education level. Therefore it can be said that, when the education level is low of a person it affects his FBS level in 


blood. The reason for that can be not having enough knowledge about the necessary life style needed to control the sugar level The best finding is that there patients with attribute combination generated by decision tree were 100% females The decision tree generated to further analyze the relationship between gender and FBS level is shown in figure 5 When considering the decision trees generated to analyze the probability of gender in different attribute combinations, in most of the times WEKA did not even generated the tree. The reason is that, when designing the tree, WEKA selects the best attributes to split the data records at the top of the decision tree to get the possibilities Figure 2. Decision tree for diabetes type 1 and edema Figure 3. Decision tree for diabetes type 1 and wheezes 375 of the particular attribute. When considering attribute Gender, female has the highest possibility than male Therefore there is no reason to do the splitting any more Association rules that generated regarding the gender and both diabetes types also proved that when the other attributes are in normal levels gender becomes the major attribute of increasing the possibility of having Diabetes The overall conclusion which can be obtained through this is, the patients who are female housewives having wheezes, BMI range of 18.5-24.9, systolic blood pressure between 90- 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure between 60-80 mmHg has the most possibility of more than 125 mg/dl in the FBS level. Because the BMI range, Systolic BP range and Diastolic BP range are in the normal levels; the gender of female, aged between 39-75 years, education level only having primary or secondary education and having wheezes become the major decision factors of high FBS level V. DISCUSSION Following section is about the problems encountered and issues faced when doing the project and key contributions of the research towards the diabetes field and research community A. Problems Faced When considering the phase 2 of the research there were 


several problems with the WEKA software, when generating the decision tree. The content of the window which displays the generated decision tree cannot be zoomed out/in according to the requirement of the user. Therefore it was difficult to view and analyze the generated decision trees with all its' branches according to the needs. Also the generated decision tree could not copy to another application. Therefore generating an image of a large decision trees were impossible B. Key contributions of the research One of the key contributions of this research is to identify hidden risk factors of Diabetes. The other key contribution is to identify whether there is any possibility to increase the Diabetes risk level when different combinations of risk factors are taken together The value of these key contributions can be described focusing different end users such as physicians and the people who have or who do not have Diabetes. For example after experimentally proving the results of this research, the doctors will be able to exactly say how much of possibility a person has to get Diabetes and other diseases which occur as side effects of Diabetes. Other than that the patient will be able to get a brief idea of whether he would get Diabetes in the future or whether he already has Diabetes in his body without his knowledge VI. CONCLUSION This paper discussed the utilization of classification techniques and association rules generation to identify the undiscovered decision factors of diabetes and the effects of diabetes Phase 1 of this research included the preliminary findings of the generation and analysis of the association rules. After the association rules generation, to further improve the reliability of the results, classification approach was used This paper covered the phase 2 of the research which covers the application of classification techniques. The conclusions which can be made through phase 1 and phase 2 are stated below A relationship between edema and diabetes has been identified from the association rules generation. The results obtained from the decision tree analysis also clearly state that, the probability of occurring edema for both diabetic 


type patients will increase if they have wheezes. From the decision trees generated for edema and both diabetes types it can be concluded that, wheezes will more affect towards developing edema for both diabetic types than the other attributes A strong relationship between wheezes and diabetes also identified with association rules. Currently in the medical field, no relationship is identified between wheezes and diabetes. The decision tree analysis regarding this aspect discovered that the diabetic patients who are suffering from edema have the highest probability for developing wheezes than the people who havent edema. Edema has a contribution towards wheezes than other attributes.  So, it can be concluded that there is a higher relationship between edema and wheezes In the previous phase of this research, a high risk for women towards diabetes was identified than men. Another conclusion obtained was, when the BMI range, systolic BP Blood Pressure normal levels, females with only primary or secondary Figure 5.    Decision tree for diabetes type 2 and gender.Figure 4. Decision tree for diabetes type 2 and wheezes 376 education aged between 39-75 years, and having wheezes will have a high risk towards developing high FBS levels All the above discovered relationships are true for both Diabetes type 1 and type 2. But Diabetes type 1 has a stronger relationship with all those factors than type 2 Currently in the medical field, none of the above discovered information was proved except the relationship between diabetes and edema. Since a strong relationship between diabetes and edema was identified through the data mining techniques, other rules also have a higher possibility of proven by the real world experiments All the conclusions of the entire research were generated through data mining process and evaluated through the related literature and the domain experts knowledge. But they must be   validated through real life applications and medical experiments. That is the major future work to be done for this research ACKNOWLEDGMENT Our sincere gratitude goes to Dr. H. A.
