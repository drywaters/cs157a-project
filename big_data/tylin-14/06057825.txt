perform the association rules mining process without loss of generality other mining methods of association rules can be applied IV E XPERIMENTS This section presents experimental results when using our proposed method to execute similarity queries In order to evaluate our approach we employed precision 002 recall P 002 R graphs The precision of a query is the fraction of the retrieved elements which are relevant Hence precision  j R A j j A j  where j R A j is the number of relevant images retrieved and j A j is the size of the answer set The recall of a query is the fraction of the relevant elements which has been retrieved Thus recall  j R A j j R j  where j R A j is the number of relevant images retrieved and j R j is the number of relevant elements that should be retrieved When analyzing P 002 R graphs the closer the curve to the top the better the corresponding retrieval technique is To build the P 002 R graphs when the user decides to 002nalize and visualize the results we applied sets of k nearest neighbor  kN N  queries using all images of the analyzed image dataset as query centers varying the values of k  in order to compare our approach i.e features selected according the user perception with the original features In the Step 2 RF Loop of the proposed method was employed the Rocchio's technique setting the positive feedback constant as 014  1  0 and the negative feedback constant as 015  0  5  We chose to employ this well-known technique for showing our method applicability However other more sophisticated RF methods could also be used A Dataset Description We used a variety of image datasets acquired from our Hospital University to perform the experiments However due to space limitations we present here only the results obtained from one representative dataset The M RI dataset consists of 800 images obtained from magnetic resonance imaging exams The dataset was divided into 4 classes according to the body region image orientation and the height of the slice Figure 3 illustrates an example of each class a Axial Head MRI 200 images b Coronal Head MRI 200 images c Sagittal Head MRI 200 images d Sagittal Spine MRI 200 images Figure 3 Examples of images from the M RI dataset Each image from the dataset was processed using the Haralick's Texture the T raditional Gray-le v el histograms and the Zernike Moments These feature e xtractors generated feature vectors comprising 140 256 and 256 positions respectively They were used because they describe the gray-level distribution the texture patterns and shape peculiarities of the medical images B Results In our experiments considering the Steps 1 initial query and 2 RF Loop we applied sets of k nearest neighbor  kN N  queries more speci\002cally 80 nearest neighbor queries and the 002rst three relevance feedback cycles in order to build the training dataset For our experiments at the 002rst second and third relevance feedback cycles 5 10 and 15 relevant images were selected respectively For comparison purposes we always required the user to perform 3 relevance cycles Therefore the 002rst relevance feedback cycle always generated a training set with 5 002 n classes  were n classes is the number of classes in the dataset The second cycle generated a training set with 15 002 n classes  because it was increased by 10 new images and thus the third RF cycle always generated a training set with 30 002 n classes images as it was increased by 15 new images In all experiments a weight w  000 0  5 was assigned to the irrelevant images The P 002 R graphs of Figures 4 5 and 6 show the experiments performed over the M RI dataset represented by the Haralick features the gray-level histogram features and by the Zernike moments respectively using L 2 distance The graphs compare the original features i.e 140 features for Haralick and 256 for gray-level histogram and Zernike moments with the proposed method re\002ning the training dataset using the 002rst 3 relevance cycles gradually decreasing the number of features by selecting the relevant ones according to the user perception and at the same time obtaining a gain in the precision of the similarity queries Figure 4 shows the P 002 R graphs obtained using the Haralick features over the M RI image dataset Analyzing the graphs of Figure 4 we observe that the proposed method not only clearly improves the precision of the similarity queries but also achieved a considerable dimensionality reduction The precisions obtained by the relevant features selected using the training set generated in cycles 1 2 and 3 show that the curves practically ties presenting a precision gain of up to 30 over the precision of the original features i.e 140 features for a recall level of 40 It is important to note that the proposed method not only presents a considerable precision gain in all cases but also promoted a signi\002cant reduction of up to 6.7 times less dimensions in the third interaction which reduces the memory and processing cost These results show that the proposed technique improves the precision of similarity queries even when it reduces the dimensionality of the feature vectors performing the feature selection guided by the user perception

Figure 5 shows the P 002 R graphs obtained from the graylevel histogram features of the M RI dataset Analyzing Figure 5 we see that our method again presented a gain in precision of up to 14 for a recall level of 20 in comparison with the original features and those selected by the mining process using the third re\002ned training set In this case the feature vector size were approximately reduced to up to 11.6 times less dimensions in comparison with the dimension of the complete feature vectors Figure 4 P 002 R graphs using L 2 distance obtained over the M RI dataset represented by Haralick features comparing the retrieval ability both of the original features and of our proposed method after 3 cycles of relevance feedback Figure 5 P 002 R graphs using L 2 distance obtained over the M RI dataset represented by Gray-level Histogram features comparing the retrieval ability both of the original features and of our proposed method after 3 cycles of relevance feedback Figure 6 illustrates the results over the Zernike moments features We can notice that the proposed method achieved a precision gain of up to 11 in comparison with the original features considering a recall level of 60 It is important to highlight that the feature vector size again was reduced to up to 2.2 times less dimensions in comparison with original ones i.e 256 features Figure 6 P 002 R graphs using L 2 distance obtained over the M RI dataset represented by Zernike Moments features comparing the retrieval ability both of the original features and of our proposed method after 3 cycles of relevance feedback Figure 7 P 002 R graphs using L 1 distance obtained over the M RI dataset represented by Haralick features comparing the retrieval ability both of the original features and of our proposed method after 3 cycles of relevance feedback Figures 7 8 and 9 show the P 002 R graphs obtained from the Haralick features gray-level histogram features and Zernike moments of the M RI dataset using L 1 distance Analyzing the graph of Figure 7 we observe that the proposed method not only clearly improves the precision of the similarity queries but also achieved a considerable dimensionality reduction The precisions obtained by the relevant features selected in cycles 1 2 and 3 show that the curves practically ties presenting a gain of 20 over the precision of the original features i.e 140 features for a recall level of 40 Analyzing Figure 8 one can see that our method again present a gain in precision of up to 9 for a recall level of 25 in comparison with the original features considering the third interaction Figure 9 illustrates the results over the Zernike moments features We can notice that in Figure 9 the method achieved a precision gain of up to 11 in comparison with the original features considering a recall level of 50

First, transaction clustering is conducted, so that all the transactions of e-shoppers are clustered. The SOM technique is used to cluster target e-shoppers transactions Then it is necessary to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. These e-shopper behaviors, which are derived from a change in the cluster number of each e-shopper, are kept in the purchase sequence database. Finally sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. The sequential purchase patterns are then stored in the association rule database Although SOM technique can obtains transaction clusters SOM clustering technique often breaks down when handling very high-dimensional data. So it is proposed that using product classes represents the hierarchical relationships among products. The method can make an effective dimensionality reduction while improving clustering results Assume that a product class set P  is classified into n different subclasses, and that each subclass consists of subclasses at a lower level, or eventual leaf products, as follows PPPPP nn ,, 121 ?= "                          \(1 Suppose that C is the set of the transactions of m e-shoppers during s periods before timeT . More specifically letC be composed as follows CCC kTmkTkTC ???= ,,2,1 ,, "                   \(2 11,0 ?= sk "  2?s WhereC kTj ?, ?C  is a non-empty subset of products Each C kTj ?,  represents the product class or classes from which e-shopper j purchased products at time kT EveryC kTj ?,  is transformed into an input matrix composed of a bit vector, and the matrix to be transformed is used in the transaction clustering. The time-ordered vectors for a particular e-shopper represent the purchasing history of the 


e-shopper; this input matrix can be thought of as the dynamic profile of the e-shopper. A dynamic e-shopper profile is defined as follows Let C _ be a dynamic e-shopper profile. Then, C _ is defined by the following matrix for n product classes and m e-shoppers over the course of s periods  3 mj "2,1 11,0 ?= sk " 2?s Where                         1 if Pi?C kTj   All the transactions of e-shoppers in the training e-shopper purchase database are transformed into dynamic e-shopper profiles based on their prior purchase behaviors. Then we use the SOM clustering technique to assign each transaction to a group. This transaction clustering facilitates the discovery of the dynamic cluster sequence of e-shopper The transaction clustering results in the following set of q clusters DDDD q"21 ,=                             \(4 Where each Di is a subset of C _ the given in \(3 A rearrangement of these clusters by  e-shopper  and by time  period is necessary for the identification of the dynamic behavior of each e-shopper. It is possible to learn the cluster sequence of a e-shopper by identifying the cluster to which each transaction of the e-shopper belongs, during each time period. To formalize this concept, we use the following terminology Let BP j be the behavior pattern of e-shopper j . Then, the behavior pattern BPi is identical to the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper j during s periods and is defined as follows  5 Where D kTj ?, ?D ,11,0 ?= sk "  2?s The  process  of searching for  a behavior path can 


be simply conducted through transaction clustering. All e-shoppers  have  a behavior path based on their prior transactions. The association rule technique is well suited for determining the most frequent pattern with confidence, since it provides automatic filtering capabilities. To discover the behavior path of a target e-shopper at time T based on his/her past behavior, the input data should be divided into a conditional part and a consequential part. Association rules are descriptive patterns of the form X?Y, where X and Y are statements regarding the values of attributes of an instance in a database. X is termed the left-hand-side, and is the conditional part of an association rule. Meanwhile, Y is called the right-hand-side, and is the consequent part. The conditional part is composed of the left-hand-side assigned to the consequential part R j represents the association rule about the user specified minimum support and confidence in the following form R j 6 A rule R j  indicates that, if the path of a e-shopper is DD TjsTj 1,1, , ?+? " , then the behavior cluster for that e-shopper is D Tj, at timeT It is necessary to know the degree to which the behavior path of a target e-shopper during 1?s periods beforeT  is similar to the association rule. The cluster path of a target e-shopper, transformed via the SOM, is compared with the association rules derived from other e-shoppers paths, and then the best-matching path is determined. Execution of this 0 if Otherwise    C kTj 154 process requires new measures for calculating the degree of correspondence between the association rules and the behavior path of a target e-shopper. This similarity measure is defined as follows

However, even if the similarity measure is high, a choice of the association rule suited to the prediction of the cluster of a target e-shopper at timeT is difficult, since such a rule is not general, given that the support and confidence of the association rule may be remarkably low. Therefore, to assure a good fit between the behavior path of a target e-shopper and the conditional part of the association rule, it is necessary to measure fitness. Fitness is defined as follows Suppose FDij be a degree of the goodness-of-fit between the behavior path i and the association rule j . Then, FDij is defined as follows ConfidenceSupportSDFD jjjiij = ,             \(8 Using the above definition, we can determine the cluster of a target e-shopper at timeT is a consequential part R Tj, of the association rule j with maximum FDij IV.  ILLUSTRATIVE EXAMPLE In this paper, we use Table 3 as example given to illustrate proposed method. The set of product classes given in Table 3 is P={Candy, Can, Milk, Bread, Biscuit}. The transactions of e-shopper CID006 are C June,006 {Candy}, =C May,006 {Can}, =C July,006 {Milk 


Therefore, the dynamic purchase profile of CID006 buying the set of products {Candy, Can, Milk Bread, Biscuit} from May to July may be represented as { }0,0,0,0,1,006 _ C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,006 _ C May and 0,0,1,0,0,006 _ C July . CID016 and CID006 are exactly same as both bought the same products during the same month Therefore, similarly, the transactions of target e-shopper CID016 are =C June,016 {Candy} and =C May,016 {Can The dynamic purchase profile of CID016 buying the products may be represented as 0,0,0,0,1,016 _ C June , { }0,0,0,1,0,016 _ C May TABLE IV.

The association rules are as shown in table 5. The similarities  between the path of e-shopper CID016  and the derived rules are 22016 =SD and 11016 =SD . Therefore, e-shopper CID016 belongs to the ninth cluster at timeT , since the fitness between CID016 and the rules are =FD2016 0.2 and =FD 1 016 0.2001. Therefore, we predict that the products which e-shopper CID016 is likely to buy are Bread, and Biscuit  TABLE V.

In this study, we describe a new approach for mining the changes of e-shopper  purchase behavior over time and discuss solutions to several problems. For predicting e-shoppers purchase behavior, the following concepts are proposed: BP j SDij and FDij . The SOM technique is used to detect the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes. The purchase sequences are derived from the changes in the cluster number of e-shopper. The sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. Then the sequential purchase patterns are stored in the rule database Finally, we give the example to elaborate the new methodology. The research presented in this paper makes a 155 contribution to mining  e-shoppers purchase behavior basing on transaction data. E-retailer may be able to perform effective  one-to-one marketing campaigns by providing individual target e-shoppers with personalized Product basing on using purchase sequences In the future, some possible extensions to this work are as 


follows. From the results of this study, we know which products target e-shoppers are likely to buy, but we have not yet explored the times at which these purchases are likely to occur. Further research analyzing e-shoppers past purchasing patterns should likewise enable prediction of the most appropriate times. Furthermore, one interesting research extension would be the setting up of a real marketing campaign, in which e-shoppers would be targeted using this methodology, which could then be evaluated with regard to its performance REFERENCES 1]Dhond, Gupta, A., Vadhavkar, S.
