A Support-Based Vertical Partitioning Method for Database Design Lisbeth RodrÌguez and Xiaoou Li Department of Computer Science CINVESTAV-IPN Mexico D.F Mexico lisbethr@computacion.cs.cinvestav.mx lixo@cs.cinves tav.mx Abstract In association rule mining support is a measure of association between two sets of items which indicates the r elative occurrence of both sets within the overall set of transactio ns In this paper we propose a support-based vertical partitio ning method that is easy to implement and can nd an optimal vertic al partitioning scheme We present several experimental resu lts to clarify the validness of the proposed method Index Terms Association rules databases data mining support measure vertical partitioning I I NTRODUCTION Vertical partitioning is a design technique used for query optimization in databases this is achieved by grouping the attributes accessed together by the queries as vertical fragm ents Vertical partitioning is an NP-hard problem 1  T h e r e f o r e  the use of heuristics is required to nd a solution Afnity is a widely employed measure in heuristic vertical partitio ning techniques 2   3   i t m e a s u r e s h o w t w o a t t r i b u t e s a r e a c c e ssed together by the queries togetherness The main disadva ntage of this measure is that it only involves two attributes and hence it does not show the togetherness of more than two attributes 4  Data mining is a process for extracting non-trivial implic it previously unknown and potentially useful information fro m data in databases 5  O n e o f t h e m o s t i m p o r t a n t p r o b l e m s in data mining is the discovery of association rules for larg e databases this is called association rule mining Associa tion rules are a simple and natural class of database regularitie s The purpose of association rule mining is to discover the co-ocurrence associations among data in large databases i e to nd items that imply the presence of other items in the same transaction 6  I t s f o r m a l d e  n i t i o n i s  g i v e n a  n i t e multiset of transactions D  the problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have support and condence at least equal to the user-specied minimum suppo rt threshold  min-sup  and minimum condence threshold  minconf  respectively 7  Gorla and Betty 8 d e v e l o p e d a n a s s o c i a t i o n r u l e b a s e d vertical partitioning algorithm One disadvantage of this algorithm is that it is necessary to specify minimum support and condence threshold in order to nd the fragments and it is difcult to set the suite value of such thresholds to obtain t he optimal solution In this paper we use support as a global afnity measure between attributes and we present a vertic al partitioning algorithm called SVP that takes an Attribut e Usage Matrix AUM as input and also needs a minimum support threshold  min-sup  but it is automatically determined by the algorithm SVP consists of three steps in the rst ste p an Attribute Support Matrix ASM is obtained from the AUM  in the second step the min-sup value is determined and nally the optimal fragments are found using the Connection Based Partitioning Algorithm CBPA 9  The rest of the paper is organized as follows in Section II we give an introduction of association rule and its measures  In Section III we propose the support-based vertical partitio ning method Section IV presents several experiments to show the efciency of the proposed method Finally Section V is our conclusion II A SSOCIATION RULES A Introduction Given a set of transactions D  where each transaction contains a set of items an association rule is dened as an expression X  Y  where X and Y are sets of items and X  Y   The rule implies that the transactions of the database which contain X tend to contain Y 6  Support and condence are two measures of association The support factor indicates the relative occurrence of bot h X and Y within the overall set of transactions and is dened as the ratio of the number of tuples satisfying both X and Y over the total number of tuples The condence factor is the probability of Y given X and is dened as the ratio of the number of tuples satisfying both X and Y over the number of tuples satisfying X  The support factor indicates the frequencies of the occurring patterns in the rule and the condence facto r denotes the strength of implication of the rule 5  Let N to be the total number of tuples and  A  to be the number of tuples containing all items in the set A  Dene               1                     2

B.  NFUP algorithm The basic idea of NFUP algorithm is similar to the FUP algorithm. Their difference is shown in follows: FUP algorithm using the original database to set DB mining results, that is frequent items Ls need for DB and db scan for n times, getting final frequent items L' of DBdb; And algorithm NFUP just scan DB for one time and db for several times. NFUP algorithm can improve efficiency by less scanning to DB's I/O operations. Apriori algorithm for db verifies whether the elements of L is he frequent item of dbDB, and generates the frequent items Ldb, then verifies whether elements of Ldb is the frequent items of dbDB through scanning of DB However, the premise of NFUP algorithm is frequent items known metadata DB and the support of elements Therefore, the theoretical NFUP efficiency is far more than that of FUP. In order to compare the two algorithms, the actual operation comparison will be shown in below. Hardware environment: the CPU is Intel p4 2.4 GHz; memory is DDR 1.0 GB. Software environment: Windows 2000 Server operation system, a programming language is Matlab 7.1. The original data DB exist in Boolean matrix form, which is nine project including 10 000 record. The new data base has 500 records \(about 850 KB and FUP is shown in figure 1, minimum support degree in the 20 percent and 80 percent    Figure 1 The comparison of the execution time among same database algorithms From figure 1, for the same database and support circumstances, the execution time of NFUP algorithm is reduced by 50% than FUP algorithm. NFUP algorithm is much fast than FUP algorithm when the support degree in 0.2 and 0.6 V.  CONCLUSIONS Now some algorithm of some existing frequent items has some missed questions, such as many candidate items, big space. The algorithm may reduce the mining efficiency when increasing scan db frequent items. Although algorithm is simple, its process carries on more effective pruning. This paper brings in some knowledge about association rule 


especially discussing the classic association rule of algorithm and mainly pointing out the analysis and conclusion of the FUP Minimum support degree The execution tim e\(in seconds and the IUA. Also two improved algorithm have been discussed in order to help the study of negative association rules for incremental updating   REFERENCES 1] Agrawal R.Srikant R.

Frequency Module This module aims at detecting the frequent instances and the frequent associations of instances. Indeed, such a frequency depicts an important interest of the user for the concerned instances. Consequently, it is relevant to recommend items with these characteristics to the user 1 considers the profile of the user. It aims at detecting the most important features of interest for the user Regardless of the estimated interest of an instance for a user, we consider that if the user has in his history a significant percentage of items which have as a feature that particular instance, the interest of this instance is significant Unlike the previous computation, this computation ignores the users ratings for the items which have the instance as a feature Example: A user who has watched 80% of the films interpreted by the actor Tom Hanks should get the recommendation of the other 20% he has not seen even if some of the films of Tom Hanks in his history are badly rated 2 case with frequent instances described above, this part of the module deals not only with the profile of the user, but also with the set of items. It aims at discovering frequent associations between the features in the user history. It detects the features that often occur together in order to discover new recommendations. To achieve this, frequent sets of the instances related to the items in the users history are computed. Then, items with such instances are recommended to the user Example: A possible frequent association is the actor Johnny Depp and the director Tim Burton. A user who is interested in these two instances will be recommended the other films related to them E. Recommendation and explanation 


As explained in Sect. II, the collaborative and the semantic modules are in cascade. Consequently, the result is a set of recommendations rec1 which is mixed with the recommendations of the frequency module rec2 such that rec1 is presented before rec2 to the user. This order can be inverted according to user feedback. Concerning the explanation of the recommendations, this is done by highlighting the instances which have highly scored the interest of the user for the items of rec1, and by highlighting the frequent instances in the items of rec2 F. Example In this section, we illustrate the recommendation process for any user u, in the movie domain. We will simplify to preserve the clarity of the example 2010 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications 473 Table I EXTRACT OF THE PROFILE OF THE USER u Film Rating Transformation Psycho 5 Psychol Rear Window 4 Rear Windowl Four Weddings and a Funeral 4 Four Weddings and a Funerall Monty Pythons Life of Brian 5 Monty Pythons Life of Brianl Carrie 3 Carried Stephen Kings The Langoliers 1 Stephen Kings The Langoliersd Pulp Fiction 4 Pulp Fictionl Dr. Strangelove 2 Dr. Strangeloved A Clockwork Orange 1 A Clockwork Oranged Let us consider u who has rated the movies in Tab.

The concerned movies are The Shining and Monty Python and the Holy Grail For The Shining, we obtain the following interest re 


sults conceptInterestActor \(u, TheShining conceptInterestDirector \(u, TheShining conceptInterestWriter \(u, TheShining conceptInterestGenre \(u, TheShining Unlike the prediction of the previous modules, it seems that The Shining is not a good recommendation for u Actually, this film shares its director with Dr. Strangelove and A Clockwork Orange which are negatively rated by u Moreover, it has a writer in common with Carrie and The Langoliers which are also movies disliked by u. The same reasoning is made about the concepts Actor and Genre Concerning Monty Python and the Holy Grail, the interests by concept are conceptInterestActor \(u, HolyGrail conceptInterestDirector \(u, HolyGrail conceptInterestWriter \(u, HolyGrail conceptInterestGenre \(u, HolyGrail This recommendation is a good one. The film shares its actors, writers and director with Monty Pythons Life of Brian which is highly rated by the user. The recommendation is thus justified Figure 3. Extract of the movie ontology Frequency Module: Let us assume that the user rated 60% of Alfred Hitchcocks films \(in Tab. I, Psycho and Rear Window are some of them recommended to u IV. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION A. Ontology Description For the experimentation, we built the ontology manually see Fig. 3 IMDB8. We focused only on a set of data which led to the concepts Film, Person, Actor, Director, Writer and Genre The connections between these concepts are Each movie is related to a certain number of persons who can be actors, directors or writers but it can also be related to other movies \(Example: Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home and Free Willy 3: The Rescue are related A person and a movie have a genre \(Action, Adventure Animation, Children, Comedy, Crime, etc B. Experimentation and Evaluation 


We use a subset of the dataset provided by MovieLens, the recommender system of GroupLens Research. The dataset contains a set of users, the set of items they have evaluated with a rating between 1 \(for the least liked for the most liked framework, we deal with a set of 86 movies, 934 users and 13 053 ratings. The dataset contains 3593 actors, 77 directors, 275 writers and 17 genres Using a 65% confidence and a 5% support, association rule mining resulted in 1472 rules after running the collaborative module. We evaluated the results obtained from the system by eighteen 20-50-year-old volunteers. The evaluation consisted exclusively in explicit valuations \(ratings 8http://www.imdb.com 474 2010 10th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and Applications Figure 4. Users evaluation of the system between 1 and 5 rated at the beginning between 11 and 31 films. For each recommended item, the user rates it as liked or disliked. If an item is rated as liked, the recommendation is considered as accurate. Otherwise, the system explains the reason why this item is recommended. The user can then agree with this explanation or not. Explanation of recommendation can be effective in convincing users in their appreciation of the items [24]. In our approach, the explanation aims at discovering if the detected patterns in the recommended item are accurate or not. Let us consider the following explanation in the recommendation of a film: This film may interest you because you frequently watched Tim Burtons films with Johnny Depp. If the user agrees with the explanation, that means that the association \(Tim Burton - Johnny Depp relevant but this particular film do not appeal to the user Otherwise, we consider that the detected association was purely a coincidence. In this case, the system will be able to ignore this pattern for this user in the future The results of this evaluation are depicted on Fig. 4. We can see that 84,9% of the recommendations satisfy the users Concerning the recommendations rated as disliked, 59,4% of the explanations are approved by users. Finally, 93,9% of the recommendations are satisfying or approved An average of 5 recommendations is obtained by running the collaborative and the semantic-based modules \(which is 


acceptable due to the low number of movies  86  in the dataset frequency module. This difference is due to the fact that the cascading modules \(collaborative and semantic-based are limited by the unique usage of the ratings to compute the association rules. The frequency module, on the other hand, is based on a statistical analysis of the item contents Consequently, it does not suffer from the sparsity of the user rating matrix like the previous modules The collaborative module results in some recommendations which are not liked by users. Fortunately, such recommendations are eliminated by the semantic-based module Other recommendations are eliminated by the semanticbased module though they appeal to users. We explain this because the concerned items dont share any features with the ones in the users history. This is why, we aim at introducing a semantic similarity measure to alleviate this problem \(see Sect. V module recommendations and 58,1% of the explanations of the disliked recommendations, satisfy the users. We can conclude that the combination of all the modules results in better recommendations V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In our work, we propose a hybrid recommender system that combines collaborative filtering and semantic analysis of the items. The approach is based on many modules that refine the rules which progressively lead to a recommendation. A process targeting users with various interests is described. First, the collaborative filtering step is achieved using association rule mining which is a flexible way to classify the user. His history is then used to make the results more adapted to him. The semantic module aims at refining the recommendation issued from the rules. Finally, a frequency module is used to discover other items of interest for the user. Using distinct modules allows us to explain the recommendations to the user The results we have obtained from the evaluation experiments are promising. The combination of the collaborative and semantic modules improves the quality of the recommendations and the frequency module adds new ones. 93,9 of the recommendations are satisfying or approved In near future, we aim at defining the approach to learn 


the user profile in order to adapt the combination of the recommendation modules. We also plan to improve the semantic module by defining the semantic similarity between instances [25], [26]. Thus, when computing the interest by instance, those which are semantically similar to the current instance can be used when the instance is not present in the users history This similarity could also be used during the personalization of the association rules. The personalization rule \(a which consists in only keeping the rules which have a body composed of items contained in the users history, can be relaxed if the items violating \(a the items in the users history. The advantage of the semantic similarity is that it can be computed off-line which does not slow down the recommendation process Another improvement we want to introduce is the use of implicit data collected and based on the users behavior e.g. his search history, the time he spent looking at an item and his navigational patterns. This will help to increase the knowledge about the user and, in turn, lead to a better understanding of his expectations Finally, we plan to experiment the framework on other domains to confirm the domain-independence of the system REFERENCES 1] G.
