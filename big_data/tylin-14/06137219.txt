Exploiting False Discoveries  Statistical Validation of Patterns and Quality Measures in Subgroup Discovery Wouter Duivesteijn Arno Knobbe LIACS Leiden University The Netherlands  wouterd,knobbe  liacs.nl Abstract Subgroup discovery suffers from the multiple comparisons problem we search through a large space hence whenever we report a set of discoveries this set will generally contain false discoveries We propose a method to compare subgroups found through subgroup discovery with a statistical 
model we build for these false discoveries We determine how much the subgroups we nd deviate from the model and hence statistically validate the found subgroups Furthermore we propose to use this subgroup validation to objectively compare quality measures used in subgroup discovery by determining how much the top subgroups we nd with each measure deviate from the statistical model generated with that measure We thus aim to determine how good individual measures are in selecting signiìcant ndings We invoke our method to experimentally compare popular quality measures in several subgroup discovery settings 
Keywords Statistical validation subgroup discovery I I NTRODUCTION Subgroup discovery 2 is a data mining frame w ork closely related to Contrast Set Mining and Emer ging Pattern Mining see also 5 concerned with disco v ering subgroups that satisfy certain user-speciìed constraints In this process we explore a large search space to nd subsets of the data that have a relatively high value for a given quality measure Because of the magnitude of the candidate set the process suffers from the multiple comparisons problem which roughly states that when considering 
a large number of candidates for a statistical hypothesis some candidates will inevitably be incorrectly labeled as passing the test Hence one of the many practical problems in subgroup discovery is that it is nontrivial to determine whether discovered subgroups are actual discoveries or false discoveries caused by random artifacts In this paper we draw upon statistical theory to build a model for false discoveries Using this model a number of practical problems in subgroup discovery can be solved When applying subgroup discovery to a dataset one is often faced with the nontrivial task of choosing the right 
parameters for the discovery algorithm in order to obtain a reasonable collection of results The problems we intend to address are related to these parameter-setting issues First of all with the gradually extending range of quality measures available for classical subgroup discovery  b ut also for non-standard v ariants such as re gression 9  and Exceptional Model Mining 11 12 the issue of selecting the right measure for the task at hand is often hard Users of discovery tools often choose the measure based on their personal familiarity or simply proceed with the default choice We aim to provide more objective guidelines for selecting the measure that is most likely to produce 
interesting and exceptional results and present empirical results that indicate an order amongst quality measures A second algorithm-tuning question we intend to address is that of setting a minimum threshold for the selected quality measure Different measures have different domains and end-users nd it hard to set a reasonable value Ideally one would like to choose a minimum quality such that all subgroups exceeding this value are reliably exceptional and do not include random results that stem from the potentially large search space and the multiple comparisons problem inherent to all disco v ery methods In other words given some desired signiìcance level 
002 typically 5 to 1 we would like to obtain the corresponding minimum quality for the measure and dataset in question As a converse but very related task one would like to compute a p-value for each reported subgroup that indicates to what extent the result is statistically signiìcant As mentioned subgroup discovery potentially suffers from the multiple comparison problem The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of a method that employs a randomization technique to build a statistical model for the false discoveries caused by the multiple comparisons problem Using this statistical model we can refute many 
insigniìcant results returned by the discovery algorithm and thus identify a set of on average more interesting subgroups Furthermore we employ the statistical validation to provide an experimental comparison of measures and propose a suitable choice of measure The article is organized as follows In Section II we recall basic subgroup discovery and give a more formal description of our problems In Section III we introduce the method used to compare found subgroups with a model for false discoveries Section IV discusses currently used

validation approaches and other related work Our method is empirically illustrated in Section V after which we interpret the results in Section VI Section VII concludes the paper with a summary II P RELIMINARIES Throughout this paper we assume a dataset 002 with N elements  data points  that are  h 1 dimensional vectors of the form x   a 1 a h 003   Hence we can view our dataset as an N   h 1 matrix where each data point is stored as a row x i 002 002  We call a i  002 a i 1 a i h 003 the attributes of x i  and 003 i its target  Attributes are taken from an unspeciìed domain A  At this point we will assume that 003 is a single value from a discrete domain which is the case in traditional subgroup discovery In Section V-C we will explore other possible target domains For our deìnition of subgroups we need to deìne patterns  Usually a pattern is created by building a conjunction of constraints on singular attributes and a data point is covered by the pattern if all constraints are satisìed Hence a pattern is an intensional description of a part of our dataset and its extension is the subgroup of records covered by the pattern For practical reasons in this paper we will technically deìne patterns to be functions p  A\003 0  1   A pattern p covers a data point x i if and only if p 004 a i 005 1  We denote the space of all patterns by P  Deìnition Subgroup A subgroup corresponding to a pattern p is the bag of data points G p 004 002 that p covers G p  002 x i 002 002 006 006 p 004 a i 005 1 003 From now on we omit the p if no confusion can arise and refer to a subgroup as G  We write n for the size of G  We can now formally deìne a quality measure Deìnition Quality measure A quality measure is a function 004 2 002 003 R which assigns to each subset of the data exactly one numeric value Notice that this deìnition may seem trivial However it implies that we allow any kind of quality measure No special properties such as antimonotonicity are required any function assigning a quality value to a subset of 002 is suitable As mentioned in the introduction subgroup discovery  is a data mining frame w ork concerned with disco v er ing subgroups that satisfy certain user-speciìed constraints These constraints usually include a lower bound on the quality of a subgroup 004  G p  005 t  as well as a minimum support threshold n 005 minsup that guarantees a lower bound on the size of the corresponding subgroup Further constraints may involve properties such as the complexity of the generating pattern p  In most cases a subgroup discovery algorithm will traverse a search lattice of candidate patterns in a top-down general-to-speciìc fashion The structure of the lattice is determined by a reìnement operator 005  P\003 2 P  a syntactic operation which determines how simple patterns can be extended into more complex ones by atomic additions In our application the reìnement operator is assumed to be a specialisation operator  006 q 002 005  p  p 007 q  p is more general than q  The actual search strategy used to consider candidates is a parameter of the algorithm We have chosen the beam search strategy because it nicely balances the beneìts of a greedy method with the implicit parallel search resulting from the beam Beam search effectively performs a levelwise search that is guided by the quality measure 004 On each level the best-ranking w patterns are reìned to form the candidates for the next level This means that although the search will be targeted it is less likely to get stuck in a local optimum because at each level alternatives are being considered The search is further bounded by complexity constraints and the minsup constraint The end-result is a ranked list of patterns each one corresponding to a subgroup that satisfy the inductive constraints Notice that while we choose to traverse the search space heuristically using beam search algorithms do exist that provably nd the global top k subgroups without resorting to a heuristic given certain restrictions Such restrictions usually compel the attribute domain to be nominal 2 or impose an anti-monotonicity property on the quality measure which is then used to prune the search space W e choose to free this paper from such restrictions but notice that this is by no means essential to the described method It would also work with an exhaustive search setting Regardless of restrictions it may very well be the case that the global top k contains subgroups that cannot be statistically validated especially if the search space is not too large Even if a run of a subgroup discovery algorithm has the goal to nd the top k subgroups there may not be k statistically valid subgroups to report and this may be of interest to the enduser Merely nding the top k is not a justiìcation of the siginiìcance of these k subgroups hence this is not enough A Problem statement As mentioned in the introduction the main contribution of this paper is a method that builds a statistical model for false discoveries This model can be used to solve a plethora of practical problems of which we will empirically illustrate two 1 given a dataset 002  a quality measure 004 and a set S of subgroups found with this measure through subgroup discovery determine the statistical signiìcance of each element of S  2 given datasets 002 1  002 t  determine which of the given quality measures 004 1 004 g are better in distinguishing the top k subgroups found with that measure from a random baseline for a given k

III V ALIDATION METHOD In order to deal with the aforementioned multiple comparisons problem we introduce a method consisting of the following steps rst we generate a random baseline model for false discoveries Then we consider a discovered subgroup statistically sound if its measure value is signiìcantly better than the random baseline Finally a quality measure is statistically sound if the best subgroups found with it are statistically sound We can express this method more formally Suppose a dataset 002  quality measures 004 1 004 g  and sets of subgroups S 1  S g where 006 g i 1  S i is found through subgroup discovery using quality measure 004 i  I 006 g i 1  use a randomization technique to generate baseline subsets R i 1 R i m 004 002 for arbitrarily large m  II 006 g i 1  build a statistical model for false discoveries based on 004 i 004 R i 1 005 004 i 004 R i m 005  Then determine for each S 002S i how much 004 i  S  deviates from the model III choose any positive integer k  and determine preference between the quality measures by comparing the deviations corresponding to the top k subgroups in S i  Since we determine the statistical soundness of quality measures in terms of their ability to deviate from a random baseline we could interpret this as a test to what extent a quality measure is also a measure for exceptionality Notice that our method does not consider the coherence of a set S of subgroups we do not solve the problem of redundancy within such a set we do not solve the problem of selecting a small subset of jointly interesting subgroups in S  we merely consider for every single subgroup in S the likelihood that it is deemed interesting because of the multiple comparisons problem The rest of this section investigates techniques for each step in the method separately A Randomization techniques There are several randomization techniques we can use to generate the baseline subsets R i 1 R i m i.e perform step I of the method We will employ the randomization technique that is currently the most popular in data mining swap randomization Recently Gionis et al have published a paper detailing its use In its most radical form for zero-one matrices swap randomization shufîes the elements of the data matrix in such a way that all row and column sums are kept intact which is what the authors of ha v e done for tests involving itemset mining Swap randomization is also frequently used for validating classiìers in a more moderate form only the column containing the class labels is replaced by a random permutation of itself For subgroup discovery it seems reasonable to use this moderate form of swap randomization We generate the baseline subsets in the following way For each R i j to be generated we create a swap-randomized version of the data by keeping all attributes intact but taking a random permutation of the target column Then we run our subgroup discovery algorithm on the resulting dataset using quality measure 004 i  and let R i j be the best subgroup found The rationale behind this process is that by swaprandomizing the target column we keep its distribution intact but remove all dependencies between the target column and the attributes Hence the best subgroup found on the swap-randomized data represents the best-quality discovery made while there is no connection between target column and other attributes apart from a connection caused by random artifacts In other words this best subgroup represents a false discovery and its quality is among the highest qualities a false discovery can have Another reason why a subgroup found on the swaprandomized data is a good representation of a false discovery is the fact that its discovery has resulted from the same search process as employed while discovering actual subgroups on the original dataset Alternatively one could easily choose a method to directly generate some random baseline subsets for use in step I of our method However a subgroup found on swap-randomized data goes through the same motions of the subgroup discovery algorithm as the actual subgroups found on the original dataset i.e the same hypothesis space is traversed the traversal is performed in the same way and the search is bounded by the same constraints Hence the generated false discovery can be reasonably considered a false discovery of the search process B Building a statistical model When we have generated the baseline subsets there are plenty of ways to build a statistical model from them i.e perform step II of the method The most straightforward technique and the simplest in terms of statistical interpretability is a direct application of the central limit theorem CLT Under the assumption that m  the number of baseline subsets is sufìciently large according to the central limit theorem the mean of 004 i 004 R i 1 005 004 i 004 R i m 005 follows a normal distribution since these are independent and identically distributed random variables We use the sample mean and standard deviation as parameters for this distribution as suggested by the method of moments We call this distribution the Distribution of False Discoveries DFD Let S 002S be a subgroup under consideration We can now formulate the null hypothesis H 0  004  S  is generated by the DFD We can compute a p-value corresponding to this null hypothesis for each S 002S  and this p-value gives us the deviation required as result of step II of the method Notice that although the null hypothesis is xed its interpretation may vary depending on the randomization technique employed in step I of the method

Using the DFD we can not only validate a found subgroup but also compute threshold values for the quality measure at given signiìcance levels prior to the actual mining run Such a threshold could be used as lower bound on the quality of a subgroup in the subgroup discovery process This is a nontrivial contribution to the process since it is generally not easy for an end-user to set a sensible lower bound for any given quality measure Additionally such sensible values for a lower bound depend heavily on the dataset at hand Until now it was common to use a default value for such a lower bound by lack of a better method the DFD gives us more sensible threshold values C Comparing quality measures For performing step III comparing the relative performance of the quality measures we use a technique recently described by Dem 031 sar in an article on statistical compar isons of classiìers over multiple data sets First a Friedman test 20 is performed to determine whether the quality measures all perform equivalently This is a non-parametric version of the repeated-measures ANOVA For each test case the quality measures are ranked by their performance if case of ties we assign average ranks Let r i denote the average rank over all test cases for quality measure 004 i  006 i 002 1 g   and let T denote the number of test cases The null hypothesis states that all measures perform similarly hence their average ranks should be equal Under this null hypothesis the Friedman statistic 006 2 F  12 T g  g 1  007 i 010 r i  g 1 2 011 2 follows a chi-squared distribution with g  1 degrees of freedom 1 If the null hypothesis of the Friedman test is rejected we can determine which quality measures are signiìcantly better than others with a post-hoc test Following Dem 031 sarês proposal we use the Nemenyi test which is similar to the Tukey test for ANOVA In this test a critical difference  CD  is computed CD  q 002 012 g  g 1 6 T where the critical values q 002 are based on the Studentized range statistic divided by 010 2  If the difference between the average ranks of two quality measures surpasses this CD  then the better-ranked measure performs signiìcantly better IV R ELATED WORK Statistical validation speciìcally tailored for subgroup discovery barely exists Fortunately many techniques for statistical validation in local pattern mining settings which 1 careful readers may notice that this formula is not the one given by Dem 031 sar It is however the one given by Friedman himself Equivalence of the formulae can be shown in four lines of math have been developed ever since association rules were invented are applicable in subgroup discovery Most of the recent approaches employ empirical p-values  i.e a pattern to be validated is assigned as p-value the fraction of randomly generated results that outperform the pattern This method has been applied in articles concerning signiìcant query results on multi-relational databases and sw ap randomization on high-dimensional 0/1 datasets In many circumstances the use of empirical p-values is very appropriate However we attempt to validate subgroups with a high quality by comparing them to random descriptions/subsets that are expected to have moderate quality Since we are trying to validate outliers in the quality measure distribution in many cases we will nd empirical p-values to be zero for many measures hence they are not very useful for comparing the measures with each other A method that assigns nonempirical p-values to single association rules has been proposed by Megiddo and Srikant  The y use random approximation techniques to assign signiìcance to single association rules and sets of associations Unfortunately their choice of underlying distribution is not motivated in any way Quality measures exist for subgroup discovery that directly implement a statistical signiìcance test For instance one can show that Kl  osgenês mean test  010 n  p  p 0   is order-equivalent to a t-test Also well suited for subgroup discovery is the chi-squared 004 006 2 005 measure originally deìned for association rules While such quality measure automatically statistically validate single subgroups their application in subgroup discovery and hence use in a vast search space will invariably suffer from the multiple comparison problem and hence the results will fall prey to the problem we attempt to solve in this paper Tan et al have developed a method to compare quality measures on contigency tables by intrinsic properties The results this method delivers are somewhat inconclusive hence the method relies on experts to decide which measure is to be preferred Also the method seems not to be extendable beyond k way contingency tables Finally Webb devised a procedure to assign signiìcance to individual subgroups He gi v es tw o dif ferent w ays to perform a Bonferroni-style adjustment to the signiìcance level direct adjustment and an approach that is very similar to the train-and-test-set procedure known from the determination of the predictive accuracy of a classiìer As is typical for Bonferroni correction the adjustments may be a bit too strict This especially holds when the search space becomes very large for instance when dealing with numeric attributes When applying a Bonferroni correction one assumes that the different hypotheses are independent which in a subgroup discovery setting is not the case leading to too strict adjustments to the signiìcance level Also rather than a method that assigns signiìcance to subgroups Webbês work is more a framework that can be used with

any statistical hypothesis test V E XPERIMENTS To illustrate how our method performs we experimented on several UCI datasets For the subgroup discovery process we use the parameterized implementation available in the Cortana discovery package This Ja v a implementation is an open-source spin-off of the Safarii Data Mining system Although we have so far stated our problems and method in terms of subgroup discovery with only one discrete target this is by no means essential to the method In fact it can be applied to any local pattern discovery technique We illustrate this by applying our method not only to traditional subgroup discovery but also to an instance of Exceptional Model Mining EMM an e xtension of subgroup discovery incorporating more complex target concepts Whereas in traditional subgroup discovery there is only one target attribute 003  in EMM the target concept may consist of multiple attributes EMM is instantiated by choosing a model class over these attributes and deìning a quality measure for this model class For instance one could be interested in nding conditions under which there is an exceptional ratio between two designated features Then the chosen model class would be a simple linear regression model and the quality measure would be based on the slope of the tted regression line This particular EMM instance would given a dataset detailing the sales price of houses and their lot size allow one to nd conditions under which a set of houses has a relatively high price per square meter Both EMM and subgroup discovery are supervised settings but nothing in the method requires this so we could also apply it in unsupervised settings such as association discovery We test our method on traditional subgroup discovery in Sections V-A and V-B and on the EMM variant in Section V-C We pick the following parameters for the beam search process On each level we select the w 25 best patterns and reìne these to create the candidate patterns for the next level This beam width w creates a balance between redundancy in the reported patterns and search efìciency on the one hand and search extensiveness on the other hand When reìning a pattern by adding a constraint on a numeric attribute we partition the domain into eight equal-height intervals and consider inequalities on these dynamically allocated split points as the reìning constraints To bound the complexity of the patterns we use a search depth of d 3 at most three reìnements We let minsup  013 N 10 014  i.e a pattern must be covered by at least 10 of the dataset These parameter settings are somewhat arbitrary we believe that this is not really relevant for the purpose of demonstrating our new method Notice that the dynamic partition of a numeric attribute into eight intervals uses more information from the attribute than the information we would use if we would statically Table I UCI DATA SETS USED FOR THE EXPERIMENTS  Dataset N  attributes  002  discrete numeric 1 Adult 48842

level one the dynamic partition amounts to static discretization On search level two however we start with candidate subgroups that have seven different sizes the eighth possibility is not a proper reìnement Each of these is reìned by dynamically partitioning into eight intervals leading to 49 different possibilities to start with on search level three etcetera Hence the used information is much more than the information used when statically discretizing The 20 datasets we have used for our tests with traditional subgroup discovery in the following two sections can be found in the UCI Machine Learning Repository T able I contains details on the datasets considered Here  003  denotes the number of distinct target values in the dataset Before experimenting with the method let us shortly substantiate the claim made in the previous section that empirical p-values are not very suitable in our setting Figure 1 displays a histogram represented by the twitchy line of qualities of 1000 random subsets on the CMC dataset with target value no-use  normalized into Z-space i.e a subset has value one on the x axis in the histogram when its quality is one standard deviation higher than the sample mean The gure also contains our CLT-based normal model tted to the random qualities represented by the smooth curve and the 13 subgroups represented by circles on the x-axis found using a very shallow search of d 1  The rightmost nonzero value of the histogram occurs at x 4  hence all subgroups to the right of that point are indistinguishable by empirical p-values The normal distribution never becomes zero hence does not suffer from this problem

158 


 WRAcc  now also perform signiìcantly better than Conìdence and Speciìcity is now additionally outperformed by the F-measure and WRAcc while it no longer performs signiìcantly better than Purity Finally Correlation signiìcantly outperforms Conìdence Obviously some measures might be better than others in distinguishing the top k subgroups from false discoveries when k 1  while others might be better when k  100  The observed changes are not very dramatic and we consider the selection of k a user-derived parameter in the method One of the signiìcant relations that seems somewhat peculiar is the result that for both k 1 and k  100  Conìdence performs signiìcantly better than Purity while the latter is deìned to be max  Conìdence  1  Conìdence   While there is a good theoretical reason to consider the Purity of a subgroup we can see from the deìnition that Purity has a lower bound of 0  5  hence the random baseline will generate higher values with Purity than with Conìdence Apparently the quality of the subgroups found with Purity does not increase enough compared to those found with Conìdence to compensate for this effect By comparing the second and third columns of Table III with the last two columns we can see that  WRAcc   WRAcc and particularly Purity perform better when we restrict the tests to datasets with a binary target These measures beneìt from the fact that in these test cases we have a better balance between positive and negative examples in the data compared to test cases on other datasets We can also read from the table that we have fewer measures that are signiìcantly better than others on datasets with a binary target This is mainly because because signiìcance is hard to achieve in an experiment with only 18 test cases as opposed to 85 or 78 on all datasets With 18 test cases the critical difference for the Nemenyi test with signiìcance level 002 1 is CD 4  496  rather than CD 2  069 with 85 test cases Since the average ranks range from 1 to 12  a critical difference of 4  496 is substantial More signiìcant differences between the quality measures can be expected when tested on more datasets with a binary target The results for the EMM variant were generated on a modest number of test cases As a result the critical difference for the Nemenyi test is quite high and one could not expect to nd many signiìcant results Expensive experimentation may give a signiìcant reason to prefer one measure over another in this setting For now what matters is that this illustrates that our method is applicable in more general settings than just traditional subgroup discovery VII C ONCLUSIONS We propose a method that deals with the multiple comparisons problem in subgroup discovery i.e the problem that when exploring a vast search space one basically considers many candidates for a statistical hypothesis hence one will inevitably incorrectly label some candidates as passing the test Our method tackles this problem by building a statistical model for the false discoveries the Distribution of False Discoveries DFD This distribution is generated by given a dataset and quality measure repeatedly running a subgroup discovery algorithm on a swap-randomized version of the data In this swap-randomized version while the distribution of the target variable is maintained its correlation with the attributes is destroyed Hence the best subgroup discovered on this dataset represents a false discovery The DFD is then determined by applying the central limit theorem to the qualities of these false discoveries Having determined the DFD one can solve many practical problems prevalent in subgroup discovery For any given discovered subgroup one can determine a p-value corresponding to the null hypothesis that it is generated by the DFD refuting this null hypothesis implies that the subgroup is not a false discovery Given a set of quality measures one can use the DFD to determine which quality measures are better than others in distinguishing the top k subgroups from false discoveries This gives an objective criterion for selecting a quality measure that is more likely to produce exceptional results Finally given some desired signiìcance level 002  one could extract from the DFD a minimum threshold for the quality measure at hand When validating single subgroups we see that our method removes insigniìcant subgroups found on datasets that have few numeric attributes From metalearning we nd that on large datasets for instance with more than ve numeric attributes the random baseline is more likely to accept many patterns This is reasonable because of the associated larger hypothesis space Table II shows that our method can remove insiginìcant subgroups on some of the datasets with more than ve numeric attributes but not on all of them When we validate quality measures we have outlined that the method we described determines the extent to which a quality measure is also an exceptionality measure We have seen that of the twelve measures for subgroup discovery we tested 006 2 is the best exceptionality measure and Purity and Sensitivity are by far the worst For the EMM correlation model variant no signiìcant conclusions can be drawn from the modest experiments In this paper we have presented a technique making extensive use of swap randomization Notice that we do not by any means claim to have invented this particular randomization method Also its use in step I of the method we introduced in this paper is not the only option available We have extensively explained why using swap randomized data leads to a good model for false discoveries but it comes at a price for every result of a subgroup discovery run one wishes to validate one has to run the same subgroup discovery algorithm an additional m times where m needs to be large enough to satisfy the constraints of the Central Limit Theorem In the more traditional subgroup discovery setting one can usually afford this extra computation time 
159 


For more complex settings for instance the EMM variant using Bayesian networks introduced in this becomes problematic When computation time becomes an issue one might consider different randomization techniques to generate R 1 R m  for instance by simply drawing a random sample from 002 of a certain size for each R i  Before such a technique can be employed its theoretical ramiìcations need to be explored In future work we also plan to empirically investigate the effect of certain parameters on the outcome of the method A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research is nancially supported by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientiìc Research NWO under project number 612  065  822 Exceptional Model Mining R EFERENCES  J Friedman N Fisher  Bump-Hunting in High-Dimensional Data Statistics and Computing 9\(2 pp 123Ö143 1999  W  Kl  osgen Subgroup Discovery Handbook of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery ch 16.3 Oxford University Press New York 2002  S D Bay  M J P azzani Detecting group dif ferences Mining contrast sets Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 5\(2 pp 213Ö246 2001  G Dong J Li Ef cient mining of emer ging patterns Discovering trends and differences Proc KDD pp 43Ö52 1999  P  Kralj No v a k N La vra 031 c G I Webb Supervised Descriptive Rule Discovery A Unifying Survey of Contrast Set Emerging Pattern and Subgroup Mining Journal of Machine Learning Research 10 pp 377Ö403 2009  Y  Hochber g A T amhane Multiple Comparison Procedures Wiley New York 1987  J F  urnkranz P A Flach ROC n Rule Learning  Towards a Better Understanding of Covering Algorithms Machine Learning 58 1 pp 39-77 2005  N La vra 031 c P Flach B Kav 031 sek and L Todorovski Rule induction for subgroup discovery with CN2-SD Proc ECML/PKDD 2002  H Grosskreutz Cascaded subgroups disco v ery with an application to regression Proc ECML/PKDD 2008  B F  I Pieters A Knobbe S D 031 zeroski Subgroup Discovery in Ranked Data with an Application to Gene Set Enrichment Proc Preference Learning workshop PL2010 at ECML PKDD 2010  W  Dui v esteijn A Knobbe A Feelders M v an Leeuwen Subgroup Discovery meets Bayesian networks an Exceptional Model Mining approach Proc ICDM pp 158Ö167 2010  D Leman A Feelders A Knobbe Exceptional Model Mining Proc ECML/PKDD Part II pp 1Ö16 2008  Y  H Xu A Fern On Learning Linear Ranking Functions for Beam Search Proc ICML 2007 ACM International Conference Proceeding Series vol 227 pp 1047Ö1054 ACM New York  H Grosskreutz S R  uping On Subgroup Discovery in Numerical Domains Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 19\(2 pp 210Ö226 2009  A Gionis H Mannila T  Mielik  ainen P Tsarapas Assessing data mining results via swap randomization Proc KDD pp 167Ö176  2006  A M L yapuno v  Nouv elle forme du th  eor  eme sur la limite de probabilit  e St Petersburg 1901  K Pearson L Filon Mathematical contrib utions to the theory of evolution iv on the probable errors of frequency constants and on the inîuence of random selection on variation and correlation Phil Trans A 191 pp 229Ö311 1898  J Dem 031 sar Statistical Comparisons of Classiìers over Multiple Data Sets Journal of Machine Learning Research 7 pp 1Ö30 2006  M Friedman The use of ranks to a v oid the assumption of normality implicit in the analysis of variance Journal of the American Statistical Association 32 pp 675Ö701 1937  M Friedman A comparison of alternati v e tests of signiìcance for the problem of m rankings Annals of Mathematical Statistics 11 pp 86Ö92 1940  P  B Nemen yi Distrib ution-free multiple comparisons PhD thesis Princeton University 1963  M Ojala G C Garriga A Gionis H Mannila Ev aluating Query Result Signiìcance in Databases via Randomizations Proc SDM pp 906Ö917 2010  N Me giddo R Srikant Disco v ering Predicti v e Association Rules Proc KDD pp 274Ö278 1998  W  Kl  osgen Explora A multipattern and multistrategy discovery assistent Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining pp 249-271 1996  C Silv erstein S Brin R Motw ani Be yond Mark et Bask ets Generalizing Association Rules to Dependence Rules Data Min Knowl Discov 2 1 pp 39Ö68 1998  P N T an V  K umar  J Sri v asta v a Selecting the right inter estingness measure for association patterns Proc KDD pp 32Ö41 2002  G I W ebb Disco v ering Signiìcant P atterns Machine Learning 68 1 pp 1Ö33 2007  M Meeng A J Knobbe Fle xible Enrichment with Cortana  Software Demo Proc Benelearn pp 117Ö119 2011  D Ne wman S Hettich C Blak e C Merz UCI repository of machine learning databases 1998

cc ur ac y   Fig. 4. Accuracy for Model-based clustering and rule-based classification Fig. 5. Distribution of flow attributes in scatter plot matrix In Fig.5, the distribution of IP and ports for source and destination is depicted for Model-based clustering method. For HTTP \(blue traffic to few destination IPs. HTTP behavior is prominent because a number of source hosts are communicating with small number of destination hosts, i.e., HTTP servers. In DNS application, source hosts communicate with a set of DNS servers. Each host interacts with different domains such as www, .org and .net for resolving IP addresses. The DNS behavior is prominent because large group of source hosts communicate with small repeated set of destination IPs. In the IRC application, a group of hosts communicates with other group of hosts. There is roughly one-to-one correspondence between source and destination IP. This behavior is prominent because IRC \(cross with approximately equal number of destination IPs. Moreover, source IP and destination port distribution show that destination port numbers are in the range of 30000 for SMTP green where as HTTP and MAIL have destination ports number in lower range of 1000. Model-based clustering with the Apriori algorithm provides reliable and accurate classification model as compared to K-mean method. The association rules helps us predict flows for particular application with high confidence and lift values IV. CONCLUSION In conclusion, we have presented a classification model that achieves high flow classification accuracy with application behavior profiling. The use of the K-mean algorithm for Netflow classification was shown to be inefficient. On the other hand, Model based clustering with association rule mining techniques provided a much better accuracy. Moreover the rule heuristics are produced automatically, making the algorithm modular and independent of the dataset. In addition

denote the input attribute with the minimum integrated cost after the split, and let the set of allocated sample sizes, computed by the sample allocation method explained later, be ASM . Then DM | children are generated for the node M . For each child CHi, i = 1, . . . , |DM |, the associated query is QN ?{M = mi sample size is asi ? ASM , and potential splitting attributes is PSN ? M . The process of splitting is then recursively applied to children of node N In the process of calculating costs during the strati?cation process, we need to perform sample allocation, i.e., divide the parent nodes sample size among the potential children nodes This is required for calculating the integrated cost for the potential split. This is based on our sample allocation method, which we 328 describe next in Section IV-B. Furthermore, for calculating the integrated cost, the variance of target value ?2i and probability of output attribute A = a, ?i, for each stratum is computed based on the pilot sample Initially, the strati?cation process on the query space begins by calling Stratification\(R, null, F IA, n, null root node. The process of strati?cation would stop if there is no leaf node with integrated cost larger than a prede?ned threshold Each leaf node in the tree is a ?nal stratum for sampling, and the associated sample size denotes the number of data records drawn from the subpopulation of the stratum B. An Optimized Sample Allocation Method Now, we introduce our optimized algorithm for sample allocation which integrates variance reduction and sampling cost As introduced in section IV-A, integrated cost is de?ned by taking into account of variance of estimation and sampling cost The goal of our sample allocation algorithm is to minimize the integrated cost by choosing the sample size, ni, for each stratum In our algorithm, we adjust the value of SampCost and ?2s so that their in?uences on the integrated cost are in the same unit SampCost SampCost SmpCost\(r where SmpCost\(r entire population, and ?r denotes the probability of A = a being true for the entire population 2 2s 


2r where ?2r 2 n denotes the variance of estimation of the target value on the entire population The key constraint on the values of the sample sizes for each strata is that their sum should be equal to the total sample size A vector n = {n1, n2, . . . , nH} is used to represent the sample sizes, where the ith element, ni, is the sample size for the ith stratum By including sampling cost and variance of estimation into the integrated cost, our sample size determination task leads to the following optimization problem Minimize Cost\(n  i\(?s ni i v N2i niN2 2 i subject to  i ni = n 6 where Ni denotes the population size of data records under the space of A = a in ith stratum. Note that this value may not be known if A is an output attribute. However, the total number of records in the ith stratum is typically known, and can be denoted as DNi. Then Ni can be estimated by ?iDNi, and the population size of A = a on the entire population is estimated by N  i ?i DNi For ?nding the minimum of integrated cost, we utilize Lagrange multipliers, a well know optimization method. Lagrange multipliers aims at ?nding the extrema of a function object to constraints. Using this approach, a new variable ? called a Lagrange multiplier is introduced and de?ned by n n  


 i ni ? n If n is a minimum solution for the original constrained problem then there exists a ? such that \(n Lagrange function. Stationary points are those points where the partial derivatives of ?\(n n,??\(n 7 In our problem, by conducting partial derivatives on Formula 7 a group of equations are yielded as follows s i v N 2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? = 0 i = 1, ..H i ni = n 8 where the solution n leads to the minimum value of integrated cost in Formula 5 However, it is dif?cult to solve the group of equations directly Thus, we use numerical analysis to approximate the real solution. Newtons method is utilized for ?nding successively better approximations to the zeroes \(or roots Given an equation f\(x x tive of function f\(x method iteratively provides, xt+1, a better approximation of the root, based on xt, the previous approximation of root according to the following formula xt+1 = xt ? f\(xt f ?\(xt The iteration is repeated until a suf?ciently accurate value is reached, i.g. |f\(xt In our problem of Formula 8, there are H + 1 equations F \(xt xt xt n1, .., nH , ?}, where the equations in F \(xt fi\(xt s i v N 


2 i n2iN2 2 i + ? i = 1, .., H fH+1\(xt  i ni ? n The Newtons method is also applied iteratively via the system of linear equations JF \(xt xt+1 ? xt xt 9 where JF \(xt H + 1 H + 1 equation system F \(xt vector xt. The entry JF \(i, j d\(fi\(x dxj where fi\(x xt x From the Expression 9, a better approximation xt+1 is obtained based on previous approximation xt. The iterative procedure would be stopped if ?i|fi\(xt threshold, and then the sample size ni is allocated for each stratum so that the integrated cost is minimized. In reality, we are required to pick an integral number of records from each stratum during the sampling step. Thus, we round down each ni to its nearest integer, ni + 0.5 In the example shown in Table I, suppose we set both weights v and ?s to be 0.5. Further, assume the variance of the entire population, ?2r , to be 80000. The probability of A = a over the entire population ?r is 0.242. By using the proposed optimized sample allocation method, the sample sizes for the three strata 329 are 162, 299, and 139, respectively. In this case, the variance of estimation according to the Expression 2 is 93.66, and the estimated cost is 1943.7. We can see that, compared with Neyman allocation, the sampling cost is decreased by 42.1%, but results some increase in variance. Overall, this example shows that we can achieve lower sampling cost by trading off some accuracy C.

EVALUATION STUDY We evaluate our sampling methods for association mining and differential rule mining on the deep web using two datasets described below US Census data set: This is a 9-attribute real-life data set obtained from the 2008 US Census on the income of US households. This data set contains 40,000 data records with 7 categorical attributes about the race, age, and education level of the husband and wife of each household and 2 numerical attributes about the incomes of husband and wife 


Yahoo! data set: The Yahoo! data set, which consists of the data crawled from a subset of a real-world hidden database at http://autos.yahoo.com/. Particularly, we download the data on used cars located within 50 miles of a zipcode address. This yields 30,000 data records. The data consists of 7-attribute with 6 categorical attributes about the age, mileage, brand, etc, of the cars and one numerical attribute, which is the price of the car Variance of Estimation is estimated for the target value \(i.e mean value in differential rule mining, and con?dence in association rule mining is calculated according to the Expression 2. Since variance of estimation reveals the variation of the estimated value from the true value, smaller variance suggests better estimation Sampling Cost is estimated by the number of queries submitted to data sources in order to acquire a certain number of data records containing target output attributes, i.e. A = a. Larger sample size implies higher sampling costs in a deep web setting where the queries are executed over the internet Estimate accuracy is estimated by Absolute Error Rate \(AER Small AER value indicates higher accuracy. For an estimator on variable Y with true value y and estimated value y, the AER of the estimator is calculated by AER\(y A. Association Rule Mining In this section, we present the results of our method for association rule mining. Using our overall approach, we have created four different versions, which correspond to four different sets of weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling costs. 1 the weight ?v = 1.0 and ?s = 0.0, 2 the weight ?v = 0.7 and ?s = 0.3, 3 v = 0.5 and ?s = 0.5, and 4 weights ?v = 0.3 and ?s = 0.7. In addition, we also compare these approaches with a simple random sampling method, which is denoted by Random We focus on the queries in the form of A = a ? B = b where A and B are output categorical attributes. Other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes Our goal is to estimate Supp\(A=a,B=b A=a association rules are randomly selected from the datasets. Each of the 50 association rules are re-processed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations result is the average result for 5000 executions 


In all charts reported in this section, the X-axis is k, which denotes the size of sample under the space of a target rule drawn from deep web. The sample size for each point on X-axis is k x, where x is a ?xed value for our experiment, and depends upon the dataset. At each time, queries are issued to obtain kx data records under the space of a target rule. Overall, all our experiments show the variance of estimation, sampling costs and sampling accuracy with varying sample size Figure 1 shows the result from our strati?ed sample methods on the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, from which all of the 50 initial rules are derived. In this experiment the ?xed value x is set to be 300, which means the smallest sample size at k = 1 is 300, and the largest sample size at k 10 is 3000. Figure 1 a the ?ve sampling procedures.

 9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG c Fig. 1. Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Association Rule Mining on US Census Dataset estimation and sampling cost for the sampling procedures var7 var5, var3, and rand are normalized by the corresponding values of Full Var. Thus, in our experiment, the values of sampling cost and variance of estimation for sampling procedure Full Var are all 1. Furthermore, Figure 1 c sampling procedures From Figure 1 a pared with sampling procedures Var7, Var5 and Var3, Full Var has the lowest estimation variance and the highest sampling cost. From sampling procedures Var7, Var5, and Var3, we can see a pattern that the variance of estimation increases, and the sampling cost decreases consistently with the decrease of the weight for variance of estimation. At the largest sample size of k = 10, the estimation variance of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 27% and the sampling cost is decreased by 40 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. The experiment shows that our method decreases the sampling cost ef?ciently by trading off a percent of variance of estimation. Similar to variance of estimation, the sampling accuracy of these procedures also decreases with the decrease of the weight on variance of estimation. For the largest sample size at k = 10, we can see that the AER of sampling procedure Var3 is increased by 20 compared with sampling procedure Full Var. However, for many users, increase of the AER will be acceptable, since the sampling cost is decreased by 40%. By setting the weights for sampling variance and sampling cost, users would be able to control the trade-off between the variance of estimation, sampling cost, and estimation accuracy In addition, compared with sampling procedure of Full Var Var7, Var5, and Var3, sampling procedure Random, has higher estimation of variance, sampling cost and lower estimation accuracy. Thus, our approach clearly results in more effective methods than using simple random sampling for data mining on the deep web Figure 2 shows the experiment result of our proposed strati?ed 


sampling methods on the Yahoo! data set. The size of pilot sample on this data set is 2,000, and the ?xed value x for sample size is 200. The results are similar to those from the US census dataset. We can still see the pattern of the variance of estimation increasing with the decrease of its weight. Besides, the sampling accuracy is also similar to the variance of estimation. However although the variance estimation of sampling procedure Random is 60% larger than sampling procedure Full Var, the sampling cost of Random is 2% smaller than Full Var. This is because Full Var does not consider sampling cost. It is possible that Full Var assigns a large sample to a stratum with low ?, which denotes the probability of containing data records under the space of A = a, resulting the larger sampling cost than that of simple random sampling. Sampling procedures Var7, Var5, Var3 consider sampling cost as well, and have smaller variance estimation and sampling cost, compared with Random. Furthermore, Random has smaller sampling accuracy than Full Var, Var7 and Var5, but has larger sampling accuracy than Var3. This is because Var3 assigns much more importance to the sampling cost, and loses accuracy to a large extent To summarize, our results shows that our proposed strati?ed sampling are clearly more effective than simple random sampling on the deep web. Moreover, our approach allows users to tradeoff variance of estimation and sampling accuracy to some extent while achieving a large reduction in sampling costs B. Differential Rule Mining In this section, we present results from experiments based on differential rule mining. Particularly, we look at the rules of the form A = a ? D1\(t t categorical attribute and t is an output numerical attribute, while other categorical attributes in the data set are considered as input attributes In this experiment, we also evaluate our proposed method with different weights assigned to variance of estimation and sampling cost. Five sampling procedures, Full Var, Var7, Var5,Var3 and Random, have same meanings with those in the experiments of association rule mining. Similarly, 50 rules are randomly selected from the datasets, and each of the 50 differential rules are reprocessed 100 times using 100 different \(pilot sample, sample iterations 5000 runs First, we evaluated the performance of these procedures on 


the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment. Figure 3 shows the performance of the 5 sampling 331 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH             9D UL DQ FH R I V WL PD WL RQ  9DU 9DU 9DU 5DQG a timation 6DPSOLQJ&RVW

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
