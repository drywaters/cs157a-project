found then a penalty of 0 is applied These 0s directly reduce the similarity value During this loop the number of evaluated links is counted The nal step penalises leftover rules that were not used in the previous step From the starting workload r 1 all leftover links are penalised by adding 0s to the result set as counted from the number of previously evaluated links Any leftover links from workload r 2 are also directly penalised by adding 0s to the result set The method nishes with a list of relative dierences and penalties The algorithm returns with the similarity measure m a  r 1 r 2   mean  final ycalculating the arithmetic mean over all elements in the multi-set 4.3 Evaluation We evaluate the association rule method with two synthetic data sets each having 5 descriptive attributes 4.3.1 Methodology Again each data set is split into 8 distinct segments that are compared to each other yielding a sample size of 28 comparisons For one data set the workloads are created with round-robin selection of 1024 distinct values for each attribute per segment repeated 2 16 times This creation guarantees that dependencies stay consistent and should result in m a  1 by the association rule method The other data set selects uniformly distributed random values between 0 and 1024 for each attribute repeated 2 16 times Random data provides the practical lower limit of the method Again the evaluation of the method is subject to random number generation as mentioned in section 3 4.3.2 Results As expected the association rules found in the roundrobin workload scored a similarity value of m a 1 The method thus is able to nd consistent repeatable behaviour perfectly On the random uniform workload though the method scored a similarity value of m a 0 Avalueof0 was slightly unexpected because we assumed uniform random data to produce at least some usable rules However the apriori algorithm did not consider any of the random attribute dependencies as frequent enough Once we reduced the number of distinct values from 1024 to only 16 the apriori algorithm was able to nd 3 to 5 rules This reduction resulted in a low similarity value of m a 0  13 However note that xed values for support and con“dence are responsible for this result As we see later this problem does not exist in large-scale workloads as the possible permutations of attributes and events produce a much larger sample space As we are not aware of any other method that automatically quanti“es the dependencies of association rules we have no ground truth or competitors against which we can compare our methods eectiveness With a practical result of 0  13  m a  1 we are quite con“dent that the method is applicable to many workloads because it covers the possible range of similarity values to a high degree Nevertheless while the association rule measure on its own is not a good choice for a similarity measure it does play the key role in improving the results attainable by our wavelet method 5 COMPOUND MEASURE We combine the wavelet measure and the association rule measure into a compound measure and evaluate its accuracy on operational workloads and with a hypothesis test 5.1 Combining the two methods The combination is based on the concept of transfer functions  where outputs of one measure are weighted according to the outputs of another measure This was shown to be superior to simple linear combinations of measures  I n our case we de“ne our transfer function to weight the coef“cients of the wavelet transform before the intermediary result is calculated The idea is that coecients that involve events with attributes from the association rule measure should be weighted according to the in”uence of the attribute Finding these events is trivial because the length of the wavelet is given and the involved attributes were already found via the association rule measure A simple match on event and attribute can thus trigger the weighting and use the weighting value of an attribute f attribute  final  m a  t 1 DWT X 1 w min l 1 l 2   f attribute t 2 DWT X 2 w min l 1 l 2   f attribute 5 These t 1 t 2 arethenusedinsteadof x 1 x 2 to nish the wavelet method calculation However we call this result then our compound similarity measure 0 m 1

965519 7 24 hours Table 1 Overview of the GWA and DQ2 workloads 5.2 Methodology We evaluate the accuracies of all methods against two scheduling metrics mean waiting time and mean execution time  The premise of this evaluation is as follows if input workloads are similar then the performance metrics that evaluate the output of the system that is executing the workloads should be similar as well An elegant way of doing that is to use scheduling metrics b ecause they can b e principal targets for performance optimisation in a system Two workloads that produce the same waiting times or the same execution times can be considered similar in performance evaluation Many more dierent scheduling metrics can be used if necessary e.g mean resource utilisation or link throughput but for this evaluation we narrow ourselves to mean waiting time  W andmeanexecutiontime  E  The objective is to minimise the error between a similarity measure and the output metrics For example two workloads that dier by 0.3 in their relative waiting times should also yield a similarity value of 0.3 The normalised errors between two workloads w 1 w 2 are thus error  W   similarity w 1 w 2      W w 1   W w 2    error  E   similarity w 1 w 2      E w 1   E w 2    6 We use all the available workloads provided by the Grid Workloads Archive GWA  as w e ll as a w orkload from DQ2  T he GW A w orkloads a re pro vided i n a common trace format for the following large-scale distributed systems AuverGrid Distributed ASCI Supercomputer 2 DAS2 Grid5000 LHC Computing Grid LCG NorduGrid and SHARCNET These workloads all stem from scienti“c computational traces DQ2 workload stems from scienti“c distributed data management traces N ote t hat D Q2 uses LCG resources but its traces are sampled independently and separately from the LCG traces in the GWA Table 1 gives an overview of the contents of the data sets that store the workload It shows the number of events the number of attributes and the segments per data set DQ2 generates as many events in one third of a single day as the other systems in multiple years It is because of this imbalance that we decided to keep the number of events roughly equivalent and not the actual time spent in the workload Note that the actual number of events is not relevant because the association rule method will only consider the most important constituent events and attributes Additionally the original workload traces contained many dierent attributes but we are only using attributes with a cardinality greater than one i.e multiple dierent values of the attribute are used throughout the workload The inclusion of attributes that stay constant during the workload would yield no additional information to the attribute analysis i.e trivial association rules and such information could be modelled statically anyway The apriori algorithm thus takes care of selecting proper attributes and events and the analyst does not need to select sets of attributes manually Lastly we only use attributes that are part of the workload de“nition e.g submission time or user identi“cation  We are not using output attributes like completion time because they are not part of the workload they are the result of the workload being executed by the system We split each data set into distinct segments that we compare against each other thus yielding sample sizes between 55 and 703 comparisons depending on the number of intervals in each workload In total there are 1874 possible permutations Each workload segment is then separated into two distinct parts a time series signal for the submission time attribute and a list of attribute tuples from descriptive attributes The time series signal is created by aggregating the count of submission times in the workload into cells appropriate for the workload We chose hourly daily and monthly cells as indicated in table 1 with the corresponding number of segments We obtain all possible error  W and error  E by calculating all similarity measures as well as  W  E for all segments in the workloads from the GWA that have this information This includes AuverGrid DAS-2 Grid5000 SHARCNET In DQ2 workload the  W  E are staging and transfer times respectively and are calculated in exactly the same way 5.3 Results Figure 5 shows the error results over all evaluated workloads Figure 5a focuses on the errors of all methods against  W  There the compound measure is more accurate than all competing methods The interesting observation is that both constituent methods have a higher error but their combination as a compound measure reduces error drastically Especially the association rule measure cannot be used on its own Against the best case i.e the moving average the improvement in accuracy is 12.2 Against the worst case i.e the discrete Fourier transform the improvement is 24.5 This shows how the inclusion of a method for descriptive attributes is highly relevant in addition to time-dependent attributes and should not be ignored The wavelet method however is responsible for reducing standard deviation between 4.6 and 10.4 showing the advantage of a multi-resolution approximation free approach Figure 5b focuses on the errors of all methods against  E  Here the improvement in accuracy for the compound method is only 3.8 against the best case i.e again the moving average and 20.8 against the worst case i.e the Kalman lter Also the improvement in standard deviation is slightly less with 0.3 to 7.6 It is interesting though that the ltering methods also have a slight advantage in this case We have the following explanation for these results The waiting time is largely dependent on the number of already existing events in a system Therefore the speci“cs of a new event are important for its proper scheduling e.g which resource to use These speci“cs are stored in the descriptive attributes and can be found by the association rule method Like a scheduler uses this additional information to make an informed choice where and when to execute the event so does the association rule method evaluate the importance of the attributes This is less obvious for the execution time

ing work because the approach is free from any assumptions on the structure of the attribute and does not have to rely on statistical approximations We evaluate the approach using two synthetic data sets to establish the upper and lower bounds of the covered similarity space We nd that we can cover the whole similarity space and that we are only constrained by the random number generation To validate the method against this constraint we investigate the speci“c in”uence of the random number generation by using the method as a test of randomness Additionally operational systems usually exhibit large amounts of noise in their workload therefore we validate the method against noise as well Our ndings show that it is highly resistant to noise whereas other commonly employed methods yield to the law of large numbers or fail completely Additionally the method can consistently identify dissimilar behaviour as well even though it is not as good at that task which is only partially true for other commonly employed methods The second method uses association rule analysis to identify and quantify the relationship between descriptive attributes of the workload The novel idea of this approach is to eliminate the use of values and instead focus on the attributes themselves and therefore rank the relative usage of the attribute That way the most important building blocks of the workload can be compared directly The algorithm is described and then evaluated using synthetic data sets to establish the upper and lower bounds of the covered similarity space This time we nd that we are only constrained by the amount of learnt rules which follows from the used rule learning algorithm At least 16 rules need to be available to cover the whole similarity space when the apriori algorithm is used The method itself however does not require a speci“c rule learning algorithm We then present our compound measure that can address problematic workload characteristics We use the transfer function concept to weight speci“c events in the waveletmethod based on relative attribute dependencies Then we conduct an empirical study to evaluate all methods on operational workload from seven large-scale distributed systems Two important characteristics stand out First the time and frequency behaviour is surprisingly well-modelled with a wavelet method Second the association rule by itself is seemingly useless However the inclusion of descriptive attributes improves accuracy when determining similarity of workloads We show that the compound measure improves upon existing work by evaluating it against two important scheduling metrics mean waiting time and mean execution time The analysis of descriptive attributes for the similarity in addition to the analysis of the time-dependent attribute yields a compound similarity measure that can improve accuracy by 24.5 At the same time the standard deviation can be reduced by 10.4 We con“rm these results with an independent statistical hypothesis test a twosample Anderson-Darling statistic and show the advantage of the compound measure even at higher signi“cance levels of  0  125 with only 11 dierence Our results strongly reassure our initial expectations that the compound measure is a good choice for large-scale and data-intensive systems that have to deal with enormous amounts of events and previously unknown dependencies in their workload Furthermore even though we only used scienti“c workloads in our evaluations we did not observe any constraint that would limit the use to scienti“c workloads 7 FUTURE WORK As a result of this work we can continue to evolve our simulation eort for DQ2 We will use the similarity measure to evaluate the results of our future workload models to speci“cally address problems like data transfer cycles distributed le caching or popularity-based deletion However the measure can still be improved If it is suspected that dependencies change over time then the rate of change needs to be investigated Extending the association rule measure with time-evolving graphs may prove to be appropriate for such cases Additionally we only used the Haar wavelet as suggested by previous work We are interested in investigating the in”uence of dierent types of wavelets on the analysis of non-periodic burst behaviour An implementation of the similarity measure including already pre-processed versions of the used workloads from the evaluation can be downloaded from our website  8 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are grateful to the following teams for providing

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
