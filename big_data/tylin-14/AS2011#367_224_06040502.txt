Exploiting Additional Dimensions as Virtual Items on Top-N Recommender Systems Marcos Aur  elio Domingues INESC Porto Faculty of Science U Porto Porto Portugal marcos.a.domingues@inescporto.pt Al  pio M  ario Jorge LIAAD-INESC Porto L.A DCC-FCUP U Porto Porto Portugal amjorge@fc.up.pt Carlos Soares LIAAD-INESC Porto L.A Faculty of Economics U Porto Porto Portugal csoares@fep.up.pt Abstract Traditionally recommender systems for the web deal with applications that have two dimensions users and items Based on access data that relate these dimensions a recommendation model can be built and used to identify a set of N items that will be of interest to a certain user In this paper we propose a multidimensional approach called DaVI  Dimensions as Virtual Items  that enables the use of 
common two-dimensional topN recommender algorithms for the generation of recommendations using additional dimensions e.g contextual or background information We empirically evaluate our approach with two different topN recommender algorithms Item-based Collaborative Filtering and Association Rules based on two real world data sets The empirical results demonstrate that DaVI enables the application of existing twodimensional recommendation algorithms to exploit the useful information in multidimensional data Keywords Recommender systems multidimensional recommender systems multidimensional data I I NTRODUCTION Most web sites offer a large number of information resources to their users Finding relevant content has thus become a challenge for users Recommender systems have emerged in response to this problem A recommender system for the web is an information ltering technology which can be used to output an ordered list of items/recommendations that are likely to be of interest to the user Traditionally the data that are most often available for recommender systems are web access logs that represent 
accesses from users to pages Therefore the most common recommender systems focus on these two dimensions Based on access data that relate these dimensions a recommendation model can be built and used to identify a set of N pages that are expected to be of interest to a certain user However other dimensions such as time and type of content e.g genre of music the user is listening to a music portal of the accesses can be used as additional information They may capture the context or background information in which recommendations are being made to improve their performance For example a system may recommend different vacation packages in summer or in winter In this paper we present a multidimensional approach called DaVI  Dimensions as Virtual Items  that enables the application of traditional two-dimensional recommender algorithms for the generation of recommendations using additional dimensions The DaVI approach was introduced in an earlier workshop paper where preliminary ideas of the approach were described In this paper we formalize the DaVI 
approach and describe an algorithm that instantiates it We also evaluate the approach using two real world data sets and compare it against to the previously introduced combined reduction approach II D IMENSIONS AS V IRTUAL I TEMS The idea behind DaVI is to treat additional dimensions as virtual items using them together with the regular items in a recommender system Here we assume that virtual items are only used to build the recommendation model and not recommended On the other hand regular items are used to build the model and they can also be recommended Let p be the number of users U   u 1 u 2   u p  and q the number of all possible items that can be recommended I   i 1 
i 2   i q   In addition we have other dimensions e.g contextual or background information D   D 1 D 2   D t   where each dimension D comprehends a set of values i.e D   d 1 d 2   d f   For example the dimension Hour can deìne a set of integer values from 1 to 24  Now let j be the number of multidimensional sessions in a web site S 002   
s 002 1 s 002 2   s 002 j   Each session s 002 is a tuple deìned by a user u 002 U  a set of accessed items I s 002 003 I and a set D s 002 003 D 1 004 D 2 004  004 D t containing all the dimension values associated with the session s 002  i.e s 002  005 u I s 
002 D s 002 006  A multidimensional session can have two types of dimensions in terms of granularity session-based dimensions and item-based dimensions If a single dimension D is sessionbased a session s 002  005 u I s 002 D s 002 006 has a single dimension value virtual item d 002 D s 002 associated to the session s 002  Here the dimension value d can represent for example the hour or location from where the session is accessed On the other hand if the dimension D is item-based a session s 002  
005 u I s 002 D s 002 006  005 u  i 1   i q    d 1   d q 006 has the dimension values virtual items d 1   d q associated to respective items i 1   i q in the session s 002  For example if the dimension values d 1   d q represent the genre of songs in a music web site we will have the values associated to

songs items in the session and not directly to the session as presented in the rst case The DaVI approach consists in converting each multidimensional session s 002  005 u I s 002 D s 002 006 into an extended twodimensional session s 002\002  005 u I s 002\002 004 D s 002\002 006  where the values of the additional dimensions in D s 002\002 are used as virtual items together with the regular items in I s 002\002  The DaVI approach can also be applied to a subset of dimensions or even to a single dimension For example a multidimensional session s 002  005 u I s 002 D s 002 006  005 u  i 1   i q    d 1   d q 006  with a single dimension D s 002 003 D 1  can be converted into an extended two-dimensional session s 002\002  005 u I s 002\002 004 D s 002\002 006  005 u  i 1   i q d 1   d q 006  Thus we deìne the DaVI approach as an operator that converts a set of multidimensional sessions into a set of extended two-dimensional sessions S 002\002  DaVI  S 002  002 D   1 where S 002\002 is the set of extended two-dimensional sessions S 002 is the set of multidimensional sessions and 002 D 003D is a set indicating which dimension values in S 002 must be converted to virtual items Once we have a set of extended two-dimensional sessions S 002\002  building/learning a multidimensional recommendation model M 002 consist in applying a two-dimensional recommender algorithm on S 002\002  Then to generate the recommendations we use the multidimensional model M 002 providing to it with the items and additional dimensions transformed in virtual items by the DaVI approach from the active user session s 002\002 a  005 u a I s 002\002 a 004 D s 002\002 a 006 as follows R  M 002  I s 002\002 a 004 D s 002\002 a   2 where I s 002\002 a 004 D s 002\002 a is referred to a set of observable items O  and it contains the items  I s 002\002 a  and dimension values  D s 002\002 a  which are respectively the regular and virtual items from the active user session s 002\002 a  R is a set of items/recommendations such that R 007 I and R 010 O  002  that are the most relevant/interesting for the user u a according to the model M 002  As stated before virtual items can not be recommended Thus we apply a lter on the recommendations generated by the model M 002 in order to guarantee that the model will never recommend virtual items One important advantage of our approach is that it can be combined with different recommendation methods This means that DaVI makes it easy to apply existing recommender algorithms to multidimensional data and obtain multidimensional models without changing the algorithms III D A VI BEST A LGORITHM An important issue with respect to the DaVI approach is to determine which dimensions should be considered in the recommendation model given that some dimensions are more informative than others In this section we address this problem by proposing the DaVI BEST algorithm that evaluates and selects the best dimension in a data set to build the multidimensional recommendation model To determine the best dimension for a given topN recommender algorithm A  the DaVI BEST algorithm rst applies the DaVI approach on each candidate dimension and builds its respective multidimensional recommendation model Then it evaluates each model and selects the best dimension i.e the one whose recommendation model presents the best performance The DaVI BEST algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1 Algorithm 1 DaVI BEST algorithm Input A set of multidimensional sessions S 002   s 002 1 s 002 2   s 002 j   where each session s 002 is a tuple deìned by a

and D   The variables  F and  002 F  D denote the values of the evaluation measure F1 in this case for each fold in F and dimension in D  The variable D  stores the informative dimensions and respective F1 values in the form  dimension F 1 values   Here a dimension is informative if its respective multidimensional model presents an F1 value signiìcantly higher than the F1 value of the

partitions the sessions into n folds which are used to evaluate the dimensions through their respective multidimensional recommendation models The evaluation is carried out using the All But One protocol with the n fold cross validation technique The next step lines 5 8  consists of building n twodimensional models from all folds but one and evaluating them on the remaining fold To build a model we can use any two-dimensional topN recommender algorithm The function A builds a model and the function eval evaluates it against the validation set calculating the F1 metric These F1 values will be used as reference to evaluate the performance of the multidimensional models in lines 14 16  The evaluation and selection of informative dimensions are performed in the lines 9 17 of the Algorithm 1 Lines 10 13 build the multidimensional models for each fold and evaluate them on the corresponding validation data using the function eval to compute the F1 metric The function DaVI converts a set of multidimensional sessions into a set of extended two-dimensional sessions as described in Section II Lines 14 16 analyze whether the F1 values of the multidimensional models are signiìcantly higher than the F1 values of their respective pure two-dimensional models without additional dimensions or not The analysis is performed using the function t-test that computes a one-sided paired t-test with a 95 conìdence level signiìcance level 002 0  05  In line 15  the dimensions that are informative are stored in the set D  with their respective F1 values Finally we test whether the set D  is empty or not If it is not we use the function argmax to return the dimension D  002D  which provides the highest F1 value line 19  Then using the dimension D   we apply the DaVI approach on the whole set of sessions S 002 to build the nal multidimensional recommendation model line 20  If the set D  is empty we use the whole set of sessions S 002 to build the pure two-dimensional model line 22  The nal multidimensional or two-dimensional recommendation model is returned in line 24 of the Algorithm 1 Once we have a recommender model in M wecan generate the recommendations If M contains a pure twodimensional model M  we generate the set of N recommendations R as usual On the other hand if M contains a multidimensional model M 002  we generate the recommendations following the equation 2 IV E MPIRICAL E VALUATION In this section we evaluate our DaVI approach with two topN recommender algorithms Item-based Collaborative Filtering CF and Association Rules based AR 7 The evaluation is carried out on two different data sets from Palco Principal 1  a web site of Portuguese music The rst one called Listener  contains accesses to music tracks 1 http://www.palcoprincipal.pt of the site The data set has 62,208 accesses 6,428 different items music tracks and 9,740 sessions The second data set called Playlist  represents the set of music tracks explicitly selected by users to include in their individual playlist The data set has 37,022 accesses 5,428 different items music tracks and 4,417 sessions The additional dimensions for both data sets are presented in Table I The rst group of dimensions is related to the time and location of the accesses and it is obtained by pre-processing web access data The second one consists of domain speciìc information and it is collected from the content management system CMS of the web site Table I A DDITIONAL DIMENSIONS FOR THE Listener AND Playlist DATA SETS Dimension Description day

country/city band The band which plays a music track music genre The genre of a music track pop rock jazz etc instrumental If a music track is instrumental or not To measure the predictive ability of the recommender systems we calculate the Precision Recall and F1 metrics using the All But One protocol with 10 fold cross validation Then for each metric the 10 global values are summarized using mean and standard deviation To compare two recommendation algorithms we apply the two-sided paired t-test with a 95 conìdence level on the 10 global values of each metric We run the experiments for N

the state of the art combined reduction-based approach C Reduction Brieîy  this approach uses the v alues of the dimensions as labels for segmenting web accesses It consists of the following two phases First using the training data a recommendation method is run for each segment e.g accesses on Mondays would be a segment to determine which ones outperform the traditional twodimensional model using only user-item information Second taking into account the dimension of the active session we choose the best segment to build a model and make the recommendations The best segment is the one whose model has the highest F1 value To the best of our knowledge this approach is considered the rst one for multidimensional recommender systems Table II C OMPARING THE F1 VALUES FOR D A VI BEST AND C R EDUCTION ALGORITHMS AGAINST THE VALUE FOR user  item CF AR Algorithm N Listener Playlist Listener Playlist user  item 0.231 0.342 0.175 0.225 DaVI BEST 1 0.309 0.429 0.207 0.255 C Reduction 0.231 0.342 0.197 0.262 user  item 0.226 0.293 0.149 0.176 DaVI BEST 2 0.27 0.337 0.181 0.201 C Reduction 0.226 0.293 0.17 0.203 user  item 0.198 0.242 0.122 0.142 DaVI BEST 3 0.231 0.271 0.153 0.16 C Reduction 0.198 0.242 0.143 0.164 user  item 0.152 0.178 0.088 0.103 DaVI BEST 5 0.173 0.193 0.115 0.117 C Reduction 0.152 0.178 0.106 0.119 user  item 0.092 0.104 0.051 0.061 DaVI BEST 10 0.103 0.112 0.069 0.07 C Reduction 0.092 0.104 0.062 0.071 Our results also demonstrate that the DaVI BEST algorithm presents better results i.e Precision Recall and F1 than the combined reduction-based algorithm In Figure 1 we show the results for the Listener data set There we have Precision gains ranging from 11  7 to 33  7  Recall gains from 11  3 to 33  7  and F1 gains from 11  9 to 33  7  a Precision  Recall curve b F1 metric Figure 1 Comparing the DaVI BEST algorithm against the Combined Reduction-based algorithm using the CF technique in the Listener data set V C ONCLUSION In this paper we described a multidimensional recommendation approach called DaVI  Dimensions as Virtual Items  It consists in using the values of the additional dimensions as virtual items It is combined with traditional two-dimensional recommender algorithms to generate recommendations using additional dimensions e.g contextual or background information The main advantage of this approach is that it can be combined with different existing two-dimensional recommender algorithms The results of our empirical evaluation have showed that the DaVI BEST algorithm is able to take advantage of the information in multidimensional data to improve the predictive ability of topN recommender systems There are several directions to be explored in future research For example the DaVI approach can be tried with other recommender algorithms such as Markov Models It would also be important to further challenge the DaVI approach with new data sets in order to validate the conclusions of this paper A CKNOWLEDGMENT Fundac  037 ao para a Ci 032 encia e a Tecnologia FCT under the PhD grant SFRH/BD/22516/2005 FCT project Rank PTDC/EIA/81178/2006 and QREN-AdI Palco3.0/3121 PONORTE R EFERENCES  P  Resnick and H R V arian Recommender systems  Communications of the ACM  vol 40 no 3 pp 56Ö58 1997  M A Domingues A M Jor g e and C Soares Using contextual information as virtual items on top-n recommender systems in ACM RecSysê09 Workshop on Context-Aware Recommender Systems CARS-2009  2009  G Adoma vicius R Sankaranarayanan S Sen and A Tuzhilin Incorporating contextual information in recommender systems using a multidimensional approach ACM Transactions on Information Systems  vol 23 no 1 pp 103Ö145 2005  J S Breese D Heck erman and C M Kadie Empirical analysis of predictive algorithms for collaborative ltering in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artiìcial Intelligence  1998 pp 43Ö52  T  M Mitchell Machine Learning  New York McGraw-Hill 1997  M Deshpande and G Karypis Item-based top-n recommendation algorithms ACM Transaction on Information System  vol 22 no 1 pp 143Ö177 2004  A M Jor ge M A Alv es and P  J Aze v edo Recommendation with association rules A web mining application in Proceedings of Information Society IS-2002 Data Mining and Warehouses  Ljubljana Slovenia 2002

single area. Even if the occluded pedestrians were successfully segmented by the S-T MRF model, lower part of the occluded pedestrian does not appear in the image. In such the case bottom of the circumscriptive rectangle of the pedestrian in the right image does not indicate the grounding position of him Therefore, appearance offsets due to occlusion must be considered In our algorithm, reference value of pedestrian's height without occlusion has been learned statistically according to top positions of their circumscriptive rectangles. If the height of an object is lower than the reference value, it is considered that the object is occluded by the other object or obstacles. In the 3034 occlusion case, an additional optimization process should be performed as a follow The position correction with occlusion Step. }: Acquire position \(xtop, ytop as the top of circumscriptive rectangle. Here the origin of the image is defined at upper left comer Step.2: Obtain the height 'h' of the pedestrians from statistics data by referring to their top position xtop, ytop Step.3: Update the grounding position of the pedestrian as xtop, ytop + h End of the algorithm Figure 3 shows an example of the tracking result of the object by this algorithm. It is understood that ROI of the pedestrian with occlusion is extracted by our algorithm, and the trajectory of the objects \(pedestrians calculated B. Time sequence data Both trajectory \(X, Y H, W calculated by the ROI information obtained tracking results of the ST-MRF model. The position of an object \(X, Y as the center of the ROI's feet, and the trajectory of the object is tracked as shown in figure 3 \(a The pose and location information are also obtained from the size of the object and the trajectory, respectively. The pose information is extracted by an appearance feature. The appearance feature adopted in this paper is aspect ratio of the pedestrian's ROI mentioned in formula \( 1 aspect ratio = W / H . . .  \( 1 


For example, as shown in figure 4, the aspect ratio of standing walking crawling pedestrian. Therefore, the pose feature falls into three categories by threshold based decision as follows \(2 thresholds \(THs and THd are decided empirically o if aspect ratio < TH s \(standing pose = I if TH s :s; aspect ratio :s; TH L \(crawling 2 2 if aspect ratio> TH L \(lying The location information is defined by assembling the position of the object and semantic information of the position on the image together. The semantic information is catch from location map as shown in figure 3\(b represented in figure 3\(a b referring the trajectory of the objects. The semantic location of the position is defines as a normal floor. So, the pedestrian is considered to be nested on the normal floor In addition, the attribute of the object is also judged from the Data[t] in this timing.

Aspect ratio of region of interests between To frames in the past, the object is considered as not pedestrian. The example is given in section IV e. STI \(State transition information The equations are an exception to the prescribed specifications of this template. You will need to determine whether or not your equation should be typed using either the Times New Roman or the Symbol font \(please no other font To create multi leveled equations, it may be necessary to treat the equation as a graphic and insert it into the text after your paper is styled To handle the behavior understanding process easily, STI is recorded from the time sequence data \(Data[tD by the state transition form of each feature. The behavior understanding process is done by the unit of STI 


STI is a state transition buffer witch has a steps information STI[n] has n th information including both location and state buffer witch has b steps. The STI buffer is accumulated when the location number of the object is updated. Similarly, state buffer in STI is accumulated when pose of the object is renewed, and the posed continuance time is also recorded in the buffer. The behavior of pedestrian is basically decided by referring the location and state buffer information in the STI \(to be described in section 4 D. Multiple objects interaction It is thought that there are some interactions if the object is mutually adjacent. This information is defmed as an objects interaction map, in our algorithms. If each object is adjacent in a constant distance, the value in the object interaction map is assumed to be }, otherwise the value is assumed to be O. The information is maintained as a multiple objects interaction map as far back as m frame in the past \(see figure 5 behavior understanding on multiple pedestrians becomes possible by considering the multiple objects interaction map with STI together \(to be described in section 4 IV. HUMAN BEHA VIOR UNDERSTANDING BY THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK Basically, most of the behavior can be judged from the features by framework mentioned in the previous section Details of the major behavior understanding in this paper are shown according to the types as follows 3035 t=n t=n   t=n-m I n-2 I 1 1 2 3 0 0 96 1 2 1

Single pedestrian or no interaction 96 -=r Whether the pedestrian is crawling or lying down can be judged by referring to pose feature in the framework. However a behavior of the pedestrian can not be completely decided to be normal or abnormal by this feature. For instance, even when a pose of the pedestrian is "crawling", a behavior of the pedestrian may be judged as "normal" if the pedestrian is located on "bench". On the other hand, the behavior may be judged as 'abnormal" if the pedestrian is located on "floor The behavior understanding method of the single pedestrian judged by combining the pose feature with the location feature is described as follows 1 Figure 6\(b by our framework. When a certain pedestrian is posture of crawling" or "lying down", if the pedestrian is passing over the position where the location is a gate of tickets of the station it is obviously thought as illegal gating. Moreover, the case where the pedestrian similarly passes over the position where the location is a fence of the station is probably illegal gating 


by over fencing. In the example, it is determined that an object A is passing gate of the station, because the attribute is Pedestrian" and the location is transited from "floor" to "gate In addition, the behavior of the object A is judged to abnormal illegal gating is passing the gate 2 The object is considered as loitering if the object's attribution is "pedestrian", and the object returned to the location witch num of location is the same, and if the duration until returning is more than TL as shown in fig. 6\(c behavior of the object B seems to be normal wrongly if it is only considered that he keeps moving the position where the location is floor. This case is an example for successful understanding of abnormal behavior of the single pedestrian by time sequential transition of the location 3 The object can be understood as "crawling" or "lying down" by the pose feature, regardless of state transition of location feature. However, if the location is a bench, the behavior of the object is assumed to be normal even when the pose is "crawling". In this way, the normal behavior can be understood correctly by the combination of pose feature with 1\(wl 6\(le 10\(11 Obj A Attribute Ped Ped F\(II ft II   OBJA 7\(ob le 9\(g 11\(11 12\(11 OBJ B wlWall flFloor feFence ob Obstacle gtGate a 13\(ft

This is one of the examples using multiple object interaction. The object is considered to be abandoned, if the attribute of the object is not pedestrian, and when it is left during To.

EXPERIMENT In our experiments, the video sequences imitated by the extra's acting in various scenes such as station gate of tickets or the station premise, or the station home as shown in Table 1 They were combined to produce objects tracked frames from which the features are extracted. Then, the proposed framework algorithms developed in this work are applied for behavior understanding process. In the framework, location information on each scene is defined beforehand. The value of THs and THL deciding pose feature is set to 0.6 and 1.5 respectively The duration values deciding interaction among objects such as To or T D are uniformly configured to 50 frames. These processes were handled in off-line. The rate is 10 frames per second. The number of samples is twelve \(five categories represented in table B. Results Results of the experiments are shown in figure 8.The good performance of classification rate is proved the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. It was confirmed that detection of the behaviors that had been targeted in this research had succeeded Additionally, there are no false detections that the behavior of pedestrians other than the target is understood as abnormal VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, the framework of the human behavior understanding corresponding to various scenes in the station is constructed. We have presented a simple rule based approach for understanding human behaviors in video sequences addressing the main goal of surveillance systems for protecting public transportation assets. The promising results indicate that there is much to be said in favor of simple methods even when the problem is complex. So, in our future works, the simple approach would be integrated with other methods such as silhouette analysis or detailed trajectory analysis \(velocity of objects etc ACKNOWLEDGMENT This research was partially supported by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology NICT REFERENCES I] Teddy Ko, "A survey on behavior analysis in video surveillance for
