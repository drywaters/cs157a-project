In this paper, we perform exploratory data analysis and data mining on an e-Learning web log, which spans one academic year.  The study uncovers the e-Learning users usage behavior in accessing the content. The study discovers e-Learning media popularity and usage patterns, and helps the institution fine tune future courseware, from strategic changes to the fine-grain of lesson content improvement Index Terms e-Learning, exploratory data analysis, web log mining, curriculum design   I   I NTRODUCTION  With the advancement in network technologies, online learning environments have become possible, giving learners the opportunity to study outside the class [5  EL e a r n i n g  platforms contain useful insight not only for students, but also for the schools and instructors themselves. Usage pattern session time, and preferred media type are examples of important information which universities can use to enhance their e-Learning to better support their students. This information is not shown directly on the web pages, but is hidden in the web log files In this paper, we use exploratory data analysis and web log mining to explore students behavior on e-Learning websites of the School of Information Technology \(SIT\ King Mongkuts University of Technology Thonburi \(KMUTT\, Thailand.  The web log in this study has been collected from the e-Learning web server log of the complete 2009 academic year which spans twelve months, 106,851 records, and 5,200 unique users From the results, SIT can improve its courseware and course contents. In addition, lecturers can get indirect teaching feedback from students e-Learning usage behavior.  This is crucial for Thai classroom culture, in which learners are typically too shy to ask questions directly during class session Complete direct student feedback cannot be fully observed from teaching evaluations alone II  L ITERATURE R EVIEW  A  SITs e-Learning System The objective of an e-Learning system [3 is t o s o lv e th e  distance education problem. To improve the e-Learning experience, web mining is used as a tool to assess student behavior on e-Learning websites [1  t o pe r s o n a l i z e  e Le ar ni ng for each person based on their learning style [2   Nev er th ele s s   the main objective of SITs e-Learning system is to enhance students learning by providing 24/7 class reviewing; it is not intended to replace the classes themselves [5, 6     SITs e-Learning system provides four types of digital recording media of lectures from the classroom, which are high- and low-resolution lecture videos, streaming sound files extracted from class videos, and lastly high-resolution videos synchronized with presentation slides. The users of SITs eLearning system are current students, alumni, staff, and other types of users. They can all access e-Learning B  Exploratory data analysis Exploratory data analysis is the process of getting to know the data set T h i s  i s do ne b y  m e a n s o f  e x t r a c t i ng co mmo n  statistics and visualization of data distribution.  Interesting patterns can appear as a result of such direct inspection including abnormal patterns C  Web log mining Web log mining or web usage mining \(WUM\ is one domain of web data mining that applies data mining techniques on web log files to find out users behavior and other relevant information. Every transaction request from users is recorded in log files on a web server [7, 8 In  th is stu d y so m e  preprocessing steps before input to WUM are needed. These steps are data cleaning \(remove unnecessary data\ data filtering \(choose only groups of data that we need\ user type identification, etc.  The mining techniques used in our study are association rule finding, and clustering  III  M ETHODOLOGY  The analysis process starts with data preprocessing, which includes performing data anonymization for privacy protection identifying user session, user type, and session length, as well as aggregrating two input data files \(media usage and user 978-1-4244-9718-8/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE The 6th International Conference on Computer Science & Education \(ICCSE 2011 August 3-5, 2011.

     session\ into a single file. The sessions of users who performed the complete logout procedure can be analyzed for session length. However, for the users who did not terminate their sessions properly, their sessions can be used only for hit or access analysis. Once the data has been preprocessed, the analyst team can start investigating for hidden patterns, trends exceptions, and deviations beyond basic statistics. More details are described as follows  A  Data preprocessing SITs e-Learning log files are kept in two separate files called Media Usage file and User Session file, on a monthly basis. The preprocessing steps start with identifying the type of user from user id.  The second step is determining session time from a sequence of user actions login  open web, and logout  Note that many access sessions cannot be extracted for a complete session time due to the fact that many users do not click on logout but rather terminate the session by closing the browser.  This has filtered our session records from an original 106,851 records to 6,352 records of complete sessions. The third step is combining data from the Media Usage and User Session files into a single file for each month. Then, all twelve files are combined into one yearly session file which is ready for further data analysis B  Exploratory data analysis of hit analysis Two measures are considered in this analysis: access hits and unique user hits. Access hits are the total number of times an item of e-Learning media is accessed by students, while in unique user hits, no matter how many times the same user accesses the same media, we count it as one time. Then, we compare these two numbers to see their correlation. High access hits do not always mean high unique user hits.  The ratio of high unique user hits can help differentiate whether learning activity is coming from an individual student, or from students at large  C  Clustering and Association rule finding Unlike hit analysis that can simply use data in the yearly session file, these mining techniques require additional steps of relabeling session times into three subgroups \(0-20 min., 21-60 min., and more than 60 min.\ed on session time histogram before we can input this data find clustering and association rule. Before performing clustering, we preprocess data to include an additional field whether each record indicates the cross viewing of material of students in different study programs or not.  For association rule finding, we convert original single-course data into a vector of all courses offered in each study program.  The bit 1 indicates that students have opened media of that course Otherwise, 0 is presented  IV  R ESULTS FOR K NOWLEDGE D ISCOVERY  A  Hit analysis  …Macro level As mention earlier, we are interested in two measures which are access hits and unique user hits. Fig. 1 shows the results for a whole year, which are represented by bar chart The number of access hits and unique user hits of M.Sc.IT is the highest. In addition M.Sc.IT has the highest utilization rate of one unique user generates about 70 hits.  We discovered that for each core course of each program, the highest access is from its students; the amount of cross-access from students in other programs is still very low.  SIT should promote expanded use of e-Learning in general, especially among alumni users and users with the privilege to do cross-access among program degrees   Figure 1: Results of media file access   B  Hit analysis … Micro level From Fig. 2, each lecturer can see if some lectures under the same course have very high e-Learning utilization.  This may mean that the students have struggled with the classroom lecture.  Thus, the lecturer could try to come up with a better way to explain the same content  Figure 2: Results of hit analysis at lecture level  C  Hit analysis … Cross-access from different degree programs  Table 1 shows the number of registered students, unique user hits, and ratio between these two numbers in randomly selected core courses of each program. From the results M.Sc.EB is the only program that has a ratio of unique user hits and registered students greater than 1, which implies significant cross-viewing of content, while B.Sc.CS has the lowest ratio   D  Clustering  We use the k-means method to cluster the data based on correlation dimension between user types and three session 177 ThA 1.3

n-dimension data cube\( I1  I k Support=sup_count/total_count 2 3 4. Performance Analysis Example 2 Lets talk about a practical problem just like the status of sales. Assume that we will mine the association rules involved 4 dimension attributes of sales, the minsup=25%. First of all, using OLAP technology to build a 4-D data cube and the 4 dimension attributes are: time location, item, and supplier. For location dimension which contains area, country and so on, we choose province level We use brand level for item dimension, company level for supplier dimension. Time dimension can be divided as Q1 1-3 4-6 7-9 10-12 location\(P1,P2,L1,L2 York, item\(B1,B2,B3,B4 C1,C2,C3 sales data cube can be generalized like this Graphic 2: The 4-Dimension Data Cube of Sales The details of this sales data cube are in the table follow: The amount of cells is 100 Location Time Item Supplier Count Cell-1 P1 Q1 B1 C2 5 Cell-2 P1 Q3 B1 C1 2 Cell-99 L1 Q3 B1 C1 3 Cell-100 L2 Q4 B1 C3 11 Table 2: The details data table of sales data cube We use original Apriori_Cube Algorithm to find frequent predicate set with minsup_num= 25%*100=25 According the data table we calculate that sup_count of every member of dimension L is \(P1:8, P2:5, L1:1, L2:24 and also T, I, S. So there is the process Graphic 3: The processes of old algorithm As we know, through comparing with the minsup_num dimension location has no one frequent 1-predicate set, so that there have no frequent 4-predicate set in the output by the original algorithm. But users are interested in the Candidate 1-Predicate set L T I S P1 P2 L1 


L2 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 B1 B2 B3 B4 C1 C2 C3 Frequent 1-Predicate set T I S Q1 Q3 B2 B3 C1 C2 I1 I 2 C1              C2                 C3 2 12 1 3 5 1 6 2 12 8 11 Q 1  Q 2  Q 3  Q 4 P 1 P 2 L 1 L 2 Candidate 2-Predicate set Q1,B2},{Q1,B3 Q1,C1},{Q1,C2 Q3,B2},{Q3,B3 


Q3,C1},{Q3,C2 Candidate 3-Predicate set Q1,B2,B3}{Q 1,Q3,B2},{Q3 C1,B2 Frequent 2-Predicate set Q1,B2}{Q1,B 3},{Q3,B2 Q3,C1 Output: 1L U 2L U 3L Frequent 3-Predicate set Q1,B2,C1},{Q1,B3,B2 Q1,B2,B3  6 level from the same dimension and SP to pruning Candidate 3 Set, pruning {Q1,Q3,B2}, keep {Q1,B2,B3} due to the special requirement on location B by users 7 1 max_support of every dimension 1 frequent 4-predicate set which contains location dimension And the candidate 3-predicate set {Q1,Q3,B2} is useless because when we mine multi-dimension association rules we should follow that one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension even the sup_count >minsup_num when there are no requirements from users. But this time, users require that different members from dimension item can exist at the same time So we redo this mining process by the improved Algorithm Graphic 4: The processes of improved algorithm At last, we got the frequent 4-predicate set which the users are interested in, and then can format the rules 5. Conclusion In this paper, we have studied issues and methods on efficient mining of multi-dimension association rules based on data cube. With the development of technology, the size 


of database has become much huge than ever before unimaginable. So the multi-dimension model of database based on data cube has become useful and popular relatively how to mine useful multi-dimension association rules based on this model has been important too. Among the algorithms for the problems we choose the most classify one to improve, to make it more efficient and useful An efficient algorithm, Apriori_Cube_Improved, has been developed which explores the multi-dimension association rules. First, we use max_support and min_support of every frequent 1-predicate set to check the levels of dimensions, and then adjust the data cube by roll-up and drill-down operation immediately. This step is embed in the process of mining association rules, so it makes the rules much more useful and flexible; second applying one predicate set contains no more than one different level from the same dimension and SP pruning can help reduce the amount of predicate set, especially with the great growing of the number. So the speed of algorithm improved is faster than ever At last, there are also many other interesting issues and flaws of the algorithm which call for further study including efficient mining multi-dimension association rules of complex measures and so on.
