but with a lot of data collection and storage, will greatly reduce the efficiency of the existing algorithm. In this paper transformed association rules problem into Biclustering problem complete association rule mining well, its efficiency and complexity of the issues is lower than the Apriori algorithm  Keywords biclustering; association rules equivalent model; frequent itemset  I  Introduction Data mining is the process to get interesting novel, potentially useful information and knowledge from the database which contains a 
large number of original data 031 it is one of the most active branch of database research   Association rules is a hot and important issue in data mining area, the aim is to find the hidden relationships between datasets  Rakesh Agrawal  in 1993 first proposed in basket on the data mining association rules, and designed the most influential mining Boolean association rules of frequent itemsets--Apriori algorithm, but algorithm makes it many times brain-scan 
database efficiency is not high. Y.Cheng and G.M.Church  presented two clustering concept in 2000, and design the classic Cheng and Church algorithm to find the double clustering algorithm based on data matrix ranks and clustering looking for certain regular sub-matrix 5,6 Later puts forward many classic double clustering algorithm 7-9 In this paper, we develop an association rules algorithm,which called Association Rules Algorithm based on Biclustering \(ARAB II  
Association Rules and Biclustering Algorithm A  The concept of association rules  Let I={i 1 i 2 i m is a set of items. Task-related data D is the set of database transactions, Where each transaction T is a set of items, makes T 000\000 I Let A be a item set, transaction T contains A if and only if A 000\000 T. Association rules is shaped like the implication A 
000\000 B, which A 000\000 I, B 000\000 I, and A 001 B 001. Rules A 000\000 B established in the transaction set D, and with support s, where s is the transaction in D include the percentage of A\037B, it is the probability P\(A\037B\. Rules A 000\000 B has the confidence c in the transaction D, if the percentage of A contains in transaction D also 
includes B is c, This is the conditional probability P\(B|A\. That is support \(A 000\000 B\=P\(A\037B\       \(1 confidence \(A 000\000 B \=P\(B|A\      \(2 A set of items is referred to as an itemset. A itemset which containing k items is a k-itemset The frequency of itemset is the number of transactions containing this itemset, if the frequency of a itemset is greater than or equal to min_sup product of the total number of transactions in D, this itemset called frequent itemset. Frequent k-itemset usually denoted as L 
k  Mining association rule is generate all the strong rules which meet user-specified minimum support \(min_sup\d minimum confidence min_conf two-step process   a  Find all frequent itemsets: the itemset appears frequently greater than or equal to the minimum support count b  Generated strong association rules by frequent itemsets: these rules must satisfy

 minimum support and minimum confidence Finding frequent itemset is the key to mining association rules. The so-called association rules mining is mainly mining frequent itemsets B  Biclustering concept Y.Cheng and G.M.Church proposed biclustering in 2000  031 and designed classic Cheng and Church algorithm to find biclusters Biclustering defined as 031  Definition 1: Let the data matrix A 031 X be the set of rows and Y the set of columns. A ij be the i row j column element of the matrix A. Let I 031 J the subset of X 031 Y respectively. The pair \(I,J specifies a submatrix A IJ with the following mean squared residue score  2  1     ij iJ Ij IJ iIjJ H IJ a a a a IJ 002\002  000 3 where 1 iJ ij jJ aa J 002  000 002 1 Ij ij iI aa I 002  000 002 and  111 IJ ij iJ Ij iIjJ iI jJ aaaa IJ I J 002\002 002 002  000¦\000¦\000  are the row and column means and the mean in the submatrix 031 I 031 J 031 A submatrix A IJ is called a bicluster if H\(I,J 000”\001 for some 001/\000 0. There are several different bicluster model 10 the most basic model is the equivalent model Definition 2: If a matrix all elements have the same value, the matrix model called the equivalent model Figure 1 shows the equivalent model and an example  Definition 3: For the matrix A in definition 1, i row residue score and j column residue score respectively 2 1    ij iJ Ij IJ jJ di a a a a J 002  000  2 1    ij iJ Ij IJ iI dj a a a a I 002  000  Cheng and Church algorithm based on this fact to find bicluster: If one row\(or column residue score greater than this matrix mean square residue score, delete the row \(or column can reduce the mean square residues score of submatrix. If one row\(or column smaller than this matrix mean square residue score, add the row \(or column\matrix cann’t increase the mean square residues score of the submatrix  III  Association Rules Algorithm Based on Biclustering Frequent itemsets is one or more items simultaneously in multiple transaction itemsets with 0 or 1,which means item isn’t in itemset or not. when data matrix to denote the trade data set its corresponding to 1 value in more lines appeared together, can as equivalent model matrix in more lines in the value of simultaneously For example, frequent itemsets {A, B, C} is simultaneously presented three times in 5 transaction, the frequent itemsets is corresponding to a 3 * 3 matrix, and the rows of  matrix is the amount of elements of frequent itemsets,and the columns of matrix denote frequent itemsets is in which transaction Due to the zero value interference, matrix make double clustering algorithms searching for 1 equivalent model are often find some 0 equivalent model, these 0 equivalent model is we don't need.To avoid this situation, adopt the 0 matrix by a range of random number of way, will replace 1-0 transformations for 1- random matrix A  Converted the transaction dataset The transaction data set converted into matrix form which can make bi-clustering mining contains following steps  a  Construction data matrix A, the transaction corresponding to the rows of A, items Equivalent model         An example Figure 1 equivalent model and an example S    S    S    S S    S    S    S S    S    S    S S    S    S    S 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0 1.0  1.0  1.0  1.0

 corresponding to the columns of A  b  For each transaction, the item contains in this transaction corresponding to the elements of A is set to 1, other elements in A set of random number within a certain range. The following transaction data contains information about the bank loans. We will mining frequency itemset use the methods in our paper  Table 1  Transaction data about the bank loans  Using the above steps to convert the transaction data in Table 1 into data matrix form take a random number range \(10,100 are as follows  B  A new Bicluster Algorithm used Mining frequent itemset Use Apriori algorithm on table 1 transaction data, set min_support of 3. We can get frequent itemset on table 2, the frequent itemset corresponding submatrix A\(I,J\ in A, and I={1,7,8} are 1,7,8 row respectively, J={1,3,4,6 are 1,3,4,6 column respectively. The elements in A\(I,J\ are all 1, that A\(I,J\ is equivalent model  Equivalent model is one type of bicluster models. Therefore, find frequent itemset in association rules problem is the same as find equivalent model in bicluster problem. Mean square residue score of equivalent model is 0 that is H\(I,J\=0. Thus we can use improved Cheng and Church algorithm to find this model Table 2 Frequent itemset Frequence itemset Ia,Ic,Id,If support count 3 The method of improvement Cheng and Church algorithm as follow: \(1\me rows and columns residue score greater than a specify positive number, delete those rows and columns 2\ind one row or column which has the max residue score in the get matrix in the previous step, until the submatrix mean square residue score is 0. \(3\Add the rows and columns which can ensure all elements of submatrix are 1.

This submatrix corresponding to frequent itemset in table 2  ARAB once can delete many transaction, so avoid the traditional methods to scan the database many times, greatly improved the efficiency of mining frequent itemset. But the bicluster algorithm uses the greedy strategy, sometimes cann’t find the optimal equivalent model 11 So it can be researched more effective bicluster algorithm for mining association rules IV  Conclusion Association rules have a very important value Existing association rules algorithm search for frequent itemset by gradually search k-itemset need to repeatedly scan the database, not suitable for large-scale association rules.

In other words the mining results of Apriori algorithm are basically consistent with the results of sp atial autocorrelation and spatial regression that is spa tial analysis However the advantage of the spatial analysis is efficiency as spatial data is already known to be large in size It can save time consumption significantly In addition spatial analysis method will find much more in teresting and useful rules and knowledge from the spatial d ata such as the distribution of the variables the cluster ce nters of the variables even the changing trend of the variables VI C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE WORK A Conclusion In this paper two methods are applied to mining association rules including the Apriori algorithm and spatial analysis method\(spatial auto correlation and spatial regression to extract the co rrelation between the county-level revenue and population education state health state and social security state in China from 2 000 to 2005 Results of the two methods are compared in order to find which one is more appropriate under certain circumstance Log transformation is applied to the experiment data which is effective in normalising the data in addition to weakening the negative effect of outliers A strong correlation of the variables is observed, revealing that there are clear spatial patterns of the variables on the distribution map Mining spatial association rules present a great challenge to the developers of multi-relational data mining methods as the explosive growth of spatial data and widespread use of spatial databases emphasize the need for the automated discovery of spatial knowledge In this paper we explore the spatial association rule mining which take account of the spatial autocorrelation of the data. Illustrative examples taken from spatial data of county-level revenue and popu lation education state, health state and social security state in China show that our method enables us to use GeoDa to compute the spatial autocorrelation between the variables and locations. It will be very time consuming if there are a lot of counties to mine the spatial association rules with Ap riori algorithm Moreover implicit spatial patterns will be extracted from the analysis results of spatial auto correlation The most important thing is spatial analysis method will provides priori knowledge to the mining procedure as the results of both methods have so many rules in common However the differences between the two methods showed that the spatial autocorrelation will also brings deviation to the results which we must find ways to eliminate B Future work Besides the deviation that spatial autocorrelation brings to the mining results its very difficult to set the rules to specify the candidate frequ ent itemsets from the spatial autocorrelation In this paper, we get the candidate frequent itemsets by the level of correlation between the variables and the goodness of fit of the models and dont know how the spatial autocorrelation affect the mining procedure So how to maintain the impact on mining procedure that is when to make use of the spatial autocorrelati on and when to eliminate it should be impro ved in the future A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS This paper is funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China-Yout h Science Fund Project\(No 40801152 and Scho larship Research Fund Pr oject Ministry of Education\(No.213153249 R EFERENCES  Tobler W A com pute r m ovie si mulating urban growth in the Detroit  region Economic Geography  vol 46, pp. 234-240 Feb. 1970  Clark, Philip Evans, "Distance to nearest neighbor as a m easure of  spatial relationships in populations Ecology \(Ecological Society of America  vol. 35 pp. 445…453.

Post Mining o/Non-redundant Association Rules /or Sensor Data Estiamtion In this subsection, we describe our proposed technique for post mining of non-redundant association rules for sensor data estimation purpose. This algorithm is developed based on non-redundant informative association rules which means all rules cannot be derived from other rules and the left hand side and right hand side of the selected rules contain the input itemset. There are some research works that can generate the closed itemsets and corresponding association rules using generated closed itemsets [3 , 18 Based on our previous works [8] we assume to have the non-redundant association rules ready and the criteria of selecting the rules from non-redundant rules further reduce the number of rules to the minimum In this algorithm, dn.vm is treated as one item in association rules. Dn represents the sensor which is indexed as n. Vm represents the value of the sensor n is read as m. In the following figure, Xinput is the itemset represent the current round of sensor readings, it can be represented by a set of dn.vm pairs. Xl and X2 are the itemsets in left hand side and right hand side of association rules. Z represents all items in X2/Xinput. Index\(z z and value of sensor value pair z. Confidence{Xl=>X represents the confidence of the rule Xl=>X2 Support\(Xl=>X2 C represents the confidence of association rule, dn V represents the identifier and value pair of the sensor dn Xestimate represents the returned estimation itemset which contains the senor identifiers with missing values in the current round of readings of stream data and their corresponding estimated values. Sspecify represents the user specified support, and Cspecify represents the user-specified confidence The algorithm is described as below. The input of the procedure Estimate includes the current round of sensor reading, current association rule confidence, user-specified minimum support and user-specified minimum confidence 


In line 4, all association rules that satisfy with the conditions of minimum support and confidence are selected The confidence of the select association rules are calculated in line 5. The condition of line 6 filters out the rules whose left hand side itemset Xl does not contain the itemset Xinput in this case, sensor identifier is filtered based on the enriched contextual information. The condition of line 7 filters out the rules whose right hand side itemset X2 does not contain new estimated items. Each new item was processed in line 8 and 9 so that missing sensor values are V5-104 2010 2nd International Conference on Education Technology and Computer \(ICETC modified and updated.

Figure 1. The post mining of non-redundant association rule for sensor data estimation IV. EXPERIMENTAL STUDY The performance of our proposed approach is studied by means of simulation. Several different simulation experiments are conducted in order to evaluate the proposed technique and compare it with the Average Window Size A WS linear trend approach, and with the WARM approach, the state-of-the-art data estimation algorithm in sensor databases using 2-frequent itemsets based association mining [6]. We compared the estimation accuracy, running time and memory space usage when applying different methods to the application dataset The dataset was collected in year 2000 at various locations throughout the city of Austin, Texas. The data represents the current location, the time interval, and the number of vehicles detected during this interval. All sensor nodes report to a single server. The sensors are deployed on city streets, collect and store the number of the vehicles detected for a given time interval. The vehicle counts taken as sensor readings that are used as input for our simulation experiments are traffic data provided by [2 A. Performance Study of Estimation Accuracy The evaluation of the estimation accuracy of the missing values is done by using the average Root Mean Square Error RMSE I'\(xa, -Xe 1 ___ l __ lI_?''? ____ _ numStates # estimations where Xa; and Xe; are the actual value and the estimated value, respectively; #estimations is the number of estimations performed in a simulation run; and numStates is the number of subsets, in which the actual readings are distributed The expression u  xa, -Xe estimations error and is an estimate of the standard deviation under the assumption that the errors in the estimated values \(i.e. Xai Xei 


see the smaller the RMSE, the better the estimation accuracy From Figure 2, we can see that the proposed technique gives the best average estimation result of the above approaches regarding the accuracy, followed by the WARM approach. The linear interpolation, A WS, and linear trend approaches perform no better than WARM and the proposed approaches. From Figure 2, we can also see that the proposed technique gives the best estimation result on the maximum estimation accuracy, which is the root square error for the maximum difference between the estimated and accurate values 0.6 0.5 0.4 w n 0.3 cz 0.2  Average 0.1  Maximum 0 l' ?? 0" </.,oQ Figure 2.

Performance Study of Memory Usage Figure 4 illustrates the memory usage of A WS, linear interpolation, linear trend, WARM and proposed approaches in MB. The experimental results show that in terms of memory space, the WARM approach is outperformed by all the other four approaches. The results of the simulation experiments show that for 108 sensors the needed memory space using WARM is much higher than that using proposed approach. This is because the closed lattice data structure uses less memory space than the cube data structures, and it only stores the condensed closed itemsets information Figure 4. Performance study of memory usage for traffic monitoring application in MB V. CONCLUSTIONS Sensor stream applications are becoming very common with the advances in technologies for sensor devices. In this paper we propose a method to post mine non-redundant association rules, and used the result to produce missing data estimation in sensor network applications. The objective is to further reduce the resulting rules from non redundant association rule mining based on the users request, and apply the retrieved meaningful information to perform missing data estimation in wireless sensor networks We have evaluated the proposed technique with real data from a wireless sensor network of a traffic monitoring site Our proposed method is able to estimate missing sensor value with both time and space efficiency, and greatly improves the estimation accuracy. Our performance study 


shows that proposed post mining of association rule mining technique for missing sensor data estimation is an area worth to explore REFERENCES 1] Agrawal, R., & Imielinski, T., & Swami, A., "Mining association rules between sets of items in massive databases", International Conference on Management of Data, 1993 2] Austin, F.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm. And then we propose an improved algorithm IFP-growth based on many association rules mining algorithms. At last we implement the algorithm we propose and compare it with algorithm FPgrowth algorithm. The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
