The Study on the Exploratory Spatial Data Mining Method Based on Partial Random Walk and Its Application in GPS TEC Analysis Junhuan Peng 1 Kun Qin 2 Honglei Yang 3 Lei Cheng 4 Department of Surveying and Mapping, China University of Geosciences \(Beijing Beijing, 100083, China 1 pengjunhuan@163.com Abstract The Ionosphere plays an important role in atmosphere, whose globally distributed total electronic content TEC\echnology is the important data source of geographic or earth information system for monitoring global change. This paper applies the rigging method of deionization variable theory to mine the knowledge of large scale of tendency variation and small scale of random variation, and 
discovered that the large scale tendency can be modelled as a 9 orders of globe harmony function, and the small scale variation more prefers to a zero mean non-stationary random process of symmetrically distributed. Applying the developed unit-root test the small scale residual is identified with the characteristic of 3 orders of partial random walk, and thus the residuals after performing 3 orders of difference show the property of white noise process. The general Kriging predication method based on the partial random walk model is constructed to re-build the spatial process precisely. The result exhibits that the partialrandom-walk-based test can be used to mine the auto-correlated structure of zero mean non-stationary error function or small scale variation, and the constructed general kriging method can improve the prediction result Keywords  exploratory spatial data analysis and/or mining partial random walk; evolutionary spectrum test; general kriging method; EM algorithm 
I I NTRODUCTION Spatial data mining can be regarded as an extension of exploratory spatial data analysis. Kriging method is therein an important mining technique, and began with the publication of landmark paper, entitled A statistical approach to some basic mine valuation problems on the Witwatersrand then, the method has attracted attention of disciplines associated spatial positions, and in statistics has been developed into methodology of processing continuous spatial variable, and the widest a pplication is in earth science environment science, geography et al. It consists of an exploratory spatial data analysis, positing a large scale of trend model of \(non-stationary\ean plus a small scale of intrinsically stationary\etrically estimating variogram or covariogram, fitting a valid model to the estimate, and kriging \(predicting 
rved parts from the available data. This last step yields not only a predictor, but a mean squared prediction error   Howeve r  in pract ice the small scale of error doesnt always guarantee that intrinsically stationary assumption holds true, and may well be a non-stationary process with zero mean. This will result in that the variogram or covariogram based on stationary assumption cannot efficiently model the auto-correlative structure in the data, and further influence the estimation of trend model parameters and the prediction of unobserved parts This paper attempts to build a partial-random-walk-based exploratory mining method for identifying and modelling the auto-correlative structure of non-stationary error with zero mean, and improving the estimate of trend model parameters and the prediction of unobserved parts. And the arrangement is as follows: Section 1 introduces the association and 
difference of \(spatial\ining and exploratory \(spatial data analysis, and point out that the fundamental assumption of kriging method, i.e. with an intrinsically stationary error process, doesnt always hold true; Section 2 discusses the principle of kriging method and construct the EM algorithm 2 for non-stationary error process ba sed partial random walk Section 3 performs the case study; and Section 4 makes a concluding remark II K RIGING PRINCIPLES AND THE ALTERNATIVE VERSION IN THE CASE OF NON STATIONARY ERROR PROCESS  A typical spatial process can be defined in the mixed form of     Zf

Under normally distributed error assumption, the exploratory data analysis process of Kriging method can be realized via solving the maximum likelihood estimate, i.e 22 00       arg max\(log      L    Z 2 Where 2 0   L  Z is the likelihood function, and Is represented as  2 2/2 0 11   2   exp\(2 n n T LVar Var  012 012 012\012  012\012 012 Z Z ZA ZZA 3 Where    Var Var Var  Z       ij n n Var C h     2 0  Var   I And 1 1 0 2\(0 1 0 1 0 2\(0 0    T T Var Var   012\012 012  A Z A AZ Z 4 1 2\(1 1 0 1 1 0 0 2\(0 0    min\(2 log    2       T Arg n Var EVar   012 012\012   Z 5 The kriging prediction of unobs erved parts and its p mean square error can be respectively computed via 2 00 0 0 12 0              T ZCovZ Var    012  012 sas sZ Z Z A 6 and 2 000 12 2 000      0        T Var Z C Cov Z Var Cov Z   012 012 ssZ Z s Z 7 In practice   s may well be a non-stationary error process with zero mean, and the intrinsically stationary variogram and/or covariogram are no longer suited for characterizing the spatial association rule, i.e. the autocorrelation.  We have to seek a new model for fitting the autocorrelation. The partial random walk extended from the one dimensional random walk, is a feasible alternative of intrinsically stationary variogram and/or covariogram, which assumes the partial derivative of spatial error function being white noise process with variance 2  For the one dimensional case of partial random walk, it has been proved to be non-stationary, and thus this conclusion can be naturally extended to the multi-di mensional case.  Mining the parameters  non-stationary auto-correlative process   s can be achieved by solving a variational problem  2 0 2  22 1     argmin       kl m ii kl i Z d ad d dx dy    012 015  012 015  012 012    s s s s s s ss s 8 Under the normally distributed assumption of errors and grid sampling, the variational problem can be equivalent to the complete likelihood problem similar to \(4 22 2 00 12 0 2 2 1 2    11    2  exp\(2 2  exp 2      y x nn c T n n nn kl xy L Dxy        012\012 012\012 012\012 012\012   012\012\012\012\012 012  Z ZA ZA 9 Where  kl D is the difference symbol, and indicate the  kl orders of difference with respect to x …direction and ydirection.

This dataset was published by International GNSS Service, and distributed an assumed spherical Graticule that is 450km over the earth surface ,the longitude is ranging from W180 to E180 the latitude is ranging from N87.5 to S87.5 and ,the Graticule grid unit is2.5 5  Use the following spherical harm onics with longitude and latitude coordinates as the mean function fo r characterizing the large scale variation, and the spatial process is 0 00      cos  sin  cos      n n mmm nnn nm ZLB Y LB amLbmLP B LB LB          19 Where n indicates the n order  and degree of harmonics cos  m n PB is the Lengdre function The TEC dataset published by IGS was fitted into the harmonics function by using the least squares estimate,  the best order  of equation \(19\xplored to be nine., and residual histogram is as Fig.1 with zero mean And the 3D graph of residuals is as Fig.2. Fig .3 shows the variogram of residuals, the submap\(a\along zero degree direction; \(b along 63.6 degree direction; \(c\along 90degree direction; \(d along 116.4 degree direction. According to the histogram of Fig.1, we can only see that the errors or residuals are symmetrically distributed with zero mean, and the stationary assumption is difficult to iden tify. However, when examining the variogram of Fig.3, we can feel the clue of non-stationary since the variograms of four different directions are different significantly from each other, and further statistical testing by the evolutionary spectrum ndicates tha t the residuals Fig. 1 Histogram of Residuals Fig. 2  3D graph of residuals Fig. 3 Variograms of residuals with respect to the four directions of 0, 90 26 0 34 and 153 0 26 The succeeding work is to explore the structure of nonstationary errors. We compute the partial differencing with respect to L-direction \(longitude\and B-direction \(Latitude Along longitude is one order, and along latitude direction are two orders. This amounts to three orders of differencing, i.e three orders of partial random walki ng.  Fig.4 is the histogram of residuals after performing three or ders of differencing, and clearly indicates that the residuals are symmetrically distributed with zero mean. Fig.5 shows the 3 D graph of residuals, Fig.6 shows the variogram of different directions and can be seen that the variograms are almost identical, and have no significant gap. The further statistical testing by using evolutionary spectrum method also says that the residuals after three orders of differencing conform to stationary assumption. And thus we can initially inference that the TEC dataset has a large scale of variation with a nine orders of spherical harmonics incorporating with a small scale of variation with three orders of partial random walking of zero mean Fig. 4 Histogram of residuals after three order of differencing 


Fig. 5 3D graph of residuals after three order of differencing Fig. 6 Variograms of residuals with respect to the four directions of 0, 90 26 0 34 and 153 0 26 According to the explored initial structure of nine orders of spherical harmonics function plus a three orders of partial random walk or partial differencing process, a further precise mining is performed by the EM algorithm 2 and the result is obviously better than that based on the stationary assumption IV C ONCLUSIONS In the literature of data mining, the top three frequent concepts are association rule mining, clustering and classification. Both clustering and classification originates from multivariate statistics. Relatively speaking, association rule mining is more of characteristic of computer science. Its aim is to find interesting associations and/or correlation relationships among large set of data items. Association rules show attributes value conditions that occur frequently together in a given dataset. A typical and widely-used example of association rule mining is Market Basket Analysis. More generally speaking, association may indicate the relation between two events or variables. As to viewpoint of statistics the relation should be significant under some given confidence level, while in the angle of computer, the extent of confidence level can be more wide, and even is ignored. When extended to spatial dataset mining, the association rule is usually spatial auto-correlation, and measured by variogram or covariogram Only under the intrinsically stationary assumption can it be computed efficiently, otherwise the association rule is very difficultly mined. However, in practice, intrinsically stationary doesnt always hold true, this paper suggests that partial random walk is used to model the association rule for nonstationary error process, and developed the corresponding EM mining algorithm. After making exploratory analysis for the GPS-TEC dataset from IGS, the conclusion is positive that the exploratory data analysis method based on partial random walk can be use to mining the association rule of spatial dataset with such small scale variation as non-stationary error process A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This project was sponsored by The foundation of Key Laboratory of Center for Earth Observation and Digital Earth 2010LDE002\emy of Sciences, 863Ž Project 2007AA12Z226\the foundation of doctoral supervisors of Ministry of education of  China 20100022110008 the Natural Science Foundation of China \(41074009;40674015 R EFERENCES 1 Krige,D.G  A statistical approach to some basic mine valuation problems on the Witwatersrand  Journal of the chemical,metallurgical and mining society of South Africa,vol.52,pp.119-139.1951  Cressie, N.A.C  Statistics for spatial data  John Wiely Newyork,1991  Gaetan C.a nd Guy on Spatial statistics and modeling  Springer Newyork,2010  4 Journel,A.G. and Huijbregts, C.J Mining geostatistics Academic Press.1978 5 Ripley B.D Spatial statistics Newyork: John Wiely,2005 6 Wackernagel,.h Multivariate geostatistics Third edition, SpringerVerlag, Berlin.2003  Cheng, S.,Dai, R., Xu W  and Shi Y  Research on data mining and knowledge management and its applications in Chinas economic development: Significance and trend  Int.

             Figure 2. Algorithm for frequent itemset generation D. Algorithm for Generation of Association Rules This algorithm is used to generate association rules from the already generated frequent itemsets \(by algorithm 2 takes minimum confidence from the user and discovers all rules with a fixed antecedent and with different consequent This algorithm uses the fact that:  If there exists two rules AC and A{C? X} where X ? A ? C then the confidence of the second cannot be larger than the first one This algorithm checks if a given set is a subset of another set or not. To perform this operation each item in an itemset is represented as an integer where a bit corresponding to as item is set to 1. For example suppose a database with 8 attributes itemset {1,2, 5}  is represented as 38 as follows. 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 To check if set {2,5} is a subset of {1,2,5} we represent 2,5} like above and is evaluated to 36. Now we perform AND operation 38 & 36. The result is checked for equality with the first itemset \({2, 5 otherwise it is not. In this case the result is obvious. Similarly difference of two sets is done during production of the rules This algorithm is capable of finding all association rules with a fixed antecedent and with different consequents from the frequent itemsets subject to a user specified minimum confidence very quickly. The proposed algorithm is avoiding the unnecessary checking for the rules based on the above lemma 1.The algorithm generate the rules with a fixed antecedent part. When all the rules with that antecedent are generated it will go to the next antecedent. For a given Input: The transaction database bdb

items in the consequent, have confidence less than the threshold, i.e.  no rules are generated, and then the confidence of any rule in k+1 level also cannot be more than threshold. So checking for rules from this level onward can be avoided without missing any rules. Now the maximum possible confidence of the rule in the k+1 level will be minimum confidence of the two itemsets from which this is constructed Since the confidence of only one of them is larger than the threshold, others must be less than the threshold. So the confidence of the rule in k+1 will be less than threshold. So, it is not necessary to check for the rules in the next level without missing any valid rule. So it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm is complete                         Figure 3. Algorithm for association rule generation III.

Figure 4 gives the experimental results for execution time \(generating frequent itemsets and finding rules response time of the proposed algorithm is much better than that of the Apriori algorithm. In this case, confidence value is set 90% for the rule generation, which means that all the rules generated are true in 90% of the cases  Figure 4.

Association rules and Minsup in Proposed algorithm The number of association rules decreases along with an increase in minimum support under a given specific minimum confidence, which shows an appropriate Minsupport \(or Minconfidence and avoid the occurrence of some association rules so that it cannot yield a decision. These results have shown in Figures 6 and 7. The results are as expected and quite consistent with our intuition IV. CONCLUSION In this paper, a novel method of mining frequent itemsets and faster generation of association rules has been proposed to generate frequently occur itemsets very quickly. The proposed algorithm does not produce candidate itemsets, it spends less time for calculating k-supports of the itemsets with the Boolean matrix pruned, and it scans the database only once and needs less memory space when compared with Apriori algorithm The proposed algorithm is good enough for generating association rules from spatial gene expression data very fast and memory efficient. Finally, the large and rapidly increasing compendium of data demands data mining approaches particularly association rule mining ensures that genomic data mining will continue to be a necessary and highly productive field for the foreseeable future V.

The Performance Comparison In this subsection, we would like to study the effectiveness of the max-?rst traversal strategy for real-world data sets First, as can be seen in Fig. 4, due to the ?ltering effect of the upper bound and the pruning effect of the max-?rst traversal procedure, TOP-MATA consumes much less execution time than the brute-force method. This is particularly true for small ? values.

As can be seen, in general, TOP-MATA shows a better performance than TOP-DATA. And as the increase of the ? value, the advantage tends to be even more impressive for these four data sets 4.3. The Computation Saving of TOP-MATA As can be seen in the Tab. 4, four data sets, enjoy signi?cant computation savings brought by TOP-MATA. We can conclude that the computation saving is a major factor for the performance of TOP-MATA. That is, compared with TOP-DATA, a higher computation saving implies a much better performance of TOP-MATA. Since this saving is more signi?cant as the increase of the items, TOP-MATA works better for large scale data sets with a large number of items 5. Conclusion In this paper, we studied the problem of searching for top? item pairs with the highest cosine values among all item pairs. Speci?cally, we provided a novel algorithm TOPMATA which employ a Max-First traversal strategy for ef?ciently performing top-? cosine similarity search. Extensive experimental results veri?ed the effectiveness of the algorithms, And TOP-MATA algorithm is superior to TOPDATA for large-scale data sets with multiple items Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC No. 70901002 and the Ph.D. Programs Foundation of Ministry of Education of China \(No. 20091102120014
