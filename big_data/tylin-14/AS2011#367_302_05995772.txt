However, the number of relations that has been identified does not properly represent the domain as the methods only identify a portion of the total relations from domain texts. In this paper, we present a method that increases the number of relations extracted and thus properly represent the domain. In this method, all potential relations are first generated and then less significant ones, based on their frequency, are removed. The method has been tested on a collection of texts that described electronic voting machine and the result is encouraging   Keywords- Relation Extraction; Relation Identification; Nontaxonomic relation I   I NTRODUCTION  Ontologies became an important topic in various field of study.

Even though the number of methods for constructing ontology is increasing, but most of them are only focusing in supporting the concept and taxonomic component. Not many methods focus on non-taxonomic relation component.

Concept pairs are generated based on the identified predicates and most frequent concepts   III  I DENTIFYING AND EXTRACTION OF NON TAXONOMIC RELATIONSHIPS  In this section, we present a method to identify and extract non-taxonomic relations from domain texts. Fig.1 illustrates the overall system architecture of our method. Our method consists of four steps 1  Concept Extraction 2  Predicate Identification 3  Concept Pair Identification 4  Relation Extraction and Labeling A  Concept Extraction The objective of this step is to identify all the relevant concepts. The process divided into three tasks, text preprocessing, subject-object extraction and matching task. Fig.2 shows the overview of concept extraction We first take the texts and apply part-of-speech \(POS tagging to assign parts of speech to each word by using Brill\222s Rule-based POS tagg Stop w o rd eli m i n atio n proces s is  used to eliminate words based on their high frequency of            occurrences and unrelated to the domain information by using Porter\222s stop word [12 lis t            Figure 2  Overview of concept extraction  Next, morphological analysis is used to reduce all the dissimilarity of the word forms into a singular form WordNet\222s Lemm u s ed f o r th i s proces s an d on ce the process is done, a list of terms is identified Each term is calculated to determine its relevancy in a texts domain by using term frequency-inverse document frequency \(tf.idf\ metric [14 T e rm s w i th h i g h t f id f  v a lu e a r e  selected to obtain the initial cut of the relevant terms. Relevant term will be counted as the concept for the text domain In the second task, we analyze dependency triples which are generated by MINIPAR h allo w pars er to v e ri fy t h e  subject and object of a sentence. Terms which appear as subject are put in subj where subj contains a list of terms that appear as subject. Then, terms which appear as object are put in obj where obj contains a list of terms that appear as object Next, we identify each concept which appears as subject or object in texts. We match both results produced from the previous two tasks. Task one produces a list of relevant terns meanwhile task two produces two sets of terms, i.e subj and 978-1-61284-353-7/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 100

Let S  s 1 s 2 205.,s n  is a set of concepts appear as subject where s n is a list of relevant terms that are matched in s ubj   Let O = {o 1 o 2 205.,o m  is a set of concepts appear as object where o m  is list of relevant terms that are matched in obj The relevant terms also can be a member for both S and O  B  Predicate Identification Verbs are identified from text documents using the previous text preprocessing steps an d s t op w o rd [12 i s  used to eliminate verbs which do not signify to domain texts i.e is, do, has, have,\205etc After the elimination, the identified verbs will be counted as predicate into set P where P is a set of predicate that contains all relevance verbs  Each predicate in P with similar meaning [10 w i l l  b e  grouped together. WordNet is used to identify similar meaning between all the predicates in P Table I shows some of the predicates obtain and the syno nym groups of predicates  For example P  p 1 p 2  p 3 p 4  p 6  p 1 p 3   p 2 p 4   p 6   TABLE I  E XAMPLES OF P REDICATES AND G ROUPS OF S YNONYM P REDICATES  Predicates P  produce, function, provide, work, check make, ensure, create Group of synonym predicates produce, make, create}, {function, work provide, {check, ensure  Then, we identify predicate an d concept which appear in a sentence by using dependency parser MINIPAR and represent them as predicate \(subject, object\ or p\(s,o where  p is a predicate that occurs together with a concept in a sentence  s is a concept which appears as an element in S  o is a concept which appears as an element in O  223-\224 is used when either subject or object are not exist in a sentence Once the rules have been extracted, we regroup the rules as p \(s into set PS which contains all information of predicate and subject and p \(-, o into set PO which contains all information of predicate and object  Definition 2.1 Predicate Subject\et PS = \(p 1 s 1 p 1 s 2  205., p 2 s 1 p 2 s 2 205.,\(p i s n  be a set of predicate and concept as subject that consists of all rules p\(s where p i  002  P , s n 002  S  Definition 2.2 Predicate Object\et PO = \(p 1 o 1 p 1  o 1 205.,\(p 1 o 1 p 1 o 1 205, p i o m  be a set of predicate and concept as object that consists of all rules p\(-,o where p i  002  P , o m 002 new S and b 002  O  C  Concept Pair Identification In this step, for each group of predicate, we generate concept pairs based on appear ance of predicate. For each group in P, we extract all rules in PS and in PO where p is list of predicate in each group. Then, all concepts in the extracted rules from PS will be into new S where new S  contains all concepts as subject. Similarity all concepts in the extracted rules from PO will be into new O  where new O  contains all concepts as object. After we identifying new S and new O the most frequent concepts for new S  and new O  are selected as concept pair Definition 2.3 Concept pair\. Let q   new S  x new O  we call  q  is a set of concept pairs which is the result from the Cartesian product between most frequent concepts for new S  and new O  Several restrictions are used to identify suitable pairs. We assume a,b  a  002 new O the concept pairs new S  new O  are generated using the following restrictions i  a 223not same\224 with b  or ii  a 223not synonym\224 with b or iii  a 223not is-a\224 relation with b  or iv  a 223 not part-of\224 relation with b   For example 1\ the group only contain one predicate p 6 e extract all rules in PS and PO where P  p 6  200  List of subjects and objects for p 6 are listed into  new S  and  new O  as below  new S s 1 s 7  where occurrences for s 1 4 and s 7  10 occurrences  new O  o 3 o 5 o 9  where occurrences for o 3   o 5 12 and, o 9 10 occurrences  So, the most frequent concept for new S  is  s 7  meanwhile the most frequent concepts for  new O are o 3 and  o 5  200  P 1|2 S = \(p 1 s 2 p 1 s 3 p 2 s 3 p 2 s 5  P 1|2 O = \( p 2 o 2 p 2 o 3  200  List of subjects and objects for p 6 are listed into new S  and new O as below  978-1-61284-353-7/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 101 200  Hence, we generate concept  pair  q =  {s 7 x {o 3 o 5  s 7 o 3 s 7 o 5    Concept pair q= {s 7 o 3 s 7 o 5  2\ the group contain more than one predicates, i.e. \(p 1 p 2  we extract all rules in PS and PO, where P p 1  and p 2  200  P 6 S = \(p 6 s 1 p 6 s 7  P 6 O = \(p 6 o 3 p 6 o 5 p 6 o 9

R is a total rules extracted. Predicate that has highest degree of support count with concept pair are considered as suitable relationship for that concept pair.

First, voting machine domain texts are applied with concept ex traction and set S and O are identified. For example list of concepts as subject S  machine, voter, company, paper and list of concepts as object O= {machine, paper, voter  In the second step, list of predicate are identified and for example P= {produce, audit, create, provide Next, we grouped it with similar meaning using WordNet. Thus P produce, create}, {audit}, {provide  Then, in the third step, predicate and concept which is occurred in a sentence are identified and we represent them into predicate \(subject, object Example sentence in this text domain as following Sentence1 223This machine can produce many records.\224 So, we extract this sentence using Minipar parser into rule  produce \(machine, record After the rule has been extracted we regroup the rules into PS and PO Set PS produce \(machine, \d Set PO produce\(-, record  Next, concept pairs are generated based on items in group of predicate. For example, we extract all rules in PS and PO where P = {produce, create  P produce\\ create S = \(produce \(machine     create \(company P produce|create O = \(create \(-, paper From the above rules, list of subjects and objects for p 6 are listed into new S and new O as below  new S machine, company}, where occurrences for machine, company = 10    occurrences new O paper} , where occurrences for paper = 12 occurrences The most frequent occurrences concepts for new S and new O  are selected to be generated as concept pair Thus, the Cartesian product between most frequent concepts new S  and new O   Concept pair  q new S  x  new O    machine, company x paper    machine, paper}, {company, paper For predicate produce and create both of them are predicates for concept pair machine, paper and company paper Finally, we need to find either produce or create is suitable for both concept pair respectively using \(1 i.

We then evaluate the precision of the results with the domain expert. The precision is defined as the percentage of all relations which are correctly extracted To test our approach, we select Electronic Voting Machine domain. Our text corpus extracted from New York Times website consists of 20 documents To increase the number of relations in domain texts, the extracted predicates which are id entified as synonym to each other using WordNet are grouped together. Example of predicate and the group of synonym predicates are shown in Table 1 in Section III. Then, for each synonym group of predicates, the most frequent concepts which occur together in a sentence or occur in different sentences are generated as concept pair To label the most suitable identified relation for a pair of concepts, the support count \(sprt is defined. As mention in section III, any predicates that have the highest degree of support count are considered as the most suitable relations to label the concept pair. For example sprt\(state, machine  provide is 0.75, meanwhile sprt\(state, machine offer is 0.25. Therefore provide is considered as the most suitable relationship for state, machine rom the observation of the support count results, it shows that the support count can be used to label relations between concepts by counting the frequency of each predicate occurs with its concepts. But we think that by using only the high degree of support count may not enough to label the relationship appropriately  Table VI shows some of relations obtained with the proposed method to increase the number of relations in the domain text. In Table VII, each of triples relations in \(S, P, O S is a concept as subject and O is an object of predicate P and both subject and object are occur together in a same sentence Meanwhile, P\(S, O\hows the increases of relations obtain for subject and object which is occur in different sentences by grouping the predicates with similar meaning. For example  provide, offer a synonym predicate for concept pair state machine here state and machine are the most frequent concepts as subject and object respectively and both concepts appear in different sentences TABLE VI  E XAMPLES OF P ROPOSED M ETHOD R ELATIONS R ESULT  S, P, O P\(S,O machine p roduce paper voter record vote company provide  machine official tell voter  p rovide, o ff er state, machine check, control, hold, ensure voter, election produce, make, create voter, machine function, work, run, serve machine, election read, record, understand machine, process want, require official, machine    TABLE VII  T OTAL R ELATIONS O BTAIN F ROM SVO  T RIPLES M ETHOD AND P ROPOSED M ETHOD  Method Number of Concept pair S, P, O P\(S,O Total nontaxonomic relations SVO Triples 17 12 - 12 Proposed Method 22 12 10 22   In table VII, the initial column shows the method applied Second column shows the number of identified concept pairs Third and fourth column shows the number of extracted potential relations between concept pair that occurs in a sentence and the number of extracted potential relations between concept pair that occurs in different sentences respectively. The fifth column shows the total relations extracted for each method From table VII, SVO methods identified 17 pair of concept pairs which 12 potential relations are extracted between concept pair that occur together in a sentence. However, the proposed method identified 22 pairs of concept pair which 12 potential relations are extracted for concept pairs that occur together in a same sentence similar to the SVO methods. In addition, the proposed method is able to extract 10 potential relations for concept pairs that occur from difference sentences. The generated concept pairs are based on group of predicates. This experiments shows that the proposed method can be used to increase number of relations TABLE VIII  E VALUATION OF SVO  T RIPLES M ETHOD AND P ROPOSED M ETHOD  Method Number of Concept pair Number of Non-taxonomic Relations SVO Triples 65.38 45.45 Proposed Method 84.61 77.27  We then evaluate the precision of the results in Table VII with the domain expert. In Table VIII, second column indicates the precision of the methods according to total number of concept pairs obtain Meanwhile, the third column shows the percentages the number of non-taxonomic relations obtains for each method. From Table VIII, the results of the proposed method indicate that it is able to increase the number of relations extracted to represent the whole domain texts 978-1-61284-353-7/11/$26.00 ©2011 IEEE 104 


 VI  CONCLUSIONS  AND  FUTURE  WORK We have presented a method to identify and extract nontaxonomic relations between concepts in different sentences Given texts of a domain as input, text pre-processing is applied on it to identified relevant concepts and predicates of the domain. Each predicate with similar meaning are grouped together. We represented each sentence into rules that consist of predicate and concept. For each groups of predicate, all rules that contain same predicate are extracted. Then, all concepts in the extracted rules are grouped as subject and object based on position in the text and the most frequent concepts from each group \(i.e. subject and object\are generated as concept pairs. We defined support count to find the most suitable predicates to label the relationships.   The experiment results have shown that this method is useful to identify relations between concepts even the pair of concepts are in the different sentences  However, it is not sufficient by considering only the most frequent concepts to be accepted as the concept pairs  Even though the proposed method is useful to extract non-taxonomic relations from texts but further research is needed to label the relations appropriately   R EFERENCES   1  R.

VII  C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK  Subgroup discovery is referring to discovery of relations among attributes and predicted classes. This problem has been generally studied in the past with techniques enabled by statistics, datamining and human experts. It is considered as a hybrid between predictive modeling and descriptive analysis where subgroups of similar data are formed pertaining to predicting a particular target class. In this paper, we proposed a novel method for subgroup discovery by using Bayesian network. By this method, probabilities of likenesses for each relation can be explicitly calculated \(that has an advantage of white-box modeling\ and each subgroup can be represented by rules that are readily interpretable for modeling the relations We verified this method by using a small example and reasonable results are produced preliminarily. In the future, we would be working on constructi ng a software prototype that implements this new scheme. We will be putting it to work on actual datasets in large volume so that their results can be further evaluated and compared against other subgroup discovery algorithms for benchmarking. We are also working on evaluating the performance of various quality functions other than WRAcc\ for the purpose of subgroup discovery Considering the good results that Bayesian network has achieved in classification, it is believed that it can yield good results in subgroup discovery scheme as well  R EFERENCES   1  J.

B b \(6 Fig. 2. ARAM neural network If any of the inequalities of \(6 inhibited, if all nodes are inhibited, a new uncommitted node is added. The Match Tracking process is started if needed When each match criterion is satisfied in the respective module, resonance occurs and the learning process follows During learning the selected node K learns to encode the input and target vectors by adjusting its weight vectors W aK and W bK similarly to \(5 B. Multi-label Extensions It has been shown in [7] that standard algorithms do not perform well on the muti-label datasets due to the use of the WTA rule \(2 been proposed: A set of Nb best categories with the largest activation values is chosen according to the rule: a category k is included in the set, if the relative difference \(TK?Tk is below a predefined fraction t of the activation range r = TK ? Tmin, where Tmin is the minimum activation of committed neurons. Activations of the Nb categories are subsequently normalized, uk = TkPN b s=1 Ts The resulting distributed output pattern P is calculated as follows P Nb s=1 usps. \(7 where for FAM ps = W br with r such that W ab sr = 1 which means that between neurons s of ARTa and r of ARTb an association in the Map field exists, and ps = W bs for ARAM. Thus, P contains a score for each label that is proportional to the number of neurons among the Nb best categories predicting this label. Since the fast learning of ART networks leads to varying performance with the input presentation order, voting across several networks trained with different orderings of a training set improves classi 


fication performance. The sum over the output of Equation 7 pattern P , which is used to determine the predicted classes Finally, a postprocessing filter method [12] is applied: the signals P are sorted descendingly, then all corresponding output classes are included in the multi-label up to the point of maximum decrease in the signal size from one class to the next A small modification is made in the ARTb weights, which now count label occurrences during learning by increasing their values by 1 each time the corresponding multi-label is presented. This modification leads to changes in the ARTb activation calculation of ML-FAM which is Tk = |B?W bk Another difference between the multi-label and the standard algorithms is that the former ones do not use Match Tracking with raising vigilance: The winner is simply inhibited C. Comparison of Classifiers To compare the two ART-based networks with other MLclassifiers, we chosen ML-kNN described in [8] and BoosTexter [9] which is an implementation of Boosting for the field of text categorization, based on the well-known AdaBoost algorithm [15]. ML-kNN and BoosTexter were chosen since these popular MC algorithms are nearest-neighbor- and rulebased, respectively, and therefore allow a comparison of the results of ML-FAM and ML-ARAM with algorithms based on other approaches than neural networks IV. PROXIMITY MEASURES FOR HIERARCHIES Approaches for quantitative comparison of graphs and trees are either defined on an abstract level, taking into account only the pure graph structure, or make use of the field specific semantics encoded in the graph. From the former category, we utilized the Constrained Tree Edit Distance CTED  whereas Taxonomic Overlap \(TO  field of concept representation, which also deals with hierarchical structures encoded in graphs and trees. Additionally the Lowest Common Ancestor Path Distance \(LCAPD new tree distance measure, developed especially for the type of hierarchies common in HMC. A description of the mutual differences between these measures and the motivation for the development of a new metric are given at the end of this section 


A. Constrained Tree Edit Distance CTED [10] is based upon the idea of transforming one hierarchy into another via certain local editing operations The distance between two hierarchies is the minimum total number of operations needed for transforming the one into the other. Three modification operations are considered: A node i is deleted by transmitting its children to its parent and removing i from the hierarchy. Inserting is the complement of deleting: Inserting i as a child of j makes i the parent of some subset of the children of j. Changing a node means changing its label. In order to make computation in polynomial time possible, the constraint that disjoint subtrees have to be mapped to disjoint subtrees is included in the definition [10], [16 The original definition does not include any normalization For two hierarchies with q labels each, 2q is the highest possible CTED  corresponding to deleting all labels of the first hierarchy and inserting all labels of the second hierarchy We normalize the CTED by 12q which results in distances in 0, 1 B. Taxonomic Overlap TO [11] compares the nodes of two hierarchies according to how many ancestors and descendants they share. We describe a version adapted to our experiments. Define semantic cotopy as SC\(i,H i j Given two hierarchies H1 and H2, the corresponding overlap for i ? L is defined as O\(i,H1, H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 SC\(i,H1 i,H2 Note that this is a symmetric expression in H1 and H2 with values in [0, 1]. The TO of H1 and H2 is the average of all overlaps TO\(H1, H2 1 q  i?L O\(i,H1, H2 For two identical hierarchies, TO is 1, while it is 0 if H1 and H2 are totally unrelated. Since the two other hierarchy 


proximity measures used in the experiments are distances with smaller values indicating higher similarity TO? := 1? TO to simplify comparisons C. LCA-Path Tree Distance Since in a hierarchy a parent is a more general concept than any of its children, the locations of the same label i in two hierarchies H1 and H2 can be compared by how far one has to travel up the chain of ancestors in both hierarchies until a common ancestor is found. For a label i ? L the depth dH\(i 0 dH\(i pH\(i a1, . . . , av the ancestors of i in H1, such that a1 = pH1\(i a2 = pH1\(a1 i common ancestor of i in H1 and H2, lca\(i,H1, H2 first ancestor of i in H1 which is also an ancestor of i in H2 j? := min  j | j ? {1, . . . , v} such that aj ? AH2\(i  lca\(i,H1, H2 Since 0 is an ancestor of all labels in all hierarchies, the LCA always exists. Note that usually lca\(i,H1, H2 lca\(i,H2, H1 We use the LCA to measure how far apart the positions of a label in both hierarchies are: If a label i has the same parent in both hierarchies it is regarded as being in the same position, otherwise the distances of i to its LCA in both hierarchies are used to measure how far apart both locations are. The cost for i is defined as d\(i,H1, H2 2 k=1 dHk\(i lca\(i,H1, H2 D\(i,H1, H2  0, if pH1\(i i d\(i,H1, H2 8 This can be seen as the length of the path from i to lca\(i,H1, H2 i,H1, H2 As D is not symmetric, the complete LCA-path distance

Comparison All three hierarchy proximity measures presented above reflect different concepts of tree similarity. It is thus not surprising that CTED and TO*, although they perform well in the domains they were designed for, may produce counterintuitive results when used in the field of HE. This is demonstrated by the hierarchies shown in Figure 3: Despite the fact that the relationships between the nodes in both hierarchies are completely different, their CTED and TO are 0.33 and 0.44, respectively. Their LCAPD, on the other hand, is 1.00. Thus only LCAPD marks both hierarchies with the highest possible distance Some hierarchies used in our experiments contain nodes with exactly one child \(single-child labels that TO* does not distinguish between such labels and their children, in the following sense: Given a hierarchy H and a single-child node i, we denote with H ? the hierarchy 


that is obtained from H by swapping i and its child. Then TO?\(H,H CTED or LCAPD V. EXPERIMENTS We tested the proposed data mining system with four multi-label classifiers: ML-FAM, ML-ARAM, ML-kNN and BoosTexter on three real-world datasets with increasing complexity from the text-mining field. In our experiments we compared extracted hierarchies to the original hierarchy by means of three hierarchy proximity measures: LCAPD CTED, and TO The experimental setup of ML-FAM and ML-ARAM had the following parameter values: choice parameter 0.0001; learning rates ?a,b = 1.0 for fast learning; vigilance parameters ?a = 0.9 and ?b = 1.0. The parameter t was chosen to be 0.05 for the 20 newsgroups dataset and 0.02 for the other datasets. The number of voters V was set to 9 Following [8], we used 10 nearest neighbors \(k = 10 Laplace smoothing \(s = 1 BoosTexter was trained using 500 boosting rounds as in 8] and the threshold for converting rankings into multi-labels was set to 0 [9 A. Multi-label Classification Performance Measures We used a large set of performance measures for evaluation of the MC experiments: First, two example-based measures for multi-label predictions: Accuracy \(A measure \(F  of the predicted labels are actually present while F-measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall calculated on the per-instance basis. The larger the A and F values, the better the MC performance Then two label-based measures were calculated on the basis of binary counts for each label: the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives We used the micro-averaged version of F1 with the binary measures counted on the whole test set. The perfect performance corresponds to F1 = 1. Additionally, micro-averaged precision and recall were used for computing the Area Under a Precision-Recall Curve \(AUPRC  precision corresponds to the proportion of predicted labels in the test set that are correct and recall to the proportion of labels that are correctly predicted. AUPRC has been claimed 


to be a well-suited performance measure for MC tasks where the number of negative instances significantly exceeds the number of positive instances [6]. Another advantage of AUPRC is its global nature and independence of a certain threshold value. The closer the AUPRC value is to 1, the better the performance Since these measures are based on the comparison of multi-labels, they depend on a transformation from rankings to classes. As a contrast we also used four wellknown ranking-based performance measures: One-Error OE RL C cision \(AP  for all ranking-based performance measures except AP. OneError evaluates how many times the top-ranked label is not in the set of proper labels of the instance. Ranking Loss is defined as the average fraction of pairs of labels that are ordered incorrectly. Coverage evaluates how far we need, on average, to go down the list of labels in order to cover all the proper labels of the instance. Average Precision evaluates the average fraction of labels ranked above a particular label i ? mt which actually are in mt And finally, the special hierarchical loss function H-loss 2] were utilized. Following [3], normalized costs were calculated: ci := 1/|c\(p\(i i ? L i of all direct children of i. Hierarchical loss \(H-loss consider mistakes made in subtrees of incorrectly predicted labels and penalizes only the first mistake along the path from the root to a node. The smaller the H-loss value, the better the performance B. 20 Newsgroups Dataset We modified the popular single-label dataset 20 Newsgroups [18], [19] by considering eight additional labels corresponding to the intermediate levels of the hierarchy faith, recreation, recreation/sport, recreation/vehicles, politics, computer, computer/hardware, science. This dataset is a collection of almost 20,000 postings from 20 newsgroups sorted by date into training \(60 40 data were preprocessed by discarding all words appearing only in the test documents and all words found in the stop word list [20]. Afterwards, all but the 2%-most-frequent words were eliminated to reduce the dimensionality. Documents were represented using the well-known TF-IDF \(Term 


Frequency  Inverse Document Frequency scheme [19]. The TF-IDF weights were then normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Conversion to TF-IDF and normalization were performed separately for training and test data. This resulted in the 1,070-dimensional dataset with 11,256 training instances, 7,493 test ones and 28 labels To test the performance of two HE algorithms, we first extracted hierarchies from the True Test Multi-Labels \(TTML and calculated the corresponding proximity measures. Both algorithms successfully extracted the original hierarchy We studied the performance of the multi-label classifiers and their ability to infer the class hierarchies in the presence of only partly available hierarchical information. We performed a series of HE experiments with multi-labels having a decreasing number of inserted non-leaf labels describing the levels in the hierarchy. We randomly removed such labels from 20%, 30%, and 40% of the training instances leaving them single-labeled. The results for predicted test multilabels are shown in Table I where the bold face marks the best classifier, and the first column \(left result of HE by Voting and the second \(right Thresholding \(referred as GT Comparing classification performance, one can see that the ART-based networks are superior to both the other classifiers in terms of most performance measures and that ML-FAM slightly outperforms ML-ARAM. Taken together they win on at least 6 and at most 8 out of 9 evaluation measures. BoosTexter has the second best performance, but its predictive power degrades more quickly with the increase in the number of single-label instances. The poorest MC results were shown by ML-kNN, its performance decreased very fast with any reduction in the number of multi-labels For example, F1 decreased by 15% while removing 40% of labels instead of 30%. It is also interesting to note that when trained on the dataset with 40% removed labels, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM significantly outperformed ML-kNN trained on the original dataset with all labels The hierarchy proximity measures confirm the good quality of predictions produced by the ART-based networks: The hierarchies were correct extracted by both HE algorithms of Section II-B even with 40% removed labels. The predictions of ML-kNN were the worst: The Voting variant of the HE 


algorithm could not extract the correct hierarchy with 30 assigning five labels incorrectly to the root label. None of the HE algorithms could extract the correct hierarchy in the absence of 40% multi-labels. With 40% and Voting, the number of labels falsely assigned to the root was 13, while with GT it was only three. For BoosTexter, Voting assigned two labels wrongly to the root label in the experiment with TABLE I 20 NEWSGROUPS ALL, -20%, -30% AND -40% RESULTS Measure all 20% 30% 40%ARAM FAM kNN BoosT.

GT resulted in zero distances in the both cases. Assigning more labels to the root creates more shallow and wider hierarchies \(trivial case as stated before The good hierarchy extraction with ART networks demonstrates the system robustness  even with strongly damaged data the system can rebuild the original hierarchy C. RCV1-v2 Dataset The next experiment was based on the tokenized version of 


the RCV1-v2 dataset introduced in [21]. Only the topics label set consisting of 103 labels arranged in a hierarchy of depth four is examined here. Documents of the original training set of 23,149 were converted to TF-IDF weights and normalized Afterwards the set was splitted in 15,000 randomly selected documents as training and the remaining as test samples In this case, the Voting variant of HE applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values 0.12, 0.15 and 0.13, respectively. The corresponding values of the GT variant are 0.05, 0.07 and 0.05. The poor performance of the Voting method is due to the fact that for the TTML only very high threshold values succeed in removing enough noise The Voting results are thus dominated by bad hierarchies extracted for all but the highest thresholds The classification and HE results for this dataset are shown in Table II. ML-ARAM has better performance results on this data set in all points than ML-FAM except for RL being the best of all classifiers in terms of the multi-label performance measures. BoosTexter is the best in terms of all ranking measures For both HE algorithms the distances of BoosTexter are the best, those of ML-FAM second, followed ML-ARAM and ML-kNN. All three distance measures correlate. Interesting is also that for ML-kNN the distance values obtained by both HE methods are almost the same The hierarchy extracted by GT from the TTML has much lower distances values as compared with the hierarchies extracted by both methods from predicted multi-labels. This reflects a specific problem of HE, since only a small fraction of the incorrectly classified multi-labels can prevent building of a proper hierarchy. For example, 16.5% of misassigned labels in the extracted hierarchy are responsible for about 80% of LCAPD calculated from the predictions of MLARAM. This large part of the HE error is caused by only 4% of the test data. Under these circumstances the other distances behave analogically. Most labels were not assigned making them trivial edges, but six labels were assigned to a false branch. This can happen when labels have a strong correlation and in the step Hierarchy Construction of the basic algorithm the parent is not unique in the confidence matrix. BoosTexters results suffer less from this problem because it generally sets more labels for each test sample 


Both HE algorithms behaved similarly on the predictions of the ART networks. They constructed a deeper hierarchy than the original one and wrongly assigned the same 11 labels to the root node. The higher distances come from Voting assigning more labels to the wrong branch. For MLkNN both algorithms again create very similar hierarchy trees, both misassigned 28 labels to the root label. For BoosTexter it was seven with Voting and eight with GT Voting produced a deeper hierarchy here D. WIPO-alpha Dataset The WIPO-alpha dataset1 comprises patent documents collected by the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO ments. Preprocessing was performed as follows: From each document, the title, abstract and claims texts were extracted stop words were removed using the list from [20] and words were stemmed using the Snowball stemmer [22]. All but the 1%-most-frequent stems were removed, the remaining stems were converted to TF-IDF weights and these were normalized to the range of [0, 1]. Again, TF-IDF conversion and normalization were done independently for the training and the test set. The original hierarchy consists, from top to bottom, of 8 sections, 120 classes, 630 subclasses and about 69,000 groups. In our experiment, only records from the sections A \(5802 training and 5169 test samples H \(5703 training and 5926 test samples 1http://www.wipo.int/classifications/ipc/en/ITsupport/Categorization dataset/wipo-alpha-readme.html August 2009 TABLE II RCV1-V2 RESULTS Measure ARAM FAM kNN BoosT A 0.748 0.731 0.651 0.695 F1 0.795 0.777 0.735 0.769 F 0.805 0.787 0.719 0.771 OE 0.077 0.089 0.104 0.063 RL 0.087 0.086 0.026 0.015 C 11.598 11.692 8.563 5.977 AP 0.868 0.860 0.839 0.873 AUPRC 0.830 0.794 0.807 0.838 H-loss 0.068 0.077 0.097 0.081 Wins 4 0 0 5 LCAPD 0.29 0.22 0.25 0.20 0.34 0.34 0.21 0.18

Both main and secondary codes were used in the experiment, although codes pointing to groups outside of sections A and H were ignored. We also removed groups that did not contain at least 30 training and 30 test records \(and any documents that only belonged to such small groups 7,364 test records with 924 attributes each and a label set of size 131 In this case, the Voting variant of the HE algorithm applied to the TTML resulted in the LCAPD, CTED and TO* values of 0.13, 0.12 and 0, respectively. GT showed the same values. Remarkable are the TO* distances, which are equal to 0. This is due to the fact that the WIPO-alpha hierarchy contains 16 single-child labels that are not partitioned by the true multi-labels: whenever a single-child label j is contained in a multi-label, so is its child, and vice versa. It is therefore theoretically impossible to deduce from the multilabels which of them is the parent of the other. As a result the HE algorithms often choose the wrong parent, resulting in higher LCAPD and CTED values. TO*, as described above is invariant under such choices The results obtained on the WIPO-alpha dataset are shown in Table III. The classification performance of the ART-based networks on this dataset is slightly worse than that of BoosTexter. Mostly in the terms of OE, RL, C, AP, AUPRC, and H-loss measures BoosTexter is better because its rankings are better and it assigned more labels to each sample. But the ART networks have better HE results because their predicted labels are more consistent with the original hierarchy. MLkNN has the worst classification results and distance values again. The reason for the high relative difference between LCAPD as well as CTED and TO* obtained for the ART networks or BoosTexter as compared to the results of the other datasets is because most of the labels were assigned in the right branch but not exactly where they belong Both HE algorithms extracted the same hierarchy from the predictions of ML-ARAM and a very similar hierarchy for ML-FAM.

Here, GT extracted a much worse hierarchy as shown by CTED being 0.15 higher for GT than for Voting For BoosTexter both HE methods built the same hierarchy and no label was wrongly assigned to the root. All extracted hierarchies were one level deeper than the original one Although Voting produced worse hierarchies than GT on two previous datasets, this time its distance values were comparable or even better. In comparison to Voting, GT has higher values for all distances on the multi-labels of MLkNN. Voting has the advantage of being a much simpler method and of being more dataset independent. Still the tree distances have the same ranking order for all classifiers for both HE methods VI. CONCLUSION In this paper we studied Hierarchical Multi-label Classification \(HMC tive was to derive hierarchical relationships between output classes from predicted multi-labels automatically. We have developed a data-mining-system based on two recently proposed multi-label extensions of the FAM and ARAM neural networks: ML-FAM and ML-ARAM as well as on a Hierarchy Extraction \(HE algorithm builds association rules from label co-occurrences 


and has two modifications. The presented approach is general enough to be used with any other multi-label classifier or HE algorithm. We have also developed a new tree distance measure for quantitative comparison of hierarchies In extensive experiments made on three text-mining realworld datasets, ML-FAM and ML-ARAM were compared against two state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers: ML-kNN and BoosTexter. The experimental results confirm that the proposed approach is suitable for extracting middle and large-scale class hierarchies from predicted multi-labels.

the US census data set. The size of pilot sample is 2000, and all 50 rules are derived from this pilot sample. In this experiment the ?xed value x for the sample size is set to be 300. The attribute income is considered as a differential attribute, and the difference of income of husband and wife is studied in this experiment.

Dataset procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the US census data set. The results are also similar to the experiment results for association rule mining: there is a consistent trade off between the estimation variance and sampling cost by setting their weights. Our proposed methods have better performance than simple random sampling method 


We also evaluated the performance of our methods on the Yahoo! dataset. The size of pilot sampling is 2000, and the xed value x for the sample size is 200. The attribute price is considered as the target attribute. Figure 4 shows the performance of the 5 sampling procedures on the problem of differential rule mining on the Yahoo! dataset. The results are very similar to those from the previous experiments VI. RELATED WORK We now compare our work with the existing work on sampling for association rule mining, sampling for database aggregation queries, and sampling for the deep web Sampling for Association Rule Mining: Sampling for frequent itemset mining and association rule mining has been studied by several researchers [23], [21], [11], [6]. Toivonen [23] proposed a random sampling method to identify the association rules which are then further veri?ed on the entire database. Progressive sampling [21], which is based on equivalence classes, involves determining the required sample size for association rule mining FAST [11], a two-phase sampling algorithm, has been proposed to select representative transactions, with the goal of reducing computation cost in association rule mining.A randomized counting algorithm [6] has been developed based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for counting the number of frequent itemsets Our work is different from these sampling methods, since we consider the problem of association rule mining on the deep web. Because the data records are hidden under limited query interfaces in these systems, sampling involves very distinct challenges Sampling for Aggregation Queries: Sampling algorithms have also been studied in the context of aggregation queries on large data bases [18], [1], [19], [25]. Approximate Pre-Aggregation APA  categorical data utilizing precomputed statistics about the dataset Wu et al. [25] proposed a Bayesian method for guessing the extreme values in a dataset based on the learned query shape pattern and characteristics from previous workloads More closely to our work, Afrati et al. [1] proposed an adaptive sampling algorithm for answering aggregation queries on hierarchical structures. They focused on adaptively adjusting the sample size assigned to each group based on the estimation error in each group. Joshi et al.[19] considered the problem of 


estimating the result of an aggregate query with a very low selectivity. A principled Bayesian framework was constructed to learn the information obtained from pilot sampling for allocating samples to strata Our methods are clearly distinct for these approaches. First strata are built dynamically in our algorithm and the relations between input and output attributes are learned for sampling on output attributes. Second, the estimation accuracy and sampling cost are optimized in our sample allocation method Hidden Web Sampling: There is recent research work [3 13], [15] on sampling from deep web, which is hidden under simple interfaces. Dasgupta et al.[13], [15] proposed HDSampler a random walk scheme over the query space provided by the interface, to select a simple random sample from hidden database Bar-Yossef et al.[3] proposed algorithms for sampling suggestions using the public suggestion interface. Our algorithm is different from their work, since our goal is sampling in the context of particular data mining tasks. We focus on achieving high accuracy with a low sampling cost for a speci?c task, instead of simple random sampling VII. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we have proposed strati?cation based sampling methods for data mining on the deep web, particularly considering association rule mining and differential rule mining Components of our approach include: 1 the relation between input attributes and output attributes of the deep web data source, 2 maximally reduce an integrated cost metric that combines estimation variance and sampling cost, and 3 allocation method that takes into account both the estimation error and the sampling costs Our experiments show that compared with simple random sampling, our methods have higher sampling accuracy and lower sampling cost. Moreover, our approach allows user to reduce sampling costs by trading-off a fraction of estimation error 332 6DPSOLQJ9DULDQFH
