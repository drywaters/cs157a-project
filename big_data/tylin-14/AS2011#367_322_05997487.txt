  Application Analysis of Clementine based Data Mining Algorithm Lu Ansheng Department of Computer & Information Engineering Wuhan Polytechnic University  Wuhan ,China lasgnw@sina.com  Abstract  This paper presents a case of application of data mining of intentional house purchase factors The data were collected fr om the Wuhan Real Estate Bureau by questionnaire. With a focus on data 
mining process, we analyze the data mining model and its application based on Clementine package Key words 002 Data mining; Logistic; C5 decision tree; Apriori; intention of house purchasing I  I NTRODUCTION  In order to clearly understand the housing status of urban residents and provide truthful, reliable and detailed information for the planning of urban housing construction and development, the city’s real estate 
bureau conducted a comprehensive housing survey on urban residents. The index system for the housing survey consists of 49 indexes and 192 variables in six aspects, including housing composition, housing quality housing usage, housing difference, housing reform, and housing market. The survey was completed through household interviews and questionnaire, with 160, 000 pieces of records entered in the database. A large number of data from the housing survey provides a very 
solid basis for assisting real estate administrations and developers in decision-making. The SPSS statistics software and Clementine data mining tool were used to analyze the housing survey data. Clementine is a very user-friendly and functionally powerful data mining integrated environment with a graphical menu-driven interface and drag-and-drop operations. The paper introduces process and method of using Clementine to realize data mining for housing purchase intention 
factors. In the records of housing purchase intentions in the future 5 years, the group with housing purchase intention in 2 years was classified as type 1 and the group without housing purchase intention was classified as type 2. The main means for type 1 to change houses the means to raise housing funds, structure of newly purchased house, expected amount of funds requirement for house type, professional type and nature of the unit were primarily analyzed in order to understand the main features and types of type 1 people 
intended to purchase house  II  M INING P ROCESS OF H OUSE P URCHASE I NTENTION D ATA  After using SPSS to complete statistics and analysis of housing survey data, the characteristics of people in various districts intended to buy house in the next 2 to 5 years were further analyzed. The CRISP-DM standard was followed during the data mining process  
A.  Business understanding Considering that the real estate market has continued to heat up in recent years, we analyzed the people intended to buy house in the next 2 to 5 years  B.  Data understanding The means to raise funds for house purchase structure of newly bought house, newly bought house expected amount of funds, selection of means to change house were analyzed. The housing inconsistencies include: inconsistency between residence type and house, inconsistency between financial income and 
house, inconsistency between career type and house and inconsistency between work type and house  C.  Data preparation Records of people with a house purchase intention were extracted from the database and the attributes were screened and discretized. After the processing, the data set was shown in Figure 1 and the data set variables were described in Figure 2

Modeling The sampling records of people intended to buy house within 5 years were used as the training data set and people intended to buy house within 2 years were further analyzed. Clementine provides a wide range of data mining models, including neural network, decision tree, cluster analysis, correlation analysis, factor analysis, regression analysis and so on, as shown in Figure 3. Among them, Logistic regression, C5 decision tree and Apriori association rule are three appropriate data mining models for analysis of house purchase intention  Figure 3 Clementine Data Mining Models E  Model evaluation and result deployment In order to obtain satisfactory data mining results, a variety of data mining models should be comprehensively used to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the data models and provide reasonable comments on the results through repeated operation and evaluation according to the ch aracteristics of data from the training data set.

C5 decision tree a\5 approach C5 is a decision tree generation algorithm developed on the basis of C4.5. A decision tree is a tree structure using the attributes of samples as the nodes and the values of the attributes as the branches. It is generated through analysis and summarization of the attributes of a large number of samples by using the information theory. The root nodes of the decision tree are the attributes with the largest amount of information among all samples. The middle nodes are the attributes with the largest amount of information among sample sub-sets included in the sub-trees with the root nodes as the root The leaf nodes of a decision tree are the ordinal values of the samples  Decision tree is a form of knowledge representation It is a highly concentrated summary of all sample data In other words, the decision tree can accurately identify the types of all samples and effectively identify the types of new samples  b\esults and analysis All attributes of the training data set were discretized.

  some rules. For example, among 150 pieces of records of intention to buy house within 5 years, there are 134 pieces of records of intention to buy house within 2 years, accounting for 89.33%. Most buyers in this district are workers of state-owned enterprises amounting to 88 cases. Their housing funds mainly come from self-raised funds \(15 cases\d provident fund loans \(22 cases\d the funds to be used are mainly below 80, 000 yuan  C.  Apriori association rule a\priori approach The association rule is used to mine and find interesting associations or relevant connections between item-sets among a large amount of data. It is an important research subject in the district of data mining With the association rule, first all frequent sets are mined. The frequency of these frequent sets is at least the same the predefined minimum support. Then, the frequent sets generate strong association rules, which must satisfy the minimum support and the minimum confidence. The general performance of mining with association rule is determined by the first step. The step is relatively easy  b\esults and analysis Operational results of Apriori mining model is shown in Figure 6  Figure 6 Apriori Association Rule Figure 6 lists 6 association rules that satisfy the minimum support of 5 and the minimum confidence of 30%, rules: C1=1, C2=1, C3=2, C5=2, indicating that the demand of intentional buyers is: intention to buy within 2 years \(C1=1\econd-handed house \(C=1 two-bedroom \(C3=20 th 8 th floor \(C5=2 IV  C ONCLUSION  In the citywide residents’ housing survey jointly carried out by the Municipal Real Estate Bureau and the Municipal Statistics Bureau, 157, 211 valid questionnaires were recovered, with a pass rate of 97.76.3%. The survey results are consistent with the basic facts, and are highly credible and effective. After using SPSS to complete statistics and analysis of housing survey data, the characteristics of people in various districts intended to buy house in the next 2 to 5 years were further analyzed. In order to obtain satisfactory data mining results, a variety of data mining models should be comprehensively used to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the data models and provide reasonable comments on the results through repeated operation and ev aluation according to the characteristics of data from the training data set  Clementine provides a wide range of data mining models, including neural network, decision tree, cluster analysis, correlation analysis, factor analysis, regression analysis and so on. Through our experiment, Logistic regression, C5 decision tree and Apriori association rule are three appropriate data mining models for analysis of house purchase intention  C5 decision tree can interpret intuitively and according to rules and is suitable for in-depth analysis of a specific attribute. The Apriori association rule usually discovers the factors affecting the house purchase intention of large-population groups \(workers state-owned enterprises\ while neglects the associated factors of house purchase intention of small-population groups \(such as: medical staff, justice units\ fact these small-population groups enjoy a high possibility of house purchase. Logistic can effectively solve this issue. In addition, Logistic also has a strong capacity of single-factor analysis. Through comprehensive comparison, it is concluded that Logistic analysis method is the most suitable for mining house purchase intention data  R EFERENCES   m ed Kan t ardzic 002 Data Mining T s i n ghu a  University Press. 2003 2 S he n Q i j u n S A S S t a t i s t i c a l A n a l ysi s  M   So ut he a s t  University Publishing House. 2001 3 Z ho u X i a o mi ng G ua n W e nj i ng  Lo gi st i c  Re gr e s si o n  Analysis of Various Factors Affecting Customer Credit Risk i n a n c i a l C o mpu t er of H u a n a n 2003   4 C he n W e n w e i  H ua n g J i n c a i  D a t a W a r e ho use a nd  Data Mining j i n g  Pos t s  T e l ecom Pres s  2004

mining procedures. Our motivation in this study is to utilize the redundancy for extracting algorithm of fuzzy association rules IV. IMPROVEMENT OF APRIORI ALGORITHM BASED ON If max{Conf\(Z ? y X ? y max{CF\(Z ? y X ? y ZEQ Proof From the assumption, there exist P E Q that satisfY Con/\(P ? y X ? Y P ? y 0: CF\(X ? Y CF\(X ? y P ? Y Z ? V ZEQ 70 The necessary point in the Apriori algorithm for extracting association rules is to generate the frequent item sets efficiently Though the confidence of the association rules are calculated mally after all decision of frequent itemsets in traditional Apriori algorithm, the basic idea of our proposal is that the confidence of the rule can be calculated after each step A3 in the Apriori algorithm and used for pruning the redundant itemsets. The issue is to decide which itemset should be pruned utilizing the confidence information. Then we define "strong redundant rule" and "strong redundant itemset Confidence 1.0 2 3 4 The number of items Figure 2. Conceptual Diagram of Pruning Method Definition 2: Let X ? Y be a fuzzy association rule, where X and Yare fuzzy item sets. Let Q be Q = 2 x - X If min\(ConJ\(Z ?Y X ?Y ZEQ X ? Y strong redundant rule Let k-rule denote the rule that has k attributes\(items consequent part, and the "subset rule" denote that itemset corresponding to the rule is subset of the item set of larger rule and the consequent parts of both rules are the same set Definition 3: Let Z be a fuzzy itemset that has k items\( k>2 When all the k-rules generated from Z are strong redundant, we call the itemset Z strong redundant itemset Fig.2 shows the concept of strong redundant rule and strong redundant itemset. Since the Apriori algorithm generates the candidate itemsets in tum from l-itemsets, the pruning based 


on the redundancy should be performed simultaneously In addition to the basic Apriori algorithm, the following procedures are employed for k> I as A4 confidence of k-rule based on Lk and Lk.j AS The concept of the procedure is that the confidence value of rule should increase by increasing the number of antecedent items. In other words, the procedure is based on valid heuristics that the combination of items in antecedent part which deteriorates the confidence value will become redundant in the following iterations. We can expect reduction of computational time and redundant rules pruning by the additional procedures It should be noted that the confidence calculation in each iteration does not lead to the increase of overall calculation time in association rules mining v. NUMERICAL EXAMPLES We develop the fuzzy mining system based on the redundancy pruning and evaluate the proposed algorithms through numerical examples. We apply the system to "abalone data" available from the vcr Machine Learning Repository[7 The abalone data set consists of 4177 measured data with 1 nominal attribute and 8 continuous attributes as shown in 71 Table. I. In the experiments, the nominal attribute is transformed to the continuous attribute. Table 2\(a statistics and the fuzzy partition information of attributes are summarized in Table 2\(b wider than the actual data distribution for performance evaluation. The fuzzy partition example is shown in Fig.3. We use two types of fuzzy sets with different width, i.e. triangle type and trapezoid type. Although it is better to use the factor such as "interesting" for pruning the derived rules in addition we apply the native association rule extraction for proposed algorithm evaluation.

The number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm Fig.5 shows the results of reduction of itemsets by the proposed algorithm. We can see that fair itemsets are pruned by the proposed method. Fig.6 shows the number of extracted rules by the conventional Apriori algorithm. Many redundant rules are extracted as well as the necessary non-redundant rules Our issue is to restrain the extraction of redundant rules. Fig.7 shows the results of the number of deleted rules by the proposed algorithm. Some redundant rules are deleted simultaneously along with frequent itemsets extraction However, since a few non-redundant rules are also unexpectedly deleted at the lower threshold value of minimal confidence, we have to investigate further about heuristics, i.e strong redundant itemsts and relation of threshold values. It should be noted that the number of deleted rules has less dependence on the minimal confidence These results are promising in terms of computational time and redundant rules pruning. However, the improvement is limited in terms of computational time. We consider that the performance of the proposed method must be improved by applying the output field specification method[17]. We expect that the number of pruned rules becomes larger based on the specifications. Moreover, the other measures to prevent redundant rules extraction in fuzzy association rules mining 


could be applied as well as the proposed algorithm VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we proposed a basic algorithm based on the Apriori algorithm for rule extraction utilizing redundancy of the extracted rules, in order to improve the efficiency of the association rules mining and to prune the redundant rules extracted. We also proved the redundancy defmition of the rule based on the CF\(certainty factor algorithm was evaluated through numerical experiments using benchmark data, "Abalone". From the results, the method was found to be promising in terms of computational time and redundant rule pruning. Our future plan includes sophistication of the proposed algorithm, application to the huge data mining problem, and further improvement of fuzzy association rules mining REFERENCES I] R.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper first discusses the theory of foundations and association rules and presents an association rules mining algorithm, namely, FP-growth algorithm.

The experimental evaluation demonstrates its scalability is much better than algorithm FP-growth 177 Now, lets forecast something we want to do someday Firstly, we would parallelize our algorithm, because data mining needs massive computation, and a parallelable environment could high improve the performance of the algorithm; Secondly, we would apply our algorithm on much more datasets and study the run performance; At last, we would study the performance when the algorithm deal with other kinds of association rules  REFERENCES 1] S.

Pruning experiences at support 0.25  V. DISCUSSION AND CHALLENGES It is important to discuss the technique presented here with focus on the purpose the technique pursues:  to produce semantic recommendation The reader should have noticed that the algorithm presented 


relies strongly on "choice". For instance, the algorithm chooses ears in the graph to form an order for elimination, and the choice is arbitrary. This strategy is essential to maintain low complexity \(polynomial practical. Nevertheless, a warned reader may conclude that this arbitrary choice implies that there are many compactions to produce and therefore the approach as a whole does not show to produce an optimal solution. And the reader is right in this conclusion. Since the goal is compaction, the search for an optimal solution can be bypassed provided a substantial level of pruning is achieved To complete the whole view, we describe how web service descriptions are complemented with the association rules as recommendations. In effect, under our scheme, the document describing the web service is augmented with a set of OWL/RDF/S triples that only incorporate the non-pruned rules with the format of Example 1, that is, the set ARmin of the compaction program obtained by our algorithm, together with the thresholds applied to the mining process and a registered URI of a registered description service. The assumptions and defeaters are not added to the web service description. If the associations encoded in the triples are not sufficient for the client \(a search engine, for instance widening of the response to the description service identified by the given URI, and then the assumptions and defeaters are produced. The reasoning task required for deriving all the implicitly published rules is client responsibility Notice that, under this scheme, the actual rules that appear as members of the set initial ARmin set are irrelevant; the only important issue is the size of the set The developed scheme also supports an extension of the algorithm that admits the assignment of priorities to rules and to itemsets, in order to allow the user to produce a more controlled program as output. Nonetheless, the importance of the extension has not been already tested, and therefore it is beyond the subject of the present paper It would be also interesting to design a scheme that supports queries where the client provides an itemset class and values for support and confidence and the engine produces a maximal class of inferred associated itemsets as a response. This scheme is also under development, so we have not discussed this aspect here 


VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, we have presented a defeasible logic framework for managing associations that helps in reducing the number of rules found in a set of discovered associations. We have presented an induction algorithm for inducing programs in our logic, made of assumption schemas, a reduced set of association rules and a set of counter-arguments to conclusions called defeaters, guaranteeing that every pruned rule can be effectively inferred from the output. Our approach outperform those of [17], because all reduction compactions presented there can be expressed and induced in our framework, and several other patterns, particular to the given datasets, can also be found. In addition, since a set of definite clauses can be obtained from the induced programs, the knowledge obtained can be modularly inserted in a richer inference engine Abduction can be also attempted, asking for justifications that explain the presence of certain association in the dataset The framework presented can be extended in several ways Admitting defeaters to appear in the head of assumption, to define user interest Admitting arithmetic expressions within assumptions for adjustment in pruning Admitting set formation patterns as itemset constants Extending the scope, to cover temporal association rules REFERENCES 1]  R.
