Abstract 
measured by microarray technologies or recently by using sequencing technologies Using these technologies identifying Differentially Expressed Genes DEGs among multiple phenotypes is one of the most important tasks in biology Thus many methods for detecting DEGs between two groups has been developed For example T-test and relative entropy are used for detecting the difference between two probability distributions When more than two phenotypes are considered these methods are not applicable and other methods such as ANOVA F-test and Kruskal-Wallis are used for 037nding DEGs in the multiclass data However ANOVA F-test assumes a normal distribution and it is not designed to identify DEGs where gene are expressed distinctively in each of 
phenotypes Kruskal-Wallis method a non-parametric method is more robust but sensitive to outliers This paper proposes a nonparametric and information theoretical approach for identifying DEGs in the multiple class data and the approach is less sensitive to outliers In extensive experiments with simulated and real data our method outperformed existing tools In addition a web service is implemented for the analysis of multi-class data http://biohealth.snu.ac.kr/software/degselection

Multiclass problem RNA-seq Differentially expressed genes Bioinformatics 
Thus many technologies have been developed to measure gene expression levels of biological samples Until recently microarrays or DNA chip have been the most widely used method A microarray is composed of a large number of speci\037c probes that are hybridized with certain cDNAs cDNAs are synthesized from mRNAs in each sample by reverse transcriptases and these cDNAs are hybridized with probes Depending on the amount of hybridization each spot of the probes has different intensity of 036uorescence In this way gene expression levels of a sample can be measured However measuring gene expression levels based on the intensity of 036uorescence has limitations in terms of reproducibility and resolution Recently sequencing technologies known as the 
Next Generation Sequencing NGS technique have achieved capacity enough to measure levels of gene expressions in the whole cell in a single experiment While microarrays measure the abundance of a transcript by a 036uorescence intensity RNA sequencing measures it by a count of sequenced reads Therefore the absolute expression levels can be measured and it can provide a higher resolution in measuring gene expression levels For this reason the sequencing technology begins to replace the microarray technology rapidly Once we measure expression levels of genes from cells of multiple phenotypes identifying genes that are expressed differentially is an important research question These genes are called differentially expressed genes DEGs To detect genes that are expressed differentially in multiple phenotypes 
a number of samples for each phenotype are routinely used In this situation identifying DEGs requires sophisticated techniques Technical challenges are that a DEG should express consistently within samples of the same phenotype while it should express differentially among samples of different phenotypes To detect DEGs a number of algorithms have been developed Many studies have been conducted on detecting DEGs between two groups For example T-test and relative entrop are used for detecting the difference between two probability distributions However 037nding DEGs from more than two groups is a more dif\037cult problem A multiclass problem is referred to a problem that has more than two groups Most of the methods 037nding the difference between two groups cannot 
be directly applied to multiclass problems ANOVA F-test information gain and gini index are used for gene selection in multiclass data 4 ANO V A F-test assesses whether the mean values within several groups differ from each other The problem of ANOVA F-test is that it selects genes which have a signi\037cantly different expression level in one phenotype and have similar expression levels in the other phenotypes The method that is proposed in this paper selects a gene as a DEG when a gene has all different expression levels according to all different phenotypes As NGS is replacing microarray technique different methods have been developed for identifying DEGs because the nature of RNA-seq data and microarray data are different In 
this paper we review existing methods and propose a nonparametric and information theoretic method for identifying DEGs in RNA-seq data In addition we implemented a web service for identifying DEGs and also for biological analysis of DEGs II R ELATED WORKS Gene expression data from RNA-seq experiments of multiple samples can be represented in a matrix form When the number of samples is

Bioconductor packages for analysing differential expression of RNA-seq data These tool assume that follow a negative binomial distribution After 037tting a result of RNA-seq experiments to a speci\037c model these tools perform differential expression analysis using an exact test analogous to Fisher\222s exact test The limitation of these tools is that they can not be directly adjusted to multiclass problems Cuffdif is a dif ferential expression analysis program included in Cuf\036inks that is a transcript assembly program The limitation of Cuffdiff is that it performs analysis between two samples not between groups  and SAMseq[2 pro vide solutions for multiclass problems PoissonSeq assume that follow a Poisson distribution This tool is not robust when there are outliers in an input

skewed across the groups SAMseq 037nds DEGs based on this property Although SAMseq is more robust than PoissonSeq there is some chance it can be affected if there are outliers III M OTIVATION Many approaches employ a parametric model to identify differential expression analysis However when real data is not 037tted to these parametric models the performance of those programs becomes low Also there is no guarantee that RNAseq data follow a certain parametric model When an outlier exists in data sets parameters of parameter models can be affected largely A previous sho ws that parameter models are not robust when an outlier exists To solve this problem we suggest a non-parametric model that can be used for any kind of model SAMseq that uses Kruskal-Wallis method for testing differential expression is more robust than the methods based on parametric models However it also has an weakness that the score is highly affected by highly ranked inputs Also when outliers change the ranks of elements the score is dramatically changed To solve this problem we suggest an information theoretic approach that is more robust for outliers I V M ETHODS as a normalized count of mapped

the following steps First of all we normalized the input count data by using the Reads Per Kilobase per Million reads\(RPKM concept After that we changed expression levels\(real values to rank values that is a widely used technique in non-parametric methods We discretized expression values based on their ranking The number of discretized groups is equal to the number of classes We call the discretized values Discretized Ranks\(DRs Then we calculate mutual information between DRs and class labels If the DRs and class labels have a high mutual information value then we can conclude that this gene has different expression levels for each class The detailed process is explained below RNA-seq reads are mapped to a reference genome by mapping programs such as Bo and T ophat[10 T o obtain a read count table of genes from a mapped data we can use the GenomicRanges in Bioconductor or the HTSeq Python or Cuf 036inks These programs have their own algorithms to calculate read counts of each genes After we get a count table we normalize the count table by RPKM RPKM is an widely used technique for normalizing count data and it normalizes data by considering the sequencing depth and the length of a gene These processes are preprocessing steps for the input data The normalized count table can be represented in a The mutual information\(MI is a measure of the mutual dependence of two random variables We analysed differential expression by measuring the mutual information between the class labels and the discretized ranks\(DRs If the mutual information of a gene is high this gene

  For the test we set one sample among input samples as an outlier sample Figures 2 shows that our tool is more robust than other existing tools 42  The class labels 024 031 030 037 032 036 035 035 036\035 031\034 030 027\026\025 032 031\034 030 037\036 035\034 033 037 036  By using this distribution we can randomly generate simulated data that is similar to real data By using these simulated data we compare the performance of the algorithms  The discretized ranks Estimating a P-value is a statistical method to measure the signi\037cance of the score from the previous step A P-value indicates the probability that a score from a randomly generated instance is greater or equal to the score from the previous step So if the p-value of the score is small the score has signi\037cance We used random permutation method to calculate P-values This technique is widely used to measure p-values in non-parametric models Discretized ranks are randomly generated 100,000 times and scores\(mutual information are calculated for each iteration Based on this score We can make a null hypothesis distribution After that for each gene We calculated the score of the gene and P-value as the probability that random scores are higher than the score of the gene V R ESULTS To check whether our algorithm is working appropriately or not we performed classi\037cation on each DEG We selected a gene as a DEG when it had different expression levels for different classes So the expression levels of DEGs have class-prediction power Therefore a classi\037er that uses the DEG as a feature can output the class accurately KNN\(knearest neighbour algorithm was used for classi\037er because it is sensitive to the quality of the feature Fig 1 The box plot of accuracies of the top 50 DEGs from the simulated data The DEGs selected from the mutual information based method\(mi show higher class-prediction powers\(classi\037cation accuracies than those from SAM and PoissonSeq\(poi Fig 2 The mean of accuracy of the top DEGs when an outlier is included The mean accuracy of the top 50 DEGs from SAM and PoissonSeq decreased when an outlier is included However our method shows robust accuracy when an outlier is included 037  A random variable X of a Poisson distribution follows 037 035 033 037 036 036 037 is equal to the expected value of X 037 037 035 032 031 037 030\027 030\027 035 D Estimating P-value 2 Real data 032 032 033 024 037 035 034\033\033 2 037 1 Simulated data 033 We checked the accuracy of the classi\037er when using expression values of one gene as an input We performed this 50 times for each of the top 50 genes To our knowledge only and PoissonSeq[8 can be used for identifying DEGs in multiclass RNA-seq data We compared our tool which is based on mutual information with existing tools The result is shown in Figure 1 As shown in Figure 1 the method based on mutual information shows higher mean of accuracy than other tools Also we tested the case that includes outliers The expression level of the outliers are set to be 100 times bigger than the original value This can be represented as 036 034 036 036\035 037 037 037 036 037 021 037 037 037 033 A Data 1 Simulated data B Classi\037cation results We also applied our algorithm to real biological data We used breast cancer data The breast cancer data is from The Cancer Genome Atlas\(TCGA e chose 3 groups Normal Basal Luminal A from the TCGA data for our research The characteristics of Basal type Basal-like carcinoma is that they do not have estrogen receptors progesterone receptors or Her2/neu proteins For this reason Basal type is also called as the triple negative breast Luminal A type has estrogen receptors with low grade 023\022 To test our algorithm and compare it with existing tools we generated simulated data from a Poisson distribution The reason we used Poisson distribution for random data is that RNA-seq can be modeled as a simple random sampling In this model each read is sampled uniformly and independently from every possible  So the number of reads mapping to a gene follows a binomial distribution and it can be approximated by a Poisson distribution A Poisson distribution has one parameter 020

joined tables have more data in common or having sufficient network resources, all pair partition join, repartition join should be used because its implementation is not as complex as the others. If two joined tables have few data in common or having inadequate network resources, broadcasting join, semi join per-split semi join should be used because it may reduce time and resources consumption Data in NoSQL database can be structured, semi-structured or unstructured; and can be stored in many types of data structures such as indexed table of relational database, B-Tree Queue, Hash table. Therefore, in addition to the consideration presented in this paper, selection of join strategies is also affected by data structures. MapReduce programmers may also need to consider data accessing time, data sorting time when selecting joining strategy.
