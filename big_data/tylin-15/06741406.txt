I INTRODUCTION The success of Web search engines has made keyword search the major form of retrieval method in information retrieval system Given the rapid growth of XML and relational data repositories the ability to support keyword search over such repositories has become important In contrast to traditional structured query keyword search enables users to query the databases easily by issuing some keywords without 
full knowledge of the database schemas or query languages Recent years have witnessed many approaches to keyword search over XML and RDB For XML keyword search existing approaches 11 13 15 are structure-based because they mainly rely on the exploration of the structure of XML data Those approaches can be classi\037ed as tree-based and graph-based search The tree-based search is used when an XML document is modeled as a tree i.e without ID references IDREFs while the graph-based search is used for XML documents with IDREFs Almost all tree-based approaches are based on some variations of LCA Least Common Ancestor semantics such as SLCA and ELCA Due to the unawareness of real semantics in XML data these LCA-based approaches suffer from several serious problems such as meaningless 
answers duplicated answers missing answers and etc For RDB keyword search existing approaches 5  9 are also structured-based because the y rely on the foreign key-key references of RDB Those approaches can be classi\037ed as data graph based and schema graph based Data graph based keyword search on relational databases takes a relational database as a data graph Each node in the data graph represents a tuple in some relation in the database and each edge between two nodes in the data graph represents a foreign key-key reference between the two tuples represented by these two nodes An answer to a keyword query is de\037ned as a minimal connected subgraph which contains nodes that match keywords in the keyword query On the other hand schema graph based keyword search takes a relational database 
schema as a schema graph Each node in the schema graph represents a relation in the database and each edge between two nodes in the schema graph represents a foreign key-key reference between the two relations represented by these two nodes To answer a keyword query a set of SQL statements are generated w.r.t possible interpretations of the keyword query The results of the SQLs are considered as the answers Without considering semantics in the database these RDB keyword search techniques suffer from the problems of retrieving incomplete duplicated and meaningless answers Moreover the retrieved answers are highly dependent on the schema of RDB and dif\037cult to understand their intuitive meanings In this paper we point out mismatches between answers returned and the common expectations in keyword search in 
XML and relational databases We analyze these mismatches and discover that the main reasons are due to the unawareness of the semantics of object relationship and attribute of object/relationship in the databases We refer to them as ORA-semantics To capture the ORA-semantics we propose Object Relationship OR data graph for XML and Object Relationship Mixed ORM data graph for RDB Based on OR and ORM data graph model we can achieve an intelligent keyword search over XML and RDB in order to avoid the problems mentioned above To further facilitate the usability of keyword search we are also working on enhancing the expressive power of keyword queries Particularly we enable to users explicitly indicate their search intentions by relation attribute and tag names 
in keyword queries Thereby we can reduce the ambiguity of keyword queries and retrieve more precise answers We also handle recursive relationships and identi\037er-dependency relationships IDD in databases in order to answer the common queries on recursive relationships such as 223\037nding the manager name of an employee\224 in keyword search Besides we incorporate aggregate functions into keyword queries so that users can explore databases with aggregate queries such as 223\037nding the cheapest price for iPhone 5S\224 1

one relation an answer is incomplete if the Steiner tree contains nodes that represent part of information of objects/relationships Consider the university database in Fig 2 The data graph of the database is shown in Fig 3 An answer to the keyword query relation This is incomplete as information of the quali\037cations i.e degrees majors and universities of the lecturer which are stored in the is queried there may be 100 duplicated answers Although this is very annoying to users little attention has been paid for eliminating this problem Last but not least the LCA-based approaches cannot distinguish between an object attribute and a relationship attribute under an object node Therefore when a user issues a query related to relationship attributes users may get unexpected answers Moreover the LCA-based approaches also face problems when queries involve ternary and above relationships Janet Kate Qualification Bill A Bill Mary 037 can be solved if the ID Reference mechanism

based on LCA semantics such as SLCA VLCA 8 ELCA 15 we use the LCAbased approach as a representative of the tree-based search onward While the semantics of LCA and its variants work well for several

Steiner tree consisting of a single node Fig 1 university.xml II P ROBLEMS OF CURRENT APPROACHES 037 incomplete 221Bill Kennedy\222 The graphbased search can be applied for both XML tree without IDREF and XML graph with IDREFs In the absence of IDREF the graph-based search suffers from the same problems as the LCA-based search does With IDREFs object and object ID are observed and utilized An object can be referenced by an IDREF which has the same value with its object ID to avoid duplication This helps the graph-based search handle some but not all problems of the LCA-based search Particularity the 036 035 duplicated 037 We give a brief discussion on problems of XML keyword search More details can be found in We choose the data graph approach 2 as a representative to illustrate the limitations of RDB keyword search The schema graph approach 1 suf fers from the similar limitations Recall that in data graph approach an answer to a keyword query is de\037ned as a minimal Steiner tree which contains nodes that match keywords in the query relationships who is enrolled in some course as student set of answers 3 return Given a keyword query a minimal Steiner tree which contains nodes that match keywords in the query could be meaningless Suppose a user issues a keyword query missing answer duplicated answer and answers 2 miss meaningful answers or return  Meaningless answers are returned when the LCA node or its variants just simply matches query keywords and does not provide any other additional information More importantly LCA-based approaches return incomplete sets of answers because they only search up from the matching nodes for common ancestors and never search down to 037nd common information appearing as descendants Duplicated answers overwhelm users with extraneous information If an object  which represents the 037rst tuple in the  This answer is incomplete as information of the course is not retrieved  Two answers are shown in Fig 4 The 037rst answer Fig 4\(a indicates that both students  and also enrolled in another course as student 2 037 Problem of tree-based approaches Problems of graph-based XML keyword search meaningless relation is not retrieved Besides an answer is also incomplete if the Steiner tree contains nodes that represent information of relationships without their participating objects This is based on the intuition that when a user refers to some relationship he is also interested in the information of objects of the relationship For example an answer to the keyword query appears 100 times in an XML document when is the Steiner tree 221John Clinton\222

type nodes that are directly connected to 036 035 n and n 002 in the ORM data graph into this Steiner tree We refer readers to for details I V C URRENT WORKS TO FACILITATE KEYWORD SEARCH USABILITY Keyword queries are simple and user-friendly but not as powerful as structured queries For example with structured queries users can explicitly indicate their search intentions express queries involving recursive relationships and/or aggregate functions In contrast existing keyword search engines do not or even cannot handle such cases To further facilitate the usability of keyword search we propose to enhance the expressive power of keyword queries and edge as label in the OR data graph n\t\026\b\016\030 n  The information stored for each relationship node is a similar quadruple and   is the set of is the set of and a relationship node in  For every relationship  there is an edge between each of its participating objects and 006 to a keyword match node comprises nodes from distinct relations If so then the Steiner tree is an answer and stand for  Each object/relationship has a uniquely generated 036 n 032 and is a mixed node and respectively Generally a non-value keyword indicate an output requested by users When a user issues a query he has some intention in mind about what he wants to search for and he expresses his intention by non-value keywords Particularly he would like to search for object indicated by the non-value keywords and related to value keywords The above ideas can be illustrated by the following example Although we consider XML it is similar if the data is RDB in Fig 2 4 036 030 036 034 undirected diamond relationship node 036 object node     and  An  as well as the tuples  There is an edge between nodes  The ORM data graph captures the ORA-semantics in the database To process a keyword query we search over the ORM data graph to 037nd a set of Steiner trees which contain nodes that match query keywords For each Steiner tree we will check whether there exists a node  where of an object/relationship include its attributes and values as well An example OR data graph is shown in Fig.6 where 004\003 004\003 and in XML data tree in Fig 1 aim to search for students whose major is nodeID object class OID associated keywords nodeID relationship type 031 indicates a foreign key-key reference between tuples in relations An object relationship relation contains all single valued attributes of an entity relationship type A relation is a mixed relation if it encompasses both an entity type and a relationship type A component relation represents a component part or the multi-valued attribute of an entity or relationship type Based on the type of each relation in the database we construct an undirected is the root Otherwise this Steiner tree is not considered as an answer Besides we will also check every keyword match node 007 n Student_\(1 To solve these problems of XML keyword search a more semantics-enriched model is needed in which not only objects but relationships and their attributes must be fully captured as well We illustrate this model by proposing Object Relationship OR data graph to represent an XML document Both objects and relationships are represented as nodes in an OR data graph while attributes and values are associated with the corresponding objects and relationships As such an OR data graph can capture all objects relationships and attributes of an XML data An OR data graph Our approach to RDB keyword search 037rst utilizes foreign key-key constraints to classify the relations in a relational schema into To indicate search intention users may explicitly add tag name in XML or table name and attribute name in RDB referred to as non-value keyword into keyword queries For example queries 034 033 037 036 depending on whether the represented tuples are from an object relation a relationship Object Node Relationship Node Mixed Node L2 CS301 E5 E2 S2 E4 S3 E3 CS203 L1 CS5201 E1 S1

have more than one prerequisite course and be prerequisite for more than one course So it is a many-to-many recursive relationship Besides we refer to the number of recursions between two courses as

etc are common in both XML and RDB Therefore it is desirable to handle queries involving recursive relationships in keyword search Unfortunately such queries are dif\037cult to express and process for existing works Consider the university database in Fig 2 again Suppose there is another relation An identi\037er-dependency relationship IDD occurs when an object cannot be identi\037ed by the value of its own attributes but has to be identi\037ed by its relationship with some other object E.g a child of a lecturer does not have a unique identi\037er but can be identi\037ed by the identifer of the lecturer i.e StaffID and the name of the child Intuitively when people search for some object which needs to be identi\037ed by an IDD relationship with other object it is helpful for a search engine to retrieve the intended object as well as the IDD relationship with the object to identify it However since the existing works in both XML and RDB keyword search are unaware of the semantics of object and relationship they retrieve incomplete information for queries involving IDD relationships Suppose there is another relation in isa in the schema For the query which 037nds all levels prerequisite courses\222 titles of and 037 PreqCode as a prerequisite Our approach can also handle this case For example the previous query can be expressed by the enhanced keyword query matches

037nd all levels prerequisite courses\222 titles of  According to our best knowledge none of existing works can even express such queries The problem is similar for XML keyword search To solve this problem we propose to incorporate keyword queries with information about recursive relationships Particularly we let users explicitly indicate the existence of the recursive relationship and the number of levels they would like to search in the query For example if the user would like to 037nd one level prerequisite courses\222 titles of course  he can issues the keyword query  The query consists of two parts The 037rst part is the keyword  the corresponding keyword query will be  Compared to the previous keyword query  Asterisk indicates that the user is interested in all levels of the recursive relationship in the database If the user only wants to know the 037rst three levels of the recursive relationship then the keyword query is  Besides some users may want to issue a reversed query involving recursive relationships e.g 037nding the titles of courses which have the course  After the keyword search engines are aware of the recursive relationships in the query they can handle them separately and intelligently 037 CS5201 is ambiguous and matches two objects namely computing indicating that this query involves one level recursive relationship via the constraint

This is re\037ected by the foreign key-key reference between the relations ICDE CIKM SIGMOD 033 issued against XML data in Fig 1 can be interpreted as 036nding the max grade of students taking course S1 Similar to structure search SQL XQuery users often want to perform some accumulated computation or summarization However no work handles aggregation functions e.g max min count etc for XML keyword search Aggregation functions can be classi\036ed into the following groups Keyword search is a user-friendly way so that users can issue keyword queries without or with little knowledge about the schema of the underlying data However they often know what the data is about Therefore when they issue a query they often have some intuitions expected about the answers in mind Since they may not know which schema is used their expectations are independent from schema designs If they already got some answers for this schema it could be surprised if different answers are returned when they try another schema of the same data source Thus different schemas of the same data source should provide them the same or similar answers However this is not the case for the existing XML and RDB approaches as shown in the following example Users may know a university database about courses and students but they do not know how the data looks like It can be an XML data tree as in Fig 1 or another XML data tree as in Fig 8 or even a RDB as in Fig 2 Consider 034 Child VLDB S1 037 037 037 036  Given a keyword query that consists of a child name the existing works in RDB keyword search will only retrieve the information about the children whose names match the keyword query However this is not complete because the parent information of the children are not retrieved XML keyword search suffers from this problem similarly We propose to identify IDD relationships in XML and RDB to overcome this problem For RDB we utilize the foreign key-key constraints in the database schema For XML we 036rst identify IDD which is usually a child of the intended object We then include the parent of the IDD the intended object into the answers Once we found the IDD relationships we can retrieve complete information for keyword queries involving IDD relationships  For another example query  One basic idea to handle queries with aggregation function is that we 036rst handle the portion without aggregation function 036rst then using aggregation functions to 036lter the returned results For example for query  we 036rst process query  among which we then 036nd the maximum grade

answers for different designs are different though these designs refer to exactly the same information and we are dealing with the same query One basic idea to handle this problem is as follows First

of the problems in existing keyword search approaches in both XML and RDB We are also working on enhancing the expressive power of keyword queries to facilitate the usability of keyword search This is

In order to better evaluate the scalability of DARE on larger backup datasets we have implemented the schemes of Stream-Informed Delta Compression SIDC  2  in SiLo  20  a memory-ef cient near-exact deduplication system that exploits the backup-stream similarity and locality As introduced in Section 2.1 SIDC only detects resemblance in the backup-stream locality-preserved cache that can reduce the indexing overhead of SFs and scales well in large-scale deduplication system Thus we employ their method to assess the scalability of different resemblance detection schemes and implement SiLo with a 20MB locality cache similar to SIDC  2  with a se gment size of 1MB The stream-informed approaches are denoted by the Cached/Cac preìx in Table 4 and Figure 5 The rst column under a dataset Freq or Less in Table 4 shows the percentages of data reduction and the second column shows the data reduction factor the ratio of before/after data reduction Since SiLo achieves nearly 99 deduplication efìciency of the exact deduplication i.e full index in memory while requiring substantially less memory overhead about 1/250 of the exact deduplication approach for ngerprint indexing  20  we only discuss the results of resemblance detection after SiLoês deduplication here in Table 4  As shown in Table 4  resemblance detection further reduces the storage space after the deduplication process by a factor of about 2.5 meaning that we can save about 60 of the post-deduplication storage space by resemblance-detecting post-deduplication chunks DARE achieves a superior data reduction efìciency on both datasets while the cached SF-2F and SF-4F schemes detect less resemblance which is consistent with the results on our real-world datasets summarized in Table 3  Table 4 also shows that the cached SF-2F and SF-4F schemes fail to detect a noticeable amount of resemblance due to the sometimes weak or lack thereof locality in the backup stream as the limitations of the stream-informed cache approach  2  To further understand the scalability of DARE Figure 5 shows the percentages of resemblance detected by its DupAdj detection and by the SF-2F and SF-4F approaches showing the individual contributions by the SF the SF and the SF on the two synthesized datasets DupAdj is very effective and efìcient in detecting resemblance in the deduplication system with abundant duplicate-adjacency information i.e dedupe factor 2 leaving DAREês improved super-feature approach very little smaller than 1 if any additional resemblance to detect see the DARE bars Figure 6 shows that DARE achieves the highest throughputs among all the approaches compared running on both RAID-structured HDDs and the SSD Cached SF-4F has the lowest throughput

Intuitively delta compression should slow down the data-restore performance of a data-reduction system since it needs to restore the resembling chunks by two reads one for the delta data and the other for the base-chunk and then delta decode them But in our evaluation of the restore operations for resembling chunks we nd that the speed of delta decode i.e Xdelta  8  tends to be v ery f ast about 1GB/s in the DARE system Another interesting observation is that for a restoration cache of a given size with a delta chunk and its based chunk  DARE actually caches more logical content of the two chunks and than a deduplication-only system and thus improves the datarestore performance by virtual of the enlarged restoration cache due to delta compression Figures 7\(a and 8\(a show that DARE on average doubles the data-restore speed of the deduplication-only system both running on the RAID Figures 7\(b and 8\(b clearly show that the reason lies in the fact that DARE reads half as many containers for restoration as the deduplicationonly system The superior data-restore performance of SF-2F and SF-4F to the deduplicationonly system is attributed to their data reduction efìciency see Tables 3 and 4  Since the restoreperformance for the other six datasets is similar to and consistent with that of the Less dataset they are omitted to save space The sudden increase in the data-restore performance of the deduplicationonly approach at the backup version 17 Figure 8\(a we observe is due to the fact that most of the backed-up sources targeted for restoration are from the current and recent backups and thus have fewer random reads for restoration

In this paper we present DARE a deduplication-aware low-overhead resemblance detection and elimination scheme for delta compression on the top of deduplication on backup datasets DARE uses a novel resemblance detection approach DupAdj which exploits the duplicate-adjacency information for efìcient resemblance detection in existing deduplication systems and employs an improved super-feature approach to further detecting resemblance when the duplicate-adjacency information is lacking or limited Our preliminary results on the data-restore performance suggest that supplementing delta compression to deduplication can effectively enlarge the logical space of the restoration cache but the data fragmentation in data reduction systems remains a serious problem  19  W e plan to further study and improve the data-restore performance of storage systems based on deduplication and delta compression in our future work This work was supported in part by National Basic Research 973 Program of China under Grant No 2011CB302301 NSFC No 61025008 61173043 and 61232004 863 Project 2013AA013203 US NSF under Grants IIS-0916859 CCF-0937993 CNS-1116606 and CNS-1016609 This work was also supported by Key Laboratory of Information Storage System Ministry of Education China

method increases slightly which is due to two reasons 1 the data before In this experiment we investigate the performance of OLTP queries when OLAP queries are running The workload is update-only and the keys being updated are uniformly distributed We launch ten clients to concurrently submit the updates when the system is deployed on 100 nodes Each client starts ten threads each of which submits one million updates 100 updates in batch Another client is launched to submit the data cube slice query That is one OLAP query and approximately 50,000 updates are concurrently processed in R-Store The system reaches its maximum usage in this setting based on our observation When the system is deployed on other number of nodes the number of clients submitting updates is adjusted accordingly Figure 11\(a shows the throughput of the system The throughput increases as the number of nodes increases which demonstrates the scalability of the system However when OLAP queries are running the update performance is lower than running only OLTP queries This result is expected because the OLAP queries compete for resources with the OLTP queries We also evaluate the latency of updates when the system is approximately fully used As shown in Figure 11\(b the aggregated response time for 1000 updates are similar with respect to varying scales VII C ONCLUSION MapReduce is a parallel execution

Querying    Fig 8 Accuracy of Cost Model    Fig 9 Performance vs Freshness On each HBase-R node the key/values are stored in format Though only one or two versions of the same key are returned to MapReduce HBase-R has to scan all the of the table Since the is materialized to HDFS when it is full these 223les are sorted by time Thus instead of scanning all the and between  only the between   are scanned The value of decides the freshness of the result There is a trade-off between the performance of the query and the freshness of the result the smaller is the fewer real-time data are scanned Figure 9 shows the query processing time with different freshness ratios which is de\223ned as the percentage of the real-time data we have to scan for the query In this experiment  1600 million and 800 million updates on 1 distinct keys are submitted to HBase-R When the freshness ratio is 0 the input of the query is only the data cube Thus the cost of scanning the real-time data is 0 When the freshness ratio increases to 10 the cost of scanning the real-time data is around 1500 seconds because the cost of scanning the real-time table dominates the OLAP query As the freshness ratio increases the running time of and  and when it is not  and  We submit 800 million updates to the server each day and the percentage of keys updated is 223xed to 1 The data cube is refreshed at the beginning of each day and the OLAP query is submitted to the server at the end of the day Since the data are compacted after the data cube refresh the amount of data stored in the real-time table are almost the same at the same time of each day The processing time of and are thus almost constant In contrast when the compaction scheme is turned off HBase-R stores much more data and the cost of locally scanning these data becomes larger than the cost of shuf\224ing the data to MapReduce As a result the processing time of and increases over time and and a user speci\223ed timestamp still need to be scanned and 2 the amount of data shuf\224ed to mappers are roughly the same with different ratios Figure 10 depicts the effectiveness of our compaction scheme In this experiment we measure the

the data scanned by MapReduce are unchanged during the execution of a MapReduce job In reality the real-time results from the most recently updated data are more meaningful for decision making In this paper we propose R-Store for supporting real-time OLAP on MapReduce R-Store leverages stable technology HBase and HStreaming and extends them to achieve high performance and scalability The storage system of R-Store adopts multi-version concurrency control to support real-time OLAP To reduce the storage requirement it periodically materializes the real-time data into a data cube and compacts the historical versions into one version During query processing the proposed adaptive incremental scan operation shuf\224es the real-time data to MapReduce ef\223ciently The data cube and the newly updated data are combined in MapReduce to return the real-time results In addition based on our proposed cost model the more ef\223cient query processing method is selected To evaluate the performance of R-Store we have conducted extensive experimental study using the TPCH data The experimental results show that our system can support real-time OLAP queries much more ef\223ciently than the baseline methods Though the performance of OLTP degrades slightly due to the competition for resources with OLAP the response time and throughput remain good and acceptable A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described
