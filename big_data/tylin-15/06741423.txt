A  Distributed Mechanism for Remote Rendering  of Image Data   Mingyu Lim  Department of Internet & Multimedia Engineering  Konkuk University  Seoul, Korea  mlim@konkuk.ac.kr  Yunjin Lee  Division of Digital Media  Ajou University  Suwon, Korea  yunjin@ajou.ac.kr   Abstract 227 In this paper, we propose a distributed rendering mechanism for image  data using multiple servers. Since the  stylization of large images also requires high computation overhead to render an image, a low 
end client divides  it into several image pieces. Each piece is sent to a different server, which then performs rendering. A client merges the rendered pieces to one output image again. The proposed method enables large image  data  to be rendered by collaboration of multiple servers with reasonable processing and communication cost   Keyword s 227  Remote rendering, image stylization, distributed processing, multi server  communication  I  I NTRODUCTION  With the advance of computing devices and Internet technologies, we can easily create and get various multimedia contents. Due to the proliferation of mobile devices which 
embed cameras, users have even more chance to manipulate  2D image data  with a variety of applications. As recent high end devices provides sufficient computing and rendering resources, users want to process, transform, and visualize higher quality of 2D image data   However, normal desktop PCs and mobile device s still lack enough rendering power due to hardware limitation. To address this issue, various researches have been done using remote rendering especially for 3D contents [1 7 T h e  re m o t e  rendering method enables low end devices to display only result i mages which are rendered by a remote server, but it has 
an intrinsic problem. Although single server has a role of surrogate renderer of a client, it can get overloaded in terms of rendering time if the server performs rendering of large contents. As the c ontents size increases, it takes longer time to process the contents. To overcome the limitation of single server, some existing approaches use parallel processing on a multi core graphics card [8  Ho w ev er   th is  a p p r o a ch r e q u i r es  expensive hardware and su fficient knowledge of parallel programming [9  In this paper, we aim to distribute the rendering overhead of single server to multiple ones in order to reduce overall delay of image stylization. To this end, a client is in charge of 
dividing an input imag e into several small pieces, if the image size is greater than threshold value. Since the stylization of a pixel is affected by its surrounding pixels in our stylization method, an input image splits such that boundary pixels of pieces are overlapped. Othe rwise, the stylization result at boundary pixels of two image pieces cannot be merged seamlessly. Each image piece is then sent to a different server so that multiple servers can handle only the separated image piece instead of a whole input image. The mul tiple servers conduct stylization of the received input image piece in parallel and independently. They do not interact with each other, and just send their result of image piece back to a requesting client 
While receiving result image pieces from servers a client assembles them into one stylized image, which is then displayed to a user. The proposed distributed stylization approach addresses the bottleneck problem of single server rendering with the modest change of client side, and makes it possible to stylize even a large input image within reasonable delay  The remainder of this paper is organized as follows S ection  II  discusses the literature survey of existing remote rendering and image stylization schemes. In S ection  III we describe the main probl em to consider and fundamental idea design of our proposed approach. In S 
ections  IV and V we introduce previous local stylization technique and its extension to the distributed manner of stylization. Communication aspects of the proposed distribution mode l benefits from communication middleware \(CM\ which is described in S ection  VI In Section VII we analyze our method to measure the performance in terms of processing and communication overhead. Finally, we conclude our paper in S ection  VIII   II  R ELATED W ORK  In this section, we discuss existing researches on 2D image stylization techniques and remote rendering approaches 
 For 2D image stylization which is a target of this paper there have been various mechanisms which require high rendering computation. For real time processing, many image stylization methods have been designed to be highly parallel and been implemented on the GPU [10 13  P ix el o p e r at io n s  are performed on a neighborhood of a pixel and the operations for each pixel are independent of the ot her pixels. The locality and independency of the computations are suitable for our distributed rendering framework  133

B  Collabora tion Manager  The collaboration manager manages a different level of user interaction area according to the application requirement It defines the number and relationship of sessions and groups in a hierarchical structure. As illustrated in Fig   8, the collaboration manager contains session managers, each of which handles a session and a session manager can have more than one group manager which manages a user group. The developer can organize the structure of sessions and groups using the config uration file or APIs provided by manager modules. In the CM architecture, we need at least one session and group to allow users to interact with each other. It means that the minimal unit of interaction is a group. A user always has to belong to a group. F or the proposed distributed stylization system, we use the default session and group which is the minimum requirement, because there is only one client for visualizing stylized images  An event passing through the CM stub module from the application layer stops by the collaboration manager which then checks the destination users in sessions or groups, and delivered to the event manager before being sent. All inbound events from the network are also delivered to the collaboration manager. It checks the event  header and does internal process if it is required. If an event handler is a session manager or a group manager, the collaboration  manager delivers it to an appropriate manager  C  Event Manager  The event manager is in charge of an event in the system An ev ent is a high level form of exchange method between application nodes. As it includes semantics to be exchanged so that it can be understandable at the application layer, high level manager modules \(the collaboration manager, session manager and group man ager\ and an application uses an event as a way of information exchange. One of key role of the event manager is to change an event to a low level message \(sequence of byte array\ which is delivered to the underlying communication manager, and vice versa The event manager provides several send ing  functions which take an event as a parameter and transform it into a message so that it can be sent via the communication manager. To the contrary, an incoming message given by the communication manager is convert ed to an event in the event manager which then delivers it to the collaboration manager for the internal operation. The event manager also forwards the converted event to the CM stub module which eventually delivers it to an application for the event proce ss at the application layer as well  D  Communication Manager  The communication manager controls messages and provides APIs to manage communication channels. The main role is to send and receive messages to/from underlying network. To support this, the commun ication manager runs a separate thread for waiting any incoming message. Whenever it receives a message from the network, the communication manager forwards it to the event manager. It also uses its own send functions embedded in each channel when a messag e to be sent is delivered from the event manager. If an application creates a channel, it is maintained in the communication manager as a channel list. Every event channel in the list is checked by the receiving thread and any received message is notified to the event manager. The communication manager  provides different dedicated communication sockets which wrap native socket APIs and makes it possible an easy way to open and close a channel depending on demand. Supported socket types are a server socket a stream socket, datagram socket, and a multicast socket. For the proposed distributed stylization system, we use the server and stream socket between a server and a client application, because our system requires reliable communication of input and output  image pieces  VII  P ERFORMANCE E VALUATION  In this section, we discuss the analysis of performance of the proposed distributed rendering scheme T he performance of r emote and distributed rendering methods consists of local processing and communication delay. In the proposed method an input image content, C, is divided into n pieces, Ci \(1 i n Ri is the rendered image piece of Ci, and R is a merged image of all Ri. S is a set of m participating servers, e ach of which is represented as Si \(1 i m\. The overall cost of distributed rendering for a content C, CostC, is defined as following  CostC = Proccl + Comm\(cl,S\ + ProcS + Comm\(S,cl    where Proccl and ProcS are processing delay at a client, cl, and serve rs, S, respectively. Comm\(cl,S\and Comm\(S,cl\ are communication delay of content from a client, cl, to servers, S and vice versa  Comm\(cl,S\ is the delay summation of transmitting all Ci to Si, and Comm\(S,cl\ is the summation of transmission delay from a ll Si to cl as described in equation \(1\ and \(2 respectively. If the existing single server based rendering approach uses a server S 222 its communication delays Comm\(cl,S 222 and Comm\(S 222 cl\, are almost same as that of the proposed scheme, because all imag e pieces must be sent. If multiple transmissions are done in parallel with separate channels, it can save the delay          The processing delay of a server set, ProcS, occurs when participating servers process and stylize the input image pieces Comparing to our approach, the processing overhead of the single server method causes much higher overhead, because only one server m ust be responsible for rendering the whole content  While the proposed scheme reduces its server processing and communication overhead, it pay higher cost for client processing overhead. Proccl is defined as equation \(3\ where Dpart is local processing cos t for partitioning an input image Dmerge is the cost for merging result image pieces, and Ddisp is the cost for displaying an output image   Proccl = Dpart + Dmerge + Ddisp  3  137 


For the proposed scheme, Dpart and Dmerge  are additional processing cost comparing to the single server approach, since the existing scheme does not need to partition  and merge tasks  We conducted an experiment to quantitatively measure the overall cost of distributed processing as we changed th e number of servers and the size of input images. For the experiment, we implemented a test client/server applications using Visual Studio 2010 on the Windows 7. Test machines are connected through 100 Mbps LAN When the client  split s  the image into pieces the number of pieces is automatically decided  to the number of connected servers. If the client connects to one server, it does not split the image   The overall cost is measured as the total elapsed time from the moment when the client splits an image t o the moment when it completes to merge image pieces. Fig   9 shows the experimental result Comparing to the case of single server, the two server case reduces the overall cost Furthermore the bigger is the image size, the more is the amount of cost reduction  VIII  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we proposed a distributed rendering scheme In our approach, a client splits the image into pieces, and then sends them to different servers. Each server receives an image piece and run a processing routine for the styl ization of the piece. When processed image pieces are sent back to the client it merges them into one image Using multiple servers which stylize only parts of a whole image, the proposed system overcomes the limitation of single rendering server, and can  process high quality image  with marginal processing cost  Currently, our research is still in progress, and we are planning to conduct more  quantitative performance evaluation s  according to different image size and number of servers in an extensive manner We also have a plan to extend our approach to adaptive distributed rendering technique. In this approach the number of participating servers is dynamically chosen according to the size of input image in order to make the system more scalable than curren t fixed environment   Fig. 9.
