  5 The GAFTS-0001 requirement is bounded by line numbers 25 through 38 which would be reported in real-time during execution of this segment of code. There is no limit to the number of lines of code within a single requirement nor is there a limit to the number of requirements  4  S RS  TIMELINER PARSER  A program written in ANSI C was developed to automatically generate the Autonomous Real Time Tracking Sequence. The storage mechanism employed in this program is a single linked list data structure. A single linked list structure consists of a head pointer which points to the entire list by storing a pointer to the first node. Each consecutive node contains a pointer to the next node and so on. The last node has its next field set to NULL to mark the end of the linked list. A single linked list diagram is depicted in Figure7. The AFTS SRS and Timeliner-TLX TM  compiler listing files are given as inputs to the program. The program begins by reading in the AFTS SRS saved in a .txt extension. The parsing of the SRS document consists of storing all of the requirements found in the SRS into the linked list structure. The sample code segment in Figure 8 depicts the insertList function which inserts the requirement into the linked list. Parsing of the Timeliner-TLX TM files involves first checking to make sure the requirement found matches a requirement in the SRS. This check is accomplished using a search function which iterates through the linked list of requirements. An example of the SRS to Timeliner-TLX TM requirement validation is depicted in figure 9.A key point to notice in Figure 9 is that the program will catch if the Timeliner-TLX TM source code and SRS requirements do not match. Also, the program will determine if the Timeliner-TLX TM unique identifiers are not paired, or have an erroneous or misspelled unique identifier The program will conclude with generating a TimelinerTLX TM source file which will be converted into the Tracker Sequence Figure 7 \226 Single Linked List Diagram  Figure 8 \226 Linked List Implementation Example  Define a linked list structure to store the SRS requirement typedef struct requirement   char req[10 t ring arra y of te n ele m e n t s   struct requirement *next; //next pointer to point to next element in the linked list srs_req  if\(strstr\(str,"%"\eck if substring contains Requirement unique identifier in SRS    if\(p = strchr\(str, '%'\d first occurrence of % in substring    strncpy\(&temp[0 p   1 1  co p y  f r o m ele v en th ele m e n t to te m p arra y  starti n g at ele m e n t z e ro    temp[10   0  N u ll ter m i n a t e th e stri n g    insertList\(temp\;  // Insert requirement into linked list

  7 5  T RACKER SEQUENCE  The Tracker Sequence is the output file of the SRS/Timeliner-TLX TM file parser. This file will be compiled which generates an executable and a listing file The executable is then installed into the Timeliner-TLX TM Executor / Engine. Upon installation, the operator must start the Tracker Sequence. As soon as the Tracker Sequence becomes active, this sequence will run every second scanning for active bundles. The first check in the sequence will determine if a given bundle is active. The logic will then decide if the specified sequence in the current bundle is active. If the sequence is active, it will then check if the sequence statement is within a range of line numbers. If the active sequence lies between the sequence statement range a message will then be logged to the Timeliner-TLX TM  engine log file indicating a requirement has been encountered. Figure 10 depicts the Tracker Sequence code Figure 10 \226 Tracker Sequence Code Example  6  R EAL TIME EXECUTION  The Tracker Sequence must be started first in the execution order as installing the HAL_Main Bundle will begin autonomous operations for the AFTS Test-Bed. The Tracker Sequence monitors for the bundle installation of HAL_Main. When the bundle is installed, sequences within the bundle become \223active\224 automatically. Once the HAL_Main bundle installation is detected, the Tracker Sequence monitors for the individual sequences to become active. Once the sequences become active, Timeliner-TLX TM begins reporting execution line numbers. The Tracker Sequence monitors the reported line numbers for requirement ranges, matching a line number to the requirement line number ranges. When a match is found, a message statement is issued to the Timeliner-TLX TM  console. A log message is written to the log file. This same interaction is performed for each bundle and sequence that is installed and becomes \223active\224, as many times as the sequence is executed. After the test-plan is executed, the log is utilized for analysis of requirement coverage. For the AFTS Test-Bed, the log depicts the time of execution and the order of the test-plan as executed in real-time. If multiple test plans are to be executed, such as an autonomous plan of fluid transfers, the Tracker sequence can simply stay active as it continually scans for bundle installations and active sequences until manually stopped by the operator. There are occasions where a requirement is satisfied by only a few lines of code producing a line number range that is small. The AFTS Test-Bed had one requirement \(validate transfer quantity\ which  encompassed only one or two lines of code. During testing the team noticed the validation requirement was not being reported, although the validation code was executed. This meant that the Timeliner-TLX TM execution engine was executing these lines of code rapidly enough that the reported execution line was past the requirement bounded code. The TLX engine executes at a 1 Hz rate within the CPU, and the number of statements that the engine can execute is dependent upon the number of sequences that are currently active. The more sequences that are active, the less number of statements within each sequence are executed The solution to force reporting of bounded statements is to place a \223Wait 1\224 statement within the requirement range The WAIT statement provides a one second wait in execution and will force the sequence to give up its execution time slice within the TLX engine, and the current line number will be reported  7  L OG OUTPUT AND ANALYSIS  Figure 11 shows the log output produced by the Tracker Sequence. The time frame of this log file shows the initialization of the AFTS through three autonomous fluid transfers; one via the back-up leg with one of a quarter tank quantity, a second transfer where the crew selects the quantity transferred over the backup leg, and the third transfer which is a crew selectable quantity transferred over the primary leg. During initialization of the AFTS, the software system queries the crew on the status of manual valves which does not provide telemetry. If the manual valves are not in an operational state, or the query is not Sequence TRACKER Active We start our control loop to monitor every second  Every 1.0 then If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.BUNSTAT = BUN_ACTIVE Then -- Is the bundle active If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.Initialize.SEQSTAT = SEQ_ACTIVE Then -- Is the Initialize Sequence active If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.Initialize.SEQSTMT IN 25..38 then -- Current line within the req range Message "GAFTS-0001 Manual Valve Status Query Requirement End If If AWTS_HAL_MAIN.Initialize.SEQSTMT IN 39..54 then -- Current line within the req range Message "GAFTS-0006 Autonomous Procedure Installation Requirement End If End If End If 


  8 answered within one minute, the system inhibits the autonomous installation of auto-procedures preventing operation of the test bed in a non-operational state. The log traces the date and time, the requirement encountered and executed, the Timeliner-TLX TM Bundle Name that contained the requirement, the tracking tag of the bundle which is created at compilation time and utilized for configuration management of the software system, and the requirement ID including the text that was encountered during execution. The Tracking Tag is another unique feature of the Timeliner-TLX TM system as this internal identifier is also reported in telemetry during execution allowing operations to uniquely identify the procedures in execution. The Tracking Tag can be decoded as it is a date/time stamp, produced in binary coded decimal, after a successful compilation of the procedure. The log output shows that after the crew manual valve query, autonomous installation of the AFTS software occurred and that three fluid transfers of different types were directed by the crew The log is then used to determine which requirements were met during the current test plan. In this way, test plans can be tailored to include operations that were missed. Software Quality personnel can now scan the log for requirement and test plan analysis for anomalies encountered during testing Figure \226 11 Timeline-TLX Log Output Example  8  S UMMARY  The Command and control procedures developed utilizing the Timeliner-TLX TM within AFTS test-bed have been instrumental in proving the concept of automated and autonomous operations for a deep space mission. The testing has helped to pave the path for extended research and validating the transition from auto-procedure to flight software. The idea of moving command and control from ground control centers to th e crew on a manned deep space mission involves extended research of how to develop intelligent auto-procedures and how much of the operational environment will change. The early analysis of Autoprocedures has shown that there are 4 types of procedures Extensive testing and research will be needed to solidify this confidence and exactly detail the development requirements for auto-procedures to be an accepted norm for operations Further hardware software integration testing will lead to a more detailed concept of what an autonomous architecture will entail and how to qualify the software for flight.

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
