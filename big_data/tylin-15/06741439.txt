In recent years because  the traditional classifier algorithms are designed only for balanced cases, these  classifiers  always achieved poor performance  in imbalanced data classification issues especially  for the imbalanced data with a really high density. This paper introduces  the  importance of imbalanced data classification in 
various fields  first then, contend s  existing  methods of  solv ing  the imbalanc ed data classification problem; finally, proposes two new sampling methods, which are based on borderline SMOTE, for the imbalanced data with high density especially for big data  with this kind of distribution feature These two new algorithms are not onl y over sampling the minority samples near the borderline, but als o creat ing  appropriate  synthetic samples in the majority class samples side and under sampling some particular majority class samples. Experiments show that these two algorithms  could  achieve  a better performance than random over sampling, SMOTE   Synthetic minority over sampling technique   and Borderline

In recent years, with rapid  development of computer science and tec hnology classification of data  sets attracts more and more attention s  Imbalanced data  sets exist in different areas of a wide range 
of issues such as face recognition  t h e  a na l y s i s o f satellite imagery detection of oil spills [2  f i n a n c i a l r is k  analysis [3  me d ic al d i ag n o s t ic  d e c is io n  ma k i n g  4    a n d s o  on. In many areas, compar ing  with samples in the majority class, minority samples tend to contain  more valu able information  E.g in diagnosis of cancer, the minority samples are positive, and the majori ty samples are negative   A s a rule it is more severe that a potential  cancer patient positive is  misdiagnosed as a health person \(negati ve  than the opposite situation   because this patient might have missed the best time for treatment  Ambiguous  boundaries of classes  and unsatisfactory performance of  classification algorithms  
are caused by reasons as follow. First  traditional machine lea rning classification algorithms are designed for  data  sets  with balanced  distribution second, previous studies have shown that data  sets with imbalanced  distribution  features, often have three factors that had negative affect  on performance of classificat ion work   20   w h ic h  a r e s ma l l minority samples size  overlapping and small disjunct  And since  many imbalanced data  set s  have  high density distribution feature  s o called high density distribution feature is that all or most of samples are distributio n in a relative ly  narrow samples  space Comparing with the data  sets 
with  medium density or low density data distribution since  most minority samples  are  distribute d  very close with each other, class es  boundaries  of data  sets with  high  density  are more di fficult to be distinguished, minority samples  are more  often regarded as noise, or classified into a fault class Combin ing  with the general  problems in  all  the imbalance d  data  set s  which  have described above, they cause that the performance of cl assificat ion of imbalanced data  sets, which have the high density distributi on feature, was further reduced  E specially for the big data  which have  more instances distribute in a relative smaller space 
 make  the  data  sets  with higher  density  and lead work perform ance worse   Facing to the imbalanc ed data  sets with high density, this paper proposes two new sampling methods accordingly They are based on the ideas that more distinct  border lines  could make more contributions to the classification work and minority s amples tend to contain more valuable information than majority samples. And these  two  sampling methods will be validated  through experiments  This paper only studies  binary class problem  The structure of th is paper is organized as follow Section 2 gives a brief introduction to the recent developments in the domains of imbalanced data sets. Section 3 describes two  new sampling 
 methods for  resolving the problem of cl assification of imbalanced data  sets with high density Section 4 presents the experiments a nd compares the new  sampling  approaches  with other traditional over sampl ing methods, and analyze  the experiments\222 results.

II  C URRENT A PPROACHES  The studies  show that there are many solutions that solve the problem of imbalanced learning. These approaches could be mainly divided i nto two categories. Th e first category of methods solve the problem at  data level, that is, methods make imbalanced data sets into a balanced distribution  through appropriate sampling the second type of approaches consider s  classification of imbalanced da ta sets at  algorithm level, which improve s  traditional and existing machine learning classifier algorithm, then get ting  a new classifier with  a better performance on imbalanced classification  A  Approaches at Data Level  Solving the problem of imbalanced lear ning through  taking sampling methods, that is   considering this problem from the perspective of changing the data distribution characteristics. In other words reconstruct ing  the original imbalanced data sets   and  making  the  new  training sets  have the  bala nced data  distribution characteristics Researches have shown that balanced data sets always have a better classification performance than imbalanced data sets [6    u nde r t h e s a m e e x i s t i ng c l a s s i f i e r a l go ri t hm  S a m pl i ng methods are divided into two ap proaches  one is  over sampling   another is  under sampling  Random under sampling method  is  base d  on  the  idea that through removing the samples in the majority class randomly changing the distribution of class into a balanced state Random over sampling al gorithm is which trying to balance the distribution of class by randomly adding  instances in the  minority  class. Both over sampling and under sampling have significant drawbacks, such as under sampling may lose some potential  information, and over sampling  may lead the over fit ting     There are many potential problems when using random under sampling method or random over sampling method However, there are  still a lot of sampling algorithms mak ing  improvements  on them E.g Kubat and Matwin [9 proposed a method to do the under sampling work in the majority class, which is called one sided selection; Mani and Zhang [10  u s ed k n e ar es t n e i g h b o r s  cl a s s i f i e r t o  s el ect  samples which should be under sampling; Chawla et al pr oposed SMOTE algorithm which create s  synthetic samples in the minor ity class. And experiments show  that it outperformance traditional sampling method s Han et al described that instances which are distribute near class border lines  as having  more influence on performance  of classificatio n  work and proposed an improved SMOTE algorithm, which is called Borderline SMOTE. This new algorithm only creates synthetic samples by using specific original samples, which distribute near the border line. And the new algorithm can achieve  a  better pred iction for the minority class [12   B  Approaches at Algorithm  Level  As  what have  been  mentioned above, the sampling methods change the data distribution characteristics, and then solv e  the problem that standard  classifier algorithms  could not adapt to imbala nced data sets. But there are still many researches try ing  to solve imbalanced learning problem at the algorithm level. E.g., a reasonable cost matrix could help cost sensitive learning find the minimum  classification cost and then get the best prediction  result [13  Since  the minority samples are always classified into a wrong class and regarded  as noise samples in  the real world In the cost sensitive learning minority instances  are always given  a relative higher m isclassification cost  than majority in stances  T h is strategy  makes classifier algorithms pay more attention  to predict these difficult  samples. In addition i n recent years  as a kind of e ffective  classification method  E nsemble L earning is  more widely  applied in imbalanced classification  than  before By sorting and combin ing  weak classifiers, ensemble learning achieves a strong classifier which has a better work performance T here are  a large amount of improvements that base on ensemble learning method, such as  Wang  et al  described Threshold  SMOTE with Attribute Bagging    Utasi  investigate d w eighted conditional mutual information based boosting  22 and  Chawla  et al. proposed SMOTEBoost 14  which ha ve  a good performance on predicti ng  the minority class through combining sampling met hod s and E nsemble L earning   III  A  N EW S AMPLING A PPROACH  FOR I MBALANCED D ATA S ETS WITH H IGH D ENSITY   D ISTINCT B ORDERLINE  A LGORITHM  Previous stud y [1  indicated that, due to the ambiguous class  boundar ies   samples which  d istribute near the border lines   are easie r to be misclassified than others In other words  these boundary samples often have a more significant influence on the classification performance It is clear that a lot of boundary samples which  in big data  distribution space  make the classification p erformance worse  Then that study  also proposed an improved SMOTE algorithm, which only us es  boundary samples to create artificial  samples  and adding them into minority class  To begin with, from what  have  been  mentioned above comparing with data sets wit h low  density and medium density, it is clear that the distances  between majority samples and minority samples are smaller  in  a  high density data set   and the class border lines are more ambiguous  S o   more minority sample s will be  regarded as noise sample s  or misclassified into a wrong class  in  the  high density  imbalanced  data set  Moreover, although under sampling may make some valuable information to be ignored; after considering the situation that  researchers always pay more attention to minority sample s i f  a small amount of specific majority boundary instances  are  removed it is a  useful way to make the class border lines more clearly and also could improve the classification performance   In other words, more minority samples will  be classified correct ly  and  boundary sa mples in the majority side were  removed   thus  mak ing  majority and minority have a more striking distance  T h is paper proposes two  new sampling methods that base  on the definition  of border line subset in Boderline SMOTE algorithm and the approa ch of creat ing  synthetic samples in SMOTE algorithm. Suppose the whole training set is S the majority samples set is S maj the minority samples set is S min  the boundary subset of majority class is S Bmaj the boundary 218 


subset of minority class is S Bm in  The main steps of the  DB   Distinct Borderline   algorithm are as follow   Step 1  For each sample in the minority class S min  calculat ing  it\222s the  number of  K  nearest neighbors from the  whole  training data set S, by using KNN classifier algorithm Especi ally K  should  be  suitable for the following condition 0   K    S    Step 2 According to  the results of the first step  this step calculat es  the  boundar y  subset of minority class S Bmin   T he main idea  is  as follow s for K  n earest neighbors of each sample  in S min if the size  of its neighbors from S maj  outnumbers  the  size  of its neighbors from S min then this sample would be  regard ed  as  the  boundary sample, and add ed  to the S Bmin   I n contrast if the size  of its neighbors from S maj  outnumbers  the size  of its neighbors from S min   this sample would be  regarded as the no ise or inner class instances and  anything  should not be done  I t should be noted that  S Bmin S min    Step 3  According to  the results of the second  step for each sample in S Bmin  this step c alculates its nearest sample f r o m S maj by using the nearest neighbor  algorithm, and addi ng this nearest majority sample  into S Bmaj When this step is finish ed, each sample in S Bmin  could be mapped to only one  sample from S Bmaj and these two boundary subsets make up the class border lines together. E specially  S Bmin S Bmaj    Step 4  In this step according to the sampling rate   specific numbers of synthetic  samples are  to  be  add ed  i nto the original training set S  First of all some synthetic samples which are generated through  SMOTE sampling method   are  add ed  into the minority class   I t should be noted that  DB 1  Distinct Borderline1  sampling algorithm onl y generates artificial  samples from S Bmin that is, both X i  and Y i  which are used to create synthetic sample X new come from S Bmin While  for DB2  Distinct Borderline2 ampling algorithm X i  is selected from  S Bmin   Y i however, could be selected from  eit her S Bmin  or S min   Second synthetic  majority  samples  start  to  be  generate d  in majority class  and added  in to  S and the number of synthetic samples should equal to S Bmaj The algorithm uses SMOTE [1 e t h o d t o  generate  synthetic instances The brief int roduction is as follow s taking generate synthetic in the minority class as an example. First of all X i   S min   and Y i  is a neighbor sample which is selected from X i 222 s  K  neares t neighbors randomly Second, a  different factor Dif i  is  generated  randomly whic h should fit  the  condition that  0   Dif i   1 Third  X i   Y i  and  Dif i  are put into the 1   which  is  propose d  below. Finally the synthetic sample X new  is generated. The approach of generating  synthetic samples in the majority class is in the similar way     X new   X i  Y i  226  X i   327  Dif i  i    1,2,3\205  S Bmin       1  Step 5  S ince minority samples always contain  more valuable information than majority side  the  boundaries  samples   which appear both in S Bmaj  and S maj  are removed  a fter adding synthetic sample s both in majority class and minority class  make the class border lines more clearly  In other words, the algorithm selects specific samples, which distribute in the specific area, and then using under sampling method in them   A s a result  more minority sam ples could be classified correctly  After all the steps are finished, a new training set S new  is generated by using DB  algorithm  IV  E XPERIMENTS AND A NALYSIS  In this paper, all of data sets in experiments come from UCI repository  16  T h e n um be r  of  bou n da r y  samples is taken as a criterion, which shows  density of data sets \(the number of boundary  samples is  to be  calculated during the experiment This paper only study binary class problem. If there is a data se t contains more than two class  labels the class with  the  minim um size  is  taken as minority class, and remaining  classes are  regard as majority class. The data sets are described in T able  I   The r atio of s ampling  make imbalanced data set change into  b alanced  data  d istribution  and that  is determined like  2  Satimage  data set sources from  a satellite. User data set describes  the students knowledge status about a  subject The instances  in Segment  data set are drawn randomly from a database of outdoor images Transfusion  data set demonstrates a  marketing model  and uses a binary variable  to  represent whether he/she donated blood  Breast  data set is used  to d iagnos e the breast cancer  Austral s ian  data set is used to determine that whether credit card applications  should  be approved  or not  R atio   S maj   10 0 S min      2   The experiment s  use  C4.5 classifier in Weka [1    18 t o  compare the work performance of original training set with the  new  training set, which is generated  by DB  algorithm First of all, C4.5 is a widely used algorithm   and at the same time, it is also a classifier which has common standards  Second, C4.5 algorithm is sensitive to the data distribution The more imbalanced  d ata distribut es   the worse classification  performance C4.5 algorithm achieves  19   t his could  ma ke  the improvement  more significantly. Finally C4.5 algorithm has the t ransparent  classification progress which is says that researchers could understand the whole classification progress, and this may provide  help to the future study  Considering the di stribution  characteristic s  of imbalanced data sets, the  size  of  majority class samples outnumbers  size of  minority class samples   it  leads  to  a phenomenon that a relative ly  high accuracy could be achieved, when all of the minority instances are ignored. So the present a tom ic e valuation metric s of classification cannot adapt to the imbalanced classification. At the same time, some c omposite e valuation metric s also have problems. E.g when the classification accuracy of majority samples is very high  G Mean  often achieves a high value by  ignoring some minor ity samples. In this paper, AUC  is used to evaluate work performance. Larger AUC value means that the boundaries between majority class and minority class are  distinguish ed  more clearly     The first experiment is used to verify the hypothesis  that DB1 and BD2  are more effective to solve the imbalanced learning proble ms with high density data distribution characteristic   219

T able  II  also shows that the increment s  of A UC are  related  to  the  number of boundary samples. If there are more boundary samples in a data set there are  more significant increment s As what have  been  mentioned above, the number of boundary samples tend s  to reflect the data distribution density; the  more boundary sample s  a data set has, the higher density the data set has. If an imbalanced data set has  really high density, the problem of  overlapping and small disjunct  would be  more serious  and the border lines would be  harder to be distinguished. As  a result existing  methods usually achieve poor classification performance when facing this kind of data sets Since  DB1  and DB 2 generate  synthetic samples in both sides; at the same time, considering minority instances always contain more valuable inform ation than majority instances, they do under sampling work in majority class side, this idea make the border lines more clearly than other methods So we make h ypothesis  that  DB1 and DB2 are  especially fit to solve the problems about  imbalance data sets  w ith high density   T he second experiment  is used to  verify the assumption  which is  go t  after analy zing results  of  the  first experiment  The experiment steps are as follow: first ly half of samples in Satimage  data set are removed randomly, but the percentag e of minority samples is not changed \(error should no more  than 0.5%\. Comparing with original Satimage  data set, the half of Satimage  data set has a relative ly  low density Second ly sampling these two training data by using DB1  and DB 2 algorithm will ac hieve four training data sets  Finally, each  one  of these four training data sets is  to be  used in C4.5, and then test ed  at the same testing set  TABLE II  INCREMENT  OF AUC  Data Set  Comparing with traditional methods  R a tio of  Incre ment  Number of Boundary Samples  Sa timage  Great  5.019  143  User  Very Little  0.041  12  Segment  Equal  0  3  Transfusion  Very Little  0.044  35  Breast  Little  1.05  59  Australian  Little  1.03  81   Fig   2  shows the experiment result. It indicates that, after sampling by DB1  and DB 2, data sets with high density outperformance data sets with  relative ly  low er  density Comparing with  the data set with  relative ly  low er  density the best improvements of AUC for DB1  and DB 2 are 7.89  and 8.5  respectively So, a conclusion could be safely achieved, it  is clear that D B 1 and D B 2 are  especially fit to solve the problems about  classification of  imbalance data sets  with high density        c     b     a   220

At the same time, high density distribution characteristic make s  the distances between two classes  smaller, the border lines more difficult to be distinguished  and  the  problem of  overlapping and small  disjunct  more seriously et al  In addition, those data sets with big samples size always have higher density   These reasons make existing  sampling methods achieve worse  performance. For solving the problem what ha s been  mentioned above, this paper propo sed two new sampling methods, which are D B 1  and D B 2; and then adopting C4.5 and A UC evaluat ion  metric to verify their performance in the experiments part  First of all, considering that boundary samples have more influence on classification, the algorithms  generate synthetic samples in  both majority and minority  boundaries areas Second, considering that minority samples always contain more valuable potential information than others, and in order to make the border lines more clearly, the algorithms remove specific majority samples at the same time. The experiments indicate  tha t the algorithms, which suggested  in this paper make performance of classification of imbalanced data sets with high density improve greatly  A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments  R EFERENCES  1  Y.

Much of the w ork on lar ge distrib uted systems has been based on 2D decompositions The y were introduced in  where the authors also gi v e a comparison between 1D and 2D partitioning Other w orks using 2D partitioning include the results on BlueGene  L described in  and the already mentioned  One of the problems with using a 2D decomposition is that the representation may become h ypersparse i.e there may be nodes with more edges assigned than v ertices In  as part of their w ork on sparse linear algebra the authors introduce a compression scheme suitable for dealing with the issue Another line of research has focused on single-node system shared memory graph algorithms using CPUs as in the case of   or man ycore architectures lik e   W e mak e e xtensi v e use of bitmaps to represent v erte x sets to the best of our kno wledge this technique w as 002rst introduced in  in a GPGPU conte xt Other interesting w ork has been done on multithreaded shared memory architectures
