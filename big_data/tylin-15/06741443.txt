  Figure 6 From scientific workflow to cloud based infrastructure  VII  R ELATED WORK  There are not many academic papers related to the definition of the Big Data Architecture or its components Due to the specifics of this paper that intends to explore a new emerging technology domain   we have widely researched  both currently existing publications related to the Big Data technology and research papers and best practices documents from other domains that could contribute to the definition of the proposed Big Data Architecture Framework. A  number of publications  standards, and industry best practices have been  mentioned and cited in this paper. Here we just mention these works that we consider as a foundation for our work The authors actively contribute to the NIST Big Data Working Group that provide s  a good forum for discussion but have plans to produce initial set of the draft document s  only by the end of September 2013 The following publications contribute to the research on the Big Data Architecture  NIST Cloud Computing Reference Architecture CC RA 18   B ig  Data  E co s y s te m  A r ch itect u r e definition by Microsoft [20   B ig  Data  tech n o lo g y  a n al y s is  b y  G.Mazzaferro [21     We also refer to other related architecture definitions Information as a Service  by Open Data Center Alliance [22   TMF Big Data A nalytics Architecture 23   IBM Business Analytics and Optimisation  Reference Architecture 24   LexisNexis HPCC Systems [25   VIII  F UTURE R ESEARCH AND D EVELOPMENT  The future research and development will include further Big Data definition initially presented in this paper  At this stage we attempt ed to summarise and re think some widely used definition s  related to Big Data, further research will require more formal approach and taxonomy of the general Big Data use cases in different Big Data origin and target domains also analyzing different stakeholder groups    The authors will extend their research into defining the Big Data Security Framework with the specific focus on data centric security that should allow secure data storage transfer and processing in di stributed data storage and processing infrastructure   The authors  are  also looking into defining data structures for high performance streaming applications and developing new types of disk based stream oriented data bases, continuing the work started fro m the authors work on CakeDB  database  4 4    The authors will continue contributing to the NIST Big Data WG targeting both goal s  to propose own approach and to validate it against the industry standardisation process   Another target research direction is d efining a Common Body of Knowledge \(CBK\ in Big Data to provide a basis for a consistent curriculum development. This work and related to the Big Data metadata procedures and protocols definition is planned to be contributed to the Research Data Alliance RDA   4 5     The authors believe that the presented paper will contribute  toward the definition of the Big Data Architecture Framework and provide a basis for wider discussion to define a new research and technology domain   en-GB A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work is supported by the FP7 EU funded project s  GN3plus and EUBrazil Cloud Connect The authors also express acknowledgement to the members of the Big Data Interest Group at the University of Amsterdam for contribution to the discussion on Big Data Ar chitecture framework and provided valuable advices regarding use cases, suggested technology use and basic operational models  R EFERENCES  1  Global Research Data Infrastructures: Towards a 10 year vision for global research data infrastructures Final Roadm ap March 2012  O nline  Available  http://www.grdi2020.eu/Repository/FileScaricati/6bdc07fb b21d 4b90 81d4 d909fdb96b87.pdf  2  Riding the wave: How Europe can gain from the rising tide of scientific data Final report of the High Level Expert Group on Scientific Data October 2010   O nline   Available at http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/e infrastructure/docs/hlg sdi report.pdf  3  Y.Demchenko  P Membrey, P  Grosso, C   de Laat 000 Addressing Big Data Issues in Scientific Data Infrastructure  000  in First International Symposium on Big Data and Data Analytics in Collaboration \(BDDAC 2013 Part of The 2013 Int  Conf   on Collaboration Technologies and Systems CTS 2013 May 20 24, 2013, San Diego, California, USA  4  NIST Big Data Working Group NBD WG   O nline  Available  http://bigdatawg.nist.gov/home.php  5  Definting Big Data Architetcure Framework Outcome of the Brainstorming Session at the University of Amsterdam 17 July 2013 Present ed  at  NBD WG 24 July 2013  O nline  Available  http://bigdatawg.nist.gov/_uploadfiles/M0055_v1_7 606723276.pdf  6  Reflections on Big Data Data Science and Related Subjects Blog by Irving Wladawsky Berger  online  Available http://blog.irvingwb.com blog/2013/01/reflections on big data data science and related subjects.html  7  E Dumbill, What is big data?

Size of Largeincrease The reasons are twofold Firstly when increases according to the node selection scheme to construct decrease There are two reasons Firstly when the memory size increases the stop condition for graph contraction is easier to be satis\336ed since more nodes can 336t in memory Secondly when the memory size increases the costs of the external sorts in both graph contraction and graph expansion phases decrease  Average Degree Number of Largeincreases the time and I/O consumptions for both increases the number of iterations in graph contraction increases This is because when number of edges increases the cost to sort and scan edges in each iteration increases thus more time and I/Os are consumed in each iteration                                     2 4 1 u E  V v E    u v

are 336xed This also explains why the results in the three datasets Massiveis a primitive operation in directed graph exploration which has been studied for both internal memory model and external memory model In the internal memory model strongly connected components of a directed graph can be computed in s for a directed graph with the assumption that the nodes of the graph cannot reside entirely in memory We overcome the de\336ciencies of the existing external    sort sort computation algorithms and propose a new two-phase algorithm with graph contraction followed by graph expansion We analyze the I/O cost of our approach and show that our algorithm can signi\336cantly reduce the number of random I/Os We propose techniques to further reduce the I/O cost of our algorithm and
