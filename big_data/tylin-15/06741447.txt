A New Data Transmission Mechanism  in Aeronautical Ad Hoc Network  Zhong Dong, Zhu Yian, You Tao, Duan Junhua School of Computer Science Northwestern Polytechnical University Xi\222an, P.R.China zhongyl@nwpu.edu.cn Kong Jie School of Computer Science Xi'an Shiyou University Xi\222an, P.R.China 729475027@qq.com   Abstract 227 In  this paper, a new network topology control mechanism is proposed to impr ove routing path duration in Aeronautical ad hoc network, which can effectively decrease the probability of routing path breaks in the process of nodes highspeed moving, and be integrated with existing routing protocols used in Ad hoc network smoothly. The main principle of topology 
control mechanism is according to the different node densities with different topology construction method. For network regions having a high density of aircraft, the packets are preferentially routed over the long available links created by the aircraft moving in same direction. For low density of aircraft, the routing preferentially uses the short available links created by the aircraft moving in both directions. This mechanism can increase the routing path duration effectively. We combine the topology control mechanism with OLSR, and give the Path Link Availability Routing Protocol \(PLAR\We compare the performance of PLAR protocol wi th other routing protocols in different scenes. Experimental results show that, PLAR protocol 
exhibits a significant improveme nt over most routing protocols base on topology and position Keywords-topology control routing protocol Ad hoc 
mobile computing wireless network I  I NTRODUCTION  AANET \(Aeronautical Ad Hoc Ne twork\s a kind of Ad Hoc Network. AANET has its own features compared with the traditional MANET. In the AANET, the mobile speed of nodes is generally higher. The mobility of nodes is usually constrained by flight path of aircraft. And the nodes are not so constrained in terms of energy. The rapid change of network topology in course of moving leads to frequent links break 
between nodes, thereby cause frequent routing path interruption, which can bring great influence for the persistent session established by applications. These problems have brought new challenges to routing protocol in AANET, which require the routing protocol can detect the frequent network topology change and then take the effective methods for handling. Comparing AANET with MANET, the mobility of nodes in AANET has certain regularity and controllability And available time of links is considered a crucial metric for high mobility of AANET. The routing protocols adopt the links with long available time in the process of routing path build, which can increase the stability and reliability of the routing path greatly. The current routing protocols used in MANET can be divided into two categories [1-2 lo g y  
based and position-based In topology-based routing mechanisms, the nodes need store routing tables or routes which depend on the topology This kind of protocols includes the AODV \(Ad hoc OnDemand Distance Vector Routi ng\, OLSR \(Optimized Link State Routing\ and others \(DSDV, DSR, TORA and FSR Strictly speaking, these protocols were proposed for MANET where the nodes are assumed to move with low velocity and frequency. On this condition, these protocols are allowed to establish available end-to-end paths within a reasonable time range. And only occasionally need repair the path according to the movement features. Consequently, these protocols are used for AANET with high mobility, which is not easy to meet various requirements of appli cations in AANET. Especially when various aircrafts move with high-speed, these protocols 
are difficult to meet the demand of real-time data transmission Therefore, the protocols based on topology for MANET are used for AANET, which faces some challenges. one of the key problems is nodes in AANET usually require updating the routing information in quasi real time, in order to perceive the change of network topology in time, which can cause high cyber resources consumption. And some optimization can alleviate the consumption, such as the design of a lightweight protocol based on link state aware in [3   The position-based routing protocols mainly include GSR GPSR, LORA_CBF, RBVT, GyTA R and COALS, etc [4-9   This class of protocol often uses the location of the neighbor nodes and destination node to determine the next hop node forwarding the packets. In mo st cases, the nodes do not need record any address or routing 
table for forwarding packets only record the corresponding position of nodes. But these protocols also have their negative side. For example, when a fault occurs in positioning system of nodes, in order to inform other nodes of its new location, the node must broadcast its location to other nodes, which will increase the consumption of cyber resource This paper focus on routing mechanism based on topology in AANET, and aim to provide an ideal environment for the applications in AANET, which is not relying on positioning system. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 255 


2 introduces the nodes mobility models in AANET. In Section 3 we describe a topology control mechanism based on nodes mobility models in AANET. Section 4 describes a routing mechanism based on high mobility of node in AANET Section 5 addresses the simulations. Finally, the summary and outlook are given in Section 6 II NODES  MOBILITY  MODEL  IN  AANET For further description of service matching mechanism, we will introduce the automatic se rvice provision architecture which is shown in figure.1 firstly Mobile nodes in AANET are usually all kinds of air vehicles Each air vehicle always moves along different flight routes in accordance with all assigned missi ons. And the flight path is always a straight line. The same flight route usually has two different directions, one is the direction which air vehicles start off on their missions, another is direction homed at end of missions Our research focuses on the theoretical method of network construction, when air vehicles flight along bidirectional straight line route. The follo wing is an instance of the theoretical model We adopt the following assumptions: set the distance between two air vehicles m 1 and m 2 to d   the radio communication range of each node is r the velocity of two air vehicle nodes m 1 and m 2 are represented by the vectors 1 v and 2 v  respectively. A link between two nodes is created if d r We consider two cases: when the nodes move with high speed the link between the nodes will re main active in the case of 12 vv   the link will be broken after some time if 12 vv   According to the flight charac teristics of the air vehicles on the same route 1 v  and 2 v  can be represented in polar coordinates v 1 1 and v 2 2 with v 1 v 2  V min  V max  and 1 2   the relative velocity of the nodes is represented by 12 1 12 21 12 2  cos  cos  s   s   r in in vvv v v v v      1  And we define its absolute value as 22 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2   2 cos  r v v v v v vv     2  The relative velocity is a function depending on the random variables v 1 v 2 1 and 2 which are mutually independents. We use a random variable to express the relative velocity, and define the expected relative velocity value as 1 2 1 2    r rr E V f V dV vv  3 As the random variables in \(3\ are independent, the joint distribution function  f  V r  is equal to the product of the marginal distribution function 12 1 2        r fV f f f f vv The mathematical expectation of relative velocity can be expressed as max max min min 12 1 2 22 1 2 12 1 2 1 2 1 2        2 cos  r VV EV f f f f VV d d dd vv v v vv v v       4 We assume that two nodes  m 1  and  m 2  form  link 12 at instant t and consider that node m 1 moves with velocity r v relative to node m 2  the  link 12  will be considered broken after some time if 0 r v  If nodes do not change their velocity and the relative distance traveled never exceeds 2 r during the interval t t t  the nodes will maintain the  link 12  active. This scenario is depicted in figure.1  Figure 1 Maximum relative displacement between two mobile nodes without broken their link The probability of a link formed at a time t remaining active at a time t  t is related with the spatial intersection of the covered areas at instants t and t t which is represented by the white area in figure. 2 The radio covering area of the node m 1 at instant t can be depicted by following formula 22 2 r t r r x dx C   5 The radio covering overlap area in the instant t and t t can be represented by function O t t  d  which is the node m 1 move with velocity v 1 in the interval t,t t the distance d 0  2 2 22 2 2 02 0 2   d d r x dx d r dr tt r d O   6  Figure 2 Radio covering circumference ch ange of the node m1 moved d length units between instant t and the time instants t t Now we take the hello message in routing mechanism based on topology \(DSDV, AODV or OLSR protocol\as an example and introduce the method for calculating link available probability in the process of node moving. We consider that the Hello messages are broadcasted every T seconds to discover and/or maintain an active link The distance, which the node m 1  move relative to the node m 2 during the period T, can be calculated by E  V r  T  Therefore, the probability of the link remaining active after nT periods is approximately depicted by Formula \(7\\(N denotes the set of natural numbers This research is sponsored by the Natural Science Foundation of China \(NSFC under Grant No. 61303225  256 


2     r tt connected nTE V n nN O p r  7 We consider the nodes moving with high speed only have two opposite directions. When the nodes move in the same direction, the mathematical expectation of relative velocity can be calculated by the formula \(8\hich is simplified by formula \(4 max max min min 12 22 1 2 12 1 2      2 same direction r VV ff VV V vv E v v vv dvdv  8 When the nodes move in the opposite direction, the mathematical expectation of relative velocity can be calculated by the formula \(9\which is simplified by formula \(4 max max min min 12 22 1 2 12 1 2      2 r opposite direction VV V ff VV vv E v v v v dv dv   9 Proposition 1  The links established by the nodes flight in the same direction take on a higher probability of keeping long time available than in oppos ite direction on one air line Proof The known periodic T is a constant. And the relative distance d E  V r  nT between two moving nodes is proportional to the expected relative velocity E  V r   We can get E  V r  opposite direction E  V r  same direction by formulas \(8\\(9\And O  is a decreasing function in d r By the known conditions and formula \(7\can infer 22       oppositedirection r samedirection r tt tt nTE V nTE V OO rr  Therefore, when the nodes move in the same direction, the probability which the links between two nodes keep long time available is higher When the routing protocols in AANET create multi hop routing path, using proposition 1 can effectively reduce the probability of link break, thereby reducing the probability of routing path interrupt. When the densities of air vehicles flight in the same direction is smaller, the links created by the air vehicles in the same direction may not ensure the interactive data between the two nodes moving can be delivered each other. So we need use the li nks created between the nodes flight in the opposite directi on. Under the circumstances, the proposition 2 can be introduced to optimize the routing mechanism and increase the ava ilable time of routing path Proposition 2 The newest links established by the nodes flight in the opposite direction take on a higher probability of keeping long time available th an old links on an air line Proof Set a time period T and two links link 1 and link 2 created at different time. At the time instant t, the link 1 has lasted for n T n N and the link 2 has lasted for nT n N According to the formula \(7\, the probabilities that the link 1 and link 2 keep available at the time instant t are respectively represented by 2     opposite direction r tt connected nTE V n O p r  and 2      opposite direction r tt connected n TE V n O p r  Since  O t t  d   is a decreasing function in  0 d 2 r  Thus, we can get  p connected  n  p connected  n And the probability which the oldest link  link 1 keeps available is smaller III TOPOLOGY  CONTROL  BASE  ON  MOBILITY  MODEL This section introduces a solution, which uses topology control mechanism to detect and recognize the available links established by two nodes flight on one air line in AANET. In routing mechanisms based on topology control, discovery and maintenance of links between the nodes mainly adopts regular exchange of Hello packets. Therefore, we represent the available time of a link by the number of Hello packets received, and introduce the concep t of node logic neighbor set which is the set of 1-hop nodes which can exchange Hello packets directly from one node Table 1 shows a parameters list of a logic neighbor set of m i here i 1 M i characterizes logic neighbor set of m i  t i  m x  the time instant when the node m i firstly receives a Hello packet from its neighbor node m x and creates a unidirectional link between them i  m x is the stability between m i and m x used to measure the duration of link Formula \(10\ is the calculation method t is current time instant T characterizes the period received Hello message  x  i s t h e l ar g e s t i n t e g e r n o t  g r e a t e r t h a n  x    1 ix i x t T tm m  10 TABLE I L OGICAL NEIGHBORS OF NODE MI  T 132.6 S T=1 S  I 1  i mmm M    i i xx mm M   ix tm   ix Nm  m 2  69 63.8 n 2  m 5  12 121.1 n 5  m 3  4 129.3 n 3  N i  m x is overtime threshold. If no exchange time of Hello packets between two nodes is over the threshold N i  m x we consider the link is broken. And the function of N i  m x is to avoid that links are wrongly considered broken when occasional interference leads to He llo packet loss. Here, we just consider a fixed value N i  m x  4T, which means that the link detection mechanism tolerates up to three consecutive missed Hello packets without deeming it broken. The probability of more than three consecutive misse d Hello packets is small [10 An d w h en t h ere i s not Hel l o packet exchanged via a link for 4 periods, the link is considered broken; the routing algorithm no longer chooses this link; its stability value is reset A Recognition of long time available links This subsection gives a method using the stability value to detect the long time available links between the air vehicles flight in the same direction. As shown in the formula \(11\, a link is considered to have high stability if its stability value i  m x is greater than a given value n stab And we define the 257 


link with high stability as a l ong time available link \(represent with link ix-l   i x stab mn   11  Following is the calculation method of n stab Based on the formula \(6\ and \(7\ a link created by two nodes flight in the opposite direction presents an improbability of keeping the link available when d > 2r and E  V r  0. Due to d E  V r  nT we can infer p connected  n when n  E  V r  T The literature[10 fi n d s t h at k eep i n g t h e li nk  av ailab le in h igh  speed Ad hoc network, relative velocity is approximated by a normal distribution, 99.7% of the velocity observations are within E  V r  3  E  V r   where denotes the standard deviation of the distribution. And we use the lower limit E  V r  3 of relative velocity distribution to get a larger n stab value. The computational method is shown in formula \(12 2   3 stab r r E VT n  12 In other words, after the link is created between two nodes flight in one direction, more than n stab Hello packets are transmitted, which means the link is a long time available link B Recognition of short time available links The links between nodes are not always long time available links for the mobility of the nodes in AANET. Sometimes all existing long time available links can not establish a routing path. On this condition, we need some short time available links to patch the routing path for reliable data transmission When the condition i  m x  n stab holds, a link is considered to be unstable. The unstable link with longer duration is defined as short time available link. And corresponding recognition algorithm uses the proposition 2 to select the node, which creates link with minimum stability value, from logic neighbor set, as shown in the formula \(13  min   i i ix s x x link m m M   13 For the unstable links, we do not distinguish the links created by the nodes flight in the same direction or the opposite direction, and just choose the link with minimum value of i  m x as the short time available link C Topology control based on link stability When majority of logical neighbor nodes have created long time available links between themselves and a node, we consider the node as a stable node, which can be used for broadcasting the messages about network topology change. To avoid a large amount of messages broadcast causing flooding phenomenon, we propose a broadcast agent vote algorithm which can select an agent node to broadcast the messages about network topology change. In addition, the topology consists of long time available links can be effectively used for information dissemination and transfer in the whole of network We assume A m i  is the broadcast agent selected by node m i   and only one broadcast agen t can be selected by node m i  The m i also can learn other broadcast agents selected by the nodes in its logical neighbor set via the Hello message. The detail is shown in algorithm 1 Algorithm 1 The node m i selects its broadcast agent Input M i   i  m x   A i  m x  t i  m x  m x M i  Output A m i  1 max  return _ max _ from_table  2 address  3 A mid   4 thershold  5 IF if_stable_node  m i THEN 6 FOR each neighbor m x M i DO 7  insert_list A i  m x  list_BA   8   END 9 IF m i is BA THEN 10 insert_list  m i  list_BA  11  END 12  FOR  each A x list_BA DO 13  FOR each neighbor m x M i DO 14   m x A x AND if_stable_node  m x  THEN 15          A mid m x  16       END 17     END 18     IF A mid 1 THEN 19        BREAK  20     END 21 IF m i A x THEN 22        A mid m i  23        BREAK  24     END 25  END 26  IF A mid 1 THEN 27    FOR each neighbor m x M i DO 28  max i m x thershold 0 AND address_ m x address THEN 29 address address_ m x  30          A mid m x  31       END 32    END 33  END 34 END 35 A m i   A mid IV ROUTING  MECHENISM  BASE  ON  MOBILE  FEATURE  OF  NODES  IN  AANET This section introduces a new protocol Path Link Availability Routing Protocol \(PLAR\ased on OLSR. And one feature of PLAR is using the stability of link to control the network topology. A core technology used in OLSR is Multipoint relaying \(MPR\ which can reduce the number of redundant retransmissions me ssage when the messages are broadcasted in the network. The Multipoint Relay Set \(MPRs is a set of Multipoint Relay nodes In OLSR, MPRs are chosen as the minimum set of m i s 1-hop neighbor nodes which 258 


cover all its 2-hops neighbor nodes. Therefore MPR nodes can guarantee 2-hops full coverage. Algorithm 1 can generate a broadcast agent set which send the massage about topology change, and construct a stable topology which diffuse the message in the whole of the network. Then we introduce the algorithms 2 and 3, which select and generate the MPRs based on the algorithms 1 A Generation of MPRs for high density of nodes This subsection introduces a new method \(algorithm 2 generating MPRs for the OLSR protocol based on algorithm 1 The basic principle of the method is the choice of nodes with long time available links to generate MPRs. Following is an example about algorithm 2. If a given node m i runs the algorithm 2, only need to know its logic neighbor set M i  stability value i  m x and 2-hop neighbor set M 2i  In the OLSR 2-hop neighbor set includes all 2-hop neighbor nodes of m i In our algorithm only the 2-hop neighbor nodes which the m i 222 1-hop stable neighbor nodes m x can connect with, can be included in the 2-hop neighbor set. And the nodes set generated by our method can meet the requirement of broadcast for topology update when the density of nodes is high, because the nodes with long time available links are enough. The core principle of the algorithm 2 is MPRs in OLSR consists of broadcast agents Algorithm 2 Generation of MPRs for high density of nodes Input M i  M 2i   i  m x   A i  m x  t i  m x  m x M i  Output MPRs  m i  1 MPRs  m i  330 2 M 2i 2_hop_neighbor  3 FOR each neighbor m x M i DO 4   IF i  m x  n stab AND m x is BA THEN 5 MPRs  m i  MPRs  m i  m x  6 remove_2_hops_from  M 2i  7 remove_1_hops_from_set  m x  M i  8   END 9 END 10 M order  sort_stability_by_descendent  M i  11 WHILE M 2i 330  DO 12 m x  get_first_element  M order  13 MPRs  m i  MPRs  m i  m x  14 remove_2_hops_from  M 2i  15 remove_1_hops_from_set  m x  M i  16 rm_redundance_coverN 2a _from_set  MPRs  m i  M order   17 END  Algorithm 2 shows better results than the MPRs generation algorithm of original OLSR when the number of stable links associated with m i is above a given threshold \(4 stable links If the number of stable links is not above this threshold, the number of nodes contained in MPRs \(Algorithm 2 in line 5\s small. But the number may become bigger in line 12 However, when the number of long time available links between m i and its neighbors is small, the nodes initially inserted in M 2i is also small, which l eads to the number of nodes in MPRs is small. Under this condition, the result of utilization proposition 2 is better  than proposition 1 for the  algorithm design. In the next subsection, we will introduce an additional algorithm, which is better suited for the case that the number of long time available links of m i is below the threshold B Generation of MPRs for low density of nodes When the density of air vehicles is low, the number of long time available links created be tween the air vehicle and its neighbors is small. The result of algorithms 2 is not ideal Under this condition, we can utilize more short time available links to increase the amount of routing path, thereby improving the routing efficiency Therefore, this subsection gives the algorithm 3 based on proposition 2 to generate MPRs for the lower density of nodes Algorithm 3 Generation of MPRs for low density of nodes Input M i  M 2i   i  m x   A i  m x  t i  m x  m x M i  Output MPRs  m i  1 MPRs  m i  330 2 M 2i 2_hop_neighbor  3 FOR each neighbor m x M i DO 4   IF i  m x  n stab AND m x is BA THEN 5 MPRs  m i  MPRs  m i  m x  6 remove_2_hops_from  M 2i  7 remove_1_hops_from_set  m x  M i  8   END 9 END 10 M order  sort_stability_by_ascendent  M i  11 WHILE M 2i 330  DO 12 m x  get_first_element  M order  13 MPRs  m i  MPRs  m i  m x  14 remove_2_hops_from  M 2i  15 remove_1_hops_from_set  m x  M i  16 rm_redundance_coverN 2a _from_set  MPRs  m i  M order   17 END  Algorithm 3 has the same rationale with algorithm 2. The 1hop neighbor nodes of m i which have been selected as broadcast agents and have long time available links with m i  are inserted in MPRs \(lines 3 2268\, since these links are stable Proposition 1 indicate that they have higher probability of keeping available for a long time. If the nodes contained in MPRs generated based on proposition 1 can not access all 2hops neighbor nodes, the algorithm inserts more unstable nodes into MPRs \(lines 10 to 15\r this case, the density of nodes is low, and algorithm 3 uses proposition 2 to select the 1-hop neighbor nodes, which have lowest stability value links to m i as the nodes of MPRs. And the link between m i and its neighbor nodes with lowest stability value has higher probability of keeping long time available C Selection policy of algorithm in PLAR The difference between the algorithm 2 and algorithm 3 is the way of generating the MPRs. When the density of air vehicles is high, the probability of creating more long time available links between m i and its neighbor nodes \(stable neighbor nodes\is high. So the algorithm 2 is applied. For low density of air vehicles \(scenario proposed for Algorithm 3 the probability, which the 1-hop stable neighbor nodes of m i  259 


can access all 2-hop neighbor nodes of m i is low. At this moment, algorithm 3 is more suitable A given node m i running our method uses Algorithm 2 or Algorithm 3 depending on the number of its long time available links. We set a threshold. If the number of long time available links associate with m i is not greater than the threshold. The node m i adopts the Algorithm 3. Otherwise Algorithm 2 is used to generate the MPRs V SIMULATIONS In the simulation, we develop a traffic simulator to simulate air traffic scenarios, and the simulator is integrated into the NS2 \(network simulation platform\late the AANET We have simulated a 100 kilometer air line with three lanes in each direction and the bidirectiona l air traffic with different air vehicles density. And the radio range of air vehicle is 10 kilometer. We define three different classes of air vehicles according to the flying speed for a classic scenario. We define four different scenes regarding the density of air vehicles. The number of packets generated on each density scene was maintained constant at ap proximately 3500 packets In order to compute the threshold n stab we assume that the flying velocities of the three classes of air vehicles are normally distributed approximately. For this case, applying \(8 and \(9\ average relative velocity between two air vehicles flight in the opposite directions E  V r  opposite direction is 589 m/s and the average relative velocity between two air vehicles flight in the same direction E  V r  same direction is approximately 15 m/s We adopt that the transmission frequency of Hello packets \(1/T B is 1 Hz; the maximum communication distance between nodes is 10 kilometers; the standard deviation of mobile velocities is 5 m/s. According to \(12\, we can yield n stab 68 We compared the simulation scenarios to the real scene, the approximation degree of all parameters and data is close to 95%. All simulation results show that the method proposed in this paper is applied to the PLAR, which can increase the path available time significantly. When the routing paths are created by air vehicles flight in one direction, the available rate of routing paths established by OLSR can reach 72.18 When we choose the nodes bidirectional flight to create the routing paths, the available rate of routing paths established by OLSR is only 45.27%. The available rate of routing paths established by PLAR using the nodes bidirectional flight can reach 66.93%, which is closer to the performance of OLSR used in a single direction. In addition, the PLAR is also shown good performance in the end to end delay, only the OLSR is superior to it. But the path available rate of PLAR is better than OLSR, which can be co mparable with the AODV Therefore, the PLAR improves on the available time for routing paths, which shows PLAR is more suitable for the AANET with higher demand on the network stability VI CONCLUTION In this paper, we propose a new routing mechanism for AANET network. This mechanism can reduce the probability of routing path broken by increasing the available time of links in the AANET, so as to improve the performance of routing protocols. The experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the performance of routing protocols based on topology and location, mainly reflected in the path available time. The endto-end delay and path available rate is also enhanced to an ideal level. The innovation of this paper lies in that the node mobility model of AANET is applied to the design and implementation of routing mechanism. In the future, we can further research on probability model representing the realtime parameters of node mobility model, which can provide a theoretical basis for the adaptive routing behavior in AANET R EFERENCES  1 Li F,Wang Y.Routing in vehi cular ad hoc networks:a survey  Vehicular T e ch nology M a gazine I E E E  2007 2  2 1222  2 Bernsen J,Manivannan D.Review:unicas t routing protocols for vehicular ad hoc networks:a critical comparis on and classification[J].

PLAStiCC Runtime Adaptation Heuristic 1 This too uses the advanced prediction model of PLAStiCC but picks the most favorable infrastructure performance highest and data rate lowest from among all timesteps predicted for and uses that single value for all timesteps This offsets the impact of prediction algorithm with under-prediction This heuristic usually leads to low relative throughput since it tends to under-provision resources This is similar to WPO except it picks the least favorable performance and data rate prediction as the single value This handles prediction algorithms with over-prediction This heuristic usually gives the best relative throughput since it tends to over-provision resources VI E VALUATION We evaluate PLAStiCC and other heuristics through a simulations study We extend the  data center simulator to simulates the execution of the Floe stream processing 2 http://github.com/usc-cloud/IaasSimulator  on top of IaaSSim with support for continuous dataîows alternates distributed deployment dynamic instance scaling and plugins for different schedulers For each simulation experiment we deploy a dataîow to the Cloud using FloeSim run it for 12 hours simulated using Amazon EC2ês performance traces   II  which is also the optimization period  T 12 hrs  and repeat it at least three times to get an average We use a timestep duration of t 5 mins and the prediction intervals between P 10  30 mins  We evaluate the adaptation algorithms using a synthetic dataîow in Figure 4 with 10 stages of 3 PEs each and 3 input and output data streams The dataîow is randomly perturbed to generate between 1 3 alternates each with different cost value and selectivity This gives us a total of 30 PEs and 010 45 alternates Each of the three input data streams are independently generated based on observations in domains like Smart Power Starting from a base stream with sinusoidal data rates whose peak and trough range from 75  2 messages and with wave length of 24 hrs  we add random noise every 1 min that varies the rate by up to  20  002 002 002 003\004\005\006\007\010\011\012\006\005\013\014\005\015\005\016\017\006\005\012\010\020\021 002 002 002 003\004\005\006\007\010\011\012\005\007\010\013\004\005\011\010\004\014\010\012\010\011\005\007\010\015\004\016\017\011\004 010\005\020\021\004\022\023\024\004\025\026\007\021\004\015\026\016\016\010\011\010\012\007\004\027\010\021\005\030\026\017\011\031 002 003\032\022\023\013\004\005\012\015\004\033\034\035\004\005\006\007\010\011\012\005\007\010\013\004\026\012\004\005\006\006\031 002 003\004\026\012\036\037\007\004\013\007\011\010\005 \013\004\025\026\007\021\004\013\026\012\037\013\017\026\015\005\006\004 013\007\011\010\005 \004\011\005\007\010\013\004\025\026\007\021\004\036\010\011\026\017\015\026\020\004\012\017\026\013\010\031 We evaluate the heuristics using following metrics The overall application relative throughput  003  the overall application proìt  004  and the Heuristic Stability  005  Speciìcally we verify if the heuristic satisìes the QoS constraint 003 006 004 003  A higher value of 003 beyond 004 003 is not necessarily good unless it also gives a higher overall proìt Further given two heuristics which satisfy the QoS constraint the one with a higher overall proìt is considered better Note that proìt is and can only be compared relatively chi is the frequency of deviation in instantaneous relative throughput 003 t from the 004 003  004 during the optimization period and a smaller value indicates a more stable heuristic The proposed heuristics are evaluated under different prediction oracle models First we evaluate different heuristics under a perfect oracle model that gives accurate predictions over the prediction interval We also run experiments where the predicted performance and data rate values include bounded errors 032 e  to simulate shortcomings of real world prediction models The predictions have smaller error for near timesteps and larger ones for farther timesteps First we linearly scale the error from for the current timestep  e 0 othe 2  032 e for the last timestep  e n  in the prediction interval to give a mean close to 032 e

from a normal distribution with mean and variance equal to  and use this as the actual error for that timestep to obtain the predicted value We can also optionally specify a bias of  that is added to get a positive or negative biased model We make predictions every for all models Further we evaluate them with prediction intervals ranging from 10 mins i.e two timesteps per interval upto to 30 mins and study the effect of the length of prediction interval under different oracles A Results Perfect Oracle Model We rst present the results obtained for the perfect oracle model which signiìes the best case results for the PLAStiCC heuristic as compared to the various reactive models Figure 5 shows comparison between the PLAStiCC algorithm to the reactive models for different metrics    and  with different prediction interval lengths for which the oracle predictions are available Figure 5\(a shows the overall relative throughput for various algorithms observed at the end of the optimization duration We observe that all the adaptation algorithms successfully satisfy the application constraint   over the optimization duration for prediction interval lengths Higher values of relative throughput do not necessarily mean a better algorithm We compare this with  and  Figure 5\(b shows the overall proìt   obtained for different algorithms First we observe that the PLAStiCC algorithm performs consistently better than any of reactive algorithms across different prediction interval lengths Further we also observe that the proìt value for the PLAStiCC algorithm increases as the length of the prediction interval increases This is because with shorter prediction intervals the planned actions for that interval may be already executed before the plan for the future is obtained and hence leads to a reversal in the actual action and not just the planned action the former of which incurs additional cost As the length of the interval increases uctuations further in the future are known and hence the planned activities may be reversed before they are enacted and hence lowering the resource cost In addition we observe that the heuristics based on current CAF and historical average WAAF performance perform fairly similar However the WPP algorithm leads to much lower proìt since it always tries to allocate resources for the worst case scenario hence incurring higher resource cost Further Figure 5\(c shows the stability of the different heuristics lower values are better We observe that the PLAStiCC algorithm is more stable than any of the other heuristics and hence provides more predictable performance over the optimization duration This is mainly because the algorithm pro-actively takes actions such as launch VMs in advance to account for VM launch time while initiating a new instance at the desired time whereas in the reactive versions the delay incurred by such actions cause constraint mismatch till the action is performed This simulation study thus show that the look-ahead PLAStiCC algorithm out-performs all the reactive algorithms in the presence of data and infrastructure variability Further it shows that the PLAStiCC algorithm is dependent on the length of the prediction interval and performs better as the interval length increases Predictions with Errors and Biases Next we analyze PLAStiCC under a more realistic prediction model conditions with prediction errors We compare PLAStiCC against WPO WPA and WPP to evaluate their relative strengths Figure 6 shows the performance of PLAStiCC for models with prediction errors but no biasing As before we observe that the proìt of the algorithm for a perfect oracle model  error increases from to with increase in the prediction interval from  However we see    002\003\004 002\003\005 002\003\006 002\003\007 002\003\010 002\003\011 002 007\002\002 012\013\002\002 012\011\002\002 013\005\002\002 004\002\002\002 004\007\002\002 005\013\002\002 014\015\016\017\020\021\022\023\015\024\025\016 014\025\026\027\021\030\031\027\032\015\033\034\031\035 036\037\027\023\017 \027\021!\023\023\015\023\021\021\002  036\037\027\023\017 \027\021!\023\023\015\023\021\021\006  036\037\027\023\017 \027\021!\023\023\015\023\021\021\012\002  036\037\027\023\017 \027\021!\023\023\015\023\021\021\012\006 036\037\027\023\017 \027\021!\023\023\015\023\021\021\013\002 Figure 6 Overall proìt of PLAStiCC for different prediction error  with prediction interval horizon in secs on X axis

degrading performance as the error rate increases to  We make two observations First for a given prediction interval length the performance decreases as expected as prediction error increases Second with high error values  the performance of the algorithm for a given error rate initially increases with the prediction interval length and then falls with further increase in the interval length inverse bell curve The reason for such behavior is that as we predict farther into the future the error increases But as we move into the future more accurate results are obtained and hence they lead us to reverse actions While most of these are planned actions some enacted ones may be reversed too As the error increases only prediction very close to the current time will prove accurate and hence the PLAStiCC degenerates to the reactive version Finally we compare PLAStiCC against the reactive versions which aggregate predicted values and are potentially affected by the prediction error CAF and WAAF are unaffected by prediction errors and hence skipped Figure 7 shows the overall proìt for WPA WPO WPP and PLAStiCC for different error rates and prediction biases   As seen in the gures PLAStiCC out-perform the others for smaller errors irrespective of the prediction bias while its performance degrades as the error increases since it tries to over-ìt to the predicted values WPA on the other hand performs consistently with different error rates and for different biases While the WPO algorithm which assumes an optimistic infrastructure behavior performs poorly when the prediction errors are unbiased However it performs better than WPA with under-biased predictor With lower predicted values the best performance values over the interval tend to be closer to the real performance value than the average On the other hand WPP performs poorly under all scenarios because it assumes pessimistic infrastructure behavior and hence a single dip in the predicted performance causes it to over-provision resources VII R ELATED W ORK Continuous dataîows have emerged as an extension to the Data Stream Managements systems which were focused on continuous queries over the data streams These have evolved into a general purpose abstraction that provides strong composition tools for building large scale stream processing applications Several such stream processing systems have been recently proposed such as IBM InfoSphere D-Streams[5 Storm[24 and T ime  While these systems are b uilt for lar ge scale stream processing applications and provide distributed deployment and runtime most of these with the exception of Time Stream do not provide automatic dynamic adaptations to changing data rates or performance variability of the underlying infrastructure over the applicationês lifetime The notion of alternates is similar to exible workîo It also dra ws inspiration from dynamic tasks deìned in heterogeneous where a task is composed of one or more alternatives with different characteristics such as resource requirements and dependencies However unlike these systems where the alternate to be executed is selected in advance in our dynamic continuous dataîow abstraction such decisions are made at periodic intervals based on the changing execution characteristics Time supports similar dynamic reconìguration called  which allows replacing a subgraph with another in response to the changing load This requires dependency tracking and introduces inefìciencies In contrast we restrict dynamic adaptation to single processing elements making the process of dynamic reconìguration independent for each PE and hence allow more exibility in dynamic adaptation while restricting the application composition model Our earlier work has discussed consistency models for enacting such runtime The predictive scheduling approach proposed in the paper follow the generic scheduler monitor comparator resolver approach proposed by Nof et Se v eral such predictive scheduling techniques have been studied on computation 12 ho we v er in the conte xt of batch task scheduling instead of continuous dataîows Further several performance prediction models for the Grid have been proposed to proìle workloads as well as infrastructure v Although we do not pro vide models for performance prediction in the Clouds we envision that similar performance models may be applicable is one such system which uses signature driven prediction for variations with periodic patterns and a discrete-time Markov chain based model for short-term predictions for VMs They achieve high prediction accuracy with less than 5 over-estimation error and close to zero under-prediction error We presume existence of such monitoring and prediction algorithm to be used as the basis for our look-ahead scheduling algorithm VIII C ONCLUSION In this paper we analyzed the temporal and spatial performance variations observed in public and private IaaS Clouds We proposed PLAStiCC a predictive look-ahead scheduling heuristic for dynamic adaptation of continuous dataîows that responds to uctuations in stream data rates as well as variations in Cloud VM performance Through simulations we showed that the proposed PLAStiCC heuristic results in a higher overall throughput up to 20 as compared to the reactive version of the scheduling heuristic we proposed earlier and improved here which performs adaptation actions after observing the effects of these variations on the application We also studied the effect of realistic prediction models with different error bounds and biases on the proposed heuristic and identiìed scenarios where the look-ahead algorithm falls short of the reactive one

    11   Figure 21 Tail functions for the spacecraft power consumption \(due to data availability only ADCS components and avionics board are considered in this plot\. The plot shows results for data statistic, two expert statistics \(proportional and bisection weights\ and two Bayesian statistics. The vertical dotted and dashed lines indicate t he estimates at PDR and CDR. It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
