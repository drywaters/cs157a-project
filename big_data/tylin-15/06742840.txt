Keynote Addresses  Opening & Keynote I Tuesday, January 21, 08:30 \226 10:00  223All Programmable SOC FPGA for Networking and Computing in Big Data Infrastructure\224  Dr. Ivo Bolsens Senior VP and CTO, Xilinx, U.S.A  Abstract  Today's FPGAs have become All Programmable SOC Platforms that integrate in one single  device multi-core CPU's programmable DSP functions programmable IO and programmable logic all immersed in a rich and configurable interconnect network  These programmable platform FPGA's allow for the implementation of heterogeneous multi-core architectures that combine traditional CPU's with application-specific processing cores and dedicated data transfer and storage functions This is enabled by tools that guide designers during the partitioning and mapping of highlevel specifications onto a combination of software running on embedded processors and hardware implemented in programmable logic FPGAs are well placed to continue to benefit from Moore's law.  Advances in process scaling will be augmented with new circuit and architectural improvements along with innovations in system-inpackage technology to solve IO challenges and integrate heterogeneous technologies These innovations will allow designers to build higher performance and lower power systems that optimally exploit the programmable FGPA architecture As FPGA platforms continue to deliver more performance at lower cost and lower power they are becoming the heart of embedded applications such as complex packet processing for networks with line rates of 400 Gbps high performance digital signal processing in novel wireless baseband and radio functions; and high flexibility to enable programmable networking and data storage functions in cloud infrastructure       


Keynote II Wednesday, January 22, 08:30 \226 09:30  223Designing Analog Functions without Analog Transistors\224  Prof. Georges Gielen Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium   Abstract  Analog functions are indispensable for most electronic applications ranging from telecom to biomedical or automotive applications Yet designing the analog circuits has become a large burden especially in advanced CMOS technologies where reduced voltage headrooms and increased variability and reliability problems challenge the design of power-efficient analog circuits. Together with the lack of adequate EDA tools this also jeopardizes efficient analog circuit design This keynote describes a possible way forward The industry clearly has reached a bifurcation point Many applications will leave the scaling race and adopt older or nonstandard e.g flexible organic technologies for the analog circuits offering the increased functionality essentially through heterogeneous integration Many other applications will stick to advanced CMOS, but will shift the analog design paradigm from analog-heavy to digital-heavy minimalistic-analog circuits. The presentation will discuss and illustrate the challenges and solutions in such approach to design analog functions without analog transistors  Keynote III Thursday, January 23, 08:30 \226 09:30  223Beyond Charge-Based Computing\224  Prof. Kaushik Roy Purdue Univ., U.S.A  Abstract The trend towards ultra low power logic and low leakage embedded memories for System-On-Chips has prompted researcher to consider the possibility of replacing charge as the state variable for computation Recent experiments on spin devices like magnetic tunnel junctions MTJ's domain wall magnets \(DWM\ and  spin valves  have led to the possibility of using "spin" as state variable for computation, achieving  very high density on-chip memories and ultra low voltage logic. High density of memories can be exploited to develop memory-centric reconfigurable computing fabrics that provide significant improvements in energy efficiency and reliability compared to conventional FPGAs While the possibility of having on-chip spin transfer torque memories is close to reality several questions still exist regarding the energy benefits of spin as the state variable for logic computation Latest experiments on lateral spin valves LSV have shown switching of nano-magnets using spinpolarized current injection through a metallic channel such as Cu Such lateral spin valves having multiple input magnets connected to an output magnet using metal channels can be used to mimic neurons". The spin-based neurons can be integrated with CMOS and other devices like Phase change memories to realize ultra low-power data processing hardware based on neural networks and are    


suitable for different classes of applications like cognitive computing programmable Boolean logic and analog and digital signal processing Note for some of these applications CMOS technologies may not be suitable for ultra low power implementation. In this talk I will first discuss the advantages of using spin \(as opposed to charge\ as state variable for both memory and logic and then present how a cellular array of magneto-metallic devices operating at terminal voltages 20mV can do efficient hybrid digital/analog computation for applications such as cognitive computing. Finally, I will consider recent advances in other non-charge based computing paradigm such as magnetic quantum cellular automata  Banquet Keynote Wednesday, January 22, 18:30 \226 21:30  223The Art of Innovation - How Singapore Will Continue to Drive the Progress in Semiconductor Technologies\224  Mr. Ulf Schneider Managing Director, Lantiq Asia Pacific/President, SSIA, Singapore  Abstract Since the mid 1960\222s Singapore has been an important pillar of the worldwide semiconductor industry, reinventing its portfolio, focus and strategy a few times to keep up with overall trends Preparing for the next decade Singapore\222s industry research and academia has to put up again the right directions and strategy to keep up with the pace in a more and more competitive global environment The talk will cover some of the really unique opportunities which Singapore has in this aspect

into a MySQL database Python is used to develop command interface for sensors as well as to implement R-DPH algorithm to compress sensor data The user interface and web development are done using PHP language while the Apache Web server engine is used to provide the necessary interfacing Wireless sensor nodes are programmed to send data at periodic intervals to the orchestrator WSN nodes from MAXFOR CM5000 are used to setup WSN Each node has temperature light and humidity sensors The orchestrator is connected to the cloud using Wi-Fi and using a sink node it connects with deployed sensor networks Sensors are categorized as sink node base station access points supports multi-hop routing and end points sensing or actuation device Nodes are identical and are compatible of IEEE 802.15.4 Micro-controllers CC2420 RF Chip radio and sensors are mounted on MAXFOR CM5000 and they are programmed using TinyOS In our development we use hierarchical gradient based routing described in to form a mesh netw ork among the sensor nodes In the gradient based routing the backbone network is initially formed by using controlled ooding The base station initiates the network formation by broadcasting a packet in which it sets the gradient height to 1 Nodes that receive the gradient packet set their gradient to the received value and rebroadcast the packet by increasing the gradient value by one This constructs a network organized into layers where the higher gradient nodes report to the lower gradient ones For a given temperature and a humidity taken over a period of time t  we identify series of points with t h in a series of equally distanced in time scale utilizing R-DPH a tolerance of error  is deìned compression will implement the point reduction using the given error distance Table 1 shows compression result of 1440 sample points per day once every one minute and it clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach The ability to compress remains relevant to the diversity of the points how far they are apart and the given error margin   In a real scenario such as a green house where temperature spikes are not expected the algorithm could be extremely effective In the experiment we inferred that interrelated points like temperature and humidity can be correlated to the amount of energy needed to cool down a room for an acceptable human comfort level For example a low temperature triggers a reduction in the ability of the air to hold moisture In addition the information extracted from their combination can provide easier combinations with other relevant data sets like power consumption temperature feedback by air conditioning units By adding multiple measurements we can process the compression as a 3D entity IV C ONCLUSION Embedded sensor networks can produce signiìcant amount of data Accumulated data should be either transmitted or aggregated and sent to a remote cloud server Since wireless sensors have a limited storage capacity they need to either dispose of old data or stop producing new ones until old data is ofîoaded Our study shows aggregating data from several sensors can produce gigabytes of data in a week Obviously an orchestrator with enough storage capacity can handle the required space for a small sensor network setup for a short period of time However we will need a larger data management and storage capacity for large scale deployments To address this problem we experimented with a streaming compression algorithm extending Ramer-Douglas-Peucker heuristic and we achieved as high as 99.86 compression of sensor data In future a multi-orchestration will be designed to handle multicast and unicast data reception and parallel data warehousing for higher availability and disaster recover

The final size of the disk image of this virtual machine is 3GB, and it requires to allocate at least 30 GB of RAM for executing a proper processing. The number of cores can be defined dynamically, according to the available resources and tolerable processing time. During the computations, the total disk consumption, managed by OpenStack, was up 300 GB In our experiment we emulated a doctor interaction with the ARES system as follows  Assume a doctor needs to investigate the expression of a gene related to, e.g., a cancer, and he selects the DE analysis for this purpose An optimization function determines the processing location among the available PoPs The implemented CDN service provides the needed genomic data sets, including the patientês genome, the size of which is a 3.2 GB, together with the VM necessary to perform the relevant processing The DE analysis is done and the results is sent to the requesting medical personnel  The functional experiments have been executed over the network shown in Figure 4. These experiments are quite simple and aim to verify the correct functional implementation of the ARES components and obtain an evidence that the dynamic caching mechanism works and is effective. The genomic data are initially stored onto a single server, and caches are dynamically populated with them over time. Three clients ask for the same service The overall time needed for the execution of the software pipeline is variable according to the number of biological samples analyzed. It approximately ranges in the interval between 1 and 2 days. These outcomes of experimental processing time are used to determine the remaining time available for data and VM transfer and to define the CDN service classes. In this regards we have defined the approach illustrated in Figure 6, used in ongoing experiments, that follows a metrological approach for validating the proposed proce   3 3  In particular, the outcome of measuring the client-side success of the procedure is the achievement of results within the pre-established timeframe compliant with the CDN service deployed   Figure 4 Ö Topology of the networ k used for experiments    Figure 5 Ö Differential expression pipeline  Each measured service time, is estimated under many different conditions. In particul ar, we evaluate both the worst case approach, when the CDN service is required for the first time and caches are not populated with the needed data, and also the estimate of the expected value of the service time versus the number of requests submitted to the system in a month. In this case, estimates are obtained by averaging outcomes of the experiments an d have been characterized by calculating the corresponding uncertain ty in terms of type A

uncertainty, i.e. standard deviation of each estim h e  validation of the test of the ne twork consists in verifying that obtained estimates respect the given service time with a target reliability at least equal to 99%, i.e. that each service time estimate is lower than the target service time with a probability value at least equal to 0 99. Thus, the possibility of implementing different cloud service classes can therefore be demonstrated    Figure 6 ÖMethodology used for evaluating service time performance  The project ARES is still in pr ogress. Similar metrological approaches, based on the GUM \(Guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement\fications, will be implemented through multiple experiments, used to collect also network-side me  the set of CDN services are accessible regardless the user locations, to be verified experimentally. Success = successful verification for all locations the NSIS signaling provides transparency to any change of the repository locations Success=transparency verified for all PoPs according to the CAP theorem, a distributed information system cannot gu arantee consistency, availability and partition-tolerance at the sam e time. The achievable availability for all CDN classes will be investigated in relation to the tolerable service time and the metrics illustrated below or CDN service are robust to PoP and rout er failures. We will show how the system can manage and overcome node failures. In particular the client programs will operate correctly after a server or repository failure. Repeated failures will be emulated so as to investigate and maximize the actual robustness. This metric is strictly related to access transparency the cache instantiation and update procedures will guarantee metadata cons istency. This metric is strictly related to location transparency. Repeated experiments, also in the presence of node failu res, will be executed. Any experiment will be considered successful if all caches are synchronized with the relevant metadata CDN services will allow increasing the tolerable network load and also scale gracefully to huge ones Scalability will be analyzed and op timized in relation to the suitable trade-off induced by the CAP theorem VII C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper we have illu strated the current cloud services defined and implemented by the project ARES. These services aims to offer medical and re search personnel suitable ICT tools in a networked enviro nment for handling genome data set. Services, organized in different classes according to the time requirements of the situation handled, are accessible though a cloud interface. The cloud environment is implemented by using OpenStack. In add ition to verifying the correct execution of all the virtualized software components we have presented a case study relevant to the execution of a genomic pipeline widely used for diagnostic purposes This work is co-funded by EU u nder the project ARES supported by G…ANT/GN3plus in the framework of the first G…ANT open call 1
