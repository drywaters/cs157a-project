 Energy Efficient In-Memory Machine Learning for Data Intensive Image-Processing by Non-volatile Domain-Wall Memory Abstract - Image processing in conventional logic-memory I/O-integrated systems will incur significant communication congestion at memory I/Os for excessive big image data at exa-scale. This paper explores an in-memory machine learning on neural network architecture by utilizing the newly introduced domain-wall nanowire, called DW-NN. We show that all operations involved in machine learning on neural network can be mapped to a logic-in-memory architecture by non-volatile domain-wall nanowire.  Domain-wall nanowire based logic is customized for in machine learning within image data storage. As such, both neural network training and processing can be performed locally within the me mory. The experimental results show that system throughput in DW-NN is improved by 11.6x and the energy efficiency is improved by 92x when compared to conventional image processing system I Introduction  One exciting feature of future bi g-data storage system is to find implicit pattern of data and excavate valued behavior behind by big-data analytics such as image feature extraction during image search. Instead of performing the image search by calculating pixel similarity, image search by machine learning is a similar process as human brains. For example each image feature extraction is performed to obtain the characteristics first, and then is matched by key words. As such, the image search becomes a traditional string matching problem to solve  However, to handle big image data at exa-scale, there is memory-wall that has long memory access latency as well as limited memory bandwidth. For the example of the image search in one big-data storage system, there may be billions of images. In order to perform feature extraction for one of images, it will lead to significant congestion at I/Os when migrating data between memory and processor. Note that in-memory computing system  ising as one  future big-data solution to relieve the memory-wall issue. For example, domain specific accelerators can be developed within memory for big-data processing such that the data will be pre-processed before they are readout with the minimum number of data migrations In this paper, the big image data processing algorithm by machine learning is examined within the in-memory computing system architecture. Among numerous machine learning algorithms neural-network based algorithm has shown low complexity with genetic adaptability. In particular, the extreme learning machine \(ELM one  input layer, one hidden layer an d one output layer, and hence it has tuning-free feature without expensive iterative training process, which makes it suitable for the low-cost hardware implementation. As such the in-memory hardware accelerators of ELM is studied here for the big image data processing The proposed in-memory ELM computing system is examined by the nano-scale non-volatile memory devices 9,10,1  Dom a in-wall nanowire or racetrack m e m o ry  one newly int roduc ed spintronic NVM device that has not only potential for high density and high performance memory storage, but also fe asible in-memory computing capability. In this paper, we show the feasibility of mapping the ELM to a full domain-wall nanowire based in-memory neural network computing system, called DW-NN. Compared to the scenario that ELM is executed in CMOS based general purpose processor, the proposed DW-NN improves the system throughput by 11.6x and energy efficiency by 92x The rest of paper is organized as following. Section II reviews the fundamental of domain-wall memory and domain-wall memory based in-memory computing architecture. Section III demonstrates algorithm and implementation of in-memory machine learning by domain-wall nanowire devices. The experiments are carried out in Section IV with conclusions in Section V  II. In-memory Architecture on Domain-wall Devices A  Domain-wall Nanowire Devices Domain-wall nanowire, also known as racetrack memory  h e third-generati on of spin-based NVM. As shown in Fig. 1, multiple bits of information are stored in a single ferromagnetic nanowire. Separ ated by domain-walls, each bit is represented by the magnetization direction. The domain-walls can be moved left or right by applying a current through the shift port at the two ends of the nanowire. The domain width of each bit remain s unchanged, thus the stored information is preserved. All bits are shifted with a tape-like operation similarly as in a shift register In a domain-wall nanowire de vice, a strongly magnetized ferromagnetic layer is plac ed along the ferromagnetic nanowire at a desired position and separated by an insulator Hao Yu 1 Yuhao Wang 1 Shuai Chen 1 Wei Fei 1 Chuliang Weng 2 Junfeng Zhao 2 and Zhulin Wei 2   1 School of Electrical and Electron ic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 2 Huawei Shannon Laboratory, China Correspondent author: haoyu@ntu.edu.sg Tel: +65-67904509, Fax: +65-6793 3318  Fig. 1.

layer. Such a sandwichlike structure forms a magnetic-tunnel-junction \(MTJ\he stored information can be accessed The formed MTJ exhibits different states depending on the alignment of the fixed layer and free layer. This is called the giant magnetoresistance \(GMR\fect. MTJ shows different resistance with parallel or anti-parallel alignments. By detecting the resistance of MTJ, the stored bit can be read out Moreover, write operation is achieved by altering the free layer magnetization with an inj ected current. The electron spin will force the free layer to be para llel or anti-parallel to fixed layer based on the current dir ection [1 the write and read operation can only occur in the MTJ. Therefore, the bit to be operated needs to be shifted and aligned with the fixed layer, while the shift direction a nd velocity is controlled by the current direction and amplitude [1 B  Domain-wall Memory based In-Memory Computing Conventionally, all the data is maintained within memory that is separated from the processor but connected with I/Os Therefore, during the execution, all data needs to be migrated to processor and written back afterwards. In the data-oriented applications, however, this will incur significant I/O congestions and hence greatly degrade the overall performance. In addition, significant standby power will be consumed in order to hold the large volume of data  To overcome the above two issues, the in-memory non-volatile computing architecture is introduced. The overall architecture of domain-wall memory based in-memory computing platform is illustrated in Fig. 2\(a domain specific in-memory accelerators are integrated locally together with the stored data in distributed manner such that frequent involved operations can be performed without much communication with external processor. In addition, the distributed local accelerators can also provide great thread-level parallelism thus the throughput can be improved Fig. 2\(b\hows how the in-memory distributed Map-Re g  is perform ed locally  between one data array and local logic pair. Firstly, the external processor will issue commands to specific pair to perform in-memory logic computing. The commands will be received and interpreted by a controller in accelerator Secondly, the controller will re quest related data to the data array with a read operation. As a result, the neural network based processing in ELM, mainly including weighted sum and sigmoid function, can be performed in a Map-Reduce fashion Lastly, the results are written back to the data array In this platform, the domain-wall nanowire is intensively utilized towards ultra-low power big-data processing in both memory and logic, with sign ificantly reduced leakage and operating power. What is more domain-wall nanowire based adder, multiplier and look-up table for sigmoid function are adopted within non-volatile memory that further improves energy efficiency with small I/O overheads  III. Domain-wall Nanowire based Extreme Learning Machine  In-memory ELM neural n etwork offers two major advantages. Firstly, all do main-wall based arithmetic operations in ELM can be integrated into the memory, and these operations are performed di rectly on operands stored in non-volatile domain-wall memory. That is significantly different from the conventional memory-logic architecture where data need to be transferred from the memory to data path and then written back to the memory after being processed. Secondly, all the computing-intensive operations in ELM are implemented by domain-wall nanowire devices which can also be used as storage units. This provides integration compatibility betwee n data path and memory used in ELM, as well as the ability to reuse peripheral circuits like decoders and sense amplifiers A  Extreme Learning Machine We first review the basic of the neural-network based ELM algorithm. Among numerous machine learning algorithm [3  upport vector m achine \(S VM\ and neural network \(NN are widely discussed. However, both two algorithms have major challenging issues in terms of slow learning speed  a  b Fig 2. \(a\ The overview of the in-memory computing a rchitecture b\ domain wall nanowire based machine learning platform in Map Reduce fashion      Data/address/command IO External processor Data array In-memory logic Local data path for in-memory logic memory Local data/logic pair   0x00 0x10 M N   stored Data segment Step 3: multiplication Map process DWMUL Step 2: fetch data 0.5,0.2,0.6][2 1,3 0.8,0,0.3 2,1,3 0.7,0.1,-0.4 2,1,3 Step 1: tasks issued by external processor 1, 1 key, value 1, 0.2 1, 1.8 controllers Dispatch atom task 2, -1.6 2,0 2, 0.9 3, 0.1 3, -1.2 3, -1.4 DWADDER Dispatch atom task 1,3 2, -0.7 3, -2.5 Step 4: sum Reduce process 0.95 0.33 0.08 Step 6 Write back result DWMUL DWMUL DWADDER DWADDER DWLUT DWLUT DWLUT Step 5: Sigmoid function Domain wall data array Domain wall nanowire based In-memory logic 0.5 0.2 0.6 2 0.8 0 0.3 1 0.7 0.1 0.4 3      192 3S-2 


trivial human intervene \(parameter tuning\ poor computational scalability  Extreme Learning Machine \(ELM nitially proposed  for t h e si ngle-hidden-layer feed-forward neural networks SLFNs\pared with traditional neural networks, ELM eliminates the need of parameter tuning in the training stage and hence reduces the training time significantly. The output function of ELM is formulated as \(only one output node is considered    1  where  is the output weight vector storing the output weights between the hidden layer and output node   is the hidden layer output matrix give n input vector X and performs the transformation of input vector into L-dimensional feature space. The training process of ELM aims to obtain output weight vector and to enhance the generalization ELM minimizes the training error as well as the norm of output weight  Minimize: ||H T|| and  2  where T is the target vector in the training process and can be solved by minimal norm least square method as follows    3  where  is the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of matrix H  The application of ELM for im age processing in this paper is an ELM based image super-re solution \(SR which learns the image features of a specific category of images and improves low-re solution figures by applying learned knowledge. Note that ELM SR is commonly used as pre-processing stage to improve image quality before applying other image algorithms. It involves intensive matrix operation such as matrix addition, matrix multiplication as well as exponentiation on each element of a matrix. Fig. 3 illustrates the computation flow for ELM SR, where input vector obtained from input image is multiplied by input weight matrix. The result is then added with bias vector b to generate input of sigmoid function. Lastly sigmoid function outputs are multiplied with output weight matrix to produce final results In the following, we will demonstrate how to map the fundamental addition, multiplica tion, and sigmoid function to domain-wall nanowires B  Weighted Sum by Domain-wall Adder and Multiplier The GMR-effect can be interpreted as the bit-wise XOR operation of the magnetization direction of two thin magnetic layers, where the output is de noted by high or low resistance In a GMR-based MTJ structure, however, the XOR-logic will fail as there is only one operand as variable since the magnetization in fixed layer is constant. Nevertheless, this problem can be overcome by the unique domain-wall shift-operation in the domain-w all nanowire device, which enables the possibility of DWL-based XOR logic for computing A bitwise-XOR logic implemented by two domain-wall nanowires is shown in Fig. 4. The bitwise-XOR logic is performed by constructing a ne w read-only-port, where two free layers and one insulator layer are stacked. The two free layers are in the size of one magnetization domain and are from two respective nanowires. Thus, the two operands denoted as the magnetization di rection in free layer, can both be variables with values assigned through the MTJ of the according nanowire. As such, it ca n be shifted to the operating port such that the XOR-logic is performed For example, the A xor B can be executed in the following steps  Fig. 3.

 The operands A and B are loaded into two nanowires by enabling WL1 and WL2 respectively  A and B are shifted from their access-ports to the read-only ports  by enabling SHF1 and SHF2 respectively  By enabling RD, the bit-wise XOR result can be obtained through the GMR-effect By deploying two DW-XOR lo gic units, the SUM operation of full adder can be achieved in by domain-wall nanowire devices with low power consumption  In addition, to realize a full adder, the CARRY operation is also needed. Spintronics based CARRY operation is proposed  a pre-char ge s e nsing am plifier \(PCS A for resistance comparison. The CARRY logic by PCSA and two branches of domain-wall nanowires is shown in Fig. 4 The three operands for CARRY operation are denoted by resistance of MTJ \(low for 0 and high for 1\, and belong to respective domain-wall nanowires in the left branch. The right branch is made complementary to the left one. Note that the and  will be pre-charged high at first when PCSA EN signal is low. When the circuit is enabled, the branch with lower resistance will discharge it s output to "0". For example when left branch has no or only one MTJ in high resistance i.e. no carry out, the right branch will have three or two MTJs in high resistance, such that the will be 0. The complete truth table will confirm CARRY logic by this circuit. The domain-wall nanowire works as the writing circuit for the operands by writing values at one end and shift it to PCSA Note that with the full adder implemented by domain-wall nanowires and intrinsic shift ab ility of domain-wall nanowire a shift/add multiplier can be readily achieved purely by domain-wall nanowires C  Sigmoid Function by Domain-Wall Lookup Table Sigmoid function includes exponentiation, division, and addition, which is a computing-intensive operation in ELM application. In particular, the exponentiation will take many cycles to execute in the conven tional processor due to the lack of corresponding accelerator. Therefore, it is extremely economic to perform exponentiation by look-up table Look-up table \(LUT\ntially a pre-configured memory array, takes a binary address as input, finds target cells that contain result through decoders, and finally outputs correspondingly by sense amplifiers A domain-wall nanowire based LUT \(DW-LUT illustrated in Fig. 5\(a\o mpared with the conventional SRAM or DRAM by CMOS, the DW-LUT can demonstrate two major advantages. Firstly, extremely high integration density can be achieved since multiple bits can be packed in one nanowire.

retain the stored data. By distributing the multiple bits of results in separated nanowire s, the serial operation of nanowire can be avoided and the function can be done fast Note that the LUT size is de termined by the input domain the output range, and the required precision for the floating point numbers. Fig. 5\(b\deal logistic curve and approximated curves by LUTs. It can be observed that the output range is bounded between 0 and 1, and although the input domain is infinite, it is only informative in the center around 0. The LUT visually is th e digitalized logistic curve and the granularity, i.e. precision, depends on the LUT size For machine learning applicatio n, the precision is not as sensitive as scientific computations. As a result, the LUT size for sigmoid function can be great ly optimized and leads to high energy efficiency for sigmoid function execution  IV. Experiment Results A  Domain-Wall Logic Performance To evaluate domain-wall nanowire based in-memory ELM computing system, the following design platform has been set up. Firstly at device level, the transient simulation of MTJ read and write operations is performed within NVM-SPICE  acc urate operation e n er gy a nd tim ing  for domain-wall nanowire. The shift-operation energy is modeled as the Joule heat dissipated on the nanowire when shift-current is applied. Th e shift-current density and shift-velocity relationship are based on r ea of one  domain-wall nanowire is calculated by its dimension parameters. Specifically, the technology node of 32nm is assumed with width of 32nm, length of 64nm per domain, and thickness of 2.2nm for one domain-wall nanowire; the R off  is set at 2600 the R on  at 1000 the writing current at 100 A  and the current density at 6  10 8 A/cm 2 for shift-operation Secondly at circuit level, the memory modeling tool CACTI  o difi ed with nam e as DW C AC TI. It can provide accurate power and area information for domain-wall nanowire memory peripheral ci rcuits such as decoders and sense amplifiers \(SAs\ogether with the device level performance data, the DW-ADDER as well as the DW-LUT can be evaluated at circuit level Table I shows the energy cost and speed of basic domain-wall nanowire operations as well as logic circuits Different from CMOS based logic, domain-wall nanowire based logic circuits need multip le cycles to operate, and thus the latency is expected to be much longer than its CMOS counterpart. However, computation throughput outweighs latency in the context of big-data applications where the data parallelism is high; benefited from the leakage free and high density property, more domain-wall logic resources are able to be allocated to significantly increase the system performance B  In-memory Throughput and Energy Efficiency To compare proposed in-memory DW-NN platform and conventional general purpose pro cessor \(GPP ELM based super resolution ELM-SR\ application is executed as the workload. The evaluation of ELM-SR in GPP platform is based on gem5 [2  a nd Mc P A T 24] for c o re  power and area model. DW-NN is evaluated in our developed self-consistent simulation pl atform based on NVMSPICE DW-CACTI, and DW-NN behavioral simulator. The processor runs at 3GHz while the accele rators run at 500MHz. System memory capacity is set as 1GB, and bus width is set as 128 bits. Based on 3.7nJ a nd 6.3nJ  per a c cess are use d for on-chip and off-chip I/O overhead respectively   Table II compares ELM-SR in both DW-NN and GPP platforms. Due to the deployme nt of in-memory accelerators and high data parallelism, the throughput of DW-NN improves by 11.6x compared to GPP platform In terms of area used by computational resources, DW-NN is 2.7% higher than that of GPP platform. Additional 0.5 mm 2 is used to deploy the domain-wall nanowire based accele rators. Thanks to the high integration density of domain-wall nanowires, the numerous accelerators are brought with only slight area overhead. In DW-NN, the additional power consumed by accelerators is compensated by the saved dynamic power of processor, since the computation is mostly performed by the in-memory logic Overall, DW-NN achieves a pow er reduction of 19%. The most noticeable advantage of DW-NN is its much higher energy efficiency compared to GP P. Specifically, it is 56x and 92x better than that of GPP with on-chip and off-chip memory respectively. The advantage comes from three aspects: \(a   a\               \(b\               \(c Fig 6. \(a\ Original image before ELMSR algorithm \(SSIM value is 0.91 b\ Image quality improved after ELM-SR algorithm by DW NN hardware implementation \(SSIM value is 0.94 c\ Image quality improved by GPP platform \(SSIM value is 0.97   195 3S-2

To measure the performance quantitatively, structural similarity \(SSIM  m easure im age quality after ELM-SR algorithm It can be observed that the im ages after ELM-SR algorithm in both platforms have higher image quality than the original low-resolution image. However due to the use of LUT, which trades off precision against the hardware complexity, the image quality in DW-NN is slightly lower than that in GPP Specifically, the SSIM is 0.94 f or DW-NN, 3% lower than 0.97 for GPP V. Conclusion  With the use of the newly introduced domain-wall nanowire this paper explores an in-memory architecture of machine learning on neural network called DW-NN. In the proposed DW-NN, domain-wall nanowire based logic customized for machine learning is integrated within the image storage data such that machine-learning based image processing can be performed locally within the memory. We show that all operations involved in machin e learning on neural network can be mapped to a logicin-memory architecture by non-volatile domain-wall nanowir e. The experimental results show that the I/O load in the proposed DW-NN is greatly alleviated with an energy effi ciency improvement by 92x and throughput improvement by 11.6x compared to the conventional image processing system by general purpose processor Acknowledgments  This work is sponsored by Singapore MOE TIER-2 fund MOE2010-T2-2-037 \(ARC 5 11\nd NRF-CRP fund NRFCRP9-2011-01 References   S.

It can be noticed that in this case the statistics \(especially Bayesian\ fail in recognizing the underestimation at PDR  Differently from the other cases the risk analysis for the total power consumption shows some problems Specifically the statistics do not seem to identify the underestimation of the initial PDR estimate  The cause of this issue depends mostly on the estimates of the power consumption for the ADCS components, since the estimates of the power consumption for the avionics board seem to be more accurate Future work will focus on improving estimates for the ADCS components maybe developing a specific expert elicitation interview with control experts only  The last results of this paper were computed performing the analysis of variance The analysis considers how the variance of each factor component or subsystem affects the total variance The objective of this analysis is to identify the main drivers for mass and power fluctuations To compute the analysis [4   th e h y p o t h esi s  o f  i n d ep en d en c e between the distributions of the single components is assumed Hence the variance of fluctuations for mass and power is the sum of the single variances   4  5  The variance proportions coefficients are defined as the ratio of the variance of each component to the total variance They are computed as  6  7  The coefficients for mass fluctuations are shown in Figure 22  The coefficients for power fluctuations are shown in Figure 23     Figure 22 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft mass estimates. According to all the statistics, the components of the control system together with the avionics board seem to be the components that show the biggest variance in their estimation  


    12   Figure 23 Analysis of variance for the spacecraft power consumption estimates. The statistics offer different results on which component seems to be the principle driver for the variance of the power consumption estimate  Analysis of variance shows that all the statistics identify ADCS and avionics board components as the major drivers for the variance in the estimation of the total mass Regarding the power consumption, the analysis of variance presents conflicting results according to experts and Bayesian statistics the ADCS subsystem is the main driver of the variance, while according to data statistic the avionics board is the main driver This difference can also be correlated with the issues observed in the total powe r consumption probability density function Figure 20 and 21 Future work will focus on a more detailed analysis of the control system for the spacecraft A final comment is related to the weighting of the distributions In this analysis two weighting schemes have been used the proportional scheme and the bisection scheme While in previous works focused on communication system design only  1   5    3    4   the bisection rule achieved substantially better results in the case of this paper the two methods provide very similar outcomes and they both give reasonable estimates However since this is the first case in which the methodology has been applied by the authors to the entire spacecraft design, it is too early to claim that in all the cases the two schemes will perform in the same way More test cases need to be analyzed and additional interviews with experts need to be performed  Conclusions and suggestions for future work are presented in the next section  4  C ONCLUSIONS  This paper presents the first attempt to extend the probabilistic approach to design risk to the entire spacecraft design This approach has been developed initially by the authors primarily for the design of the communication subsystem. In this paper, the authors extend the approach to the different subsystems and focus their effort on small spacecraft which are becoming increasingly more developed in academia space agencies and industries The methodology is extended to the entire spacecraft the database now includes data on several spacecraft components and the expert elicitation interview includes questions on the different subsystems. A university satellite mission \(CASTOR\ developed at MIT is used as a test case Results show that the methodology is effective in analyzing each component and in identifying whether the initial estimate of mass and power consumption made at PDR was an overestimation or an underestimation Specifically the tail functions provide useful insights which can be applied by the engineers while designing the spacecraft. The system results are obtained by convolution of the results obtained for the single components and they show that the model is able to clearly identify underestimation for the spacecraft mass while it does not perform as well for the power consumption. Similar results are obtained in the analysis of variance proportions Future work will be dedicated to analyzing the issue on the power consumption estimate as well as in developing specific statistic al  approaches to include newly developed payloads for which no previous data are available or for which expertise in the field is somehow limited Finally future work will also focus on extending the model to the design of larger spacecraft than small satellites and to the design of satellite constellations  5 ACKNOWLEDGMENT  Part of this work was performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Part of this work was carried out at the Space System Laboratory Massachusetts Institute of Technology 6 APPENDIX  A breakdown of mass and power consumption data for each of the components at PDR and CDR is shown in the following table Table 2: Values of mass and power consumption at PDR and CDR for each of the components analyzed Component  Mass PDR Kg  Mass CDR Kg  Power PDR W  Power CDR W  Solar Panel  3.34  5.066  0  0
