Big Data applications in science are producing huge amounts of data which require advanced processing handling and analysis capabilities For the organization of large scale data sets it is essential to annotate these with metadata index them and make them easily ndable In this paper we investigate two scientiìc use cases from biology and photon

phases of the data life cycle and allow for the efìcient search of data elements The volume and data acquisition rates in these highly complex scenarios are drastically increasing by orders of magnitudes and the data even in an individual eld of study becomes much more diverse Challenges in metadata management are manifold Currently many scientiìc communities do not deal with metadata at all but the growing amount of les lets them realize the need In order to integrate increasing amounts data well with the working environments of scientists systems and standards have to be conceptually developed and tightly integrated It is of paramount importance to automate as 
many steps as possible the individual annotation of millions of data sets by hand is impossible Since many metadata standards there e xist already  designing and implementing new formats and systems should be avoided wherever possible It is often preferential to store metadata alongside or inside the data since the link to the data is always maintained which makes sharing archiving and re-using much easier The major challenge to create meaningful metadata is addressed in the context of the project LSDMA Large Scale Data Management and Analysis by the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centers More than ten key 
players Helmholtz centers and universities working on Big Data challenges are participating It aims to optimize the process of gaining scientiìc knowledge in close cooperation with applied scientists by improving data life cycle management methods On one hand Data Life Cycle Lab DLCL conduct research which is speciìc to the involved communities like climate research or engineering Five DLCLs with more than 25 communities are participating On the other hand the Data Services Integration Team aims at generic solutions and services across DLCLs We present the evaluation for two use cases One is light microscopy within life sciences with the Open Microscopy

microscopy data OMERO a tool based on a client-serv er model for data management visualization and standardized analysis implements the standard In the following we describe the eld of light microscopy and present main aspects of the compliant le speciìcation related to metadata for large data sets and the OMEXML format Then we e v aluate OME in detail and in comparison to DICOM Highly resolution uorescent microscopes such as localization nanoscopes are novel instruments providing unmatched insights into molecular arrangements and nanostructures of cells and cell nuclei The advantage of localization nanoscopy comes from the combination of visibility using standard preparation techniques and sophisticated computer image analysis with standard high quality optics and fast detectors This offers new perspectives in biomedical research resulting in novel aspects of diagnostics based on large scale data sets For localization nanoscopy biomolecules are speciìcally tagged by uorescent markers By image processing the spatial positions of all individually tagged events can be determined with nanometer precision resulting in a merged image of thousands of points see Figure 1 From such point patterns characteristic nanostructures can be calculated Within the LSDMA activities two elds of biomedical research are addressed a Understanding mechanisms in the arrangement and clustering of highly expressed receptor molecules in cellular membranes of tumor cells and the inîuence of chemotherapy drugs b Understanding nanoscaled chromatin arrangements in cell nuclei during tumor genesis and after radiotherapy Figure 1 shows a membrane of a breast cancer cell after labelling On the left an overlay of a standard wide-ìeld image green and the result of localization imaging red of a membrane section is shown where the human epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 a typical breast cancer marker is labelled The right image only shows the result of localization imaging which was obtained from a time series of 1000 images Here each uorescent point represents a single uorochrome or antibody attached to a receptor molecule In contrast to the wide-ìeld image the resulting localization image reveals details of the formation of receptor clusters or linear arrangements of receptors OME was designed to use the XML format for storing metadata related to a microscope image and the environment it was captured in XML can be modiìed directly by XML methods or on a text-editor basis Furthermore XML can be mapped to relational databases or directly stored in XML databases These offer the option to realize complex queries Figure 1 Images of the membrane of breast cancer cell after speciìc labelling of the Her2-receptors by means of uorescence labelled antibodies and therefore a high degree of automation The database structure of OME is visualized in Figure 2 Figure 2 Database structure of OME XML Input consists of raw data and metadata stored in XML related to image experiment and result The basic idea of most metadata deìnitions in microscopic imaging applications is threefold The rst class of elds includes a unique description including a unique identiìer of the imaging setup like image descriptors definition of the microscope hardware used and parameters used during acquisition The next metadata set describes the experiment and the name of the experimenter A third class of elds allows for the deìnition of free comments which may represent valuable information not tting in the given scheme This class however is non-standardized and therefore limits the portability Another speciìc property of the OME format is that each step of the data processing and visualization pipeline can be represented It supports multiple image stacks at various processing stages The dimensions are currently limited to 5D i.e three spatial dimensions are represented by multiple 2D images one time dimension and one application dependent parameter space OMERO based on OME is a client-serv er model intended to enable data handling metadata editing and data visualization Its three components are a client a server and a database The server is a middleware to interprete OME-XML schemas and to convert them to interact with both database and client As client OMERO provides a web browser interface and a standalone Java application

C Evaluation of OME in Comparison with DICOM A Photon Science B The ICAT Metadata Model and Catalogue 
In LSDMA we apply OME for handling localization nanoscopy with medical applications where microscope data is used for diagnosis purposes in pathology With respect to these application areas OME competes with the DICOM  standard which is widespread in radiological imaging Hence it is of interest to compare both standards in context of Big Data DICOM shares some similarities to OME First of all it also uses unique identiìers Instead of XML data is written in a binary tagged format with an address description and entry Tagged elds are not human readable and are only usable in applications with format conversions With a stricter deìnition and the possibility to map a production workîow into the format DICOM is oriented towards routine work in clinics OME on the other hand is more suited to research applications with its greater exibility A second issue in OME is the data format which is based on stacked 2D data like in DICOM Stacked data has the advantage that it does not require contiguous memory for access Especially methods for analysis and visualization that access 3D 4D or 5D information require a scattered read of the memory which renders processing of huge chunks of data inefìcient The limitation to 5D data concerns both OME and DICOM A signiìcant advantage for DICOM is the option to attach intermediate data from the workîow process into the overall structure This allows keeping data together which is required in well-deìned productive environments Concerning workîows support for diverse applications and networking is native in DICOM with the a client-server models for communication and high quality printing services and available in OME via additional tools like OMERA In conclusion OME is a rst and necessary step towards uniform handling of metadata for microscope data sets It is based on a modern concept like XML and its open source strategy allows vendors and research groups to freely extend and generalize it DICOM in contrast enforces more strict deìnitions and the standardization of usage patterns regardless the underlying hardware and operating system OME has not been designed for huge data sets while highresolution microscopy like localization nanoscopy produces huge data sets This shortcoming of OME marks a challenge for substantial further developments III P HOTON S CIENCE U SE C ASE AND THE ICAT M ETADATA C ATALOGUE With many synchrotron facilities switching from particle physics to photon science the organizational characteristics data rates and data amounts of the new experimental setups differ greatly from the large collaborations in particle physics In order to adapt to these changes computing facilities need to re-think their established data management concepts We describe photon science as a scientiìc eld ICAT as a solution and evaluate the latter The term photon science encompasses facilities that use high-energy light sources often X-ray lasers powered by particle accelerators to investigate small-scale details of matter and organisms These facilities generally have a similar experimental setup and data workîow and members of the PaNdata project agree that their current challenges in the eld of data handling are quite similar PaNdata aims to deploy and test a common data infrastructure for 14 European institutes The aim is to provide users with common software and a federation of their data catalogues which enables users with appropriate access rights to search and download data located at any facility Typically experimental stations in photon science labs are built close to detectors Such setups are called beamlines Detectors used may either generate images or raw numeric data Data rates may differ greatly between detector types Modern detectors can generate image streams in the order of 10 GByte/s and up to 100 images per second Beamtime the time granted for each experiment at a beamline is generally very tight as the facilities are in high demand So to easily to data management scientists stored data directly on portable media With the new high rate detectors this is getting less and less feasible Hence the photon science community is in need for an integrated data management that will move data directly from detectors to large and robust backend storage systems Access needs to be possible via network le systems and interactive download facilities An integration of such data storage systems with analysis facilities is also highly desired The ideal situation would be that scientists start by immediately setting up their experiment and starting to use the beam The data would be automatically copied to the storage systems annotated with metadata and stored in a catalogue system Later the scientist would use the catalogue to retrieve their data for further analysis This would allow the scientist to fully concentrate on their science and not data management ICATês metadata model closely follo ws the real-life situation at most photon science laboratories After the principal investigator submits a proposal which if accepted grantes beamline time Studies consist of one or more experiments An experiment is carried out at an instrument which is part of a facility and produces datasets To account for the real-world behavior of photon science detectors datasets consist of one or more data les Finally the collected data is aggregated and published This bottom-up data model is augmented by auxiliary information that allows for the parameterization of the experiments instruments and description of the samples Also user information and access

rights are stored Although this schema very closely models reality there is inîexibility that might lead to problems during adoption For example there is the requirement in the PaNdata cooperation for assigning more than one instrument to an experiment Also it needs to be understood how to map complex access rules to the internal ICAT rule engine The ICAT metadata catalogue is the core component in an open source suite of tools developed by several institutes These tools are intended to provide photon science communities with an integrated data handling system for downloading data les metadata handling and querying as well as provenance tracking and analysis support ICAT is the most advanced of these components and is considered to be production-ready by the developers It is the catalogue of choice for the PaNdata project Figure 3 ICAT follows the standard J2EE architecture Catalogue GUI and data server run as applications on the same Glassìsh instance The database is connected via JDBC and interfaces with the outside via WSDL The catalogue system itself follows the standard J2EE architecture Figure 3 and relies on a underlying Java EE application server The reference conìguration includes the Glassìsh application server It connects to either Oracle or MySQL databases and offers a web service interface to interact with other system components like the download manager the TopCat web GUI or custom ingestion modules A plugin interface system accepts custom authentication modules ICAT ships with authenticators for LDAP a local database or anonymous accounts which are useful for openaccess systems By offering a standard interface to the catalogue ICAT is completely agnostic about stored le types Files on a backend storage system are referenced by a string so that backend data stores might support POSIX or not like object stores Since with this approach metadata is only present in the catalogue special care must be taken to ensure that it is always available and consistent throughout the lifetime Furthermore a method to hand out the metadata along with the data sets has to be offered for download An approach to facilitate this is to store the metadata directly in the data les Going in this direction the PaNdata and CRIPS projects are focussing on establising the NeXus data format as a standard for photon science NeXus is a specialization of the HDF5 format widely used in high performance computing so that every well-formed NeXus le is also a valid HDF5 le and can be handled by the already present large HDF5 software ecosystem HDF5 is a hierarchical container le format that allows grouping of scientiìc data as well as exible selective operations on stored data NeXus augments this format by sets of metadata entries called application deìnitions which specify a minimal mandatory subset of metadata More user-deìned metadata may be attached to a le but application deìnitions ensure that certain information is always present DESY as a major German particle accelerator facility adopted NeXus as standard le format for its photon science beamlines Already detector manufacturers start to directly implement NeXus as standard format For other beamlines the necessary meta information for annotion has to be gathered from as before The integration means that ingestion into any catalogue is greatly facilitated and data including its metadata can be transferred between storage systems The catalogue becomes a modular search tool and can easily be replaced In the future several auxiliary tools are planned for the ICAT ecosystem The most important is the Integrated Data Server IDS which will allow the upload and download of les to and from backend storage systems Others include a Job Portal for submitting analysis jobs on datasets to computing resources and administration tools Also improvements to the ICAT itself are envisioned within PaNdata such as support for access control mechanisms an installation wizard and a web-based administration interface IV D ISCUSSION The Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting OAI-PMH is a standardized protocol for the collection of distributed metadata The minimal set of required data is Dublin Core and any representation in XML is supported OAI-PMH facilitates cross community metadata exchange with many communities already making use of XML It should be easy for new communities to transfer their metadata to XML using XSLT transformations This facilitates the use of OAI-PMH for collecting metadata Furthermore existing legacy tools can still be applied simply using a different schema Another aspect of OAIPMH is that metadata databases can be set up on a smaller scale and then aggregated using OAI-PMH The most important aspect of metadata is the possibility to quickly search in large volumes of data by specifying metadata criteria Here Apache Lucene is the most widely used library which is open source With Solr we already see enterprise grade search platforms built on top of Apache Lucene It is highly scalable and supports even highly advanced features like faceted search and dynamic

Figure 10  Time GENIE received the TRNDI pad selection message relative to the time the divert window opened for 295 HITL 003ight simulations best navigation estimate to TRNDI at 50 Hz After each simulated 003ight the simulator sends a command to fully power cycle TRNDI taking the hardware through its full operational cycle TRNDI requires only one additional software module for simulated 003ights which generates simulated camera images based on GENIE's most recent navigation state 1  The image simulation module projects a satellite image of the 003ight range into the camera view using a homography transform The image of the 003ight range is a mosaic of many images from Google Earth stitched together using the Microsoft Image Compositing Editor with recent structural additions to the range added using Adobe Photoshop Results TRNDI's HD and GIDE systems had a 100 success rate across the 295 HITL simulated 003ight tests GIDE successfully identi\002ed its target prior to every simulated vehicle launch HD output a correct landing pad decision to GENIE before the divert window closed during every simulated 003ight and over 90 GB of simulated data was logged for postprocessing without any hardware or software errors Figure 10 shows a histogram of when GENIE received the 002rst pad decision message from TRNDI according to data from GENIE's log 002les As the plot shows the message was received before the divert window actually opened in nearly 75 of 003ights and the 002rst message was always received at least 3 seconds before the divert window closed While TRNDI only requires 10 total hits on any particular pad before sending the 002rst decision message a typical trajectory will achieve over 30 hits on the correct pad by touchdown An additional test was conducted by varying simulated camera exposures to determine the effect of image exposure on the HD algorithms To do this we varied the exposure compensation of the large 003ight range image 050from which the simulated camera imagery is generated\051 by up to 006 1 EV but found it did not have a signi\002cant effect on the HD results  1 A future system upgrade will allow TRNDI to receive truth data directly from the simulator for image generation rather than using GENIE's state estimate During actual 003ight automatic exposure will likely be used for all three cameras Despite these optimistic results it is important to remember that the simulated images are not suf\002ciently realistic to draw strong conclusions regarding the accuracy of the HD algorithms in actual 003ight The simulation does give a realistic depiction of data 003ow timing 003ight geometry and system robustness all of which gave suf\002ciently positive results to validate the system for 003ight testing However because TRNDI is fully independent from GENIE it cannot have a detrimental effect on 003ight safety even if it does suffer an error in 003ight and stop operation 7 C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK This paper presented the TRNDI system for vision-based algorithm development and demonstration onboard terrestrial test rockets Hardware-in-the-loop simulations showed the capability of the system to reliably determine a safe landing site in 003ight and provide that result to the vehicle guidance system Algorithms based on the two paradigms of hazard detection 226 searching for either landing sites 050LSF\051 or hazardous terrain 050RHD\051 226 were shown to be capable of reliably determining a safe landing site in simulation and ready for 003ight testing Furthermore successful preliminary results from the GIDE system show it to be 003ight ready Future plans include a 003ight demonstration of the TRNDI system during GENIE's Campaign 6 003ight test which is currently planned for mid 2014 This 003ight will be provided by NASA Dryden's Flight Opportunities Program onboard the Masten Aerospace Xombie terrestrial rocket TRNDI will be 003own in an identical con\002guration to that used for the simulations described in Section 6 Future work will additionally include development and demonstration of vision-based terrain relative navigation and visual odometry algorithms A CKNOWLEDGMENTS
