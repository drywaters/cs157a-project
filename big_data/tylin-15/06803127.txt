The data streams coming from these devices will challenge the traditional approaches to data management and contribute to the emerging paradigm of big data One of the most challenging tasks before collecting and processing data from these devices e.g sensors is discovering and conìguring the sensors and the associated data streams In this paper we propose a tool called SmartLink that can be used to discover and conìgure sensors Speciìcally SmartLink  is capable of discovering sensors deployed in a particular location despite their heterogeneity e.g different communication protocols communication sequences capabilities SmartLink establishes the direct communication between the sensor hardware and cloud-based IoT middleware We address the challenge of heterogeneity using a plugin architecture Our 
prototype tool is developed on the Android platform We evaluate the signiìcance of our approach by discovering and conìguring 52 different types of Libelium sensors I I NTRODUCTION The Internet of Things IoT received its rst attention in late 20th century The term was coined in 1998 and later deìned as The Internet of Things allows people and things 1 to be connected Anytime Anyplace with Anything and Anyone ideally using Any path network and Any service 8 As highlighted in the deìnition connectivity among devices is a critical functionality that is required to fulìl the vision of the IoT The following statistics highlight the magnitude of the challenge we need to address in the future and motivate 
our research Due to increasing popularity of mobile phones over the past decade it is estimated that there about 1.5 billion Internet-enabled PCs and over 1 billion Internet-enabled mobile phones today The number of things connected to the Internet has exceeded the number of people on earth in 2008 By 2020 there will be 50 to 100 billion devices connected to the Internet Similarly  according to BCC Research 2 the global market for sensors was around 56.3 billion in 2010 In 2011 it has risen to around 62.8 billion Global market for sensors is expected to increase to 91.5 billion by 2016 at a compound annual growth rate CAGR of 7.8 Sensing as a service has also gained popularity among academia and industry It envisions to offer sensing capability  
1 We use terms  objects  and  things  interchangeably to give the same meaning as they are frequently used in the IoT related documentation Other terms used by the research community are smart objects devices nodes as a service similar to other offerings such as infrastructure as a service IaaS platform as a service PaaS and software as a service SaaS In such environment discovering connecting and conìguring sensors 2 is critical so cloud-based IoT platforms can retrieve data from sensors The sensing as a service paradigm and the importance of sensor conìguration is further discussed in This w ork is also moti v ated by our pre vious work which focused on utilising mobile phones and similar capacity devices to collect sensor data In DAM4GSN 
we proposed an application that can be used to collect data from sensors built-in to mobile phones Later we proposed MoSHub that allo ws a v ariety of dif ferent e xternal sensors to be connected to a mobile phone using an extensible plugin architecture MoSHub also conìgures the cloud middleware accordingly In MOSDEN we de v eloped a complete middleware for resource constrained mobile devices that is capable of collecting data from both internal and external sensors MOSDEN can also apply SQL-based fusing on data streams in real-time As we mentioned earlier in order to collect data from sensors rst we need to discover and conìgure the available sensors in such a way a that cloud can communicate with them  In our previous work discovery and conìguration steps are performed manually In this work we 
propose an approach that can be used to disco v e r and conìgure sensors autonomously II R ESEARCH C HALLENGES A sensor conìguration process detects identiìes and conìgures sensor hardware and cloud-based IoT platforms in such a way that software platforms can retrieve data from sensors when required In this section we identify the importance of sensor conìguration several major challenges and factors that need to be considered The process of sensor conìguration in the IoT is important due to two main reasons Firstly it establishes the connectivity between sensor hardware and software systems which allows to retrieve data from sensor Secondly it allows to optimize the sensing and data communication by considering several factors as discussed below Let 
us consider the following problem Why is sensor conìguration a challenging task in the IoT environment  The major factors that makes sensor conìguration challenging are 1 the number of sensors 2 heterogeneity 3 scheduling sampling rate 2 Each device may comprise one or more sensors Such device can also be called as sensor node  In this work we conìgure the entire sensor node 2014 IEEE World Forum on Internet of Things \(WF-IoT 978-1-4799-3459-1/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 94 


communication frequency 4 data acquisition 5 dynamicity and 6 context 18 1 Number of Sensors When the number of sensors that need to be conìgured is limited we can use manually or semi-autonomous techniques However as the numbers grow rapidly towards millions and billions such methods become extremely inefìcient expensive labour-intensive and in most situations impossible Therefore large numbers have made sensor conìguration challenging An ideal sensor conìguration approach should be able to conìgure sensors autonomously as well as within very short periods of time 2 Heterogeneity This factor can be interpreted in different perspectives Firstly heterogeneity in term of communication technologies used by the sensors as presented in Table I Secondly the heterogeneity in term of measurement capabilities e.g temperature humidity motion pressure Thirdly the types of data e.g numerical small in size audio video large in size generated by sensors are also heterogeneous Finally the communication sequences as depicted in Figure 1 and security mechanisms used by different sensors are also heterogeneous e.g exact messages and sequence need to be followed to successfully communicate with a given sensor These differences make the sensor conìguration process challenging An ideal sensor conìguration approach that is designed for the IoT paradigm should be able to handle such heterogeneity Towards this the proposed solution should be scalable and should provide support for new sensors as they come to the market        Fig 1 Heterogeneity in term of communication and message/command passing sequences Some sensors may need only a few message/command passes and others may require more The messages/commands understood by each sensors may also vary TABLE I Wireless

Network Communication Sampling rate deìnes in which frequency sensors need to generate data i.e sense the phenomenon e.g sense temperature every 10 seconds Deciding an ideal e.g balance between user requirement and energy consumption sampling rate can be a very complex task that has a strong relationship with 6 Context  Schedule deìnes the time table of sensing and data transmitting e.g sense temperature only between 8am to 5pm weekdays Network communication deìnes the frequency of data transmission e.g send data to the cloudbased IoT platform every 60 seconds Designing efìcient sampling and scheduling strategies and conìguring sensors accordingly is challenging 4 Data Acquisition This can be divided into two categories based on responsibility and frequency There are tw o methods that can be used to acquire data from a sensor based on responsibility push e.g cloud requests data from a sensor and the sensor responds with data and pull e.g sensor pushes data to a cloud without explicit cloud request Further based on frequency there are two data acquisition methods instant e.g send data to the cloud when a predeìned event occurs and interval e.g periodically send data to the cloud Pros cons and applicabilities are discussed in Using appropriate data acquisition methods based on the context information is essential to ensure the efìciency 5 Dynamicity This means the frequency of changing positions  appearing  disappearing of the sensors at a given location IoT envisions that most of the objects we use in everyday lives will have sensors attached to them Ideally we need to connect and conìgure these sensors to software platforms in order to analyse data and understand the environment better We observed several domains and broadly identiìed different levels of dynamicity based on mobility 3  High level sensors move appear disappear at a higher frequency e.g RFID and other low-level low-quality less reliable cheap sensors Such sensors will be attached to consumables such as stationary food packaging etc Low level sensors embedded and tted into permanent structures such as buildings and air condition systems can be categorized under this level An ideal sensor conìguration platform should be able to efìciently and continuously discover and re-conìgure sensors in order to cope up with high dynamicity 6 Context Context information plays a critical role in sensor conìguration in the IoT The objective of collecting sensor data is to understand the environment better by fusing and reasoning them In order to accomplish this task sensor data need to be collected in timely and location sensitive manner Each sensor needs to be conìgured by considering context information Let us consider a scenarios related to smart agriculture to understand why context matters in sensor conìguration Severe frosts and heat events can have a devastating affect on crops Flowering time is critical for cereal crops and a frost event could damage the owering mechanism of the plant However ideal sampling rate could be varied depending on both season of the year as well as the time of the day For example a higher sampling rate is necessary during the winter season and night time In contrast lower sampling would be sufìcient during summer and day time On the other hand some reasoning approaches may required multiple sensor data reading For example a frost event can be detected by fusing air temperature soil temperature and humidity However if an 3 It is important to note that same object can be classiìed into different levels depending on the environment they belongs to Further there is no clear deìnition to classify objects into different levels of dynamicity However our categorization allows to understand the differences in dynamicity

air temperature sensor stopped sensing due to malfunctioning there is no value in sensing humidity because frost events cannot be detected without temperature Therefore conìguring the humidity sensor to sleep is ideal until the temperature sensor starts sensing again  Such approaches save energy by eliminating unnecessary sensing and communication III A RCHITECTURAL D ESIGN Previously we identiìed several major factors that need to be considered when developing an ideal sensor conìguration model for the IoT This section presents the detailed explanation of our proposed solution Context-aware Dynamic Discovery of Things CADDOT Figure 2 describes the main phases of the proposed model Phases in CADDOT model The proposed model consists of eight 8 phases detect extract identify nd retrieve register reason and conìgure  Some of the tasks mentioned in the model are performed by the SmartLink tool and other tasks are performed by cloud-based IoT middleware                                                                  Fig 2 CADDOT Model for Sensor Conìguration 1 Detect Sensors are conìgured to actively seek a wireless access points WiFi or Bluetooth which they can be connected to without any authorization because at this point sensors do not have authentication details Sensors will get them in phase 8  SmartLink becomes an open wireless hotspot so sensors can connected to it in an ad-hoc manner 2 Extract In this phase SmartLink extracts information from the sensor detected in the previous phase Each sensor may be designed to respond to a different message-passing sequence depending on the sensor manufacturer and the sensor program developer Even though the sensors and the SmartLink may use the same communication technology protocol e.g TCP UDP Bluetooth the exact communication sequence can be varied from one sensor to another Therefore it is hard to nd the speciìc message passing sequence that each sensor follows To address this challenge we propose every sensor to respond to a common message during the communication initiation process For example SmartLink broadcasts a message where the sensors are expected to respond by providing a minimum amount of information about themselves such as sensor unique identiìcation number model number  name and manufacturer This is similar to the TEDS mechanism discussed in It is important to note that we propose this  constraint only for minimum information e xtraction Once the sensor is identiìed subsequent communications and heterogeneity of message-passing sequences is handled by matching plugins 3 Identify SmartLink sends all the information related to the newly detected sensor to the cloud Cloud-based IoT middelware queries and reasons its data stores using the information This process identiìes the complete proìle of the sensor 4 Find Once the cloud identiìes the sensor uniquely this information is used to nd a matching plugin can also be called driver which knows how to communicate with a compatible sensor in full capacity The IoT middleware pushes the plugin to SmartLink where it gets installed 4  5 Retrieve Now SmartLink knows how to communicate with the detected sensor at full capacity with the help of the newly downloaded plugin Next SmartLink retrieves the complete set of information that the sensor can provide e.g conìguration details such as schedules sampling rates data structures types generated by the sensor etc Further SmartLink may communicate with other available sources e.g databases web services to retrieve additional information related to a sensor 6 Register Once all the information about a given sensor has been collected registration takes place in the cloud The sensor descriptions are modelled according to the semantic sensor network ontology SSNO This allo ws semantic querying and reasoning Some of the performance evaluation related to the SSN ontology and semantic querying are presented in 7 Reason This phase plays a signiìcant role in the sensor conìguration process It designs an efìcient sensing strategy Reasoning takes place in a distributed manner The cloud IoT middleware retrieves data from sensors and other devices and identiìes their availabilities and capabilities Further it considers the context information in order to design an optimized strategy However the technical details related to this reasoning process is out of the scope of this paper At the end of this phase a comprehensive plan e.g schedule and sampling rate for each individual sensor is designed 8 Conìgure Sensors and cloud-based IoT software systems are conìgured based on the strategy designed in the previous phase Schedules communication frequency and sampling rates that are custom designed for each sensor are pushed into the individual sensors The connection between the sensor and the IoT software system are established through direct wireless communication or through intermediate devices such as MOSDEN so the cloud can retrie v e data from sensors The details IP address port authentication etc required to accomplish above task is also provided to the sensor IV D ESIGN D ECISIONS AND A PPLICATIONS We made a number of design decisions during the development of the CADDOT model These decisions address the challenges we highlighted in earlier sections Security Concerns and Application Strategies There are different ways to employ our proposed model CADDOT as  4 In practice IoT middleware sends a request to Google Play store  Google store pushes the plugin i.e an android application to the SmartLink autonomously via the

            Fig 3 Application strategies of CADDOT model and SmartLink tool a usage of static SmartLink b usage of mobile SmartLink  well as the tool SmartLink in real world deployments Figure 3 illustrates two different application strategies It is important to note that neither our model nor the software tool is limited to a speciìc device or platform In this paper we conduct the experimentations on an Android-based mobile phone as detailed in Section V In strategy a  a Raspberry Pi raspberrypi.org is acting as the SmartLink tool This strategy is mostly suitable for smart home and ofìce environments where WiFi is available Raspberry Pi continuously performs the discovery and conìguration process as explained in Section III Finally Raspberry Pi provides the authentication details to the sensor which is to connected to the secure home/ofìce WiFi network The sensor is expect to send data to the processing server local or on cloud directly over the secured WiFi network In this strategy SmartLink is in static mode Therefore several SmartLink instances installed on Raspberry Pi devices may be required to cover a building However this strategy can handle a high level of dynamicity The strategy b is more suitable for situations where WiFi is not available or less dynamic Smart agriculture can be considered as an example In this scenario sensors are deployed over a large geographical area e.g Phenonet phenonet.com Mobile robots tractors or similar vehicles with a SmartLink tool attached to them can be used to discover and conìgure sensors SmartLink can then help to establish the communication between sensors and sinks The permanent sinks used in the agricultural elds are usually low-level sinks such as Meshlium Such sinks cannot perform sensor discovery or conìguration in comparison to SmartLink Such sinks are designed to collect data from sensors and upload to the cloud via 3G Other strategies can be built by incorporating the different characteristics pointed out in the above two strategies This shows the extensibility of our solution For example Raspberry Pi which we suggested for use as a SmartLink in strategy a can be replaced by corporate mobile phones So without bothering the owner the corporate mobile phones can silently perform the work of a SmartLink  System Architecture The CADDOT model consists of three main components sensors a mobile device i.e SmartLink  and the cloud middleware All three components need to work collectively in order to perform sensor discovery and conìguration successfully Figure 4 illustrates the interactions between the three components The phases we explained earlier relating to the CADDOT model in Figure 2 can be seen in Figure 4 as well As we mentioned before SmartLink is based on plugin architecture The core SmartLink application cannot directly communicate with a given sensor A plugin needs to act as a mediator between the sensor and the SmartLink core application as illustrated in Figure 4                           Fig 4 System architecture of the CADDOT model which consists of three main components sensors SmartLink tool and the cloud middleware Order of the interactions are numbered The task of the mediator is to translate the commands back and forth This means that in order to conìgure a speciìc sensor the SmartLink core application needs to employ a plugin that is compatible with both the SmartLink application itself and the given sensor The sensors can be programmed in different ways We do not restrict the developers to one single sensor-level program design In order to allow SmartLink to communicate with a sensor which runs different program designs developers need to develop a plugin that performs the command translations Plugin designing is guided by an AIDL interface which explains the mandatory functionalities that needs to be implemented V I MPLEMENTATION Hardware Setup We employed the Global Sensor Network GSN middle w are as the cloud IoT platform and hosted it on a laptop with Intel Core i5 CPU and 4GB RAM during the proof of concept validation However our CADDOT model can accommodate any other IoT middleware as well We deployed the SmartLink application in a Google Nexus 4 mobile phone Qualcomm Snapdrago S4 Pro CPU and 2 GB RAM which runs Android platform 4.2.2 Jelly Bean We deployed 52 sensors in the third oor of the CSIT building 108 at the Australian National University All sensors we employed in our experiments are manufactured by Libelium libelium.com The sensors senses wide variety of environment phenomenon such as temperature motion stretch humidity presence and so on SmartLink supports sensor discovery and conìguration using both WiFi and Bluetooth Other communication technologies such as ZigBee and RFID are supported through Libelium Expansion Radio Boards  Software Setup GSN is de v eloped in Ja v a  W e e xtended GSN using the techniques proposed in so it can conìgure it self accordingly The Android platform has been used to develop the SmartLink application Further we employed the plug-in architecture called Android Interface Deìnition Language AIDL provided to facilitate plug and play functionality AIDL allows SmartLink to communicate with sensors effective and efìcient manner In order to simulate the heterogeneity of the sensors in term of communication sequences we programmed each sensor to behave and respond differently As a result each sensor can only be communicated by using a plug-in that supports the same communication sequence Figure 5 shows how the interaction 2014

                         Fig 5 Sequence diagram demonstrates the interaction between a sensor and the SmartLink tool However interaction sequence may varied depend on how the sensor is programmed between sensor and the SmartLink application occurs We measure the average amount of time taken by each step average of 30 sensor conìgurations Figure 6 illustrates the results and the following steps are considered Time taken to 1 set up the sensor 2 initiate connection between the sensor and SmartLink  3 initiate communication between sensor and SmartLink  4 extract sensor identiìcation information 5 retrieve the complete proìle of the sensor 6 conìgure the sampling rate 7 conìgure the communication frequency 8 conìgure the sensing schedule 9 conìgure the network and authentication details so the sensor can directly connect to the cloud 10 connect to the secure network using the provided authentication details VI E VALUATION According to Figure 6 the actual conìguration tasks take less that one second There is a slight variation in completion time in conìguration steps 4 to 9 This is due to storage access and differences in conìguration command processing Despite the protocol we use sensors takes 5 to 15 seconds to boot and set-up themselves self The setup stage consists of activities such as reading default conìguration from storage switch-on necessary modules and components communication modules real-time clock SD card sensor broads and so on According to the results it is evident that a single sensor can be conìgured in less than 12 seconds i.e assuming sensors are already booted which takes additional 5 to 15 seconds depending on the communication protocol Additionally SmartLink can conìgure multiple sensors at given time in parallel This is a signiìcant improvement over a manual labour intensive sensor conìguration approaches       Fig 6 Time taken to conìgure a sensor in step-by-step Experiments are conducted using TCP UDP and Bluetooth VII R ELATED W ORK In this section we review some of the state-of-the-art solutions developed by in academia as well as commercial business entities Our review covers both mature and immature solutions proposed by start-up initiatives as well as largescale projects The proposed CADDOT model as well as the SmartLink tool help to overcome some of the weaknesses in existing solutions There are commercial solutions available in the market that have been developed by start-up IoT companies and the research divisions of leading corporations These solutions are either still under development or have completed only limited deployments in specialized environments e.g demos We discuss some of the selected solutions based on their popularity Ninja Blocks ninjablocks.com Smart-Things smartthings.com and Twine supermechanical.com are commercial products that aim at building smart environments The y use their own standards and protocols open or closed to communicate between their own software systems and sensor hardware components The hardware sensors they use in their solutions can only be discovered by their own software systems In contrast our pluggable architecture can accommodate virtually any sensor Further our proposed model facilitates different domains e.g indoor outdoor using different communication protocols and sequences In addition the CADDOT model can facilitate very high dynamicity and mobility HomeOS  is a home automation operating system that simpliìes the process of connecting devices together Similar to our plugin architecture HomeOS is based on applications and drivers which are expected to be distributed via an on-line store called HomeStore in the future However HomeOS does not perform additional conìguration tasks e.g scheduling sampling rate communication frequency depending on the user requirements and context information Further our objective is to develop a model that can accommodate a wider range of domains by providing multiple alternative mechanisms as discussed in section IV Hu et al ha v e proposed a sensor conìguration mechanism that uses the information stored in TEDS and SensorML speciìcations Due to the una v ailability and unpopularity of TEDS among sensor manufacturers we use TEDS-like mechanism by establishing a standard communication message formats to extract information from a give sensors in phase 2 of the CADDOT model Actinium is a RESTful runtime container that pro vides Web-like scripting for low-end devices through a cloud It encapsulates a given sensor device using a container that handles the communication between the sensor device and the software system by offering a set of standard interfaces for sensor conìguration and life-cycle management The Constrained Application Protocol CoAP has been used for communication Pereira et al ha v e also used CoAP and it pro vides a request/response interaction model between application endpoints It also supports built-in discovery of services and resources However for discovery to work both the client e.g a sensor and the server e.g the IoT platform should support CoAP However most of the sensor manufacturers do not provide native support for such protocols Dynamix  is a plug-and-play conte xt frame w ork for Android which automatically discovers downloads and installs the plugins needed for a given context

alone application that tries to understand new environments using pluggable context discovery and reasoning mechanisms Context discovery is the main functionality in Dynamix In contrast our solution is focused on dynamic discovery and conìguration of sensors in order to support a sensing as a service model in the IoT domain We employ a pluggable architecture which is similar to the approach used in Dynamix  in order to increase the scalability and rapid extension development by third party developers The Electronic Product Code EPC is designed as a uni v ersal identiìer that pro vides a unique identity for every physical object anywhere in the world EPC is supported by the CADDOT model as one way of identifying a given sensor Sensor integration using IPv6 in building automation systems is discussed in Cubo et al  ha v e used a D e vices Proìle for W e b Services 5 DPWS to encapsulate both devices and services DPWS deìnes a minimal set of implementation constraints to enable secure web service messaging discovery description and eventing on resource-constrained devices However discovery is only possible if both ends client and server are DPWS-enabled VIII C ONCLUSION AND F UTURE W ORK We explored the barriers in deploying IoT solutions in order to build smart environments We understood that sensor conìguration is one of the major challenges To address this we presented the CADDOT model an approach that automates the sensor discovery and conìguration process in smart environments efìciently by considering key factors such as growing number of sensors heterogeneity on-demand schedules and sampling rates data acquisition methods and dynamicity CADDOT also encourages non-technical users to adopt IoT solutions with ease towards building their own smart environments In this work we evaluated sensor conìguration using three popular communication protocols We validate the CADDOT model by deploying it in an ofìce environment As CADDOT required minimum user involvement and technical expertise it signiìcantly reduces the time and cost involved in sensor discovery and conìguration In the future we will explore the possibilities of developing an efìcient technique to identify a given sensor using context information and probabilistic techniques in circumstances where information extracted in step 2 in CADDOT model is not adequate

Figure 6 Memory hierarchy behaviors among different workloads DataBench is higher than in the traditional workloads The average L2 cache MPKI of BigDataBench is 21 while that for HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 4.8 5.1 14 and 16 respectively Among BigDataBench  most of the online service workloads have the higher L2 cache MPKI on the average 40 except Nutch server 4.1 while most of the of\003ine and realtime analytics workloads have the lower L2 cache MPKI on the average 13 except BFS 56 Third the average L3 cache MPKI of BigDataBench is 1.5 while the average number of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 2.4 2.3 1.4 and 1.9 respectively This observation shows that the LLC L3 caches of the processors Xeon E5645 on our testbed are ef\002cient for the big data workloads corroborating the observation in DCBench  The ef\002ciency of L3 caches also can explain why the 003oating point intensity of BigDataBench on the Xeon E5645 is higher than on the Xeon E5310 only two levels of caches The TLB behaviors are shown in Figure 6-2 First the average number of ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench is higher than in the traditional workloads The average number of ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench is 0.54 while that of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 0.006 0.005 0.06 and 0.08 respectively The more ITLB MPKI of BigDataBench may be caused by the complex third party libraries and deep software stacks of the big data workloads Second the average number of DTLB MPKI of BigDataBench is also higher than in the traditional workloads The average number of DTLB MPKI of BigDataBench is 2.5 while that of HPCC  PARSEC  SPECFP  and SPECINT is 1.2 0.7 2 and 2.1 respectively And we can also 002nd that the numbers of DTLB MPKI of the big data workloads range from 0.2  Nutch server  to 14  BFS  The diversity of DTLB behaviors re\003ects the data access patterns are diverse in big data workloads which proves that diverse workloads should be included in big data benchmarks  Lessons Learned  On a typical state-of-practice processor Intel Xeon E5645 we 002nd that L3 caches of the processor are ef\002cient for the big data workloads which indicates multi-core CPU design should pay more attention to area and energy ef\002ciency of caches for the big data applications The high number of L1I cache MPKI implies that better L1I cache performance is demanded for the big data workloads We conjecture that the deep software stacks of the big data workloads are the root causes of high frond-end stalls We are planning further investigation into this phenomenon by changing the software stacks under test e.g replacing MapReduce with MPI 7 Conclusion In this paper we presented our joint research efforts with several industrial partners on big data benchmarking Our methodology is from real systems covering not only broad application scenarios but also diverse and representative real-world data sets We proposed an innovative data generation methodology and tool to generate scalable volumes of big data keeping the 4 V properties Last we chose and developed nineteen big data benchmarks from dimensions of application scenarios operations algorithms data types data sources software stacks and application types Also we reported the workloads characterization results of big data as follows 002rst in comparison with the traditional benchmarks the big data workloads have very low 


operation intensity Second the volume of data input has non-negligible impact on micro-architecture characteristics of big data workloads so architecture research using only simple applications and small data sets is not suf\002cient for big data scenarios Last but not least on a typical state-ofpractice processor Intel Xeon E5645 we 002nd that for the big data workloads the LLC of the processor is effective and better L1I cache performance is demanded as the big data workloads suffer high L1I cache MPKI 8 Acknowledgements We are very grateful to the anonymous reviewers and our shepherd Dr

  Paper 2581 Version 2  14   Flight i nformation and processing   Presentation and projection of flight profiles   Real time operational information   Managing both pilot operator and air traffic controller workloads   Procedural processes supported by enhanced automation capabilities   Control sector complexity and management   Separation a ssurance   Airspace d esign and p rocedures   Investment in resolving these constraints  will drive the rate of adoption in civil UAS operations in the NAS One p art of the investment will be driven by the FAA\222s \223F acilities and Equipment\224 F&E Budget over  the next ten years Another part will be driven by defense and federal investment  in R&D  The remaining part will be driven by private investment seeking to develop profitable supplie r s and manufacturing firms of UAS Unfortunately   private investment will not fully launch until there is a clear indication of the public investment into implementing the requisite air traffic management  and air traffic control  ATM/ATC changes into the NAS infrastructure and there i s a common  approach through avionic standards in UA V  equipage   It is expected that avionic standards would lower the end user costs The impact on NAS infrastructure is the outline in the following subsection  Today\222s Air Traffic Control System  Today\222s air traffic control system is built around four basic pillars. These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
