Abstract 227CiteSeer 037 is a digital library that contains approximately 3.5 million scholarly documents and receives between 2 and 4 million requests per day In addition to making documents available via a public Website the data is also used to facilitate research in areas like citation analysis co-author network analysis scalability evaluation and information extraction The papers in CiteSeer 037 are gathered from the Web by means of continuous automatic focused crawling and go through a series of automatic processing steps as part of the ingestion process Given the size of the collection the fact that it is constantly expanding and the multiple ways in which it is used both by the public to access scholarly documents and for research 
there are several big data challenges In this paper we provide a case study description of how we address these challenges when it comes to information extraction data integration and entity linking in CiteSeer 037  We describe how we aggregate data from multiple sources on the Web store and manage data process data as part of an automatic ingestion pipeline that includes automatic metadata and information extraction perform document and citation clustering perform entity linking and name disambiguation and make our data and source code available to enable research and collaboration I I NTRODUCTION Scholarly big data refers to the vast quantity of data that is related to scholarly undertaking such as journal articles conference proceedings theses books patents presentation 
slides and experimental data Big data is often described by a set of V's  which originally referred to volume velocity and variety b ut has since gone on to include other concepts such as value veracity viscosity and vulnerability As evidence of the volume and velocity of scholarly big data Microsoft Academic is reported to have over 50 million academic document records and in 2010 it was estimated that the annual growth rates of several popular databases from 1997-2006 ranged from 2.7 to 13.5 Furthermore a large proportion of that data is freely available on the Web with a recent study 002nding that an average of 43 of articles published between 2008 and 2011 were freely available online  The v ariety of big scholarly data is e vident from the wide variety of examples given above such as articles and 
lecture slides Lastly this data is of signi\002cant interest to groups involved in decision making in funding education and government as well as scientists businesses and the general public Given the scale of scholarly big data as well as the interest in accessing and making use of it a number of services have arisen that collect analyze and provide access to this data such as Google Scholar 1  PubMed 2  the ArXiv 3 and CiteSeer 037 4  A signi\002cant challenge for these services is to deal with the scale of the data they collect integrating information from multiple sources and extracting meaningful information from the data Some services such as the ArXiv allow people 
to submit documents and supply metadata for those documents while others such as CiteSeer 037 automatically collect documents from the Web and perform automatic information extraction One of the bene\002ts of this automated process is that it allows for better scalability in terms of collecting and processing new scholarly data however it comes at the cost that the quality of the data may not be as good as that of the manually curated data due to the heterogeneous nature of scholarly data on the Web and the dif\002culties that arise in automatically extracting information from such data Thus a challenge lies in designing algorithms and processes that are able to deal with this heterogeneity Scholarly data is also highly relational citations among papers result in a rich citation network co-authorship results 
in a co-authorship network research projects are related to speci\002c grants and authors are related to speci\002c institutions and publications Furthermore due to the heterogeneous nature of scholarly big data on the Web multiple variations of named entities may appear For instance NSF and National Science Foundation may both refer to the National Science Foundation or the former may refer to the National Sanitation Foundation  Similarly C Giles and C Lee Giles may or may not refer to the same author Thus a challenge lies in entity linking and name disambiguation in scholarly big data Another challenge still lies in sharing data For instance there are issues related to intellectual property and copyright 
that may limit the copying and sharing of data among different groups Furthermore the size of the data may also be a prohibiting factor In this paper we describe our approach in addressing 1 http://scholar.google.com 2 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed 3 http://arxiv.org 4 http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu  1 kwilliams 4 madian}@psu.edu  2 jxw394 3 szr163 5 giles}@ist.psu.edu 978-1-4799-3481-2/14/$31.00 002 2014 IEEE ICDE Workshops 2014 68 


    Fig 1 CiteSeer 037 architecture and system overview challenges such as those mentioned above when running the CiteSeer 037 digital library We describe how CiteSeer 037 automatically integrates scholarly documents from across the Web and extracts information from them how we deal with document clustering entity linking and name disambiguation and our policies and experiences in sharing data Furthermore we discuss some potential research areas of interest for the future In making these contributions the rest of this paper is structured as follows Section II brie\003y describes the CiteSeer 037 architecture and provides some collection and usage statistics followed by Section III which describes the data collection process Section IV describes some of the different types of information extraction we perform followed by Section V where we describe how we deal with issues such as deduplication document clustering entity linking and entity disambiguation Section VI describes our experiences and policies for sharing data and code and making services available Lastly conclusions and opportunities for future research are discussed in Section VII II C ITE S EER 037 CiteSeer 037 is a digital library and search engine for academic documents Traditionally the focus of CiteSeer 037 has been on computer science information science and related disciplines however in recent years there has been an expansion to include other academic 002elds The key features of CiteSeer 037 are that it automatically performs information extraction on all documents added to the collection and automatic citation indexing which allows for citations and other information among papers to be linked A System Overview Figure 1 shows a high-level overview of the CiteSeer 037 system architecture The backend to the system is made up of the crawler extraction modules and backup data stores As with most online services high availability is a challenge and thus the frontend to CiteSeer 037 contains load balancers that direct incoming traf\002c to one of a series of Web servers three at the time of writing These Web servers serve the user interface and interact with the repository database and index servers The physical system is highly modular and has recently been migrated to a virtual infrastructure that allows for the easy deployment of resources as needed TABLE I C OLLECTION AND USAGE STATISTICS FOR C ITE S EER 037  Statistic  Value  Documents  3.5 million Unique documents  2.5 million Citations  80 million Authors  3-6 million docs added monthly  300,000 docs downloaded monthly  300,000-2.5 million Individual Users  800,000 Hits per day  2-4 million  B Data Stores As can be seen in Figure 1 CiteSeer 037 makes use of three main data stores the index server that is used to enable fast searching the master repository that stores the physical 002les and the database that stores metadata citations and other relevant information It is important to keep these data stores synchronized and linked since they are often used simultaneously in responding to requests for documents We link the data stores by means of unique identi\002ers for each document or cluster of documents For instance when a user conducts a search each result contains a unique Document Object Identi\002er DOI These DOIs are then used to retrieve metadata from the database based on the DOI and download requests are ful\002lled based on the DOI Thus special care is taken to ensure that these DOIs are consistent across data stores and persistent over time C Collection and Usage Statistics Table I shows various approximate statistics related to the size of the CiteSeer 037 collection as well as its usage As can be seen from Table I CiteSeer 037 provides a relatively large collection of scholarly documents with the collection growing by about 10,000 new documents daily of which about 80 are unique Due to the scale and growth challenges lie in ef\002ciently extracting information from the documents and scaling to support many users III D ATA C OLLECTION A central challenge for CiteSeer 037 is to aggregate academic papers from across the Web in a single location and process them in a uniform way Our interest is only in academic papers and thus we make use of focused crawling while 002ltering out non-academic documents A Focused Crawling CiteSeer 037 uses two instances of Heritrix 1.14 crawler to perform focused crawling The 002rst crawler is for scheduled crawls while the second is for crawling user submitted URLs Both crawlers are con\002gured to only save PDF 002les The seed URLs of the main crawler are selected from a whitelist which is updated every few months The whitelist is generated based on crawl history and contains high quality URLs that are most likely to provide plenty of academic PDF links The average crawling rate varies from 50,000 to 100,000 PDFs per day Of the crawled documents about 40 of are eventually identi\002ed as being academic and ingested into the database 69 


B Document Filtering During crawling there is no way of knowing whether a PDF we have retrieved is an academic paper or not Thus we perform document 002ltering after PDF documents are crawled We 002rst extract text from all these documents and then classify them using a regular expression that looks for the occurrence of the words 223references\224 or 223bibliography.\224 This is a rather simple and error prone classi\002cation scheme and thus we are currently looking into supervised classi\002cation methods for academic documents All documents identi\002ed as nonacademic are 002ltered out while all academic papers undergo further metadata extraction and ingestion IV I NFORMATION E XTRACTION Information extraction forms a crucial part of CiteSeer 037 and affects the overall usability and quality of the service due to the fact that the automatically extracted information is used as the metadata which is used for searching and interacting with the site and data collection Due to the fact that CiteSeer 037 integrates academic papers from across the Web and is a fully automated system extraction needs to be robust to variations among paper formats and be scalable CiteSeer 037 currently incorporates several different information extraction modules A Header Extraction Metadata in the form of information about papers is one of the most important types of information extracted by CiteSeer 037  Speci\002cally CiteSeer 037 attempts to extract the following information from each document that passes the document 002ltering title authors abstract venue volume and issue for journals page numbers publisher and publisher address Extraction is performed using SVMHeaderParse which is an SVM-based header extractor A recent comparison of various header extraction tools sho wed that more accurate extraction tools than SVMHeaderParse currently exist however it is currently not clear how well those other tools scale which is an important consideration given the rate at which CiteSeer 037 grows 1 Metadata Corrections and Improvement It is often not possible to extract all header elements from papers For instance preprints may be missing information such as venue and page numbers Furthermore there are often errors in extraction W e thus attempt to le v erage other sources to improve the quality of our metadata a User Corrections CiteSeer 037 allows users to create accounts through a system known as MyCiteSeerX and provide metadata corrections and add additional metadata A recent log analysis showed that CiteSeer 037 receives over 13,000 user corrections per month though we are yet to analyze the quality of these correction b DBLP DBLP provides manually curated metadata from publication in computer science and related 002elds Since a large proportion of CiteSeer 037 papers are from these 002elds as well recent efforts have attempted to integrate this metadata through record linking based on matching title and authors from CiteSeer 037 metadata with DBLP It w as found that about 25 of papers in CiteSeer 037 have matching counterparts in DBLP and on a sample of 1000 randomly selected and labelled papers in CiteSeer 037  it was found that precision of 0  75 and recall of 0  8 could be achieved when matching CiteSeer 037 papers to DBLP based on the Jaccard similarity of 3-grams in titles B Citation Extraction Citations play an important role in scholarly documents as they form a graph that can be mined to extract information related to evolution of ideas importance of work etc Citations are extracted for every paper ingested by CiteSeer 037 using the ParsCit citation string parsing tool The section of the te xt containing citations are 002rst identi\002ed from the text based on regular expressions and then each citation is extracted parsed and tagged Furthermore the citation context for each extracted citation is stored which allows for further citation analysis C Other Information Extraction Header and citation extraction are the core information extraction modules in CiteSeer 037 as they form the majority of metadata that users interact with however other information extraction modules also exist that are the output ongoing research in scholarly information extraction 1 Table Extraction Tables are common in scholarly documents as a method of summarizing information and 002ndings CiteSeer 037 includes a table extraction module that automatically extracts tables and their associated metadata from documents and allows for tables to be searched for  CiteSeer 037 also includes a custom table ranking function TableRank that ranks tables by  query,table  pairs rather than  query,document  pairs thus preventing many false positives that would arise in regular Web search This table search functionality with TableRank is integrated into the main CiteSeer 037 interface 2 Figure Extraction Figures are used in academic documents to report experimental results system architecture and various other things In authors pointed that this rich information resource have been neglected for a long time in digital libraries Our current work in this domain consists of 017 Extraction of 002gure and associated metadata caption and mention from digital documents This w ork sho wed that positional and font related information extracted from digital documents can be used for accurate extraction of 002gure metadata As extraction of such information is heavily dependent on underlying PDF processing library such as PDFBox later a machine learning based system was also developed which uses just textual features 017 A search engine focused on 002gure related textual metadata extracted from documents Figure metadata e xtracted from 160,000 chemical journals were indexed using Lucene The standard ranking function of Lucene was modi\002ed to improve the ranking procedure This search engine can be readily integrated into the other such functionalities such as table search or author search 70 


017 A complete pipeline for extraction of data from 2D line graphs and scatter plots that consists of 1 classi\002cation of 002gures into 2D plots and others 2 segmentation of 2D plots into X-axis Y-axis and plot regions 3 identi\002cation of the X-axis Y-axis labels and legends in the plot and 4 identi\002cation of data points possibly overlapping for scatter plots and curves for 2D line graphs Future work in this area seeks to explore extraction of vector images understanding the semantics of 002gures in scholarly documents and extending the data extraction process to other type of graphs 3 Algorithm Extraction As mentioned CiteSeer 037 has its roots in computer science and related 002elds These 002elds often contain descriptions of algorithms and thus a module for algorithm extraction was developed  Similar to table and 002gure extraction this is an extraction module with speci\002c application to scholarly documents however in this case the application is even more speci\002c since it only applies in 002elds that describe algorithms in papers As with table extraction the algorithm search feature is integrated into the main CiteSeer 037 interface 4 Acknowledgment Extraction Acknowledgments are argued to be an important attribution of gratitude that in some cases refers to at least as much contribution to the paper as that of the last author In certain domains such as medicine where clinical studies span multiple centers it is not feasible to 002t the number of authors in the authors section Thus the names of centers are shown as the authors while the individuals contributing to the study are listed in the acknowledgments section Therefore CiteSeer 037 extracts the acknowledgments sections from research papers into a stand-alone system called AckSeer  An ensemble of named entity recognizers is used to extract the entities from the acknowledgments section of a paper and three types of entities are extracted person names organizations and companies This introduces a problem of identifying different variations of names for the same entity Formally it is an entity resolution problem where multiple entities can be clustered under the same canonical name To do this AckSeer utilizes a novel search engine based algorithm for disambiguating the plethora of entities found in the acknowledgment sections of papers D Challenges for Scholarly Information Extraction Challenges in scholarly information extraction include accuracy coverage and scalability The 002rst two of these challenges apply to scholarly information extraction in general while the last is mainly speci\002c to big data scholarly information extraction By accuracy we mean that when information is extracted it is extracted correctly As already mentioned this can sometimes be challenging due to missing information as well as errors in the extraction itself As discussed in this Section IV-A1 CiteSeer 037 attempts to address this by integrating data from additional sources and using it to improve metadata In Section V-B we will describe how the way in which we link and cluster citations can also be used to improve metadata Coverage is related to the classic tradeoff between precision and recall in information retrieval When extracting entities such as tables 002gures and algorithms it is desirable to achieve good recall by extracting as many of them as possible while also maintaining good precision by not extracting false positives Lastly from the perspective of scholarly big data it is desirable to meet the above goals while processing large amounts of data in a reasonable time One way of doing this is to make use of ef\002cient algorithms possibly at the cost of accuracy precision and recall Another way is to make use of parallel and distributed processing such as the map-reduce framework V D OCUMENT C LUSTERING AND E NTITY L INKING Once information has been extracted from documents the second challenge lies in linking the new data to existing data In CiteSeer 037 this takes the form of de-duplication and clustering citation linking and matching and author disambiguation A De-duplication and Clustering It is reasonable to expect that multiple versions of papers exist on the Web For instance the co-authors of a paper might each put a copy of a paper on their personal Website or a pre-print might exist on a author's website while the 002nal version of a paper exists at a publisher Furthermore these multiple versions may not be bitwise identical but may have minor differences such as the omission of copyright notices thus making them near duplicates During ingestion bitwise identical papers are identi\002ed by a SHA1 or MD5 hash and discarded however near duplicates are retained and clustered CiteSeer 037 performs clustering of near duplicates based on the metadata extracted from each document and attempts to match the extracted metadata with the metadata of already ingested papers When a match is found the papers are assigned to the same cluster where a cluster represents a set of near duplicates of the same paper When no match is found a new cluster is created and the new paper is added as the only member of that cluster One of the shortcomings of the metadata based clustering is that the performance is directly related to the quality of the automatically extracted metadata Thus we are currently investigating the use of near duplicate detection methods based on the full text of articles B Citation Clustering and Linking Many scholarly documents might cite the same in\003uential papers and therefore CiteSeer 037 performs citation clustering whereby citations to the same paper are grouped together in the same cluster  The method for doing this is the same as the document clustering method and is based on the metadata extracted from each citation during the citation string parsing The citation clusters are in fact the same clusters as used for documents with a 003ag to indicate whether or not CiteSeer 037 contains a version of the paper or just a citation to it Furthermore for each citation C extracted from a paper P a  cluster\(P cites cluster\(C  relation is created thereby 71 


    Fig 2 Cluster document and citation graph creating a citation graph Figure 2 shows an example of the relationship between clusters documents and citations As can be seen from the 002gure clusters contain both papers and citations which have been matched to the cluster based on the metadata automatically extracted during header extraction for papers and citation parsing for citations In the 002gure the papers in Cluster 3 cite papers in Clusters 1 and 2 as is demonstrated by the fact that there is a cites relationship and the fact that Clusters 1 and 2 both have citation nodes One of the bene\002ts of linking papers and citations to clusters is that it can be used to improve metadata For instance it has already been discussed how certain metadata 002elds may be missing when performing header extraction from a paper however when there is a citation to that paper as well then it is possible to improve the paper metadata by incorporating the 002elds extracted from the citation C Author Name Disambiguation Due to the fact that publishers have different formats author names often have different representations For instance C L Giles and C Lee Giles may be two ways of referring to the same author The author name disambiguation problem involves identifying whether or not two references are to the same person The method for author disambiguation currently in use is based on building a similarity pro\002le for each author and disambiguating authors using random forests CiteSeer 037 maintains a page for each disambiguated author that contains different variations of their names their af\002liation and homepage their H-index based on CiteSeer 037 data and a list of their publications in CiteSeer 037  VI D ATA S HARING There are many reason to share the data collected by CiteSeer 037  such as to foster collaboration and research However challenges exist for sharing our data due to the size of the data as well as issues related to potential copyright violation Even though CiteSeer 037 data is crawled from the public Web while obeying site crawling policies it is possible that some copyrighted material is retrieved and from time to time CiteSeer 037 receives requests from authors and publishers to remove documents However even with these challenges we still believe it is bene\002cial to share data One way CiteSeer 037 data is shared in through the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting which is a standard proposed by The Open Archive Initiative in order to facilitate content dissemination By programatically accessing the CiteSeer 037 OAI Harvest URL 5  it is possible to download the metadata for all papers that exist in CiteSeer 037  This is the easiest way to access CiteSeer 037 data and seems to be widely used with an average of 4983 requests per month From time to time researchers are interested in more than just the CiteSeer 037 metadata For instance during November 2013 CiteSeer 037 received 9 requests for data via the contact form on the CiteSeer 037 Website In cases like these we make dumps of our databases available on Amazon S3 for download This has the bene\002t for alleviating us of the cost of distributing the data since the cost of download traf\002c is paid for by the user and not by us A challenge still remains however in how to best go about distributing the core repository which contains the actual PDF papers and extracted text Besides the copyright issues already spoken about there are challenges in distributing the data which currently is larger than 6TB Furthermore this repository is growing at a rate of about 10\22620GB per day thereby making keeping this repository synchronized with others over the Web a challenge A Code Sharing CiteSeer 037 and related projects such as the extraction modules are usually open sourced under the permissive Apache License Version 2 The motivation for doing this is to allow other research groups to run their own versions of CiteSeer 037 as well as to allow the community to make improvements to CiteSeer 037 that can be used to improve the service The source code for CiteSeer 037 was previously hosted on SourceForge 6  however recently the source code has been migrated to GitHub 7 to enable better collaboration Since making this migration in July 2013 CiteSeer 037 has been forked 5 times B CiteSeerExtractor CiteSeer 037 runs other services in addition to the OAI service already mentioned to simplify the ways in which people interact with and make use of scholarly big data CiteSeerExtractor is a stand-alone Web service that provides a RESTful API for information extraction from scholarly documents Based on the extraction modules currently used in CiteSeer 037  CiteSeerExtractor can be integrated into any application that needs to perform scholarly information extraction This greatly simpli\002es the information extraction process and allows for centralized extraction that can easily be improved without needing to distribute the improvements Like CiteSeer 037  CiteSeerExtractor is an open source project publicly available on our GitHub page thereby making it easy for other research 5

groups to deploy their own versions and allows us to bene\002t from any community improvements to the software VII C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we have provided a case study of CiteSeer 037 and how it integrates data from across the Web and performs automatic extraction clustering entity linking and name disambiguation on that data Furthermore we have described how we share data code and services and some of the challenges and opportunities that have arisen from doing that All of these tasks are interesting in and of themselves from a research perspective however recently we have been faced with the pressure of not only supporting these sorts of operations but also the need to do so in scalable ways In this regard as CiteSeer 037 has continued to grow we have been faced with increasing pressure to be able to deal with the needs and demands of big data and the need to design algorithms systems and processes that are scalable Though not discussed in this paper the 002rst step in doing this has involved migrating CiteSeer 037 from a physical architecture to a virtual architecture This has the main bene\002t of allowing us to provision resources on demand in order to meet increasing requirements for processing power However in addition to this we see a number of other research opportunities in dealing with scholarly big data It was mentioned in Section III that we crawl between 50,000 and 100,000 PDFs per day of which about 40 are scholarly documents however we only ingest about 10,000 new documents per day and thus a bottleneck exists in our ingestion pipeline Research opportunities thus potentially exists in distributed ingestion Opportunities also exist in investigating new information extraction methods that can be applied to scholarly data such as extracting data from 002gures as previously mentioned This is one of the main bene\002ts of automated scholarly big data management systems since new extraction modules can easily be added As already mentioned though there are often errors in extraction thus there is the potential to identify new sources of information that can be integrated into CiteSeer 037 that can be used to improve the quality of automatically extracted data Furthermore the user corrections submitted through MyCiteSeerX provides a useful set of data that can be used to try and better understand where automatic extraction fails which may be bene\002cial for improving the extraction algorithms Lastly given the large number of hits that CiteSeer 037 receives per day we believe that there is an opportunity in analyzing access logs in order to determine how best to provision services and design algorithms For instance logs analysis can be used to gain insight into user requests and requirements improve ranking and determine which data should be cached A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation R EFERENCES  E Archambault D Amyot P  Deschamps A Nicol L Rebout and G Roberge

   7 The team settled on an 1800W Hydrargyrum  Medium arc Iodide \(HMI; i.e. metal halide\ lamp system, with ballast and adjustable stand.  Figure 8 shows the scaled lamp spectrum over laid onto a 6000K blackbody spectrum 8  9  T he t o t a l p ur c ha s e p r i c e f o r t he  s ys t e m i s  1 1 k w i t h a  three week lead t ime  Selecting the Current  The amount of current required for a \221passing\222 test was the matter of some debate.  Ideally, the maximum panel current would be generated so as to meet the EPS 4 requirement by test.  However, the theatre lamp is not that prec ise; slight variations in warm up time, distance, and focus can produce large swings in panel current.  The lab experiments also showed that some cases can generate currents in excess of the design value.  To eliminate risk of hardware damage, the flight t est requires a minimum of 500mA generation, and a target of 80% of the manufacturer\222s LAPSS measurement 7  T hi s va l ue i s l a r ge e no ug h t o e xp o s e a n y  s ub s t a nt i a l  power losses in signal path, and to cause a failed string to clearly result in an out of fami ly measurement  Hardware and Personnel Safety  Thermal 227 In addition to safely de rating the current generation, several safety aspects required resolution prior to the first flight test.  Though the metal halide bulbs better approximate the sunlight spectrum, they still generate infrared.  Both the panel and surrounding flight hardware require real time monitoring to prevent thermal related damage.  Only 40% of th e LADEE panels carry embedded temperature sensors.  To maintain hardware safety, the test requires use of a calibrated, handheld thermal imager.  The specific imager used \(Fluke Ti25\ is essentially an infrared digital camera.  The entire panel can be moni tored and saved for offline analysis.  The test limit for panel temperature is 70\272 Celsius, driven by the mounting bushings.  This proved good for nominal safety measurements, but limited for precision use due to surface reflections  Contamination 227 LADEE is a contamination sensitive mission due to the presence of mass spectrometers and optical instruments.  All spacecraft activities occur in 10k clean tent, and instruments are continuously bagged and purged.  Theatre lamp systems are not necessarily design ed for a clean room environment.  The rental lamps see heavy usage, and often have peeling paint.  New lamps outgas substantially, and must be burned in prior to test in the clean tent     Figure 8:  Test La mp Spectrum  


Optics 227 Though the lamp is, roughly speaking, meant to simulate sunlight spectrum and intensity, most of the optical hardware on the spacecraft is not designed to look directly into the sun.  LADEE\222s body mount panels are r ight next to the payloads; for protection, all instruments were shielded with reflective blankets.  LADEE\222s star trackers can withstand sunlight, and did not require protection  Personnel Safety 227 Regarding personnel safety, precautions were necessary.  On e of the strengths of the metal halide bulb is less infrared and more UV; unfortunately human eyes are sensitive to UV radiation.  Further, the light reflects easily and can cause headaches even when personnel avoid looking at the bulb.  Fortunately, an in expensive, stock solution was available.  Most standard safety glasses meet the ANSI Z87.1 standard for UV protection.  Welding glasses also meet the standard, and often provide fitted wrap around protection.  To meet personnel safety, the project purchased a dozen glasses and required all personnel to wear them during test. [7  D eb r i ef s a n d p l acar d s s er v e t o  notify all staff   5  T EST R ESULTS  The first test occurred just after final observatory integration, and was straightforward to execute.  The test tim e was about four hours, and required three staff to operate.  The EPS 4 295W requirement was not met due to de rating the lamp.  Figures 9 and 10 are time series of all panel currents and temperature sensors during the test Figure 11 shows a typical \221ste p\222 current signature for each panel type.  Note the signature shows evidence that the lamp warm up persists beyond one minute.  All panels measured above the 0.5A requirement, with most between 70 75% of maximum.  Typical panel temperatures hovered around 45\272 Celsius \(Figure 12\, with the hottest at about 59\272 Celsius The test was considered a success, and LADEE Risk #87 was subsequently closed  LADEE project management was sufficiently happy with the test that it approved purchase of a new lamp system The test proved to be simple enough in execution that the test rig could be taken to the launch site for evaluation prior to encapsulation.  At t he final observatory test \(Figure 13 the team attempted verification of the 295W requirement Enough thermal margin was available to relax the generated current de rating from 25% to roughly 10%.  Recall that only one panel can be tested at a time; anal ysis combines superposition of results with the spacecraft rotation and orientation outlined in Figure 3.  The average observatory power generation meets the 295W requirement \(Table 4 Three sides of the spacecraft fell less than 10% short of the require ment.  However, the level of residual risk was considered appropriate for a Class D mission and no further testing was required  Table 4:  EPS 4 Closed by Test  Minimum Power  Maximum Power  Average Power  Requirement  270.9W  339.7W  310.4W  295W     Figure 9:  Solar Array Test Currents

   10   Figure 12:  Infrared Image of a Panel during Test   Figure 13:  Final LADEE Test   6  M AINTENANCE   I NSPECTION   AND R EPAIR  Receiving Inspection  Beyond testing, the LADEE team used tried and true methods of visual inspection and record keeping from receipt through launch.  The panel vendor accompanied the initial delivery of hardware to NASA ARC and participated in an on site inspection, thereby do cumenting the initial state of the hardware.  Throughout during Integration and Test \(I&T\, the LADEE test team performed their own visual inspections of the hardware.  This best practice resulted in the discovery of two panels with minor damage  Launch Site Inspection  Following shipment to the launch facility \(NASA Wallops Flight Facility, Virginia\, the manufacturer performed an on site inspection and repair of the panels.  Roughly 15% of the array was found to have minor cracks and damage due to  handling \(Figure 14\.  During an extended stay at Wallops Island, the repair team was able to fix all affected panels with no issues \(Figure 15\.  The simplicity, portability, and ease of operation of the lamp test fixture made it easy to re evaluate all repaired panels prior to launch.  Note the inspections and final test were not part of the project\222s original \(observatory LAPSS test\ plan   Figure 14:  Damaged LADEE Solar Cell   Figure 15:  Cell Repair at the Launch Facility   7  M ISSION O PERATIONS  A ma jor assumption that enabled the entire risk mitigation process was the allocation of manufacturer\222s per panel LAPSS data for requirements verification, LADEE EPS modeling and mission operations tools.  Several factors can invalidate that assumption.  One obviously, is any damage and repair that could occur prior to launch.  Another is degradation; though LADEE is a short lifetime mission some level of radiation or micro meteorite damage will occur.  A final factor, shadowing, is less a function of the pan els themselves than the spacecraft geometry Protrusions in the spacecraft will tend to shadow portions of the array, and predicting that behavior can be extremely complex.  Neither the lamp test nor a LAPSS would completely account for shadowing.  All of  these factors feed into the need to continuously evaluate the health and performance of the solar array through mission operations  


   11 This would be relatively simple if the spacecraft\222s COTS avionics measured current from each panel, or even each switch.  Unfortunately this is not the case; only one measurement is made for the entire solar array system This design approach, while appropriate for a low complexity Class D system, is highly inconvenient for debugging any type of photovoltaic system failure   During Operational Readiness Training \(ORTs\, the LADEE EPS team developed a method to evaluate panel performance throughout the mission.  The approach illuminates the interdisciplinary nature and value of mission operations experience, even for the hardware designer.  In this case, the ORT campaign engendered collaboration between the EPS and Guidance, Navigation, and Control GNC\ teams that led to a solution.  The EPS team discovered that the GNC system design includes calculation and storage of the spacecraft sun vector as part of its attitude determination process.  As mentioned, the EPS subsystem records the solar array current and number of closed switches.  The EPS analysis tool simply combines the downlinked sun vector with the EPS data and a ge ometrical spacecraft model to determine an expected array current and the derived error \(Figure 16\.  Observation of the spacecraft over a combination of attitudes can be used to back out the behavior of individual panels, thereby updating the manufacture r\222s data   8  C ONCLUSIONS  The LADEE program applied true Class D risk tracking and mitigation techniques to address a major technical risk.  A project decision driven by resources, combined with redefinition of risk metrics, forced its staff to reconsider st andard practices and determine what was really necessary The process of test research development, execution, and risk closure took roughly 10 weeks \(Figure 5\.  The total cost was roughly 12% of the industry standard \(LAPSS solution in materials costs  and 12 labor hours per test Further, the theatre lamp approach is easy to train with and portable.  When combined with standard visual inspection it actually added value over the LAPSS approach in this application.  The test proved the system met powe r generation requirements 6 weeks prior to launch.  Post launch, interdisciplinary approaches proved useful to track performance of the array in flight.  Finally, the entire approach can be easily handed down to future missions   A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work  was performed under the direction of Joseph Camisa, who served as the LADEE EPS Lead until his retirement in mid 2013.  Additional notes of appreciation go to the NASA GSFC Power Group \(Code 563\, the Emcore inspection and repair staff, and the LADEE Syst ems Engineering, Project Management, and Integration and Test teams for their participation in this work        Figure 16 226 Mission Operations Tool Overlays Expected and Actual Generated Array Current
