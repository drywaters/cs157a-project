F OREWORD   Welcome to the International works hop on LOng term Preservation for big Scientific data \(LOPS the first meeting to be held in conjunction with IC DE that bring researchers from different domains to advance research in the area of long term for scientific data Scientific data collected with modern sensors or de dicated detectors exceed very often the perimeter of the initial scientific design in different applica tion domains. These data including experiments and simulations are obtained more and mo re frequently with large material and human efforts.  For instance high energy physics and astrophysics experiments involve multi-annual developments. Hence, the preservation of big data sets produced is of perm anent concern and has been addressed in various disciplines at different levels. However, the challenge of digital preservation of scientific data lies in the need to preserve not only the dataset itself but also the ability it has to deliver knowledge to future user community. A real scientific research asset allows futu re users to reanalyze the data within new contexts In fact, the data should be preserved long term such that the access and the re-use are made possible and lead to an enhancement of the initial investment. It is therefore of outmost importance to pursue coherent and vigorous approaches to preserve the scientific data at long term The overall goal of the workshop is to provide a forum for researchers to sharing original ideas discussing and refining future research challenges in dig ital longevity of big scientific data in different application domains including biology, astrophysics The program committee accepted five papers that c over a variety of topics including data provenance data quality, scientific workflow representation of experiments a nd simulation, archiving, assessing architecture and applications including biology and ph ysics. We hope that these proceedings serve a start point for researchers and developers work ing on long term data preservation We would like to thank all authors for their cont ributions. A great thank, to the program committee members for spending time in reviewing papers a nd providing suggestions for improvements, and to Mehdi Bentounsi for helping in the organization. Fi nally, we would like to thank the CNRS for its sponsorship We wish you a great workshop and fruitful and productive conference  Salima Benbernou and Cristinel Diaconu General Co-Chairs  124

changing the user application ma kes it possible to optimize them as a future work It is not our objective to find the most optimal implementations for each of the envir onments, especially for Clouds since that might end up being a moving target due to the rapidly evolving and black box nat ure of Cloud environments This presents an opportunity for Cloud providers to offer optimized implementations of these primitives as cloud infrastructure services that can be utilized by the frameworks H-Collectives is the Map-Collectives implementation for Apache Hadoop that can be used as a drop-in library with the Hadoop distributions. H-Co llectives uses the Netty NIO library, node-level data aggregations and caching to efficiently implement the collective communications and computations Existing Hadoop Mapper impl ementations can be used with these primitives with only very minimal changes. These primitives work seamlessly w ith Hadoop dynamic scheduling of tasks, support for multiple Map task waves, and other desirable features of Hadoop while supporting the typical Hadoop fault tolerance and speculative executions as well A single Hadoop node may run several Map workers and many more Map tasks belonging to a single computation. The H-Collectives implementation ma intains a single node-level cache to store and serve the collective results to all the tasks executing in a worker node H-Collectives speculatively sche dules the tasks for the next iteration, and the tasks are waiting to start as soon as all the AllGather data is received, getting rid of most of the Hadoop job startup/cleanup an d task scheduling overheads Task level fault tolerance checkpoints Map task output data to HDFS using a background daemon, avoiding overhead to the computation. In case this checkpointing fails for some reason, failed Map tasks or even the whole iteration can be re-executed This performs TCP-based best effort broadcasts for each Map task output. Task output data is transmitted as soon as a task is completed, taking advantage of the inhomogeneous Map task completion ti mes. Final aggregation of these data products is done at the destination nodes only once per node If an AllGather data product is not received through the TCP broadcasts, then it will be fetched from the HDFS H-Collectives Map-AllReduce use n'ary tree-based hierarchical reductions, where Map task level and node level reductions would be followed by broadcasting of the locally aggregated values to the other worker nodes. The final reduce operation is performed in each of the worker nodes and is done after all the Map tasks are completed and the data is transferred Twister4Azure Map-Collectives are implemented using the Windows Communication Foundation \(WCF\-based Azure TCP inter-role communicati on mechanism, while employing the Azure table storage as a persistent backup Twister4Azure collective implem entations maintain a worker node-level cache to store and serve the collective result values to all the tasks ex ecuting in that node. Twister4Azure utilizes the collec tives to perform synchronization at the end of each iteration. It also uses the collective operations to communicate the new iteration information to the workers to aid in the decentralized scheduling of the tasks for the next iteration Map-AllGather performs simple TCP-based broadcasts for each Map task output. Workers start transmitting the data as soon as a task is completed. The final aggregation of the data is performed in the destination nodes and is done only once pe r node Map-AllReduce uses a hierarchical processing approach where the results are first aggregated in the local node and then final assembly is performed in the destination nodes The iteration check happens in the destination nodes and can be specified as a custom function or as a limit on the number of iterations VII E VALUATION  In this section we evaluate and compare the performance of Map-Collectives with plain MapReduce using two real world applications, Multi-Dimensional Scaling and K-means clustering. The performance resu lts are presented by breaking down the total execution time in to the different phases of the MapReduce or Map-Collect ives computations, providing a more finely detailed perform ance model. This provides a better view of various overheads in MapReduce and the optimizations provided by Map-C ollectives to reduce some of those overheads In the following figures, èSche dulingê is the per iteration per MapReduce job\nd task scheduling time Cleanupê is the per iteration overhead from Reduce task execution completion to the iterati on end. èMap overheadê is the start and cleanup overhead for each Map task. èMap variationê is the overhead due to variation of data load, compute and Map overhead times. èComm+Red+Mergeê is the time for shuffle, reduce execution, merge and broadcast. èComputeê and èData loadê times are calculated using the average compute only and data load times across all the tasks of the computation. The common com ponents \(data load, compute are plotted at the bottom to highlight variable components Hadoop and H-Collectives experiments were conducted in the FutureGrid Alamo clus ter, which has Dual Intel Xeon X5550 \(8 total cores\node 12 GB RAM per node and a 1Gbps network. Twister4Azure tests were performed in Windows Azure cloud, using Azure extra-large instances. Azure extra-large instances provide 8 compute cores and 14 GB memory per instance The objective of MDS is to map a dataset in highdimensional space to a lower dimensional space, with respect to the pairwise proximity of the data points I n this pa per   we use parallel SMACOF [11  majorization algorithm. The input for MDS is an N*N matrix of pairwise proximity values The resultant lower dimensional mapping in D dimensions, ca lled the X values, is an N*D matrix

A Collective Commun ication Primitives B MapReduce and Apache Hadoop C Iterative MapReduce and Twister4Azure 
   
VIII B ACKGROUND AND R ELATED W ORKS  Collective communication  optimized communication and coor dination between groups of nodes of a distributed computation, and are used heavily in the MPI type of HPC applications. These powerful operations make it much easier and efficient to perform complex data communications and coordination inside the distributed parallel applications. Collective communication also implicitly provides some form of synchronization across the participating tasks. There exist many dif ferent implementations of HPC collective communicati on primitives supporting numerous algorithms and topologies suited to different environments and use cases. The best im plementation for a given scenario depends on many fact ors, including message size number of workers, topology of the system, the computational capabilities/capacity of th e nodes, etc. Oftentimes collective communication implementations follow a poly-algorithm approach to automatically se lect the best algorithm and topology for the given scenario Data redistribution communi cation primitives can be used to distribute and share dat a across the worker processors Examples of these include broadcast, scatter, gather, and allgather operations. Data consolid ation communication primitives can be used to collect and consolidate data contributions from different workers. Examples of these include reduce reduce-scatter and allreduce. We can further categorize collective communication primi tives based on the communication patterns as well, such as All-to-One \(gather, reduce One-to-All \(broadcast, scatter All-to-All \(allgather, allrebarrier The MapReduce model sup ports the All-to-One operations through the Reduce st ep. The broadcast operation of MR-MB model \(section II\e One-to-All type operations. Th e MapReduce model contains a barrier between the Map and Reduce phases and the iterative MapReduce has a barrier between the iterations. The solutions presented in this paper focus on introducing All-toAll type collective communication operations to the MapReduce model We can implement All-to-All communications using pairs of existing All-to-One and On e-to-All type operations present in the MR-MB model. For ex ample, the AllGather operation can be implemented as Reduce-Merge followed by Broadcast. However, these types of impl ementations would be inefficient and harder to use compared to dedicated optimized implementations of All-to-All operations MapReduce, introduced by Goo gle  consists of a  programming model, storage architecture and an associated execution framework for distribut ed processing of very large datasets. MapReduce frameworks take care of data partitioning, task parallelization, task sch eduling, fault tolerance, intermediate data communication, an d many other aspects of these computations for the users. MapReduce provides an easy to use programming model, allowing users to utilize the distributed infrastr uctures to easily process large volumes of data MapReduce frameworks are typically not optimized for the best performance or parallel efficiency of small-scale applications. The main goals of MapReduce frameworks include framework-managed fault to lerance, ability to run on commodity hardware, ability to process very large amounts of data, and horizontal scal ability of compute resources Apache Hadoop together w ith Hadoop distributed parallel file system \(HDFS provides a widely used open source implementation of MapReduce. Hadoop supports data locality-based scheduling and reduces the data transfer overhead by overlappi ng intermediate data communication with computation Hadoop performs duplicate executions of slower tasks and handles failures by rerunning the failed tasks using different workers. MapReduce frameworks like Hadoop trade off costs such as large startup overhead task scheduling overhead and interm ediate data persistence overhead for better scalab ility and reliability Data-intensive iterative MapReduce computations are a subset of iterative computations where individual iterations can be specified as MapReduce computations. Examples of applications that can be im plemented using iterative MapReduce include PageRank, Multi-Dimensional K-means Clustering, Desce nd Col laborative Filtering with ALS-WR These data-intensive iterativ e computations can be performed using traditional Ma pReduce frameworks like Hadoop by manually scheduling the iterations from the job client driver, albeit in an un-optimized manner. However, there exist many possibl e optimizations and programming model improvements to enhance th e performance and usability of the iterative MapReduce programs. Such optimization opportunities are highlighted by the development of many iterative MapReduce frameworks such as Tw  Twister4Azure  Daytona 18 and Spar k [19 Optim i zations exploited by these frameworks include caching of loopinvariant data, cache-aware scheduling of tasks, iterativeaware programming models, direct memory streaming of intermediate data, iteration-aware fault tolerance, caching of intermediate data \(HaLoop reducer input cache\ic modifications to cached data \(e.g. genetic algorithm caching of output data \(in HaLoop Twister4Azure is a distributed decentralized iterative MapReduce runtime for Windows Azure Cloud that was developed utilizing Azure cloud infrastructure services. Twister4Azure optimizes the iterative MapReduce computations by multi-level caching of loop invariant data, performing cache-aware scheduling, optimizing intermediate data transfers, optimizing data broadcasts and many other optimizations described in Gu narathne  IX F UTURE WORKS   M AP R EDUCE S CATTER  There are iterative MapReduce applications where only a small subset of loop invariant data product is needed to process the subset of input data in a Map task. In such cases, itês inefficient to make all the loop invariant data available to such computations. In some of these applications, the size of loop variant data is too large to fit into the memory and introduce communication and scalab ility bottlenecks as well. An

example of such a computation is PageRank. The MapReduceScatter primitive, mod eled after MPI ReduceScatter is aimed to support such use cases in an optimized manner Map-ReduceScatter gets rid of the inefficiency of simple broadcast ofing all the data to all the workers. Another alternative approach is to perform a join of loop i nvariant input data and loop variant data us ing an additional MapReduce step. However, this requires all th e data to be transported over the network from Map tasks to Reduce tasks, making the computation highly inefficient Map-ReduceScatter primitive is still a work in progress and we are planning on includi ng more information about it in our future publications X C ONCLUSIONS  We introduced Map-Collectives, collective communication operations for MapReduce in spired by MPI collectives as a set of high level primitiv es that encapsulate some of the common iterative MapReduce application patterns. MapCollectives improve the co mmunication and computation performance of the applications by enabling highly optimized group communication across th e workers, getting rid of unnecessary/redundant steps, and by enabling the frameworks to use a poly-algorithm approach based on the use case. MapCollectives also improve the usability of the MapReduce frameworks by providing abst ractions that closely resemble the natural application patterns. They also decrease the implementation burden on the developers by providing optimized substitutions for certain steps of the MapReduce model. We envision a future where many MapReduce and iterative MapReduce frameworks support a common set of portable Map-Collectives and consider this work as a step in that direction In this paper, we defined Map-AllGather and MapAllReduce Map-Collectives and implemented MultiDimensional Scaling and K-means Clustering applications using these operations. We also presented the H-Collectives library for Hadoop, which is a drop-in Map-Collectives library that can be used with existing MapReduce applications with only minimal modification. We also presented a MapCollectives implementation for Twister4Azure iterative MapReduce framework as well. MDS and K-means applications were used to evaluate the performance of MapCollectives on Hadoop and on Twister4Azure, depicting up to 33% and 50% speedups over the non-collectives implementations by getting rid of the communication and coordination overheads A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We would like to thank colleagues and members of the Digital Science Center at Indiana University for helpful discussions and contributions to Twister4Azure and the present work.

  Paper 2581 Version 2  11  These nine attribu tes have been used in this study to define a limited set of business models for civil use of UAS as a means of demonstrating the utility of business modeling Each of these attributes illustrates  a particular application or grouping of applications for use  of UAS.  Multiple current and near future applications are being considered, including    1  D elivery of cargo in remote areas 226  UAS offer efficiencies in terms of access, productivity timeliness, and potentially service quality   2  P olice operations 226  UAS use in DoD surveillance operations has created a market opportunity for similar use in civilian markets   3  Power line and pipeline inspection 226  Long distance detailed inspections requiring extensive hovering or repeated fly bys for inspection of worn components are well suited for execution with UAS   4  Agricultural use for management of crops and livestock 226  A UAS fitted with visual and IR sensors can fly over farm fields and locate pests weeds, and diseases, significantly improving the application of pesticides a t reduced loading to the crops and soil   5  Augmented flight assistance for manned flight 226  Business opportunities in this category range from transfer of technology from UAS experience to the cockpit to provide the pilot with a pilot\222s assistant to Optionall y Piloted Aircraft \(OPA\ where the aircraft is capable of human piloted and autonomous flight   and  6  Communications media relay 226  A UAS stays on station and provides the ability to connect users with a ground station for distribution of information to a lar ger customer base   Business model canvases have been created for each of the six applications cited above.  Fictitious companies were used; however, plausible circumstances, company relationships, and market opportunities were generated  to maximize relevance  Technology Transfer  The U.S. Government, especially through the D oD has made a significant investment to produce unmanned aircraft While less reliable than civilian certified manned aircraft these flying platforms are primaril y used to replace manned missions where risks are high or to provide an \223eye in the sky\224 extending the reconnaissance capabilities of the soldier on the ground. Long loiter times for sensors have proven their worth in battle areas. Patrol capabilities to s eek and detect threats have significantly improved both the vehicles and the sensors they carry  The market value is in the applications, not the aerial platform. The technology transfer that is needed is the adaptation of military technology for civilian  applications the freeing up of flight restrictions to stimulate application development, and the generation of revenue in the private sector through delivery of new ways of gathering information and converting that information for commercial use 227 whether  to reduce cost of existing activities or create new opportunities  Technology transfer can be divided into two major categories:  the transfer of aviation technology to manned flight, and the transfer of sensor technologies for adaptation in the civil mar ket  Aviation Technology 227 this is mainly  technology deployed in avionics  i.e systems that control flight, provide navigation, and support systems monitoring  Some examples of short term technology transfer opportunities include   Small autopilots that can be adapted for use in general aviation aircraft to improve performance and offer value added features at lower cost. The technology transfer is geared toward adapting autonomous flight opportunities from UASs to general aviation a ircraft   Sense and avoid technologies could aid general aviation safety, since most general aviation aircraft do not carry collision avoidance systems   Fuel and engine management systems used for optimizing loiter can be added to a Pilot Assistant for man ned aircraft  Autonomy must pass a major hurdle, that of attaining what the Air Force calls \223certifiable trust in autonomy.\224 The processes for certification are an area of joint collaboration between the military and civil sectors. New methods of Verifica tion and Validation \(V&V\ will be needed, and this V&V must be certifiably reliable, meaning there are scientific and engineering processes to prove performance  Sensor Technology 227 Electro optical video and IR, synthetic aperture radars, ground penetrating  radars, laser targeting systems make up the suite of current sensors. T he trend is to  produce the same or better performance with less system weight systems. This is coupled with the use of signal and information processing to improve the product sensing  for the operator. Approximately 80 percent of the commercial market will be realized in small UASs, where weight is a key factor. The vast majority of the users of the information the sensors capture will not be for a warfighter mission Therefore, inform ation presentation in usable forms will be essential to commercial success  Mapping technologies will need to be adapted to accept UAS derived information. The fight track, the sensor data and the underlying mapping must merge in order to realize the ben efits of sensor payloads on UAS. The technology transfer is a combination of information registry and visualization coupled with greater virtual reality

While the initial market will be in producing the flying pl atform and its sensors, the longer term market is in the information the sensors produce. When coupled with detailed mapping information through a geographical information system \(GIS new opportunities are created, from the farmer or rancher, to the larg e timber company, to water management authorities, to any case where a business involves land use  While most of the UAS industry is focused on a derivative of current military uses for security and police operations the civil industry is looking to use the UAS as a platform to produce revenue from the data derived through the sensors  Taking a longer view, the benefits are clear   Lower labor costs to accomplish tasks that are now performed by manned flight     Lower labor costs through a faster way to aut onomously gather information needed     Lower labor costs in land use field surveys and management    Greater use of information to manage application of water, fertilizers, pesticides, timing of crop harvests and management to produce greater yields \(from cor n to timber    Improvements in water management and allocation through use of GIS technologies paired with UAS sensor information    Reduced cost of environmental oversight and enforcement    Improved public safety through surveillance    Improved flight safety t hrough technology transfer from UAS to manned flight operations    Recognition of UAS flights as a data collection tool with the market driven by the information gained   Ease of operation to attain the data through information processing and presentation   The commercialization of UAS technology  and its capability to collect surveillance information  is limited by constraints imposed by the federal regulatory actions aviation\ and by general citizen concern over law enforcement applications of surveillance a nd the right to privacy. Both of these barriers will be overcome, but not without an impact on the economics of UAS. This delay will likely defer commercialization benefits and present additional obstacles to market entry  6  M ARKET B ARRIERS  Legal and Regulatory Policies and Procedures  The anticipated expansion of UAS into a myriad of public private, and commercial missions routinely using the national airspace alongside other air traffic has highlighted both the UAS operational needs and the public co ncerns associated with those operations. The Federal Aviation Authority\222s FAA's   Interim Operational Approval Guidance 08 01  gives the rules for gaining approval to operate UAS in the NAS and the operating limitations that are imposed on those flights. In  general, the rules for manned aircraft governing vehicle airworthiness, pilots maintenance, and use of the airspace have been directly applied to UAS operations with the caveat that relaxation of some of these rules may be granted if FAA accepts an opera tor proposed safety case using the regulatory process known as Alternate Methods of Compliance." Lacking that the UA S  must meet equivalent certification standards usually experimental category\, and be flown by a licensed pilot. Except in Class A airspa ce, UAS must be flown in VMC in sight of the pilot or, if a chase plane is used, in sight of the observer. UAS are to be maintained like a manned aircraft. All UAS flights in the NAS require a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization \(COA\, typically valid f or up to a year, obtained by submitting an application and receiving specific approval by the FAA  T he time and cost barriers these policies and procedures place in the way of achieving UAS benefits  are well documented Efforts are under way at FAA and th rough the RTCA Special Committee s  203  and 228  to create standards specifically for UAS of varying size and sophistication and for realistic operating procedures which would permit using their unique capabilities while still safeguarding the public Once in  place, these new standards will eliminate the time consuming COA process  Social Issues  Even when these technical and safety concerns are overcome, there is still a growing barrier to widespread use of UAS in the NAS brought on by the public's privacy con cerns. The most widely used mission for UAS is ISR, or more simply, surveillance. As many missions provide low altitude, high resolution surveillance, the privacy rights of citizens caught collaterally in the surveillance, must be protected  Articles in th e popular press have conjured up visions of thousands of prying eyes in the sky watching every move a person makes and continuously advising the authorities of individual's locations and activities. Even though a pro UAS bill was recently passed mandating the FAA to integrate UAS into the NAS by 2015   the government will also have to deal with the public's concern over privacy and the fears created by seeing numerous drones overhead, often at low altitude, regardless of how noble the purpose of their missio n  


  Paper 2581 Version 2  13  Environmental Impacts  Many proposed UAS missions identified earlier would place the vehicles in close proximity to persons who are not directly involved in the UAS operation. Civilian store deliver ies for example, could require a package drop off in cl ose vicinity to populated areas  The noise produced by the UAV being close to people could mean the difference between the success or failure of this type of business  Helicopters are notoriously loud noise producers Additionally, their blades are hazardous to be around. The wind produced by their hovering lift can also be strong enough to damage articles that are not either heavy or tied down. The fumes and gaseous e missions produced by the powerplants will be subject to the same environmental scrutiny  of all other transportation appliances and vehicles  Larger payloads and long endurance can be achieved quietly using lighter than air \(LTA\ or hybrid LTA vehicles with  multi mode propulsion capabilities. The lift required to keep large payloads aloft is not obtained aerodynamically, but through buoyancy, which is completely silent. This lift also produces no emissions, so if the thrust can be hybrid electric, most envir onmental concerns can be overcome.  A hybrid turbine electric propulsion system may also be capable of providing low noise periods of flight before and after which batteries are re charged.  The basic idea is that a battery powered ducted fan eliminates th e need for noisy gearboxes to operate during a noise sensitive leg of flight D Star Engineering is prototyping such a capability with funding from the I ntelligent Advanced research Projects Agency \(I ARPA   Other  There are other more subtle potential barri ers to acceptance of widespread use of UAS in the NAS Cost is still a significant factor for all but recreational radio controlled models. The costs of even experimental certification, pilot and mechanic training, salaries for pilots, mechanics, and other  mission specialists needed to carry out a drone mission, and the still relatively poor accident record for UAS, which can result in total loss of the expensive vehicles, are all substantial  Insurance costs for UAS operations over cities and towns are st ill being determined as actuarial data is slowly accumulated.  No matter how quiet or clean it is, the sight of a large vehicle passing overhead where none had been before may  draw complaints and political pressure to restrict or ban their operations  This  is not to suggest that these barriers cannot be overcome to the benefit of many domestic civil and military UAS missions. The concerns need to be understood and addressed so that their potential to stop the use of UAS is neutralized The technical barrier s are much simpler to overcome than the political and social ones, so continuous public education about the benefits of UAS use and the measures taken to ensure the safety and privacy of the general public is essential  7   UAS  F UTURE F ORECASTS  From resourc es reviewed during the study, the team developed the two forecasts: one for the military and public growth of  UAS  Figure 5  and one for the growth in civil use UAS  Figure 6  Under the FAA perspective   the definition of \223public\224 means federal agencies, s tate and local government organization \(including law enforcement and public universities These curves represent market 223demand\224 projections   Figure 5 2015 2035 Forecast for UAS DoD and Public  UAS   Figure 6 2015 2035 Forecast for Total Public and  Commercial UAS  8   C ONSTRAINTS AND I NFLUENCES ON UAS  T ECHNOLOGY  The technical team participating in the study  identified  listing of the top factors  that most likely will constrain UAS growth   These factors are  integrated functions drawn from the study areas when view ed as total system.

These are communications, navigation, surveillance and infrastructure. The mortar holding these pillars together is aviation policy, rules and procedures  The FAA Air Traffic Organizat ion \(ATO\ has identified over 25 FAA procedural orders and notices that will need to be revised to accommodate routine  UAS operations in the NAS. This does not include advisory and informational materials that need to be developed and briefed to air traffi c controllers, pilots and other aviation stakeholders Additionally NAS investments to accommodate UAS efforts and associated costs must extend  beyond training requirements and procedural developments to include modification of infrastructure to permit an d to optimize efficiency and safety of UAS operations in the NAS  The majority of UAS operating in the NAS today are predominantly operated by the DoD. They were not designed with NAS compatibility in mind but rather to meet military mission needs. It is e xpected future commercial UAS will be designed and operated much more along the lines of manned aircraft. For example, current DoD UAS do not have Flight Management Systems and associated NAS aeronautical database and cannot be program m ed to fly approved F AA instrument procedures such as an instrument landing system \(ILS\ approach. Future commercial UAS operating in the NAS will need have integrated avionics systems and NAS capabilities similar to those of manned aircraft. However, unique challenges associa ted with UAS will remain and drive functional changes across many NAS project and programs. Some of these anticipated drivers or changes are listed by FAA program area below  En Route Automation Modernization \(ERAM 227 ERAM will be impacted by the need to be able to accept and process and display lengthy and complex UAS flight plans that include automated flight profile contingencies to the air traffic controller. This includes the ability to display a 20 minute planned route of flight on a controller\222s displa y suite  ERAM needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in an en route center airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained  COA  process now is in use  Nati onal Voice System \(NVS  227 Future air traffic control voice switching systems must be able to provide timely and direct pilot to controller voice and data e.g text messaging\ communications via Voice Over Internet Protocol \(V o IP  Terminal Automation Mode rnization and Replacement TAMR  227 TAMR needs to be able to display to review to modify and to approve a UAS flight plan request originating in a terminal airspace environment as a 24 hour file and fly replacement to the current constrained COA  process now is use. TAMR also needs to be able to surveil approved UAS flights within the terminal environment  Terminal Information Display System \(IDS\ and En Route Information Display System \(ERIDS  227 Information support systems need to be able to inges t to and  to rapidly display unique local procedures and associated graphics associated with UAS operations. These include pilot communications and UAV control lost ink procedures  System Wide Information Management \(SWIM  227 SWIM  must be able to rapidly mov e critical UAS information around the NAS to provide the right information to the right controller or pilot at the right time and in the desired  format  Flight Information Exchange Model \(FIXM  227 UAS flight information needs to move to and from other Air Navigation Service Providers \(ANSP\ throughout the world and new data terminology must be created that supports the collection, processing and dissemination of UAS movements through the airspace  Air Traffic Control Optimum Training Solutions \(ATCOTS  227 UAS provides new training challenges for FAA in creating new teaching curricula that contains new procedures and paradigms used to accommodate UAS safely and efficiently in the NAS. This is notable c hallenge given 


  Paper 2581 Version 2  15  the diversity and dynamic of evolving UAS technologies and missions  Future Facilities 227 FAA real estate assets may likely be affected as new UAS related systems are development and deployed. UAS NAS integration may drive additional FAA manpow er needs for positions of operations, coordination and management. This may require additional physical footprints to accommodate new positions of operations personnel and their supporting infrastructure  Next Generation Weather Processor \(NWP\ and Weathe r and Radar Processor \(WARP  227 The removal of a pilot in the cockpit also removes the ability to \223see\224 from a traditional pilot\222s perspective. Not only does this relate to the need for electronic systems for detect and avoid \(i.e., the FAR reference 91.113 for see and avoid\ but also affects many aspects of flight safety associated with detection and avoidance of hazardous weather from visual perspective of the manned cockpit. Determination of flight visibility is one such factor. It should also be noted tha t many of the UAS flying in the NAS today have a very low tolerance to hazardous weather such as turbulence and icing  Detect and Avoid \(DAA  227  Depending upon architecture and functionality, detect and avoid for UAS could have a profound impact on a variety of FAA systems and infrastructure components. DAA can be airborne based, and affect Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast \(ADS B\ In and Out and an associated Cockpit Display of Traffic Information \(CDTI\nd Traffic Alert and Collision Avoida nce System \(TCAS\ functionality, including designs for the new Next Generation Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems \(ACAS X\. GBSAA that leverages ASR 11 Surveillance Radars and Standard Terminal Automation Replacement Systems \(STARS\ or TAMR also demands automation and surveillance system modification to provide this capability. Additional future work on portable primary three dimensional \(3D\ radars integrated in the NAS will also demand close analysis  The previous overview of FAA air traffic control sys tems gives insight in the investment required to be undertaken within the F AA\222s F&E  budget It also s erve s to illustrate the pervasiveness of changes that the UAS will eventually have on air traffic control and its supporting  ATM  infrastructure   It is impo rtant to recognize these ATM/ATC changes need to be planned for, funded and deployed. It must also be recognized that these UAS related investments do not stand alone in that these changes must be done while other planned ATC system improvements are taking  place I nvestments   such as   the Surveillance Broadcast System Program  National Voice Switch, Future Cyber Security Data Communications, and others are planned under the Next Generation Air Transport System  NextGen and others  Obviously   if future UA S forecasts are to be sustained it will entail a major shift in current FAA investment in addition to the  currently planned funding of NextGen  The forecasts outlined in this paper  will require an increase in funding levels of between $500 million and $1 billion dollars per year over and above current FAA requested F&E funding levels   Doing so will greatly facilitate realization of the $30 billion per year UAS market  9   S UMMARY  From an aviation perspective, UAS represents a new and disruptive technology  challenging the staid institutions policy, procedures and technologies that exist today and have served manned aircraft well for the last fifty years or more. This UAS technology supports an incredibly wide range of uses that not only allows old challeng es to be addressed in new ways but also creates new innovative world markets for hundreds, if not thousands, of new creative applications answering the call of \223better, faster and cheaper.\224  A growing number of early adopters and innovators of aviation tech nologies are beginning to realize the significance of a growing diversity and number of UAS  This growth  is  driven by a confluence of technological developments in airframes, powerplants, sensor s command and control sys tems and information management The  economic  value  of this industry projected to be $30 billion per year supporting 300,000 American jobs by 2035   As concluded b y the study team   the realization of UAS market forecasts will be constrained  unless key investment is performed in   The NAS ATC/A TM facilities needed to be updated to support new aircraft performance and controller capabilities   Training for ATC to be ready to adopt the new unmanned aircraft performance with acceptable workload    ATC to pilot communications that have the availability  integrity confidentiality and continuity as to not heavily impact either  pilot o r  controller workload   Development of Civil standards for the c ontrol and communications data link that w ill foster low cost access for a b road  range of UAS 226  this could in clude standards of f orm, fit and function as well as covering signal in space  networked channel  access and common control exchange applications    This key investment will develop a C 3  approach to support NAS integration.  It is agreed that other areas such as of DAA are important for investment, but there are already multiple economic incentive s  following this path
