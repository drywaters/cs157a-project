User-Driven Re\002nement of Imprecise Queries Bahar Qarabaqi s upervised by Mirek Riedewald College of Computer and Information Science Northeastern University Boston USA Email bahar@ccs.neu.edu Abstract 227With the advent of big data everywhere the need for new techniques for exploratory search in large databases is magni\002ed The focus of this work is on less technical users who often query a database through a limited interface We propose user-driven query re\002nement as an interactive process to aid users create and re\002ne query conditions This process is characterized by three key challenges 1 dealing with incomplete and imprecise query conditions 2 keeping user effort low and 3 guaranteeing interactive system response time We address the 002rst two challenges with a probability-based framework that 
guides the user to the most important query conditions To recover from input errors we introduce the notion of sensitivity and propose ef\002cient algorithms for identifying the most sensitive user-speci\002ed query conditions i.e those conditions that had the greatest in\003uence on the query results For the third challenge we develop techniques to estimate the required probabilities within a given hard realtime limit I I NTRODUCTION Our goal is to make databases more accessible to a broad spectrum of users ranging from SQL experts to non-technical users querying them through form-based interfaces While an expert with full SQL access will usually 002nd her way around a database less technical users working through limited interfaces often have dif\002culty 002nding what they are looking for Hence for databases to be relevant for these users they 
have to provide functionality for exploratory search  Consider a large crowd-sourced database of bird observations Each record has attributes describing the properties of the bird e.g species size and the observation event e.g location habitat features An organization such as the Cornell Lab of Ornithology would like to leverage this database to help casual bird watchers identify the species of a bird they observed Consider user Amy who is sure about some attributes e.g her GPS device reliably recorded location She does not know others e.g the bird's belly color Then there will be many more attributes whose values she recalls with varying degrees of uncertainty  e.g she thinks the bird's wing was mostly red but maybe it was more of a brownish tone Assume Amy initially only 002lls in values she is certain 
about Unfortunately these are not selective enough and she receives an overwhelming list of possible matches where none of the top-10 species displayed looks like the one she observed Trying to narrow the search further she has to decide which of the less certain attribute values to enter Without help from the database this is a tedious process of trial-and-error If she selects only 223red\224 for wing color but the species is actually rufous the correct answer might be eliminated If she selects too many possible colors only few of the irrelevant records might be eliminated Or maybe the wing color selection does not even matter much Similar issues arise in many other applications In general our work targets the challenge of helping a database user 002ne-tune selection conditions for exploratory analysis In these applications the query is not pre-determined but the goal is to 
002nd a query that returns a result that is 223good enough\224 We make several contributions aimed at improving support for exploratory search in databases First exploratory search usually involves uncertainty not only in the data which motivated probabilistic database research b ut also in the query  To deal with uncertainty in user-provided query conditions we propose a probability-based framework that makes this uncertainty explicit Hence ranking of result records based on their probability is inherent in exploratory search Our second contribution helps the user judge the potential risk of specifying a condition she is not very con\002dent about Specifying such a condition might provide useful information for improving the query result However if getting it just slightly wrong might signi\002cantly change the result then it 
might be safer to not enter it at all To provide this kind of risk-estimation functionality we introduce the novel notion of sensitivity of a condition and prove structural properties that allow its ef\002cient computation  While sensitivity allows the user to quantify the risk of a query constraint our third contribution aims at quantifying the bene\002t of a constraint by identifying the best new conditions to be added in order to improve result quality As a user-driven process query re\002nement should be interactive  Unfortunately computation time tends to be high when dealing with large databases and imprecise queries and data We therefore propose fast approximate estimation techniques that guarantee to deliver results 
within a given response time threshold  The following sections present an overview of our approach II D ATA M ODEL AND F RAMEWORK We introduce the data model and propose a probabilitybased framework for exploratory search in databases A Data Model The database manages some entities of interest each of them described by a set of attributes f X 1  X 2      X m g and an entity-identi\002er Y  For simplicity and without loss of generality assume that data is stored in a relational view 
R with schema f X 1  X 2      X m  Y g   Y does not need to be a key of R  In the bird example the entities of interest are the different bird species Attribute Y is the species name The X i describe various properties of a bird and observation event e.g hasWingColorRed and obsLongitude

B Probabilistic Query Framework The user wants to 002nd entities y 2 Y of interest and expresses her preferences by specifying constraints on some of the attributes X i  This corresponds to query SELECT Y FROM R WHERE condition X 1  X 2      X m  in a relational database To incorporate uncertainty our framework supports constraints that are probability distributions in the condition More precisely for some attribute X i  let A i be the set of all possible probability distributions over the values in the domain of X i  When interacting with the system the user speci\002es some probability distribution a i 2 A i  Given such probability distributions for some of the X i  we support exploratory search by doing the following 1 Estimate for each entity y 2 Y the probability that it is what the user is looking for and present a list of the top-ranked entities based on these probabilities 2 Estimate the sensitivity of each X i for which the user speci\002ed a distribution a i and present these X i and their sensitivity scores in decreasing order 3 Estimate how much each of the remaining unspeci\002ed X j would help improve the query result quality if the user provided a distribution a j for it Present these attributes X j and their quality-improvement score in decreasing order to the user Entity Probability  Given data set D and assuming the user speci\002ed distributions a 1      a k for attributes X 1      X k  the desired probability for y 2 Y is Pr Y  y j A 1  a 1      A k  a k  D   written more compactly as Pr Y j A 1      A k  D   Seeing possible results the user might explicitly reject some of them This also affects the entity probability Let 026 y j denote that entity y j was rejected and assume the user rejected entities y 1      y l  The entity probability then becomes Pr Y j A 1      A k  026 y 1      026 y l  D   III R ESULT R ANKING Given an imprecise query we want to present a ranked list of entities Due to the probabilistic nature of the query conditions each entity y 2 Y is a query result with probability Pr Y j A 1      A k  026 y 1      026 y l  D   We can use it to simply rank by entity probability  We also propose ranking by effort-adjusted entity probability  which takes user effort into account It is motivated by the fact that the user has to invest some time to look at each of the top-ranked entities to decide which of them are of interest Let 036 j denote the user effort required for deciding about the relevance of entity y j  The effortadjusted probability of entity y i 2 Y is de\002ned as Pr Y  y i j A 1      A k  026 y 1      026 y l  D  036 i with the following property proof omitted due to space constraints Lemma 1 Assume the user is looking for a single entity of interest by exploring the ranked list of entities one-by-one from top to bottom until this entity is found Expected user effort then is minimized if the entities are ranked in decreasing order of their effort-adjusted probability IV S ENSITIVITY A NALYSIS We propose the notion of sensitivity of a user-provided condition for an attribute X i  Intuitively user response a i for attribute X i has high sensitivity if the current result ranking would change 223signi\002cantly\224 if the user were to change her current answer 223a little\224 To illustrate the use of sensitivity analysis suppose that Amy can exclude some values of an observed attribute with certainty but is not certain about its exact value If the system tells her that any alternative input in the limited space of probability distributions would result in only minor changes of the species ranking she can be con\002dent about having entered the distribution information even if her probability numbers are a bit 223off\224 On the other hand if even minor changes could dramatically change the species ranking then adding this information is very risky Sensitivity complements other approaches that identify possibly incorrect input by looking for unusual values or outliers 4 5 A De\002nition and Naive Algorithm The sensitivity of user-provided condition a i for attribute X i depends on how much a change of a i would affect the current result ranking Let L p and L q be two entity rankings For each entity y 2 Y  let 032 p  y  and 032 q  y  denote y s rank in the 002rst and second ranking respectively To measure how different the rank of each entity is between the two rankings we use the popular Minkowski distance  dst L p  L q   0  X y 2 Y j 032 p  y  000 032 q  y  j d 1 A 1 d  De\002nition 1 Let L p be the current entity ranking and X be an attribute for which the user has speci\002ed a condition Let A denote the set of all alternative conditions the user considers for attribute X  The sensitivity of the current ranking L p to attribute X for a set of possible conditions A is de\002ned as the maximum difference dst L p  L q  between L p and any other ranking L q that could be obtained if the user were to change the current condition for attribute X to any other value in A  Naive algorithm for computing sensitivity When computing the sensitivity of attribute X i  try every single condition in A i  compute the entity ranking based on this modi\002ed condition to 002nd the ranking with the maximum distance from the current ranking L p  B Ef\002cient Sensitivity Algorithm We proved that the maximum ranking difference can only be achieved by a distribution 223on the edge\224 of the space of possible alternative inputs considered The proof is based on structural properties of the ranking distance and is omitted due to space constraints Theorem 1 Let p be the current user input for attribute X  Let q and r be two other possible responses from A  such that q  p  013 001  r 000 p  for some 0  013  1  And let L p  L q  and L r  respectively denote the rankings obtained for these responses while keeping all other responses constant Then if categories are ranked based on their probability or effortadjusted probability it holds that dst L p  L q  024 dst L p  L r   356

when searching for the distribution that maximizes the ranking distance to the current ranking we only need to consider the 223boundaries\224 of the data space This often eliminates the vast majority of possible distributions in A  dramatically reducing the cost of sensitivity analysis compared to the naive algorithm For instance to compute the sensitivity of a 3-valued attribute the naive algorithm would have to consider the entire colored triangle in Figure 1 Thanks to Theorem 1 we only need to consider the triangle edges The implications of Theorem 1 are particularly powerful for binary attributes where we only need to check the rankings for the lower and upper extreme of the range of possible probability values considered See Figure 2 V R ECOMMENDING A DDITIONAL C ONDITIONS The goal is to recommend currently unspeci\002ed attributes that have the greatest potential for improving result quality Intuitively we estimate how bene\002cial each currently unspeci\002ed attribute is for improving the result quality Since the user's future input a for attribute X is not known we model it as a random variable A  We can estimate the probability that A takes on a speci\002c value a from all the information gathered so far i.e Pr A  a j A 1      A k  026 y 1      026 y l  D   For each value a  we can then compute Pr Y j A  a A 1      A k  026 y 1      026 y l  D  and use it to create an entity ranking as discussed in Section III Assume we have a function F that returns by how much the entity ranking improves with the additional information A  a  compared to the current ranking without knowing A  Using this function F  we can then compute the expected improvement in entity ranking over random variable A  While entropy and other purity measures are widely used to measure how well 223winning\224 cases are separated from 223losing\224 ones and are intuitive candidates for function F  they do not help the user decide if adding another condition is 223worth the effort\224  If it costs the user an effort of 036 X to decide about and then specify a condition for attribute X  then this investment should result in savings of future effort of at least 036 X  We measure these future savings in terms of the reduction of expected effort for going through the ranked list of entities VI P ROBABILITY E STIMATION We make use of Pr Y  y j A 1      A k  026 y 1      026 y l  D  and Pr A  a j A 1      A k  026 y 1      026 y l  D  in our methods In principle we can leverage the vast body of previous work on classi\002cation and prediction techniques to estimate these probabilities 7 8 9 W e can in theory le v erage almost any classi\002cation technique using the following basic approach for estimating Pr Y j A 1      A k  026 y 1      026 y l  D   Using data set D  we train a classi\002cation model M  X 1  X 2      X k  that predicts the probability of each entity y 2 Y 000f y 1      y l g for a given input vector  x 1  x 2      x k  2 X 1 002 X 2 002 001 001 001 002 X k  Then we sample a suf\002ciently large number of points from the joint distribution over A 1      A k  For each such vector  x 1  x 2      x k   M  x 1  x 2      x k  returns the desired probabilities We return the average of these probabilities for each entity The same approach can also be used for estimating Pr A j A 1      A k  026 y 1      026 y l  D   While conceptually straightforward making the above probability-estimation algorithm work in practice is very dif\002cult due to the requirement of guaranteeing interactive response time A Solution Bagged Tree Ensembles We propose a solution based on bagged decision tree ensembles due to se v eral reasons First trees can handle any attribute type and missing values Bagged trees are robust against noise and over\002tting and have been shown to return excellent probabilities 223out-of-the-box\224 Second due to their structure of splitting on an attribute at a time trees can easily compute expectations like Pr Y j A 1      A k  026 y 1      026 y l  D  in a single pass through the tree This is achieved by partitioning the 223weight\224 according to the potentially imprecise userprovided distribution or the training data distribution when the split attribute value has not been speci\002ed at all Hence there is no need to sample from A 1      A k  Third a tree trained for input  X 1      X m  can be used to make predictions for any subset of these attributes And fourth the comparably simple index-like structure makes tree cost predictable and tuneable based on the number of nodes accessed This is crucial for guaranteeing interactive response time In addition to predictability we can tune bagged tree access cost very accurately as well Assume the ensemble consists of T trees each with at most L levels By using only t  T of these trees or limiting access to the top l  L levels of each tree we can reduce cost proportional to the reduction in the number of nodes accessed As the user reveals more attribute value distributions the initial limits for t and l can be increased Since this tree ensemble is capable of adapting to the time threshold we refer to it as an Adaptive Tree  The term Full Tree refers to the full bagged ensemble with t  T and l  L  VII E XPERIMENTS In our experiments we are using a data set provided by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology It contains 2 million observations of 372 common bird species in North America Each record was generated as follows First an observation record is sampled uniformly at random from the real eBird data set a data set containing actual observations reported by citizen 357 


Fig 3 Naive vs ef\002cient sensitivity estimation algorithm Fig 4 Response time Uncertainty=0 Fig 5 Response time Uncertainty=0.5 scientists Unfortunately while eBird reports the species of the observed bird it does not contain individual bird properties like color size etc These individual features were added by sampling from a feature distribution that was carefully de\002ned by the domain experts for every single species A Sensitivity Analysis In this experiment we explore how much difference it makes to use the ef\002cient algorithm for sensitivity estimation instead of the naive one For each attribute we randomly select 1,000 sample points and plot the maximum ranking distance found versus the number of samples explored so far The goal is to 002nd a good estimation of the maximum distance with as few samples as possible Figure 3 shows this experiment for attribute 223size\224 which has 9 values After sampling only 27 points the ef\002cient algorithm has already reached a ceiling while the naive one keeps improving with more samples Still even after 1000 samples for the naive algorithm the maximum distance found by the ef\002cient algorithm is 78 greater B Additional Condition Recommendation In this experiment we explore how well our condition recommendation framework improves the entity ranking quality We compare the Full Tree F to the Adaptive Tree A to explore the effect of potentially less accurate probability estimates in the Adaptive Tree The other competitor is Random R which picks a random attribute In Table I the 002rst three columns report 032  y   the rank of the true entity The second and third sets of three columns report the probability of the true entity and the expected user effort respectively The 002rst row shows the initial values based on the data set D only The values are updated as conditions are added one by one in the next rows The experiment is repeated for varying degrees of uncertainty in the user response Uncertainty value x means that with probability x the user will specify an imprecise constraint The value of x in Table I is 0.5 Other uncertainty values show the same trend and are not presented due to space constraints The Full and the Adaptive Trees clearly outperform the Random approach providing strong evidence that a careful selection of attributes has a great impact on the query re\002nement process Although the same number of conditions are speci\002ed in the Random approach it can at best only slightly improve the initial rank TABLE I R ANK OF THE ENTITY INITIALLY AT POSITION 100 AS VALUES FOR MORE ATTRIBUTES ARE SPECIFIED  P ROBABILITY OF IMPRECISE INPUT  0.5   032  y     Pr Y j A 1      A k  D     Expected Effort    F  A  R   F  A  R   F  A  R    100  100  100   0.002  0.002  0.002   38.1  38.1  38.1   75  76  100   0.003  0.003  0.002   35.3  35.3  39.1   54  54  100   0.006  0.006  0.002   30.6  30.7  40.1   42  42  100   0.008  0.008  0.002   30.6  30.6  41.1   26  26  100   0.012  0.012  0.002   24.2  26.5  42.1   19  19  100   0.020  0.020  0.002   20.6  21.1  43.1   9  17  100   0.031  0.020  0.002   18.9  21.8  44.1   4  17  100   0.062  0.020  0.002   18.4  22.0  45.1   3  18  100   0.125  0.020  0.002   16.8  21.3  46.1   3  17  100   0.125  0.020  0.002   17.6  21.4  47.1   3  16  100   0.125  0.020  0.002   17.4  21.6  48.1   C Interactive Response Time An important feature of our framework is to guarantee interactive response times In this experiment we discuss representative results comparing an Adaptive Tree to a Full Tree Bagged tree ensembles represented by the Full Tree results here have been shown to provide excellent probability estimates but might be too slow for large data sets We set the response time threshold to 5 seconds Figures 4 and 5 show how system response time varies as more userprovided conditions are added with varying degrees of uncertainty The x-axis reports the number of attributes speci\002ed so far and the y-axis reports the system response time The experiment shows that the Adaptive Tree virtually guarantees our system to respond within the set realtime limit no matter how uncertain the user provided data is It initially tracks the 5 sec threshold and at some point mirrors the behavior of the Full Tree when it converged to full size as user input results in pruning of tree branches VIII F UTURE W ORK Fast and accurate probability estimation is central to the interactive query re\002nement problem therefore the main thrust of our future work is to identify other probability estimation approaches Another direction for future work is to make the methods scalable to big crowd-sourced data R EFERENCES  D Suciu D Olteanu C Re and C K och Probabilistic Databases  Morgan  Claypool 2011 358

Another view of grade distribution that is the average grades for each year is depicted in Figure 5 The results of the evaluation show that CISCO students achieved slightly better grades than regular students especially in the prior years when their number was greater We can conclude that although the CISCO students are allowed to achieve 10 more points the average grade distribution of all years is very similar for both student groups which proves our curriculum Several arguments also con\223rm this conlcusion The CISCO students actually have more topics to cover an extra exam than regular students They are more motivated due to practical challenges and also they are enforced to learn more since they spend money and do not want just to pass the course but gain more knowledge through practical exercises VI D ISCUSSION Tanenbaum and Stallings 19 propose a bottom-up approach for teaching and learning about the computer networks These books are also proposed to our students even more because they are of\223cially translated to the student\220s native language The other approach is the top-down approach which is proposed by Kurose The teachers usually choose the approach they prefer In this paper we presented the integration of these two opposite approaches simultaneously That is CISCO\220s CCNA 1 and 2 approach is top-down and it was a very hard to integrate with the theoretical bottom-up approach The results of the course with the new curriculum as well as with the regular one during several years con\223rm our success Implementation of two CISCO CCNA courses improved the course\220s average throughput of CISCO students spectacularly that is average 91.09 CISCO students passed the course compared to minor 37.84 of the regular students The CISCO students are more motivated because they work with practical equipment they face real problems and 223nally they can continue with CCNA 3 and CCNA4 extend their knowledge achieve a 223nal certi\223cate and 223nd a job more easily The similar grade distribution and the average grade through several years is expected since 200 points two thirds of the points are still from the theoretical part of the course which is obligatory for both approaches for the Computer Networks curricula VII C ONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Computer science students usually avoid to learn the nonsoftware courses such as the Computer Networks and Data Communications although most of the applications in today\220s broadband world are distributed and acquire the services by the lower network protocols This paper proposes a new computer network curriculum by introducing CISCO CCNA 1 and CCNA 2 courses into the course This change allows the students to choose if they would like to follow the course according to more practical exercises and tutorials instead of the regular which are more theoretical The course evaluation in the period of several years show that these changes improved the course throughput without making the course easier that is the grade distribution of passed students is slightly better for CISCO students The analysis also show that although the Computer Networks course is one of the core courses it should be offered in the upper study years after the students have learned more details about Internet well known application protocols and distributed systems We have concluded the following students obtain better results by learning more practical oriented courses and moving the computer network class in the second study year instead of the third year of study gives worse results When the course is moved to the 223rst or second study year less students understand the importance of practical approach and recognize it as opportunity to get in touch with engineering 978-1-4799-3190-3/14/$31.00 ©2014 IEEE 3-5 April 2014, Military Museum and Cultural Center, Harbiye, Istanbul, \Turkey 2014 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference \(EDUCON Page 505 Fig 4 The grade distribution of CISCO and regular students Fig 5 The average grade distribution through years D The average grade

the point displacement A good introduction to the possible techniques can be found in Warping Processor 226 WRP The warping Processor receives as input a number of bands of the slave image the af\002ne transformation and the X and Y offset parameters computed by the Interpolation Processor and produces as output the warped bands according to the offsets Since offsets generally contain a decimal part various methods of interpolation of data can be used to get the 002nal result The easiest way is to round the offset to a whole number and take the exact value of the resulting pixel as the destination This technique is called nearest neighborhood it is simple to implement but can cause artifacts in the output image especially when very thin features are present Interpolation of the source pixels gives better results many approaches are possible but the most common are bi-linear and bi-cubic interpolations which are both provided However the perfect interpolator would be an in\002nitely long 2dimensional sinc 002lter which is unfortunately not feasible so a windowed version called the Lanczos 002lter is used instead The GPU texture memory already provides hardware assist for bi-linear interpolation In fact accessing the memory using 003oating point coordinates yelds a value which is the weighted average of the four closest pixels with a single memory fetch Performance are identical to using whole numbers and indeed our implementation does not actually distinguish between the two as the nearest neighborhood relies on the bi-linear function by simply rounding the pixel location To further increase performance the destination image is divided in blocks and a kernel operating in parallel on all pixels of a block has been developed A similar kernel was also developed for complex images using two fetches 050the real and the imaginary parts\051 rather than a single one as in the normal case Bi-cubic interpolation is even better than bi-linear as it uses a weighted average of the 16 closest pixels to determine a pixel value so it produces a smoother result However there is no dedicated hardware support in the GPU Fortunately instead of 16 memory fetches a bi-cubic interpolation mechanism can be achieved using just 4 bi-linear lookups by offsetting the sample position within each pixel and weighting the samples correctly as described in This technique has been again implemented for both real valued and complex images by using an appropriate kernel to process a block of pixels of the output warped band concurrently The Lanczos 002lter implementation is based on a windowed version of a sinc 002lter according to the following formulation 050in one dimension\051 L 050 x 051  032 sinc\050 031x 051 sinc\050 031x=a 051 if 000 a  x  a 0 otherwise where a is a positive integer and it is an input parameter of the tool 050typical values are between 2 and 5\051 The two dimensional version is simply the product of two one dimensional 002lters along the orthogonal axes i.e L 050 x y 051  L 050 x 051 001 L 050 y 051  where we assume that a is used for both the horizontal and vertical functions In the implementation the value a de\002nes a square region of size 2 a  centered on the location in the slave image de\002ned by the X and Y offsets and the af\002ne transformation if the af\002ne transformation includes a rotation the square is also rotated A kernel has been developed to evaluate the 002lter within the square region using integer coordinates for the source pixels and applying the proper coef\002cient given by the above expression All contributions are then summed to obtain the 002nal value for the warped image pixels As the Lanczos coef\002cients are already normalized no further adjustment is needed after accumulation Since offsets are in general 003oating point numbers the Lanczos 002lter has to be potentially evaluated for any value between 000 a and a  However to improve performance the horizontal and vertical 002lters coef\002cients are pre-computed with 1024 samples between any whole value This shall be compared to the expected precision of the estimated sub-pixel displacement which is no more than 1/30 of a pixel and therefore it is considered more than adequate To further increase the throughput the developed kernel performs the evaluation of the 002lter for many pixels in parallel Unfortunately given that each pixel has a different offset it is not possible to share contributions between adjacent pixels in the warped image so a separate thread is run for each of them In case the warping function is a rigid translation then the 002lter can in principle be separated into an horizontal and vertical one thus achieving a huge saving in running time However given that the transformation is almost never so simple this optimization has not been implemented 6 E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS The co-registration toolchain has been applied to many reallife satellite images from both optical and SAR sensors In this section two examples are presented to verify it against two main metrics accuracy and timing performance In both cases we relied on synthetically generated slave images in order to be able to correctly verify the obtained results In a 002rst experiment a sample high resolution 050 14320 002 11760  168 Mpixels\051 3-bands optical image is used as the master On the other hand the slave image is derived from the master with a known distortion applied The distortion is a third order polynomial with 006 9 pixels in the horizontal direction and 006 3 pixels in the vertical one An equally spaced grid of 100 002 100 pixels has been de\002ned where each master patch is 64 002 64 pixels and the search area size in the slave is 128 002 128  The matching processor is run using the sub-pixel option with accuracy of 1/100 of a pixel and the interpolation processor is used with three different algorithms Linear Triangulation 050LT\051 Quintic Triangulation 050QT\051 and Least Square Polynomial 050LSP\051 with degree 3 Table 1 gives the RMS error in pixels in both the horizontal and vertical directions for all cases As it can be seen the error is always very low and LSP is the most accurate with the QT being better than LT as expected Figure 5 shows the generated horizontal offsets by the LSP in the graph for each pixel of the image a bright value represents a positive x offset 050with white representing the maximum positive offset\051 and a dark one a negative offset 050with black the maximum negative\051 Co-registration timing performance are veri\002ed on two sets of images in the 002rst one images are 20000 002 20000 050400 Mpixels\051 with two bands while in the second they are smaller at 8000 002 8000 05064 Mpixels\051 but with 12 bands each 9
