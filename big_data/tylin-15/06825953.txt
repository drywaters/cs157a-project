9 VII C ONCLUSION We reconsider the problem of how to reduce the regeneration time in networks with heterogeneous link capacities We analyze the minimum amount of data to be transmitted on each link of the regeneration tree and prove that the problem of building optimal regeneration tree is NP-complete We propose a heuristic algorithm to construct a near-optimal regeneration tree and further reduce the regeneration time by allowing non-uniform end-to-end repair trafìcs Simulation results show that our regeneration schemes are able to maintain the MDS property and reduce the regeneration time by 10  90 compared with traditional star-structured regenerating codes With the non-uniform end-to-end repair trafìcs we can exibly determine the amount of coded data generated by each provider

method increases slightly which is due to two reasons 1 the data before In this experiment we investigate the performance of OLTP queries when OLAP queries are running The workload is update-only and the keys being updated are uniformly distributed We launch ten clients to concurrently submit the updates when the system is deployed on 100 nodes Each client starts ten threads each of which submits one million updates 100 updates in batch Another client is launched to submit the data cube slice query That is one OLAP query and approximately 50,000 updates are concurrently processed in R-Store The system reaches its maximum usage in this setting based on our observation When the system is deployed on other number of nodes the number of clients submitting updates is adjusted accordingly Figure 11\(a shows the throughput of the system The throughput increases as the number of nodes increases which demonstrates the scalability of the system However when OLAP queries are running the update performance is lower than running only OLTP queries This result is expected because the OLAP queries compete for resources with the OLTP queries We also evaluate the latency of updates when the system is approximately fully used As shown in Figure 11\(b the aggregated response time for 1000 updates are similar with respect to varying scales VII C ONCLUSION MapReduce is a parallel execution

Querying    Fig 8 Accuracy of Cost Model    Fig 9 Performance vs Freshness On each HBase-R node the key/values are stored in format Though only one or two versions of the same key are returned to MapReduce HBase-R has to scan all the of the table Since the is materialized to HDFS when it is full these 223les are sorted by time Thus instead of scanning all the and between  only the between   are scanned The value of decides the freshness of the result There is a trade-off between the performance of the query and the freshness of the result the smaller is the fewer real-time data are scanned Figure 9 shows the query processing time with different freshness ratios which is de\223ned as the percentage of the real-time data we have to scan for the query In this experiment  1600 million and 800 million updates on 1 distinct keys are submitted to HBase-R When the freshness ratio is 0 the input of the query is only the data cube Thus the cost of scanning the real-time data is 0 When the freshness ratio increases to 10 the cost of scanning the real-time data is around 1500 seconds because the cost of scanning the real-time table dominates the OLAP query As the freshness ratio increases the running time of and  and when it is not  and  We submit 800 million updates to the server each day and the percentage of keys updated is 223xed to 1 The data cube is refreshed at the beginning of each day and the OLAP query is submitted to the server at the end of the day Since the data are compacted after the data cube refresh the amount of data stored in the real-time table are almost the same at the same time of each day The processing time of and are thus almost constant In contrast when the compaction scheme is turned off HBase-R stores much more data and the cost of locally scanning these data becomes larger than the cost of shuf\224ing the data to MapReduce As a result the processing time of and increases over time and and a user speci\223ed timestamp still need to be scanned and 2 the amount of data shuf\224ed to mappers are roughly the same with different ratios Figure 10 depicts the effectiveness of our compaction scheme In this experiment we measure the

the data scanned by MapReduce are unchanged during the execution of a MapReduce job In reality the real-time results from the most recently updated data are more meaningful for decision making In this paper we propose R-Store for supporting real-time OLAP on MapReduce R-Store leverages stable technology HBase and HStreaming and extends them to achieve high performance and scalability The storage system of R-Store adopts multi-version concurrency control to support real-time OLAP To reduce the storage requirement it periodically materializes the real-time data into a data cube and compacts the historical versions into one version During query processing the proposed adaptive incremental scan operation shuf\224es the real-time data to MapReduce ef\223ciently The data cube and the newly updated data are combined in MapReduce to return the real-time results In addition based on our proposed cost model the more ef\223cient query processing method is selected To evaluate the performance of R-Store we have conducted extensive experimental study using the TPCH data The experimental results show that our system can support real-time OLAP queries much more ef\223ciently than the baseline methods Though the performance of OLTP degrades slightly due to the competition for resources with OLAP the response time and throughput remain good and acceptable A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described
