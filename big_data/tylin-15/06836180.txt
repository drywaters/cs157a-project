talha.rahman@unitn.it Claudio Sacchi Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science University of Trento Trento Italy sacchi@disi.unitn.it Abstract\227 LTE and LTE-A have promised to provide high data rates to the end users with innovative radio techniques that are not only power ef\002cient but also spectral ef\002cient One such technique is Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access 050SC-FDMA\051 which is employed by the LTE uplink SCFDMA can provide power ef\002ciency to battery-limited devices due to lower PAPR compared to OFDMA An open issue in SC-FDMA is related to the implementation of ef\002cient radio resource management 050RRM\051 techniques able to provide enough radio resources to comply with user requirements in mobile environments characterized by time-varying channel conditions Obtaining accurate channel state information 050CSI\051 under these conditions is often quite impracticable In this paper we are proposing a cooperative radio resource management 050RRM\051 algorithm inspired by Game Theory for localized-SC-FDMA systems in the presence of terminal mobility and imperfect channel estimation Our approach is based on the maximization of minimum required Quality-of-Experience 050QoE\051 expressed by means of suitable Mean-Opinion-Score 050MOS\051 metrics Preliminary simulation results can prove that the time varying characteristics of the channels can be counteracted in a better way if negotiations among users are enabled We further show that such negotiations can maximize the QoE of user populations compared to other state of the art strategies particularly in the case of higher mobility channels T ABLE OF C ONTENTS 1 I NTRODUCTION                                   1 2 SC-FDMA PHY-L AYER M ODEL

Division Multiple Access 050SCFDMA\051 is a hybrid transmission scheme combining the low Peak-to-Average Power Ratio 050PAPR\051 of single-carrier modulations with the frequency allocation 003exibility and multipath resilience provided by Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access 050OFDMA\051 F or this reason SC-FDMA has been considered to support the uplink radio access of Long Term Evolution 050LTE\051 systems SC-FDMA supports two different typologies of subcarrier mapping i.e local 978-1-4799-1622-1/14 31  00 c 015 2014 IEEE 1 IEEEAC Paper 4.1102 Version 2 Updated 18/12/2013 ized FDMA 050LFDMA\051 and interleaved FDMA 050IFDMA\051 In LFDMA assigned subcarriers are localized to a portion of frequency band whereas in IFDMA the assigned subcarriers are spread over entire frequency band IFDMA achieves frequency selective diversity while LFDMA enjoys the bene\002ts of multiuser diversity LFDMA has been proposed for the uplink radio access in forthcoming LTE and LTE-A standards  Future mobile trends are aiming at targeting higher data rates and supporting higher terminal mobility In such mobile environments wireless channels are timevarying and highly uncorrelated for different users Therefore subcarrier allocation can be made adaptive w.r.t the channel conditions and can increase the capacity of the system by allocating subcarriers to the users experiencing better channel conditions in current time slot of transmission Over the recent years several adaptive radio resource management algorithms have been proposed aiming at enhancing the capacity of SC-FDMA discusses lo w comple xity channel dependent scheduling algorithms for uplink SCFDMA presents a sub-optimal radio resource allocation technique for SC-FDMA in which subcarrier chunks are assigned to users based on an interior term followed by iterative assignment of subcarriers In latter assignment users with chunks adjacent in frequency bands swap subcarriers in order to increase system capacity deri v es mean-enhanced greedy algorithm in which users with lowest channel gains are allowed to select best possible subcarrier sets before users with higher channel gains This strategy increases the fairness of radio resources allocation at the price of lowering the capacity discusses sub-optimal channel dependent scheduling for LFDMA and IFDMA In all the aforementioned contributions SC-FDMA RRM works under the hypothesis of ideal Channel State Information 050CSI\051 knowledge Acquiring ideal CSI knowledge in highly mobile environments may be a challenging task To the best of authors knowledge few works have been presented in literature about SC-FDMA RRM in the presence of non-ideal channel estimation Among these it is worth mentioning which in v estig ates using the same RRM approach of the performance of SC-FDMA uplink in the presence of imperfect channel estimation It is shown in that system capacity substantially decreases when the uncertainty in the CSI knowledge increases A key issue recently pointed out by the literature dealing with multicarrier RRM is the cooperation among users Cooperation may ef\002ciently allow solving the tradeoff between capacity and fairness To this aim Game Theory has been considered as a formal tool in order to improve user cooperation in OFDMA systems 050see for example   1 


Figure 1  Block Diagram of SC-FDMA In such a framework Sacchi Granelli and Schlegel proposed in a RRM approach applied to OFDMA W iMAX do wnlink based on the negotiation of the radio resources among competing couple of users aimed at maximizing the Qualityof-Experience 050QoE\051 of the user population rather than the mere Quality-of-Service 050QoS\051 The QoE is expressed in in terms of suitable Mean Opinion Score 050MOS\051 functions chosen on the basis of the typology of data transmission 050voice video data download\051 A further re\002nement of the theoretical game-inspired strategy of has been proposed in where a procedure of 224user e xpulsion\224 has been considered in the game in order to avoid the waste of resources by users that are experiencing unacceptable MOS values The 224expelled\224 users are temporarily queued and their resources are reassigned to the remaining users The competitive negotiation proposed in and 13 has sho wn a great deal of improvement in heterogeneous broadband multimedia scenarios which are also typical of LTE applications The proposed algorithm reconsiders some of the basic concepts of applying them to the subcarrier chunks allocation in uplink LFDMA systems working under imperfect CSI knowledge conditions We think that the negotiation among users considered in may pro vide in the critical mobile LTE uplink scenario a better radio resource allocation with an affordable computational burden Moreover we will show that the maximization of the minimum MOS increases fairness by increasing the user satisfaction index 050MOS\051 This paper is organized as follows Section 2 describes the uplink SC-FDMA system Section 3 will detail the proposed theoretical game-inspired radio resource management approach Section 4 will show some selected simulation results Finally Section 5 draws paper conclusions 2 SC-FDMA PHY-L AYER M ODEL A SC-FDMA transmission and subcarrier allocation The generic block diagram of SC-FDMA is depicted in Fig 1 The main difference between SC-FDMA and legacy multicarrier systems is the presence of the DFT block together with the IDFT at transmitter side The cyclic pre\002x 050CP\051 is added to time-domain signal to counteract fading effects Moreover differently from OFDMA the equalization in the frequency domain is often required to SC-FDMA in order to remove ISI  In SC-FDMA systems two typologies of subcarrier mapping techniques are supported i.e Interleaved-FDMA 050IFDMA\051 and Localized-FDMA 050LFDMA\051 The former technique aims at mapping the subcarriers one by one in a periodic interval LFDMA allocates chunks of M  N=L adjacent subcarriers Figure 2  LFDMA 050up\051 and IFDMA 050down\051 N  16 M  4 K  4 to transmitting users 050 L denoting the number of chunks and N the number of available subcarriers\051 IFDMA is more robust with respect to frequency selective fading and offers frequency diversity gain since the information is spread across the entire system bandwidth LFDMA in combination with channel-dependent scheduling can potentially offer user diversity in frequency selective channel conditions The basic concepts of LFDMA and IFDMA are pictorially described in Fig 2 B Non-ideal Channel estimation Over recent past years most of the research work has been done about SC-FDMA systems with perfect channel information available Practically channel state information 050CSI\051 is not perfectly known mainly due to two main reasons i\051 estimation errors ii\051 channel expires immediately due to feedback delay or velocity of mobile terminals In uplink only the base station 050BS\051 is authorized to perform radio resource scheduling based on channel information Such information is sent to mobile terminals via a feedback channel with some latency This latency can be large compared to fast variations of the fading channel and as a result it may severely affect the system In this paper we are assuming a constant delay between the channel estimation at the base station and the subsequent data transmission We further assume that feedback path is errorless and channel estimation is sent to the mobile terminals without any loss Under the aforesaid hypotheses the imperfect behavior of the channel is modeled like in where the channel estimation uncertainty is accounted by means of a correlation coef\002cient According to if we denote with H i 050 k 051 the real channel gain related to the subcarrier i of the user k and with  H i 050 k 051 its estimate the relationship between the two is given by H i 050 k 051  032  H i 050 k 051 032 030  J 0 0502 031f d 034 d 051 0501\051 Where J 0 f\017g is the zero-order Bessel function f d the doppler spread of the channel and 034 d the time delay between channel estimation and data transmission The coef\002cient 032 is always lower than 1 Fixing 034 d  032 decreases with f d  This means that the uncertainty in channel estimation increases with the terminal mobility as expected 3 T HE P ROPOSED R ADIO R ESOURCE M ANAGEMENT A LGORITHM Due to multicarrier nature of SC-FDMA system performance can be improved by modulating different subcarriers with 2 


different modulation schemes and power allocations Unlike IFDMA LFDMA allocates chunks of subcarriers 050resource blocks\051 localized to a portion of the bandwidth which are assigned to users in a given transmission time interval 050TTI\051 If the Minimum Mean Squared Error 050MMSE\051 equalization is employed by the uplink receiver the signal-plusinterference to noise ratio 050SINR\051 related to the resource block l allocated to user k is given as follows 000 l 050 k 051  8   1  1  M P M i 1 015 i 050 k 051  1 015 i 050 k 051 000 1 9   000 1  l  1  2   L 0502\051 where M is the number of subcarriers in a resource block and 015 i 050 k 051 is the signal to noise ratio 050SNR\051 measured on the subcarrier i of the user k  i.e 015 i 050 k 051  H i 050 k 051 p i 050 k 051  033 2 n  0503\051 p i 050 k 051 being the power allocated to the subcarrier i of the user k  H i 050 k 051 the channel gain and 033 2 n the noise variance respectively Under these conditions the theoretical capacity provided by the resource block l is given by C l 050 k 051  B  L log 2 1  030 n 050 k 051\000 l 050 k   0504\051 where B is the bandwidth of the system and 030 n 050 k 051 is the SINR gap de\002ned for the user k as 030 n 050 k 051  c 2  ln\050 c 1 BER k 051  0505\051 BER k being the target Bit-Error-Rate which is 002xed for each user on the basis of some quality constraint related to the typology of the transmitted information 050video voice data\051 On the other hand c 1 and c 2 are constant values usually 002xed to 0.2 and 1.6 respectively The capacity e xpression shown in 0504\051 has been computed under the hypothesis of ideal channel estimation In our dealing we are considering the hypothesis of non-ideal channel estimation Therefore the estimated channel gain  H i 050 k 051 is the only known information about current CSI for the i-th subcarrier of the resource block Since the instantaneous BER depends on the value of the true channel gain H i 050 k 051  which is assumed unknown it is impossible to 002x the target BER However according to we can de\002ne target BER given the knowledge of the channel estimation as  BER k  E n H i 050 k 051 j  H i 050 k 051 o BER k 0506\051 The conditional expectation of 0506\051 can be formally computed if and only if the conditional probability density function of H i 050 k 051 given  H i 050 k 051 is known In the present paper we use 0501\051 to link the real channel gain with the estimated one and compute the conditional expectation as sample average as in 0507\051 Such computation is clearly approximated however it is reasonable provided that the number of samples used for the average is adequate Indeed the multipath channel impulse response can be assumed as an ergodic random process E n H i 050 k 051 j  H i 050 k 051 o  1  Q Q X q 1 032  H i 050 k q 051 0507\051 Figure 3  The proposed SC-FDMA resource block allocation algorithm where Q is the number of samples taken to obtain the mean for a subcarrier i of user k  We believe the negative effects of imperfect channel estimation on the radio resource allocation can be effectively reduced by introducing cooperation among the users Game theory has been indicated by the recent literature 9 10  as a viable solution to the radio resource management in OFDMA systems The starting point for the application of Game Theory is the consideration that the RRM process in multi-user multi-carrier transmission resembles in some way a 224 market 224 where the 224 customers 224 can bid to negotiate goods in order to rightly balance the offer and the request In this paper with 224 customers 224 we mean the mobile users requesting channels and 224 market 224 is related to the base station 050BS\051 that provides users with the access to the channel In the RRM game 224 market prices 224 are related to the channel gains of users We are considering the fact that the market prices are varying with time 050i.e non-ideal channel estimation\051 Such a perturbation introduces a random factor that may signi\002cantly alter the market balance Thanks to game theory users are made to cooperate in order to adapt their resource negotiation to the market price variations In Fig.3 the proposed theoretical game-inspired resource blocks allocation algorithm is shown for SC-FDMA uplink 3 


The primary task of any radio resource algorithm is to maximize a chosen utility function In this paper we have considered the minimum-MOS as utility function 050 U 051 that is to be maximized with constraint on total available power P k  available to user k  max 000 S k 050 k 051 f U k g  8 k 0508\051 s:t p i;k 025 0  8 k 8 i 0509\051 S k X l 1 M X i 1 p l;i 050 k 051 024 P k 05010\051 K X k 1 S k 024 S 05011\051 where S k is the set of assigned resource blocks to user k  Constraints 0509\051 and 05010\051 are the power constraints and show that the sum of the powers allocated to resource blocks of user k should not exceed the total available power P k  Constraint 05011\051 indicates that resource blocks should be orthogonal and unique for each user Hence such a resource allocation problem can be seen as a combinatorial optimization problem  and is NP-hard It can be solv ed with a dynamic programming algorithm in order to respect the constraints imposed Based on these requirements the proposed game theoretic strategy dynamically assigns radio resources to the users in order to maximize the minimum MOS of each user without disrespecting the power constraints in 0509\051 and 05010\051 The K users in the system are treated as 224 customers 224 and are allowed to bargain the radio resource assignment with other users in the system Users substantially represent data 003ows with speci\002c resource requirements The bargaining game starts after the initialization step if and only if there exists at least one user with unsatisfactory QoE During the game each user individually negotiates 2 radio resources assigned to it in initialization step with others The negotiations take place between two users at a time In this way the radio resources 050radio blocks\051 are negotiated among the customers on the basis of the chosen utility function i.e the minimum MOS The fairness of radio resource allocation is inherent to the optimization criterion based on minimum MOS maximization The game ends when the utility function goes above the threshold of satisfaction or when all users 002nished their negotiations with other users i.e K 050 K 000 1\051 negotiations rounds All these negotiations take place at the BS and no control signals are required for negotiations At the end 002nal resource block mapping is transmitted to users through low rate downlink feedback channel A MOS computation for different media sources Information services 050VoIP video streaming and FTP\051 are characterized by their related QoS requirements depending on application and network layer parameters e.g sending bit-rate frame rate and packet error rate respectively In this subsection we shall review the MOS models used in this paper The MOS computation for VoIP is obtained from as a function of the so-called rating factor 050denoted by R 051 a parameter commonly accepted by ITU to asses the audio conversation quality  2 We use the terms negotiations and

cooperative resource block allocation strategy for uplink SC-FDMA have been tested in the presence of non-ideal channel estimation and compared with performance yielded by the algorithm of where the cooperation and the resource e xchange is limited to users with resource blocks in adjacent bands and the algorithm of where the users are not cooperating b ut the case of imperfect CSI knowledge is dealt Simulation results have been achieved in MATLAB environment Tab 1 highlights the input parameters based on which proposed approach solves the radio resource management problem in the system We further assumed that user power is normalized to 1 and users have their own BER and packet error rate 050PER\051 requirements depending upon the requested service The QoS requirements are shown in Tab 2 The Doppler frequencies corresponding to the channels considered are taken from Different from state-of-the-art approaches the proposed theoretical-game inspired RRM algorithm allows negotiations among users Resource blocks are dynamically negotiated with the speci\002c target of maximizing the minimum MOS of the user population We expect that such kind of negotiation should provide an improvement of the user QoE with respect to RRM algorithms only devoted at maximizing the system capacity Such trends can be clearly observed in 4

The statistical uncertainty involved by the non-ideal CSI knowledge has been dealt by means of a suitable correlation coef\002cient which is directly related to the Doppler spread of the channel The users negotiate resource blocks in couples in order to maximize their minimum Mean Opinion Score 050MOS\051 In such way the radio resource negotiation successfully optimizes the Quality-of-Experience rather than the global data-rate Simulation results have shown that the proposed algorithm clearly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for LFDMA resource block allocation in terms of QoE and fairness in radio resource allocation Future research work may concern the improvement of the game algorithm that may be re\002ned by introducing concepts like intervention and Nash equilibrium in order to moderate the user competition 6 A CRONYMS AND A BBREVIATIONS Table 3  List of acronyms and abbreviations used in this paper   BER  Bit error rate    BS  Base station    CSI  Channel state information    CP  Cyclic pre\002x    EPA  Extended pedestrian-A    EVA  Extended Vehicular-A    ETU  Extended typical urban    FTP  File transfer protocol    IFDMA  Interleaved frequency division multiple access    ISI  Intersymbol interference    ITU  Internation telecommunication union    LFDMA  Localized frequency division multiple access    LTE-A  Long term evolution advance    MMSE  Minimum mean square equalization    OFDMA  Orthogonal frequency division multiple access    PER  Packet error rate    QoE  Quality of experience    QoS  Quality of service    RRM  Radio resource management    SC-FDMA  Single carrier frequency division multiple access    SINR  Signal to interference plus noise ratio    TTI  Transmission time interval    VoIP  Voice over IP    WiMAX  Wireless microwave access   R EFERENCES   H Myung and D Goodman Single Carrier FDMA A New Air Interface for Long Term Evolution  Wiley 2008   3GPP 223TR 36.803 v1.1.0 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access 050E-UTRA\051 User Equipment 050UE\051 Radio Transmission and Reception,\224 2008   D H Holma and D A Toskala LTE for UMTS OFDMA and SC-FDMA Based Radio Access  Wiley 2009   W.-C Pao Y.-F Chen M.-G Tsai W.-T Lou and Y.J Chang 223A multiuser subcarrier and power allocation scheme in localized SC-FDMA systems,\224 in 2012 IEEE 23rd International Symposium on Personal Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications 050PIMRC\051  pp 210\226214 2012   O Nwamadi X Zhu and A Nandi 223Enhanced Greedy Algorithm Based Dynamic Subcarrier Allocation for Single Carrier FDMA Systems,\224 in Wireless Communications and Networking Conference 2009 WCNC 2009 IEEE  pp 1\2266 2009   J Lim H Myung K Oh and D Goodman 223ChannelDependent Scheduling of Uplink Single Carrier FDMA Systems,\224 in Vehicular Technology Conference 2006 VTC-2006 Fall 2006 IEEE 64th  pp 1\2265 2006   H Myung K Oh J Lim and D Goodman 223ChannelDependent Scheduling of an Uplink SC-FDMA System with Imperfect Channel Information,\224 in Wireless Communications and Networking Conference 2008 WCNC 2008 IEEE  pp 1860\2261864 2008   D Fudenberg and J Tirole Game Theory  MIT Press 1991   Z Han Z Ji and K Liu 223Fair Multiuser Channel Allocation for OFDMA Networks Using Nash Bargaining Solutions and Coalitions,\224 Communications IEEE Transactions on  vol 53 no 8 pp 1366\2261376 2005   W Noh 223A Distributed Resource Control for Fairness in OFDMA Systems English-Auction Game with Imperfect Information,\224 in Global Telecommunications Conference 2008 IEEE GLOBECOM 2008 IEEE  pp 1\2266 2008   Z Han Z Ji and K Liu 223Non-cooperative resource competition game by virtual referee in multicell OFDMA networks,\224 Selected Areas in Communications IEEE Journal on  vol 25 no 6 pp 1079\2261090 2007   C Sacchi F Granelli and C Schlegel 223A QoEOriented Strategy for OFDMA Radio Resource Allocation Based on Min-MOS Maximization,\224 Communications Letters IEEE  vol 15 no 5 pp 494\226496 2011   F Granelli and C Sacchi 223An OFDMA RRM strategy based on QoE maximization and radio resource redistribution,\224 in Aerospace Conference 2012 IEEE  pp 1\2269 2012   W Jakes Microwave mobile communications  IEEE Press classic reissue IEEE Press 1974   S Ye R Blum and L Cimini 223Adaptive modulation for variable-rate OFDM systems with imperfect channel information,\224 in IEEE 55th Vehicular Technology Conference 2002 VTC Spring 2002  vol 2 pp 767\226771 vol.2 2002   T H Cormen C Stein R L Rivest and C E Leiserson Introduction to Algorithms  McGraw-Hill Higher Education 2nd ed 2001   R G Cole and J H Rosenbluth 223Voice over IP performance monitoring,\224 SIGCOMM Comput Commun Rev  vol 31 pp 9\22624 Apr 2001   A Khan L Sun and E Ifeachor 223Content clustering based video quality prediction model for mpeg4 video streaming over wireless networks,\224 in Communications 2009 ICC 09 IEEE International Conference on  pp 1\2265 2009   3GPP 223TS 36.141 Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access 050E-UTRA\051 and Base station conformance testing,\224 2008 7

  15   module Trade studies of performance with respect to required delta chief orbit and the cost of ground operations support form important considerations in the design of the cluster architectures, and will be studied. Global designs will also need to consider the biome spread of the Earth so that the clusters are in optimal configuration when they fly over the appropriate biomes Finally this work can be extended to calculate many geophysical parameters beyond snow albedo such as vegetation GPP and radiative forcing of clouds to demonstrate the impact of improved BRDF using clusters on critical science application s  7  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   The authors are grateful to the following people for very useful discussions on the topics presented in this paper Warren Wiscombe  Jacqueline LeMoigne Alexis Lyapustin and Ralph Kahn from NASA GSFC Marco Sabatini from Universit\340 degli Studi di Trento in Italy David Miller from MIT and Thomas Hilker from Oregon State University   R EFERENCES   1   autonomous and distributed scatter manoeuvres for  Acta Astronaut vol. 82, no. 1, pp 95 109, Jan. 2013 2    System F6 Program Value-Centric Design  Proceedings of the AIAA Space Conference Anaheim, California, 2010 3  S Nag    crowdsourcing spaceflight software and STEM  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2012 4  S Nag   J   G  Katz   a n d  A   Saen z Oter o    STEM ed  Acta Astronaut  vol 83 no 0 pp 145 174 Feb 2013  5   spacecraft reorientation for earth orbiting clusters  Acta Astronaut vol. 53 no. 11, pp. 863 877, Dec. 2003 6   satellite systems for Multi-angular Multi-spectral  Proceedings of the 64th International Astronautical Congress  Beijing China, 2013 7   of Nano-satellite Cluster Formations for Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function  AIAAUSU Conf.
