displacement into the adjacent blade This leads to a cascading failure wherein the entire system fails thereby resulting in a lot of damage In this article we intend to investigate the construction of the fan blade and eventually strengthen its\325 resistance to bird strikes  Over the years, designers have come up with several ways to effectively model the birds in reducing the overall fatigue caused in the blades Several bird models were proposed each more effective than the other. A bird could be thought of as behaving like a fluid when undergoing high speed impact Some of the models propose an elastic-plastic deformable body with low value of yield point and small hardening while others consider hyper-elastic rubber-like body jelly-like body which easily splatters over the whole blade, a liquid body or even particles of solid body  In this article, the impact of a bird strike on a jet engine fan 
blade is analyzed and emphasis is not on just the bird model Stress and deformation patterns will also be investigated to suggest more robust fan designs to lessen bird strike impact Investigations conclude that the maximum pressure is expected at the center of impact on the blade. The suitable bird model selected for analysis is a hyper-elastic rubber like\body, which resembles the impact of birds most closely as they splatter off once they collide  The blade and the bird are initially modeled in CATIA AUTODYN-3D was used for the collision simulation The bird was modeled as a cylinder with hemispherical ends Material selection for the birds to accurately correspond to the actual models was challenging In order to replicate the behavior of the actual bird during strike rubber density 
1000 kg/m 3   was selected as the bird material This was reflected in the way the bird behaves in the impact. Titanium Alloy density  4420 kg/m 3  was chosen for the blade material  The bird was given a translational velocity of 150 m/s and the blade rotated at 2500 rpm. These values were chosen to replicate a worst-case scenario The resultant stress and deformation patterns of the blade and bird were obtained These patterns were compared with real bird-strike scenarios and available industry test data to establish the authenticity of the simulation.This article enables us to locate points of maximum deflection / stresses. By doing so, we can conclude whether the blade will undergo failure or not by comparing these stress values with the Ultimate Strength of

In February 1973, a Learjet 24 crashed shortly after take-off from De Kalb, Georgia, due to the avian ingestion by both engines resulting in the deaths of all 7 on board According to various surveys conducted in the past it has been 
observed that quieter aircrafts are more susceptible to avian ingestion specifically due their lack of warning Multiple measures have been taken to prevent these strikes from occurring. Both passive and active techniques have been used. In the passive method any sight of food water or shelter is removed near the airport area Meanwhile the active method uses external techniques such as pyrotechnics or even amplified sounds as a measure to disperse the birds  We can improve the aircrafts\325 turbine blades themselves by making them more resistant to bird strikes. In order to reach this goal, we have to initially predict the behavior of the bird when it collides with the blade Two materials have been identified to behave relative to the behavior of the bird upon impact gelatin and Room Temperature 
Vulcanized RTV rubber Both of these elements have fluid-like characteristics which closely replicates an actual bird\325s impact on an engine blade at high velocities  In the 1960's Allcock et al 3 studied the deflection of beams due to the impact of various soft objects including birds Based on a comparison of results they determined that gelatin projectiles and birds produced comparable loads during impact. It was also found that by varying impact velocity different types of deformation regimes can be identified elastic impact plastic impact hydrodynamic impact, impact at sonic velocities T sai et. al were the first to find a correlation between R TV   1 


rubber balls and cantilever beams  The impact of the bird striking the plate is thought to follow the hydrodynamic theory. In his thesis, Wilbeck J  discussed that the projectile and tar get can be treated as fluids and it is the material density that dominates instead of strength Stress waves propagate into the material, thus dissipating energy throughout the projectile and its target As the velocity of impact approaches or exceeds the wave velocity more energy must be dissipated in the local region of impact  In this shockwave region the initial pressure generated called the Hugoniot pressure has been effectively modeled by Wilbeck The leading face of bird deforms immediately up on impact and begins expanding radially to the contact surface In the simulation performed by Hopkins et al  the behavior of the bird was found to describe these models Elastic-plastic deformable body with low value of yield point and small hardening Hyper-elastic rubber-like body; Jelly structured body; easily spread over the blade Liquid body Particles of solid debris Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics flow  As found by Barber et al there are four distinct regimes of fluid flow during a bird impact. The first phase is the initial impact in which very high shock or Hugoniot pressures were generated. The second phase involves the decay of those very high shock pressures down to steady fluid dynamic flow pressures. The third phase is the phase where the bird material flows steadily onto the target and equivalent jet flow is established The fourth and last phase involves termination of the impact process and the return of the impact forces and pressures to zero  There are various complexities that arise while performing the simulation of the bird strike analysis This particular problem is hard to analyze as the loads are coupled to the response of the structure Added to this difficulty the impact is highly non-linear dynamic in nature The numerical instabilities involved in the computational processes are due to extremely high deformation and disintegration of bird during and after impact. In fact, Tho et al performed the bird strike on a rotor blade of a helicopter While doing their Finite Element Analysis FEA they realized that unlike implicit technique the explicit integration technique used while characterizing the impact is conditionally stable thus avoiding any numerical instability. Depending on the impact conditions the stress of the bird will likely exceed the yield strength in the constitutive model causing the bird model to behave as an elastic-plastic hydrodynamic flow   2.B IRD M ODELING M ETHODS  Majority of the research done while analyzing the bird strikes of aircraft components has been numerical in nature These methods include Lagrangian Euler Alternate Lagrangian Euler and Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics As a precursor to understanding these modeling techniques the works of Heimbs S have been analyzed  Lagrangian Model   In the Lagrangian mesh model the nodes of the model stay intact with the model itself when under impact. This is one of the key characteristics of the Lagrangian model as the boundary of the body can be distinctively defined by deformed nodes However this transient meshing can lead to extensive hour glassing during simulations as the mesh continually deforms with variation of time. Another disadvantage of using transient meshing scheme is that it can induce artificial stiffening of the element thus creating an additional impact pressure leading to incorrect result   Eulerian Model  While employing an Eulerian mesh the grid does not move like its counterpart: Lagrangian. Having a stationary grid not only eliminated the effects of artificial stiffening on the model rather decreases the effect the hourglassing an extemporaneous process that should be neglected The approach is best utilized for characterization of a fluid body under motion. As pointed out by Heimbs every element has its own volume fraction consisting of multiple elements such as a fluid However such modeling is also erroneous Since the boundary conditions require each element to be a composite of two different volume fractions, there cannot be concrete validation of the results obtained This is because there is no specific boundary defined and the results depend on the mesh size To prevent this error a coupled solver is used which employs both Eulerian and Lagrangian models for a fluid structure interaction The mesh in the classical Eulerian technique is fixed in space the corresponding computational domain should cover not only the region where the material currently exists but also additional void space to represent the region where material may exist at a later stage   Alternate Lagrangian - Eulerian Model  In an Alternate Lagrangian-Eulerian model ALE two different impactor boxes are created These Eulerian boxes are not fixed in space as the classical Eulerian model and can move around. An update of the mesh is continuously made with the change in impact velocity thus reducing the initial errors that persisted in the Lagrangian model Moreover allowing the background mesh to move in the same direction as the projectile, the number of elements for the computational domain is significantly reduced. This, in turn, affects the actual time of the simulation specifically when the required simulation deals with large distance movement with tremendous impact velocity. However, the only demerit of using the ALE model is that it is very much dependent on the mesh which is constantly being elongated and deformed These described models above are commonly used for soft-body impact which is what is assumed for the behavior of the bird when it is under impact    Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics  Now SPH Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics is a mesh less method introduced by Lucy inspired by Discrete  2 


Element Method In this an interpolation kernel of compact support is used to represent any field quantity as a disordered array of particles. Material is discretized and properties of cloud of nodes are associated with the center of the particles. A chosen interpolation kernel determines the amount of effect a known point value contributes to the point of interest. A comparative study of both of the ALE and SPH models has been done in the works of Ryabov et al and Goyal et al 1 1 In general compared to the Eulerian model, the SPH method requires fewer elements avoids the material interface problems associated with it and normally has a shorter solution time. This robustness is clearly seen when comparing the two models together without variation in the time step Comparison stated by Heimbs evaluated Lagrangian impactor and SPH modules. This showed a reduction by a factor of 10 observed for the SPH model In the survey performed by Heimbs he states that the lack of sharp boundaries which makes the application of boundary conditions difficult and may also affect the definition of fluid\320structure interaction is a disadvantage of the SPH method The so-called tension instability is identified as another weakness of the SPH method, which is referred to as the numerical collapse and unphysical clustering of the particles under tension due to negative pressures Additionally, due to lack of confined boundary, there has not  been any technique to formulate the pressure of the bird upon impact   3.N OMENCLATURE   D Diameter of the bird \\(m E bl Young\325s Modulus of Blade Material \(Pa L Length of the bir\d \(m L/D Aspect Ratio of the bird geometry u o Bird velocit\y \(m/s  o Bird density \(kg/m 3  P Pr\essure \(Pa P s Stagnation Pressure = \(1/2  o u o 2 Pa P n Normalised Pressure = Impact Pressure P s t Time \(s T n Normalized Time t  L   u o   1  2  Principal Stresses of blade material \(Pa Y Yield Stress of blade material \(Pa   Strain    4.M ETHODOLOGY  Since the focus of this work is on the behavior of the blade material during the bird strike, it was imperative to validate the bird model first Initial simulations aimed at validating the model were performed and the results of the same were compared with existing work Once a satisfactory agreement was established the work was extended to modeling the behavior of the bird and blade in conditions encountered during flight  Most of the research material available on bird strike analyses performed using computational methods involve the impact of the bird with a stationary plate. However, in this paper the authors have performed simulations in which the blade is given an angular velocity corresponding to the engine rpm during takeoff; to better understand the impact  Work carried out by Dar et al implemented an elastic-plastic material model coupled with maximum principal strain failure criterion They also employed the Von-Mises Yield criterion. In this the maximum principal strain criterion implies that if the maximum tensile principal strain exceeds the prescribed limit, then material will undergo failure. A similar approach has been used by the authors of this paper. Failure is predicted when either of the principal stress  1  and  2  equals or exceeds the maximum strain corresponding to the yield strength Y  of material in uniaxial tension or compression For yielding in tension the minimum principal strain   would equal the yield strain in uniaxial tension    5.I NITIAL V ALIDATION   Initial studies have been performed using two different types of birds: cylindrical \(with flat ends hemispherical ends Dimensions of the plate were 500mm x 500mm x 50mm while the bird had an aspect ratio of 3:1 in both cases Diameter of the bird was 100mm and its length was 300mm Initial test was performed using a cylindrical \(flat-ended bird. The dimensions and material properties are discussed in the following section   Cylindrical \(flat-ended\d model   Figure 1: Dimensions of the plate and the cylindrical bird   The figure above shows the dimensions of the plate and the bird. As we can see, the bird is a cylinder with flat ends  Table 1: Properties of the plate  Table 2: Properties of the bird  Material Density Mass Ti6Al4V 4420 kg/m 3 55.23 kg Material Density Mass Rubber 1000 kg/m 3 1.7 kg  3 


Hemispherical-ended bird model      Figure 2: Dimensions of the plate and the hemispherical-ended bird   The figure above shows the dimensions of the plate and the bird As we can see the bird is a cylinder with hemispherical ends. Also, it is to be noted that the aspect ratio \(L/D   Rubber, being a hyper-elastic material, follows the Ogden Model. This model suggests that the material behavior can be defined by a Strain-Energy Function, which comprises of various material constants that are unique to the material in question In the simulations Ogden Model is employed while modeling the bird   For rubber, the Ogden Model Equation is as follows  3  W     k   k    1  1   2  2   3  3 3 1  k=1  where W                                        Strain Energy density Function  k   k  Material Constants  1   2   3  Principal Stretches   Table 3: Ogden Model Constants for Rubber   Ti6A14V the plate has been modeled using the Mie Gr\237neisen Equation of State which is employed to determine pressure in a solid compressed by shock The Equation of State is as follows   P    C o 2   1-0.5  o     o E            \(2 2\(1-s   2  where P                                                                        \      Pressure C o  Bulk speed of sound E   Internal Energy  o Gr\237neisen's Parameter  i Initial Density   Current Density  s Linear Hugonoit Slope Coefficient   1  i     Table 4 Gr\237neisen's and other Parameters for Ti6A14V  All the simulations are based on the two models which have been discussed above   Behavior of bird at impact  The behavior of the bird was carefully studied during the validation simulations. The authors adopted the ALE Method in this paper, which has been discussed above      Figure 3: Hemispherical-ended bird on impact   Figure 3 clearly demonstrates the behavior of the bird when the impact has been modeled using the ALE technique. The deformation of the bird has been compared with Heimbs\325   Two sets of simulations were performed: One for the flatended bird and one for the hemispherical ended bird Velocity of the bird prior to impact was 175 m/s in both cases Graphs of pressure vs normalized time were obtained and a comparison was made between the two      Figure 4: Impact Pressure \(Y Axis Time \(X Axis   Figure 4 shows the variation of Pressure with Normalized Time Pressure for the flat-ended bird is indicated by the broken blue line and pressure for the hemispherical ended bird is indicated by the solid red line We see that the hemispherical ended bird has one major peak while the cylindrical ended bird has two.

obtained by S. Meguid et. al where the graphs were obtained for different bird geometries and aspect ratios   Quantitative Validation of Impact Model  To validate the impact model quantitatively, a simulation was carried out based on V. Walvekar's work In this validation a simulation has been run based on the dimensions of the bird and plate given in the thesis. The properties of the plate and bird are changed.The plate is a 2.5mm thick Al 7075 T6 Plate \(Density = 2800 kg/m 3  and the bird is 1.8 kg \(Density of 950 kg/m 3 The bird strikes the plate with a velocity of 140 m/s   Figure 5: Dimensions of the bird and plate for validation  The simulations yielded a Maximum Von-Mises Stress of 570 MPa, while Walvekar obtained a Stress value of 484 MPa, on impact. The variation is about 16% and this can be attributed to the variation in density of the bird material chosen for the simulation   6.R ESULTS  AND D ISCUSSION  Now that the validation was complete the model was extended to the analysis of the fan blade material A Ti6A14V plate was modeled on CATIA V5. For both the simulation runs the blade was studied as a rectangular plate that was 15mm thick The bird was of the same material and dimensions as the hemispherical-ended bird used in the validation simulation  As mentioned earlier, most papers on bird strikes consider the collision of the bird on an impact plate. In this paper the authors have compared the stresses induced in 245 stationary blade 245 rotating blade  In both the cases to understand the worst-case implications of a bird strike on a fan blade, the trajectory of the bird prior to impact was perpendicular to the exposed plane of the blade. In actual conditions, this is not the case since the blades are modeled in such a way that very minimal area is exposed, to withstand Foreign Object Damage \(FOD     Bird Strike Simulation on Stationary Blade The simulation conditions for the stationary blade case were similar to those of the validation simulations The blade was kept stationary and was fixed at the bottom The bird was given a velocity of 150 m/s and the AUTODYN-3D Solver performed the computation, based on the Ogden Model for Rubber and Mie-Gr\237neisen Equation of State for Ti6A14V with the same set of material constants provided with the validation simulations.The end time for the simulation was 0.01s and the solver performed 10 7 cycles Figure 6: Bird Strike on Stationary Blade  at time 0 ms  Figure 7: Bird Strike on Stationary Blade  at time 1 ms  Figure 8: Deformation of the stationary plate after impact    5 


Bird Strike Simulation on Rotating Blade The simulation conditions for the rotating blade case were similar to those of the validation simulations The blade was given 2500 rpm, corresponding to the rpm of engine fan during takeoff. The bird was given a velocity of 150 m/s and the AUTODYN-3D Solver performed the computation, based on the Ogden Model \(for Rubber\and Mie- Gr\237neisen Equation of State \(for Ti6A14V\with the same set of material constants provided with the validation simulations The end time for the simulation was 0.01s and the solver performed 10 7 cycles  Figure 9: Bird Strike on Rotating blade \(at time 1 ms    Comparative Study  Figure 10: Normalised Pressure \(Y Axis Normalised Time \(X Axis   Figure 10 shows the variation of Normalised Pressure with Normalised Time. Pressure on the rotating blade \(in red solid line reaches a high peak on undergoing the collision with the bird in comparison to the pressure reached by the stationary blade broken blue line This can be attributed to the fact that the initial force exerted by the bird on both the blades at the instant of impact, despite being equal cause greater pressure peaks in the rotating blade since the force acts on a very small area We can also observe that the rotating blade sees more fluctuation in pressures, when compared to the stationary blade  The impact pressures generated on both the stationary blade and the rotating blade were less than the Yield Stress of Ti6A14V \(880 MPa   7.C ONCLUSIONS  Based on the simulations carried out the authors would like to make certain suggestions on bird strike analyses on jet engine fan blades 245 Firstly, it is very important to extend the work done on stationary plates to rotating plates. This will lead to more accurate prediction of the behavior of the blade material to bird impacts 245 Secondly the blade profile used in this paper is a simple rectangular plate The same work done by the authors will be extended to various fan blade profiles to study their response to bird strikes 245 Thirdly, to study worst-case conditions, the authors have used rubber as the bird material, which has a density of 1000kg/m 3  Birds generally have a density less than that of rubber      8.F UTURE S COPE  More research on bird strikes would be carried out by the authors following a similar approach As discussed earlier simulations involving more accurate fan blade profiles would be run and the impact of the bird with different orientations to the blade would be studied The authors also plan to extend this work to study the cascading effect where the response of a set of fan blades to a bird strike would be studied in detail    A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The authors would like to extend their gratitude to the School of Mechanical and Building Sciences VIT University Tamil Nadu India The authors would also like to thank the personnel of the 322Product Design Laboratory\323 for all their support    R EFERENCES  1  John Thorpe Fatalities and destroyed civil aircraft due to bird strikes 1912 2002 Technical Report IBSC26/WP-SA1, International Bird Strike Committee, Warsaw, May 2003   W ilbeck J 322Impact behavior of low strength projectiles.\323 United States Air Force Material Laboratory, June 1977   A W  R Allcock and D N Collin The development of a Dummy Bird for Use In Bird Strike Research National Gas Turbine Establishment London England CP-1071, June 1968  4 G  H o p k i n s  a n d H  K o l s k y   M e c h a n i c s o f Hypervelocity Impact of Solids Proceedings of the Fourth Symposium on Upper-velocity Impact Air Proving Ground , Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, T9HU   6

4.4 Scalability of DARE Data Reduction 
In order to better evaluate the scalability of DARE on larger backup datasets we have implemented the schemes of Stream-Informed Delta Compression SIDC  2  in SiLo  20  a memory-ef cient near-exact deduplication system that exploits the backup-stream similarity and locality As introduced in Section 2.1 SIDC only detects resemblance in the backup-stream locality-preserved cache that can reduce the indexing overhead of SFs and scales well in large-scale deduplication system Thus we employ their method to assess the scalability of different resemblance detection schemes and implement SiLo with a 20MB locality cache similar to SIDC  2  with a se gment size of 1MB The stream-informed approaches are denoted by the Cached/Cac preìx in Table 4 and Figure 5 The rst column under a dataset Freq or Less in Table 4 shows the percentages of data reduction and the second column shows the data reduction factor the ratio of before/after data reduction Since SiLo achieves nearly 99 deduplication efìciency of the exact deduplication i.e full index in memory while requiring substantially less memory overhead about 1/250 of the exact deduplication approach for ngerprint indexing  20  we only discuss the results of resemblance detection after SiLoês deduplication here in Table 4  As shown in Table 4  resemblance detection further reduces the storage space after the deduplication process by a factor of about 2.5 meaning that we can save about 60 of the post-deduplication storage space by resemblance-detecting post-deduplication chunks DARE achieves a superior data reduction efìciency on both datasets while the cached SF-2F and SF-4F schemes detect less resemblance which is consistent with the results on our real-world datasets summarized in Table 3  Table 4 also shows that the cached SF-2F and SF-4F schemes fail to detect a noticeable amount of resemblance due to the sometimes weak or lack thereof locality in the backup stream as the limitations of the stream-informed cache approach  2  To further understand the scalability of DARE Figure 5 shows the percentages of resemblance detected by its DupAdj detection and by the SF-2F and SF-4F approaches showing the individual contributions by the SF the SF and the SF on the two synthesized datasets DupAdj is very effective and efìcient in detecting resemblance in the deduplication system with abundant duplicate-adjacency information i.e dedupe factor 2 leaving DAREês improved super-feature approach very little smaller than 1 if any additional resemblance to detect see the DARE bars Figure 6 shows that DARE achieves the highest throughputs among all the approaches compared running on both RAID-structured HDDs and the SSD Cached SF-4F has the lowest throughput

Intuitively delta compression should slow down the data-restore performance of a data-reduction system since it needs to restore the resembling chunks by two reads one for the delta data and the other for the base-chunk and then delta decode them But in our evaluation of the restore operations for resembling chunks we nd that the speed of delta decode i.e Xdelta  8  tends to be v ery f ast about 1GB/s in the DARE system Another interesting observation is that for a restoration cache of a given size with a delta chunk and its based chunk  DARE actually caches more logical content of the two chunks and than a deduplication-only system and thus improves the datarestore performance by virtual of the enlarged restoration cache due to delta compression Figures 7\(a and 8\(a show that DARE on average doubles the data-restore speed of the deduplication-only system both running on the RAID Figures 7\(b and 8\(b clearly show that the reason lies in the fact that DARE reads half as many containers for restoration as the deduplicationonly system The superior data-restore performance of SF-2F and SF-4F to the deduplicationonly system is attributed to their data reduction efìciency see Tables 3 and 4  Since the restoreperformance for the other six datasets is similar to and consistent with that of the Less dataset they are omitted to save space The sudden increase in the data-restore performance of the deduplicationonly approach at the backup version 17 Figure 8\(a we observe is due to the fact that most of the backed-up sources targeted for restoration are from the current and recent backups and thus have fewer random reads for restoration

In this paper we present DARE a deduplication-aware low-overhead resemblance detection and elimination scheme for delta compression on the top of deduplication on backup datasets DARE uses a novel resemblance detection approach DupAdj which exploits the duplicate-adjacency information for efìcient resemblance detection in existing deduplication systems and employs an improved super-feature approach to further detecting resemblance when the duplicate-adjacency information is lacking or limited Our preliminary results on the data-restore performance suggest that supplementing delta compression to deduplication can effectively enlarge the logical space of the restoration cache but the data fragmentation in data reduction systems remains a serious problem  19  W e plan to further study and improve the data-restore performance of storage systems based on deduplication and delta compression in our future work This work was supported in part by National Basic Research 973 Program of China under Grant No 2011CB302301 NSFC No 61025008 61173043 and 61232004 863 Project 2013AA013203 US NSF under Grants IIS-0916859 CCF-0937993 CNS-1116606 and CNS-1016609 This work was also supported by Key Laboratory of Information Storage System Ministry of Education China

method increases slightly which is due to two reasons 1 the data before In this experiment we investigate the performance of OLTP queries when OLAP queries are running The workload is update-only and the keys being updated are uniformly distributed We launch ten clients to concurrently submit the updates when the system is deployed on 100 nodes Each client starts ten threads each of which submits one million updates 100 updates in batch Another client is launched to submit the data cube slice query That is one OLAP query and approximately 50,000 updates are concurrently processed in R-Store The system reaches its maximum usage in this setting based on our observation When the system is deployed on other number of nodes the number of clients submitting updates is adjusted accordingly Figure 11\(a shows the throughput of the system The throughput increases as the number of nodes increases which demonstrates the scalability of the system However when OLAP queries are running the update performance is lower than running only OLTP queries This result is expected because the OLAP queries compete for resources with the OLTP queries We also evaluate the latency of updates when the system is approximately fully used As shown in Figure 11\(b the aggregated response time for 1000 updates are similar with respect to varying scales VII C ONCLUSION MapReduce is a parallel execution

Querying    Fig 8 Accuracy of Cost Model    Fig 9 Performance vs Freshness On each HBase-R node the key/values are stored in format Though only one or two versions of the same key are returned to MapReduce HBase-R has to scan all the of the table Since the is materialized to HDFS when it is full these 223les are sorted by time Thus instead of scanning all the and between  only the between   are scanned The value of decides the freshness of the result There is a trade-off between the performance of the query and the freshness of the result the smaller is the fewer real-time data are scanned Figure 9 shows the query processing time with different freshness ratios which is de\223ned as the percentage of the real-time data we have to scan for the query In this experiment  1600 million and 800 million updates on 1 distinct keys are submitted to HBase-R When the freshness ratio is 0 the input of the query is only the data cube Thus the cost of scanning the real-time data is 0 When the freshness ratio increases to 10 the cost of scanning the real-time data is around 1500 seconds because the cost of scanning the real-time table dominates the OLAP query As the freshness ratio increases the running time of and  and when it is not  and  We submit 800 million updates to the server each day and the percentage of keys updated is 223xed to 1 The data cube is refreshed at the beginning of each day and the OLAP query is submitted to the server at the end of the day Since the data are compacted after the data cube refresh the amount of data stored in the real-time table are almost the same at the same time of each day The processing time of and are thus almost constant In contrast when the compaction scheme is turned off HBase-R stores much more data and the cost of locally scanning these data becomes larger than the cost of shuf\224ing the data to MapReduce As a result the processing time of and increases over time and and a user speci\223ed timestamp still need to be scanned and 2 the amount of data shuf\224ed to mappers are roughly the same with different ratios Figure 10 depicts the effectiveness of our compaction scheme In this experiment we measure the

the data scanned by MapReduce are unchanged during the execution of a MapReduce job In reality the real-time results from the most recently updated data are more meaningful for decision making In this paper we propose R-Store for supporting real-time OLAP on MapReduce R-Store leverages stable technology HBase and HStreaming and extends them to achieve high performance and scalability The storage system of R-Store adopts multi-version concurrency control to support real-time OLAP To reduce the storage requirement it periodically materializes the real-time data into a data cube and compacts the historical versions into one version During query processing the proposed adaptive incremental scan operation shuf\224es the real-time data to MapReduce ef\223ciently The data cube and the newly updated data are combined in MapReduce to return the real-time results In addition based on our proposed cost model the more ef\223cient query processing method is selected To evaluate the performance of R-Store we have conducted extensive experimental study using the TPCH data The experimental results show that our system can support real-time OLAP queries much more ef\223ciently than the baseline methods Though the performance of OLTP degrades slightly due to the competition for resources with OLAP the response time and throughput remain good and acceptable A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described
