Abstract\227 Ef\002cient and fast processing of spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar 050SAR\051 data is becoming increasingly important in many applications such as surveillance and disaster recovery Moreover constellations of satellites generate a huge amount of data and standard toolchains may not cope well with them Dedicated architectures have been used in the past but they are hard to maintain from both the hardware and software points of view In this paper we present SAR focusing algorithms for the COSMO-SkyMed constellation of satellites based on established techniques

Radar 050SAR\051 system provides an active all-weather day and night penetrating remote sensing mean and produces high resolution complex 050amplitude and phase\051 images of the land under illumination of radar beam Unlike optical sensors the SAR system needs a post-processing procedure on the data acquired to form the 002nal image For decades Synthetic Aperture Radar 050SAR\051 imaging from satellites techniques have been used to represent radar data in a way that is meaningful to a human analyst The calculations necessary for these imaging techniques are computationally complex and since the advent of SAR computational throughput has always been a critical factor in the development implementation and use of processing algorithms In a few words SAR processing is a computationally intensive technique which is used for creating images from radar signals gathered by a moving platform such as an aircraft By combining signals gathered from multiple points in space  978-1-4799-1622-1/14 31  00 c 015 2014 IEEE 050multiple angles of azimuth and elevation\051 higher resolution images can be constructed without needing a larger physical antenna The computational load increases with the image size and the amount of data and so techniques for accelerating the processing of the input radar signals and generating the output images are necessary to be able to process the large amount of data in real time Our goal is real time processing of Cosmo-SkyMed satellites data which means that the volume of data which SAR processors have to deliver necessitates very fast and very ef\002cient processing mainly to enable fast decision making With the continuous advance of computational power provided by CPUs and DSPs imaging routines have become faster and faster over the years Chip makers however have reached a clock-speed plateau as processors with increasingly high transistor densities are no longer able to dissipate the heat associated with increasingly high clock speeds This heat dissipation challenge has led to the recent trend away from ever-increasing clock speeds and instead has resulted in an explosion of multi-core commercial-grade processors Multicore processors offer the potential for extremely high throughput with the ability to achieve such results depending greatly on the nature of the computations being performed Due to the rapid growth of the computational capacity of Graphics Processing Units 050GPUs\051 over the past decade researchers are increasingly using these emerging architectures to accelerate high performance applications GPUs are characterized by hundreds of self-suf\002cient but simple processors each with several execution units and support high computational throughput for data-parallel algorithms Following high-quality software interfaces for general purpose graphics processor programming such as NVIDIA CUDA released in 2007 numerous studies have demonstrated the tremendous bene\002t of using GPUs as accelerators for tasks decomposable to the same operations performed on different chunks of data 2 R ELATED W ORK To the best of authors knowledge interesting preliminary works on SAR data from satellites processors based on GPU platform equal or very similar to the one here adopted can be found in 6 and 7 These implementations ha v e been tested on relatively small sample images and if scaled demonstrate comparable computational time with respect to the presented solution It is worth noting that our solution as stated in the previous chapter is dedicated to the processing of COSMO-SkyMed satellites data and has been tested on real COSMO-SkyMed sample data Another important peculiarity of our solution 1 


resides in the Doppler parameters estimation directly from the received SAR data that resulted to be crucial for obtaining even an acceptable image quality 3 COSMO-S KY M ED AND FOCUSING ALGORITHMS COSMO-SkyMed 050COnstellation of small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation\051 is the largest Italian investment in Space Systems for Earth Observation commissioned and funded by Italian Space Agency 050ASI\051 and Italian Ministry of Defense 050MoD\051 and it is natively conceived as a Dual-Use 050Civilian and Defence\051 end-to-end Earth Observation System aimed to establish a global service supplying provision of data products and services compliant with wellestablished international standards and relevant to a wide range of applications such as Risk Management Scienti\002c and Commercial Applications and Defence/Intelligence Applications The system consists of a constellation of four Low Earth Orbit mid-sized satellites each equipped with a multi-mode high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar 050SAR\051 operating at X-band and 002tted with particularly 003exible and innovative data acquisition and transmission equipment The constellation average daily acquisition capability of 1800 images acquired in a 24 hours moving window 05075 Spotlight plus 375 Stripmap or ScanSAR for each satellite\051 drives the necessity to drastically improve the ef\002ciency of SAR image formation especially in view of the commissioning of the second COSMO-SkyMed generation satellites The COSMOSkyMed sensor imaging operating modes considered in this work are the stripmap and the spotlight The Stripmap mode which is the most common imaging mode is obtained by pointing the antenna along a 002xed direction with respect to the satellite 003ight path The antenna footprint covers a strip on the illuminated surfaces as the satellite moves and the system operates The acquisition is virtually unlimited in the azimuth direction except for the limitations deriving from the SAR instrument duty cycle 050about 600 s allowing a strip length of 4500 km\051 In this mode the radar Tx/Rx con\002gurations are time invariant allowing receiving from each ground scatterer the full Doppler bandwidth allowed by the azimuth aperture of the antenna beamwidth The stripmap mode is characterized by a swath width of about 40 km an azimuth extension for the standard product 050square frame\051 of about 40 Km 050corresponding to an acquisition of about 6.5 s\051 Pulse Repetition Frequency 050PRF\051 values ranging from a minimum of 2905.9 Hz to a maximum of 3874.5 Hz a chirp duration in the range 35 026 s a chirp bandwidth accommodated along range on the basis of the required ground resolution 050typically equal to 3 m\051 spanning from 65,64 MHz at the far range 050with a sampling rate of 82.50 MHz\051 to 138,60 MHz at the far range 050with a sampling rate of 176.25 MHz\051 The spotlight mode in which the antenna is steered 050both in the azimuth and the elevation plane\051 during the overall acquisition time in order to illuminate the required scene for a time period longer than the one of the standard stripmap increasing the length of the synthetic antenna and therefore the azimuth resolution 050at expense of the azimuth coverage\051 is characterized by an azimuth frame extension of about 11 km a range swath extension of about 11 Km PRF values ranging from a minimum of 3148.1 Hz to a maximum of 4116.7 Hz allowed chirp duration in the range 70 026 s 050depending on speci\002c access area\051 a chirp bandwidth accommodated along range on the basis of the required ground resolution 050typically Figure 1  RDA and  K 003ows equal to 1 m\051 ranging from 185.2 MHz to 400.0 MHz and 002nally a sampling frequency equal to 187.5 MHz Several algorithms can be used to process COSMO-SkyMed Stripmap and Spotlight data In this work the RangeDoppler Algorithm 050RDA\051 and the  k algorithm have been implemented They are both based on the compression of linearly frequency modulated signals 050chirp\051 along the range and azimuth directions using a matched 002lter in the frequency domain While the chirp in the range direction is generated by the radar antenna itself the chirp along the azimuth direction appears due to the Doppler effect 050synthetic aperture\051 caused by the change of relative speed between the radar and the targets As illustrated in Figure 1 the two algorithms differ in the sequence of operations with the RDA needing an additional Range Cell Migration Correction 050RCMC\051 step that is taken care by the reference function mutliplication in the  k algorithm Section 5 gives a more in-depth description of the algorithms from the point of view of the implementation for more on details theoretical aspects see 4 GPU S AND CUDA A modern Graphic Processing Unit 050GPU\051 can be used as a General Purpose computing device that acts as an accelerator for certain applications with respect to the normal Central Processing Unit i.e a microprocessor core 050or multi-core\051 The accelerator looks like an Input/Output unit to the rest of the system so it communicates using I/O commands and DMA memory transfers Internally a GPU consists of many parallel processor cores in the order of several hundreds or even up to some thousands of a 050usually large\051 memory and wide interconnection busses to improve data transfer performance In our project we used an nVidia Tesla C1060 GPU which has 240 parallel cores and 4 GByte of own memory 050called the device memory to distinguish it from the main memory of the host computer\051 The parallel cores are grouped into several multiprocessors  with each of them having also a small internal SRAM shared among all cores belonging to it used to cache the large device memory or to enable fast communication between cores This memory is called shared memory and ef\002ciently exploiting it 2 


Figure 2  Tesla C1060 internal block diagram often has a huge favorable impact on performance Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a GPU architecture in a Tesla C1060 each multiprocessor contains 8 parallel cores and an additional double precision unit while newer architectures have 16 cores that can be combined in pairs to perform 64-bit 003oating point operations The execution model is based on threads that are run by each core Within a multiprocessor all cores execute the same thread on different data much like a Single Instruction Multiple Data 050SIMD\051 parallel machine but data dependent execution is handled in a slightly different way Threads can be suspended maybe because they make a slow memory access and other thread executed with the context switch taking basically no time Thus by having multiple concurrent threads the computational resources can be effectively exploited The programming model called CUDA 050Compute Uni\002ed Device Architecture\051 is based on the execution of kernels  each divided into a number of threads which are further grouped into blocks within a user de\002nable grid A programmer has to identify those parts of a program that could be best implemented on the accelerator by exposing the parallelism to ef\002ciently exploit the architecture Kernels are written in C language but the same C description cannot be compiled as is for the host processor so there is an additional effort in porting an application to use a GPU accelerator Fortunately GPU manufacturers often provide a set of high level library functions that are carefully optimized for the hardware accelerator and implement many common algorithms found in computing intensive applications For instance in our case we took advantage of the CUDA cuFFT library that provides Fast Fourier Transform 050FFT\051 functions for 1 2and 3-dimensional arrays However for application speci\002c computation dedicated parallel kernels were developed 5 I MPLEMENTED T OOLS Two kind of processor were implemented one using the Range-Doppler algorithm the other with the  k algorithm Both algorithms were brie\003y presented in Section 3 from a theoretical point of view here their parallel implementation on the GPU hardware is analysed with additional details on the low level choices in algorithm implementation All tools have been applied to raw data from the CosmoSkyMed constellation and the output is in the Slant-range Complex Single-look 050SCS\051 format Ground projection as well as higher level products were also implemented but are outside the scope of this paper Both the raw data and the outputs are in the Hierarchical Data Format Version 5 050HDF5 see for details\051 and a freely a v ailable library has been used for reading and writing 002les The tools also support data in CEOS raw format with only small differences in the loading and writing phases with respect to the HDF5 version Simple procedures for reading and writing 002les have been implemented but details are omitted here All the following discussions assume that enough memory is available on the GPU hardware to hold an entire image and the necessary temporary buffers If this is not the case slicing of the image in the range and/or azimuth directions is required with decreased performance due to the overhead for data transfers between the host and device memories The image is also zero-padded in both the range and azimuth directions to make the two lengths multiples of the four prime numbers 2 3 5 and 7 this is to ensure that the FFT functions used operate at the best of their performance Range-Doppler Algorithm 050RDA\051 As discussed previously the Range-Doppler algorithm performs two separate compressions in the range direction and in the azimuth direction with the additional Range Cell Migration Correction performed in the doppler domain Key to the accuracy and resolution of the 002nal result is the correct estimation of several parameters like the doppler frequency and the azimuth FM rate As these values are not constant within an image polynomial models have been used to characterize their variations and the model parameters are directly derived from the image data itself The input to the algorithm is a W 002 H image with complex numbers in 32-bit 003oating point format 050i.e 8 bytes for each pixel 4 for the real part and 4 for the imaginary part\051 This image corresponds to the samples received by the SAR antenna for each of the H transmitted pulses with the high frequency carrier already removed on-board the spacecraft Many additional ancillary data are also present in the image 002le and some of them are extracted for the subsequent processing steps Among the available data are biasing and antenna pattern values that allow to correct the received samples to get a higher signal to noise ratio Both corrections are carried out using dedicated parallel kernels that operate on pixel values directly Range Compression\227 The 002rst step of the algorithm consists in the convolution of each range row with a matched 002lter that depends upon the chirp used during signal transmission Chirp samples are contained in the raw image data and are extracted during the loading phase and stored into a one dimensional array Convolution is performed in the frequency domain as the complex product of the spectrum of each range scan line with the conjugate of the spectrum of the chirp So for each line an FFT a complex multiplication and an inverse FFT are required 3 


The Nvidia CUDA CuFFT library already provides highly optimized functions to perform Fast Fourier Transforms The library which is extensively used throughout the remaining of the algorithm requires the initial de\002nition of a plan which contains all the relevant information for the transformation such as the number of samples and the direction of the transformation An additional parameter is the number of concurrent FFTs to perform called batch  as computation is parallelized over hundreds of cores increasing the opportunities to exploit parallelism is very important to improve performance In practice it turns out that an 8192 sample FFT takes roughly the same amount of time as a batch of 8 concurrent 8192 sample FFTs higher values for the batch parameter lead to a linear increase in the running time Therefore in our implementation three plans were de\002ned two of them have the batch parameter equal to H  and differ only for the direction of the transformation 050forward and inverse respectively\051 The third one is a forward FFT of a single line which is applied to a zero padded version of the chirp extended to the same size of a range scan line The entire image is initially forward transformed with a single call of the FFT library function As the raw data is not needed anymore the transformation is in-place to save memory Then the complex multiplication takes place a dedicated pointwise kernel has been developed to perform it in parallel Finally a second in-place FFT this time in the inverse direction is applied to the whole image to return to the spatial domain The original image is thus lost and only the range compressed image is kept for the subsequent processing steps Doppler parameters estimation\227 The synthetic aperture radar concept is based on the Doppler effect that changes the frequency of the transmitted signals as the spacecraft moves with respect to ground targets A good knowledge of doppler paramteres is therefore of paramount importance to achieve the highest possible resolution along the azimuth direction In principle doppler parameters can be computed from the relative geometry of the radar and target system However while this is a common practice for airborne SARs the resulting accuracy for a satellite is often not adequate enough as not only the satellite speed and attituted should be precisely known but also Earth rotation and curvature should be taken into account Hence estimation of the doppler parameters from the received data is required Two main parameters are estimated using three distinct procedures that share many similar processing steps 017 Doppler centroid the doppler frequency for a ground target when the satellite is at closest approach This value is 0 for a SAR with an antenna perfectly orthogonal to the 003ight path and it is non-zero otherwise The estimation is divided in two phases 002rst the fractional part of the doppler frequency with respect to the Pulse Repetition Frequency 050PRF\051 is computed then the integer part also known as the ambiguity number M amb is estimated 017 Azimuth FM rate the rate of change of the doppler frequency along the azimuth direction This value is necessary to derive the correct matched 002lter for the subsequent azimuth compression step In all cases the estimated values vary slowly with the image location Therefore for the estimation process the image itself is divided into several contiguous small blocks paramFigure 3  Matrix transposition with memory coalescing in reading and writing eters are computed for each individual block and a smooth polynomial 002tting surface is then obtained using the NelderMead method initialized with data obtained from geometical and orbital parameters This procedure has the added bene\002t that any error in the estimation process on a block is averaged with the other blocks resulting in better accuracy Most computations in the estimation processes are carried out in the range-doppler domain i.e in the spatial domain for the range direction and in the frequency domain for the azimuth direction Unfortunately FFT functions in the CUDA library do not provide a stride parameter so the samples of the arrays to be transformed need to be contiguous in memory Transposition of individual blocks or of the entire image is hence needed before applying the FFT In order to be ef\002cient parallel matrix transposition should exploit the memory access capabilities of the GPU hardware In particular many main memory transactions should be grouped or coalesced  in a single wider transaction to optimize access time In a straightforward parallel implementation of transposition each thread reads one piece of data from the source matrix and writes it to the destination buffer However due to the matrix memory layout coalescing is possible either while reading data or while writing it but not in both cases at the same time An alternative implementation uses shared memory to accomplish the same task while exploiting coalescing in main memory in both reading and writing Threads are divided in an n 002 n matrix each thread reads a value from an n 002 n block in the source image and stores it transposed in a temporary buffer in shared memory Shared memory is much faster than main memory and coalescing is not needed while reading from main memory enjoys coalescing because threads reads contiguous data Once the temporary buffer is completely 002lled in the destination main memory image is written The destination block is in a transposed location with respect to the source block and threads are organized to store data contiguous in memory thus achieving coalescing also in writing The trick is that a thread reads a value but writes another one read by the transposed thread in the matrix Figure 3 shows an example for the block at location 0502,1\051 with n  8  and with the details for the threads of the third row they all read contiguous data and then write contiguous data as well 4 


Having covered some of the common functions used in the doppler parameters estimation the three individual procedures can be analysed in more details Fractional Doppler centroid estimation   the range compressed image is divided into a number of blocks with a user de\002ned size For each block the Doppler centroid fractional part is estimated as the peak of the Doppler magnitude spectrum As the spectrum for a single azimuth line in a block is very noisy the magnitude is averaged over all lines of the block then its maximum is found by convolving it with a power 002lter with a sinusoidal shape and by looking for the zero crossing The detailed steps for each block are the following 1  The power 002lter is generated and its Fourier transform computed 2  2  The block is transposed to get the azimuth direction in the rows and then rows are transformed to the frequency 050doppler\051 domain using FFTs in batches equal to the block height 3  The magnitude of each azimuth line is computed and the average of all lines gives the doppler power specturm In both cases pointwise parallel kernels were developed to increase performance 4  The power spectrum is further transformed using a forward FFT multiplied with the power 002lter transform to perform the convolution and 002nally inverse transformed to get back to the doppler domain 5  The zero crossing of the convolution is determined on the host as this computation is not time critical because it involves a single line Once all blocks are completed a 002rst order polynomial surface is 002tted to the fractional centroid values such that the 002nal outcome of the procedure is given by d frac  d 0  d 1 r  d 2 a  d 3 ra where r and a are coordinates on the range and azimuth directions respectively A second order polynomial model can also be used with very few modi\002cations and a slightly higher running time Before 002tting the signal to noise ratio of the average power spectrums are also computed and potentially inaccurate values are removed Azimuth FM rate estimation   again the range compressed image is divided into user de\002ned blocks possibly with a different size with respect to the fractional doppler centroid estimation procedure Each block is transformed in the doppler domain and decomposed into two looks with nonoverlapping spectrum In turn each look is separately compressed along the azimuth axis using a nominal FM rate K a derived from orbital data In case the nominal FM rate is not precise enough it results in a mis-registration of the two compressed looks and the amount of mis-registration gives the error on the FM rate Averaging over all range lines in the block allows to reduce noise and achieve a better accuracy The implemented steps are thus as follows 1  The block is transposed to get the azimuth direction in the rows and then rows are transformed to the frequency 050doppler\051 domain using FFTs in batches equal to the block height 3  2  The block is compressed along the azimuth direction using a matched 002lter derived from the nominal FM rate Compression is obtained by the complex multiplication with  2 The power 002lter is identical for all blocks and it is computed only once 3 If the block size is the same as the one used for the fractional Doppler centroid estimation this step can be shared with step 2 of the previous procedure with a considerable saving in running time the transformed matched 002lter and the result is kept in the doppler domain at this stage Notice that the matched 002lter is computed for each azimuth line separately as the coef\002cients change from one scan line to another 3  The Doppler spectrum is divided in two looks that are separately inverse transformed back to the spatial domain The magnitude of each look is also computed 4  The mis-registration along the range direction of the two magnitude looks is computed using their mutual crosscorrelation To implement this step looks are transposed transformed complex multiplied and transformed back The average of all range lines is computed to reduce noise 5  The maximum of the cross-correlation is computed on the host processor Its position gives the amount of FM rate error 001 K a for the block A 002rst order polynomial model is used also in this case to get a smoothly varying FM rate over the entire image The Nelder-Mead algorithm is started with the nominal FM rate with the average FM rate error from all blocks already added to improve convergence Integer Doppler centroid estimation   the last doppler parameter that is estimated is the integer part M amb of the Doppler centroid The procedure is similar to the FM rate estimation as it is based on detecting the mis-registration in the range direction of multiple looks However contrary to the technique described above it starts from the range-doppler image rather than the range compressed one Therefore the entire image needs to be transformed along the azimuth direction To avoid allocating memory for the transposed image the operation is carried out in vertical slices a slice is 002rst transposed in a temporary buffer a batch of FFTs equal to the number of lines in the transposed buffer is applied and then the slice is written back in its original position by transposing it again Afterwards the integer Doppler centroid is estimated using the following steps 1  The estimated fractional part of the Doppler frequency is used to determine the vertical location of the maximum of the Doppler power spectrum 2  The image is divided in slices 4  and for each slice a set of pair of looks symmetric with respect to the maximum of the Doppler power spectrum are de\002ned at increasing distances from the estimated maximum 3  Each look is compressed in the azimuth direction by multiplying it with the frequency domain matched 002lter and transforming it back to spatial domain The magnitude of each look is computed 4  Magnitudes of compressed looks are compared in pairs to determine the range mis-registration The displacement is computed by 002nding the maximum of the cross-correlation averaged over all the lines of the looks to reduce noise The cross-correlation is upscaled by a factor of 4 to get a higher accuracy Pairs that are further away with respect to the maximum of the Doppler power spectrum show a linearly increasing displacement where the rate of increase is related to the doppler frequency 5  A 002tting 002rst order surface without the mutual r 001 a term is computed and the integer part of the Doppler frequency is determined as the coef\002cient along the range direction rounded to the lower integer value A graphical representation of this procedure is illustrated in Figure 4 for a single slice of the image with the detected displacements shown on the graph on the right-hand side When all slices are considered a plane rather than a approximating straight line is computed  4 These are different and typically larger than slices used to transform the image in the Range-Doppler domain 5 


Figure 4  Integer Doppler frequency determination For all three estimation procedures a magnitude based method has been adopted The literature also contains several phase based methods which were in some cases also implemented However the ones presented here gave the best results from both an accuracy and a performance point of view so the others are not analysed After estimations are over the image is in the Range-Doppler domain as it was transformed during the evaluation of the doppler ambiguity number If estimations are skipped the azimuth FFT using coalesced transposition and slicing is carried out anyway as it is necessary for the next steps in the algorithm Range Cell Migration Correction 050RCMC\051\227 Range cell migration occurs because the distance 050range\051 between the antenna and a target changes along the 003ight path This effect must be compensated or otherwise severe smearings appear in the the 002nal focussed image This is best achieved in the Doppler domain as the spectrum for a target is also skewed with the amount of skew depending on the effective doppler frequency Hence RCMS usually consists in a remapping of samples in the range-doppler domain using some sort of interpolation mechanism Key to an accurate RCMC is the precise knowledge of the doppler centroid given by both the integer and the fractional parts estimated in the previous steps The correction is hence computed using the available models Remapping is along the range direction only and has been implemented in two user-selectable ways 017 Using a nearest neighborhood method to achieve high performance with a slightly less accurate correction 017 Using a weighted sinc interpolator for maximum accuracy In both cases a GPU kernel performs the correction one range line at a time concurrently for all pixels of each line The result oevrwirtes the initial image so that at the end of processing a corrected range-doppler array is available Azimuth compression\227 The last step in the algorithm performs the 002nal compression along the azimuth direction Contrary to the matched 002lter in range that is extracted from the chirp data for azimuth compression the matched 002lter must be properly computed and it depends on both the accurate estimations of the doppler centroid and of the azimuth FM rate Moreover it changes with range so different 002lters are used for each azimuth scan line As the image is already in the doppler domain compression corresponds to a complex multiplication followed by a last inverse FFT To reduce the number of transposition the matched 002lter is computed directly in the frequency domain along range lines and complex multiplication directly applied This is performed using two successive parallel kernels but they can in principle be grouped into a single one The 002nal IFFT uses the usual coalesced transposition followed by a batch of IFFTs and terminated with a last coalesced transposition that overwrites the initial data The resulting image is therefore in Slant-range projection and all pixels carry a complex data To visualize it the magnitude for each pixel must be computed  k Algorithm Contrary to the RDA the  k algorithm performs all compressions and corrections within the frequency domain in both the range and azimuth directions and it is able to achieve better accuracy for large antenna squint angles The complexity is comparable to the Range-Doppler algorithm and many of the processing steps are shared with it so they will simply be referenced here rather than repeated In principle as described in Section 3 the  k algorithm consists in a two dimensional FFT the product with the reference function followed by the differential Stolt interpolation and a concluding two dimensional inverse FFT However our implementation of fractional and integer doppler centroid parameter estimations requires a range compressed and a rangedoppler image respectively While in RDA these images are readinly available along the standard processing 003ow they must be appropriately created in the  k 003ow Hence the sequence of steps is different whether estimation of doppler parameters from received data is performed or not in the following the 003ow that includes estimations is considered with the other one being faster because it needs less domain transformations For the reasons outlined above the  k algorithm starts with range compression i.e a range FFT the chirp matched 002lter multiplication and a range IFFT Fractional doppler centroid estimation follows as the image is now in the range compressed state The integer doppler centroid estimation requires the image to be in the range-doppler domain so a coalesced transposition and an azimuth FFT are executed before invoking the estimation procedure Up to this stage the algorithm is actually identical to the RDA except that the doppler rate estimation is not performed as it is not needed in the following steps The RDA and  k algorithm diverge at this point As the image is currently in the range-doppler domain a forward range FFT is needed to transform it from range time to range frequency RDA does not need it as both RCMC and Azimuth compression are performed in the range-doppler domain The reference multiply and differential Stolt interpolation are then executed as described in the following paragraphs Reference function multiply\227 The complex reference function is computed for each range scan line with a parallel pointwise kernel using the estimated doppler centroid two dimensional 6 


model at a reference range corresponding to the middle of the image swath This function consists of a phase term only 050the magnitude is 1\051 and its full formulation includes a square root to improve performance the square root is actually implemented using its second order Taylor approximation with all intermediate computations carried out in double precision and the 002nal value converted to a single precision 003oating point complex value After computing the reference function a second pointwise kernel performs the actual complex multiplication and this is repeated for all range lines in the image The 002nal output is an image in both the range and azimuth frequency domain which is correctly focused at midrange but still has a residual error along the range frequency direction due to how the reference function has been computed Note that the reference function multiplication is applied to an already range compressed image rather than the original one transformed in the two dimensional frequency domain The reason is that parameter estimations were carried out before this step However this is acceptable as this step is invariant with respect to range compression and allows us to save the memory required to store the original image while keeping the compressed one only Stolt interpolation\227 As the resiudal error after the reference function multiplication depends on range frequency rather than range time it can be eliminated with a mapping interpolation along the range frequency dimension This step called Stolt interpolation 002nally focuses the entire image Initially a vector containing the value of range frequencies is computed This is useful as the interpolation is azimuth dependent but range frequencies are not so they can be stored and reused for all lines without modi\002cations Then looping on all lines of the image a parallel kernel computes the amount of displacement of each range frequency as a 003oating point number again using an approximation of the exact function that includes a square root All displacements are stored in a vector in the device memory which is used as the input of an interpolation kernel that generates the new line using a nearest neightborhood approach A linear interpolation has also been implemented but it did not show an appreciable better accuracy in the 002nal result Following the Stolt interpolation the image is focused but still in the two dimensional frequency domain A range inverse FFT followed by a transposition and an azimuth inverse FFT brings the image back in the spatial domain where each pixel is a complex value in the Slant-range projection Similarly to the RDA a visible image is obtained by computing the magnitude at each pixel 6 E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS The entire system for focusing using both the Range-Doppler as well as the  K algorithm has been implemented on a Tesla C1060 GPU with 4 Gbyte of main memory on an Intel i7 host processor with 8 Gbyte of memory running a 64 bit Linux operating system The Cuda toolkit that was used was version 3.5 An example of focusing of a Stripmap image using the  k algorithm is presented in Figure 5 with the input and output images as well as an intermediate result transformed into Figure 6  Bulk compression without and with differential Stolt interpolation the spatial domain to show various processing levels The source raw data is at the top of the 002gure then a range compressed image used for parameter estimation follows The 002nal focused image is at the bottom Figure 6 shows an enlarged area after bulk compression but before differential Stolt interpolation on the top and after 002nal focusing on the bottom as the area has been selected away from mid-range the latter presents a better resolution The performance of some of the main steps are listed in Table 1 The transfer of a 1 GByte image from host to device memory 050or viceversa\051 takes around 270 ms with a throughput of more than 3.5 GByte/s The next two lines illustrate the performance of Fourier transforms and transpositions which are among the most used kernels in the system The range compression of a 16384 002 8192 image takes 330 ms 050including forward FFT complex multiplication and inverse FFT\051 while compression along the azimuth direction takes 3.9 s with an initial transposition forward FFT matched 002lter multiplication inverse FFT and 002nal transposition In general the FFT library achieves around 140 G\003ops performance The last line of the table shows the overall processing time for a 400 Mpixel input image with less than 20 s the equivalent throughput is around 20 Mpixel/s Timing performance are very similar for both the Range Doppler and  k algorithms The algorithms were applied to either Stripmap or Spotlight raw images from the Cosmo-SkyMed satellites with a resolution of 1 meter for Spotlight and 3 meters for Stripmap The running time also includes Doppler parameter estimations in 7

  15   module Trade studies of performance with respect to required delta chief orbit and the cost of ground operations support form important considerations in the design of the cluster architectures, and will be studied. Global designs will also need to consider the biome spread of the Earth so that the clusters are in optimal configuration when they fly over the appropriate biomes Finally this work can be extended to calculate many geophysical parameters beyond snow albedo such as vegetation GPP and radiative forcing of clouds to demonstrate the impact of improved BRDF using clusters on critical science application s  7  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   The authors are grateful to the following people for very useful discussions on the topics presented in this paper Warren Wiscombe  Jacqueline LeMoigne Alexis Lyapustin and Ralph Kahn from NASA GSFC Marco Sabatini from Universit\340 degli Studi di Trento in Italy David Miller from MIT and Thomas Hilker from Oregon State University   R EFERENCES   1   autonomous and distributed scatter manoeuvres for  Acta Astronaut vol. 82, no. 1, pp 95 109, Jan. 2013 2    System F6 Program Value-Centric Design  Proceedings of the AIAA Space Conference Anaheim, California, 2010 3  S Nag    crowdsourcing spaceflight software and STEM  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2012 4  S Nag   J   G  Katz   a n d  A   Saen z Oter o    STEM ed  Acta Astronaut  vol 83 no 0 pp 145 174 Feb 2013  5   spacecraft reorientation for earth orbiting clusters  Acta Astronaut vol. 53 no. 11, pp. 863 877, Dec. 2003 6   satellite systems for Multi-angular Multi-spectral  Proceedings of the 64th International Astronautical Congress  Beijing China, 2013 7   of Nano-satellite Cluster Formations for Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function  AIAAUSU Conf.
