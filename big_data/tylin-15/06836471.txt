the most common space solar power SSP system architectures solar energy harvested by large satellites in geostationary orbit is transmitted to Earth via microwave radiation Currently only limited information about the interactions of microwave beams with energy densities of several tens to hundreds of W/m 2 with the different layers of the atmosphere is available Governmental bodies will likely require detailed investigations of safety and atmospheric effects of microwave power beams before issuing launch licenses for SSP satellite systems This paper proposes to collect representative and comprehensive data of the interaction of power beams with the atmosphere by extending the infrastructure of the High Frequency Active Auroral Research Program HAARP facility in Alaska USA Estimates of the transmission infrastructure performance as well as measurement devices and scientic capabilities of possible upgrade scenarios will be discussed The proposed upgrade of the HAARP facility is expected to deliver a wealth of data and information which could serve as a decision base for governmental launch licensing of SSP satellites and which can be used in addition to deepen public acceptance of SSP as a large-scale renewable energy source T ABLE OF C ONTENTS 1 I NTRODUCTION                                   1 2 P OTENTIAL E FFECTS OF M ICROWAVE B EAMS IN A TMOSPHERE

SSP system designs consist of large photovoltaic modules in geostationary orbit which transfo rm sunlight to electricity The generated power is used to driv e microwave generation devices which feed a phased array of microwave transmitters forming a collimated beam directed towards earth While a nominal atmospheric attenuation of 978-1-4799-1622-1/14 31  00 c r 2014 IEEE about 2 for a microwave frequency of 2  45 Ghz 1 i s comparably small yet 100 MW of power is absorbed by the atmosphere in the case of a 5 GW power station in geostationary orbit GEO Even though substantial amounts of energy are expected to be deposited in the atmosphere by utility-sc ale SSP satellites only little information is available about atmospheric interactions of microwave power beams Currently existing data was obtained from several sounding rocket and satellite experiments mostly conducted by Japanese scient ists for a review of previous measurements see Ref 2   D u e to limitations in transmitter size and transmissible power  the range of microwave beam energy densities comparable to beams from utility-scale SSP satellites is limited to the immediate atmospheric vicinity of the spacecraft 4  A solid base of in-depth knowledge and comprehensive studies documenting safety and interactions of power beams with all relevant layers of the atmosphere will likely be require d to obtain launch and operating licenses for SSP systems from US national and international regulatory bodies such as the International Telecommunication Union Such data could also largely facilitate the approval process of SSP launche s in the context of the International Trafc in Arms Regulations ITAR 3  I n a d d i t i o n  s c i e n t i  c d a t a o f a t m o s p h e r i c interactions of power beams could if properly published and disseminated build public awareness and support and ease public concerns of possible hazards of SSP as a new renewable energy option A favorable attitude of the genera l public towards SSP would likely facilitate the development of political and funding support for timely SSP research and development prototyping and deployment Aside from SSPrelated benets the obtained data can also be used as valuab le input to further inform and verify computational models of the atmosphere and to provide better understanding of its interaction with electromagnetic waves in general As a potentially more cost-effective and efcient alternat ive to on-orbit/high-altitude microwave power beam sources t he present paper proposes to utilize ground-based facilities to collect the large amounts of information needed to enable th e deployment of a SSP demonstrator and later on utility-sca le SSP satellites Ground-based systems do not experience as stringent limitations in transmitter size and transmitted RF power levels as high-altitude microwave sources and offer continuous experimental accessibility In addition powe r beams generated at ground facilities can readily access the lowest levels of the atmosphere which likely benets public acceptance of the safety of wireless power beaming On the other hand ground facilities can probe atmospheric layers up to very high altitudes if equipped with sufcient transmiss ible power as will be shown below Lastly large amounts of 1 


data can be gathered over essentially unlimited operating times while total cost between ground and orbit-based systems could be comparable if existing ground facilities are extended The study presented in this paper is intended to provide a rst look at the option of using a ground-based facility to simulate and study interactions of SSP microwave power beams with the atmosphere Such a project could become the rst large-scale concerted effort to establish comprehen sive scientic knowledge of atmospheric power beam interaction s and represent a critical impetus to start large-scale SSP de velopment for a potentially modest amount of required funding as described below 2 P OTENTIAL E FFECTS OF M ICROWAVE B EAMS IN A TMOSPHERE To introduce notation used in the following and as an

Auroral Research Program HAARP facility in Alaska and New York City both USA with an overlay of relevant atmospheric layers 6  A l t i t u d e ranges for atmospheric layers are intended for illustratio n only The International Union of Radio Science URSI published a White Paper in 2007 about several aspects of SSP 2  T h i s report lists several possible interactions of 2  45 and 5  8 GHz microwave beams with the different layers of the atmosphere and possible sources of interference with existing radio se rvices due to the presence of microwave power beams which will be described in the following Atmospheric Interactions of Microwave Power Beams Under a nominal space weather paradigm i.e in the absence of uncommon solar activity it has been shown that most of the absorption of the power beam would occur in the lower ionosphere regions 12 b e l o w 200 km The coherence and amplitude of the power beam is dependent on linear processes such as absorption due to electron collisional events diff raction owing to plasma density variations and refraction Of more interest are the generation of nonlinear interactions of the power beam and the atmosphere Such nonlinear effects are notable in their difculty to accurately model and predi ct Non-linear interactions between microwave power beams and the atmosphere lead to a reduction in power transmission efciency via additional absorption and heating of electro ns Electron or Ohmic heating has a direct impact of the atmospheric chemistry makeup as well as the electron density and thus further collisional and scattering events As the electron density increases as a function of beam power density the thermal electron gas pressure increases In th e inhomogeneous gas environment of the various atmospheric altitudes this will result in gas density gradients where t he plasma is pushed out towards lower pressure regions resulti ng in localized electron density depletions At altitudes bel ow 200 km this change in the make up of the plasma volume leads to refractive effects such as self-focusing and als o to localized regions where chemical reaction chains can occur owing to changes in N e and T e  the electron density and temperature respectively In addition Ref 2 d e s c r i b e s t h e p o t e n t i a l f o r e x c i t a t i o n of plasma waves in the ionosphere including the meso thermoand exosphere by microwave power beams which was experimentally observed by Japanese sounding rocket experiments Such waves are considered to be a possible source of secondary electromagnetic waves which could generate additional Ohmic heating of the atmosphere or produce interference with radio services Studies referenced in Ref 2 d e s c r i b e a p o s s i b l e s i g n i  c a n t i n c r e a s e o

diffusion effects in the troposp here due to the presence of atmospheric gases and aerosols or water/ice clouds and precipitation In general Ref 2 s t ates that non-linear and feedback effects can only be predicted with limited accuracy and have to be studied experimentally  Interference of Microwave Power Beams with Radio Services In addition to atmospheric interactions of power beams Ref 2 p o i n t s o u t t h a t i n t e r f e r e n c e o f p o w e r b e a m s w i t h existing radio services have to be examined in order for SSP to be able to legally operate under ITU regulations Due to closeness in frequency the 2  45 and 5  8 GHz bands allocated for civilian and military wireless applications and ISM in dustry science and medical applications are expected to b e at risk for interference mainly from spurious or out-of-ba nd emissions of SSP microwave transmission elements Reference 2 a l s o e s t i m a t e s p o s s i b l e i n t e r f e r e n c e s o f m i c r o w a v e

Ref 2 r e c o m m e n d s t o i n v e s t i g a t e all possible effects of power beams on the electrical conductiv ity and the chemical composition of atmospheric layers even if not yet observed All of the above aspects of recommended and required investigation are accessible with the proposed extensions of the HAARP facility infrastructure discussed below which therefore would represent a crucial step towards regulator y clearance and licensing of SSP infrastructure 3 T HE H IGH F REQUENCY A CTIVE A URORAL R ESEARCH P ROGRAM HAARP F ACILITY The HAARP facility 7 n e a r G l e n n a l l

atmospheric behavior Spectrophotometric measurements o f the helium oxygen and hydrogen spectral lines were taken on the Black Brant II sounding rocket launch in 1988 13  i n order to characterize aspects of the thermosphere/exosphe re plasma environment Such spectral measurements could potentially be used to determine gas densities within targe ted volumes using the principle of chemical actinometry 14  Carrying out SPS power beam experiments with the modied HAARP array could be timed to coincide with a launch for experimental measurement of the plasma state and gas species densities within a targeted volume coincidental wi th the rocket ight trajectory Weather Balloons Low-cost atmospheric soundings utilizing weather balloons as experimental platforms are widely deployed Gas density and plasma state observations can be made using UV photometry mass spectroscopy and electrochemical sondes Weather balloon experiments customdesigned for sensitivity to specic atmospheric parameter s can be deployed around the HAARP facility site during a radiation campaign to collect additional data on atmospher ic interactions of HAARP power beams Earth Observation Satellites The HAARP Diagnostic Satellite Scintillation SATSIN system has been used previousl y to characterize the structure and dynamics of ionospheric irregularities created during HF heating utilizing the pe rturbation and modulation of UHF/VHF signals from satellite beacons as they pass through the power beam volumetric area and near vicinity This system offers additional diagnosti c capabilities for the upgrade proposed in this paper as well by measuring ionosphere behavior e.g Ohmic heating response N e and T e variations observation of nonlinear effects In related work a joint HAARP/NASA experiment to detect the effects of a high power radiowave transmission on the magnetosphere was carried out by the WIND satellite radio and plasma wave detectors WAVE 15  Wh i l e t h e t a r g e t was in the high altitude magnetospheric band such future experiments could be tailored to be analogous to an SPS power beam and such measurements could prove insightful especially for geostationary positioned SPS systems 5 S UMMARY Only limited amounts of data are available concerning the interaction of microwave power beams with Earth's atmosphere It is expected that in-depth knowledge of atmospher ic power beam interactions is required for the certication an d licensing process of SSP and for raising public acceptance of SSP Review publications of microwave interactions with atmospheric layers suggest that further studies need to be conducted and that these studies should be of experimental nature due to expected non-linear effects which are difcul t to simulate The data generated from these experimental studies would provide key metrics in terms of characterizin g atmospheric interactions of SPS power beams This paper presents a rst analysis of a possible usage of the existing infrastructure of the HAARP facility in Alaska  USA towards establishing a large-scale and comprehensive knowledge base of scientic rigor about the interactions of power beams with all relevant atmospheric layers The power beam emulation capabilities of different scales of extensi on scenarios are compared The above studies suggest that already the smallest considered upgrade allows the collection of representative data describing the interactions of a LEO demonstrator SPS power beam with the atmosphere for modest cost Additionally atmospheric power beam interactions of utility-scale SPS can potentially be emula ted in a representative way by the largest considered upgrade In-depth knowledge of the interactions of high-energydensity microwave power beams with Earth's atmosphere is expected to be of critical importance to enable SPS deployment and large-scale development supported by US national government agencies international entities as well as the general public Utilizing existing ground-based faciliti es could represent a cost-effective and efcient way of gather ing the required data for modest amounts of funding 6 D ISCLAIMER Lockheed Martin Corporation does not
