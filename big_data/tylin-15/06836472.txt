USA Benjamin.Rodriguez@jhuapl.edu Abstract\227 There is a growing number of infrared 050IR\051 spectral signature data in the scienti\002c community gathered from a variety of sensors using a variety of collection techniques As the quantity of collected data grows automated solutions for searching and matching signatures need to be developed When searching and matching signatures reducing computational complexity and increasing matching accuracy are essential We present a signature classi\002cation method via k means clustering using a novel application of spectral angle mapping to ef\002ciently determine spectral similarity We evaluate the method against spectral data in the 224SigDB\224 spectral analysis software application developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory 050JHU/APL\051 The key component to this approach is the set of characteristic functions used to map signatures similarity into a spatial representation Existing methods used to autonomously identify and classify IR spectral data include spectral angle mapping and key feature detection Spectral mapping is computationally slow due to the need for direct individual comparison and key feature detection improves computation time but is limited by the speci\002c features selected for comparison The accuracy and computation time of the spectral cluster classi\002cation method is evaluated against spectral angle mapping and visual analyses on the ASTER NASA spectral library The goal of this method is to improve both the accuracy and speed of classifying newly collected unlabeled spectra We 002nd that the proposed method of scoring signatures offers a speed increase of three orders of magnitude in comparing spectra at the expense of a high false positive rate suitable for use as a 002rst-pass 002lter We further 002nd that the k means cluster-based classi\002cation is highly sensitive to the selection of initial cluster centroids and offer alternative solutions to use with our scoring method T ABLE OF C ONTENTS 1 I NTRODUCTION                                   1 2 R ELATED W ORK                                  2 3 M ETHODOLOGY

analysis requires collecting large quantities of data from a variety of spectrometers using a variety of techniques in diverse environmental conditions Variations in observed spectral features regardless of the quality of the data make signature classi\002cation and comparison both challenging for spectral analysts and often impossible for automated systems As the quantity of collected data continues to grow automated solutions are increasingly critical For example the national Integrated Signatures Program 050ISP\051 has collected approximately one million infrared 050IR\051 spectra which largely rely on manually produced metadata for identi\002cation and classi\002cation The manual production of metadata at this scale requires signi\002cant and rising cost and time investment to reduce errors and inconsistencies The primary methods currently used to autonomously identify and classify IR spectral data are spectral angle mapping and key feature detection Spectral angle mapping cannot compare spectra with differing domains 050e.g spectral range spectral resolution or inconsistently removed bands\051 without signi\002cant preprocessing Thus spectral angle mapping is a computationally slow process running in linear time against an entire reference library to identify a single new or unknown signature Key feature detection improves computation time by comparing only predetermined feature locations in the reference spectra but this method requires the user to speci\002cally identify the spectral features of interest A novel approach to signature classi\002cation via scoring and clustering is presented A set of characteristic mathematical functions are used as arti\002cial reference spectra to score library signatures and a k means clustering algorithm determines classi\002cation clusters in the score space New signatures are scored against the same characteristic functions to determine their location in score space and thus determine their likely classi\002cation Since new signatures need only be compared against cluster centroids to determine classi\002cation the algorithm performs in O 050 k 051 time where k 031 p  n 2  i.e the computation time increases linearly with respect to the predetermined number of clusters k  We apply this approach to a reference sampling of signatures from the ASTER spectral library and e v aluated accurac y and computation time versus direct spectral angle comparison This methodology identi\002es close matches in a spectral li1 


brary to newly collected spectra three orders of magnitude faster than the direct spectral angle mapping Used in tandem with traditional signature analysis this method provides a 002rst-pass coarse screening of spectral classi\002cation to reduce the size of the identi\002cation pool Reducing the workload on a more intensive secondary analysis allows a much larger reference libraries to be used in the near-realtime classi\002cation of 002eld-collected spectra Greater access to spectral data in addition to the ability to provide a preliminary classi\002cation of newly collected spectra provides forensic analysts and 002rst responders enhanced chemical detection capabilities when they need it most The remainder of this paper is structured as follows In Section 2 related work in the area of spectral signature matching is presented Our proposed method signature classi\002cation via scoring and clustering is described in Section 3 Findings and analyses are provided in Section 4 Finally we conclude and describe opportunities for future work in Section 5 2 R ELATED W ORK The need for spectral signature comparison and identi\002cation has driven substantial work in the application of pattern recognition unsupervised and semi-supervised learning and data clustering 4 5 Further  the need to quantify and analyze enormous quantities of spectral data has spawned many attempts at spectral collections or databases with mixed results The inability to reduce v arious methods of collection and phenomenologies of spectra into a least common denominator representation has made the problem computationally challenging especially without the use of copious metadata to explain the exact conditions and context in which the spectra were collected The classi\002cation and identi\002cation of unlabeled data has been studied in great detail in the spatial domain and a wealth effective of solutions have been developed to address the problem 7 Spatial clustering algorithms in general attempt to determine natural boundaries between non-uniformly distributed spatial data points Of these k means is relatively simplistic approach given some known number of clusters k  cluster center points are randomly distributed among the sample data then iteratively updated to re\003ect the average of their nearby constituents A key assumption is advance knowledge of k  as this algorithm has no ability to merge or split existing clusters However it is the simplest in a large 002eld of clustering solutions that includes hierarchical clustering fuzzy k means DBSCAN expectation-maximization and many others  If the spectral classi\002cation problem can be effectively adapted into the spatial domain any of these existing methods can be applied Several direct and indirect methods exist to compare signatures against each other such as Spectral Angle Mapping 050SAM\051 multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis 050MESMA\051 peak detection and similarity indices s uch as the Pearson correlation In general practice the sensiti vity and utility of each method is inversely correlated with its runtime computational complexity The SAM algorithm is of speci\002c interest due to its ability to precisely describe the difference between two signatures without regard for the relative illumination within the spectra 050which is irrelevant to the spectral features of the observed material\051 4  SAM measures similarity by taking a signature in two dimensions 050X and Y\051 and creating a spectral vector consisting of its Y values The vector's dimensionality is equal to the number of data points in the signature Two spectral vectors are compared by simply computing the angle between them via their vector dot product This method inherently assumes that the two spectra being compared share precisely the same domain not only the same spectral band but also the same sampling resolution and speci\002c domain values Thus a signature sampled at 5 10 15 100 microns cannot be immediately compared with another signature sampled at 7 12 17 102 microns though the domains almost entirely overlap Any mismatch in domain must be resampled through interpolation and extrapolation Resolving the mismatch is computationally inef\002cient since pathologically every possible pair of spectra may require resampling 3 M ETHODOLOGY We formulate a methodology to rapidly classify a new unknown signature by identifying signatures in a spectral library with similar spectral features Instead of individually comparing the unknown signature against each member of the library the proposed method precomputes a score representation of the library against a small number 050 N 051 of arti\002cial reference spectra Using a derivative of the SAM method the scalar spectral angle values between each library signature and the reference spectra are treated as coordinates of a point in N dimensional space and cached within the library when a new signature is introduced it is compared against the reference spectra to produce a corresponding set of coordinates Then sets of spatial coordinates with smaller Euclidean distances correspond to library spectra with the greater similarity to the new signature This method is intended to 002lter the library down to a small subset of candidate matches Though the primary goal is to optimize spectral comparison this paper also investigates the opportunity to classify and identify unlabeled signatures by characterizing the generated N dimensional map as a spatial clustering problem k Means an 224elementary but very popular\224 3 clustering algorithm generates cluster associations among spatial coordinates A new unlabeled signature's spectral scores will place it within a de\002ned cluster then the labels of the library spectra sharing the same cluster become preliminary guesses at the unknown signature's classi\002cation Since the labels of library signatures are predetermined and signatures with the same label are expected to have very similar spectral characteristics the score clustering process also serves to validate the choice of reference spectra Characteristic Spectral Angle Mapping 050cSAM\051 Our proposed method adapts SAM spectral comparison as a measure of indirect spectral similarity rather than direct Traditionally SAM operates on the principle that if signature A has spectral angle 022 AC to signature C  then small 022 AC implies spectral similarity between A and C  Our modi\002ed application instead proposes that a characteristic function such as y  cos x  can serve as an arti\002cial reference signature B  If signatures A and C have spectral angles 022 AB and 022 BC to C respectively then 022 AB 031 022 BC implies a degree of similarity between A and C  This relationship is not as precise as SAM the set of spectral vectors satisfying a given spectral angle 022 to B trace a surface around the reference signature's vector as shown in Figure 1 here both A and C present the same spectral angle to B  but A 6  C  In this three-dimensional representation the area of ambiguity presents as the surface of a cone the spectral vector of a 5002 


Figure 1  Conical Surface of 3D Vectors Satisfying Spectral Angle 022 to Reference Vector  B point signature has 500 dimensions and thus the equal-angle ambiguity surface cannot be represented graphically The solution set of spectral vectors represents many spectra that are equally similar to the reference signature at any magnitude The magnitude of the spectral vector represents the illumination of the signature which is an artifact of the collection environment and irrelevant for the purposes of determining the similarity of spectral characteristics This leaves a cross-section of spectral vectors that all exhibit the same degree of similarity to B  for vectors in three dimensions this presents as a circle orthogonal to B  This level of ambiguity is irreducible using only one reference signature Using multiple reference signatures further constrains the solution to the intersection of the corresponding vector sets as shown in Figure 2 Thus if two signatures A and C exhibit spectral angles 022 AB 1 031 022 CB 1 to B 1 and 022 AB 2 031 022 CB 2 to B 2  it becomes increasingly likely that A 031 C  Introducing additional reference signatures B i can constrain the solutions still further at the expense of additional calculations The application of cSAM allows every signature in a spectral library to be reduced into a score vector  002  0  022 1    022 N 1 A 0501\051 where N is the number of characteristic functions B  The  002 values can then be considered the coordinates of a point in N dimensional space where B 1  B N serve as axes 050orthogonality is not required but is desirable\051 In this new spatial representation score similarity can be characterized as the Euclidean distance between two points thus this enables the use of existing spatial clustering algorithms such as k means to perform classi\002cation of spectra Preconditions The choice of mathematical functions used to produce reference spectra and thus the spectral angle scores used for comparison is a critical factor in the utility of this approach Poorly chosen functions result in spectral angles that are highly similar for many or all library spectra Functions that perform well in one spectral band may perform poorly in others thus requiring different sets of functions for different Figure 2  Intersection of 3D solutions with Spectral Angles 022 1  022 2 to Reference Vectors  B 1   B 2 respectively bands within the library For the purposes of this paper a small set of simplistic functions has been chosen to illustrate the general approach Selection and evaluation of more appropriate characteristic functions will be the subject of further work as are methods of dynamically generating appropriate characteristic functions for a given spectral library The k means algorithm requires as initialization parameters the expected number of classi\002cation clusters 050 k 051 some initial selection of centroid locations for the clusters and an error threshold to limit the number of iterations The number of expected classi\002cations was estimated using a common rule-of-thumb value k 031 p  n 2  and the initialization centroids were randomly chosen from the sample set However given that the library spectra are generally well-labeled the clustering problem can instead be tackled with a semi-supervised solution that is the known material and chemical composition of the samples can be used to intelligently select a diverse set of signatures to serve as the initial centroid locations Guided initialization has the potential to pose a signi\002cant impact on the determination of cluster associations as starting-point selection is known to strongly affect the result of the k means algorithm Initialization is also a focus of ongoing work Detailed Approach Each signature in the spectral database consists of columns of spectral data accompanied by various optional metadata properties such as sensor identi\002cation and calibration environmental conditions sample identi\002cation and description axis units and labels and any known observable associations The data is in the wavelength domain with value columns representing either re\003ectivity or emissivity as indicated by axis properties 050see Figure 3 an example signature from the ASTER library Note that NaN 003oat v alues are used to represent invalid or removed data points within the spectra such as deliberately suppressed water bands A hash of the spectral data uniquely identi\002es the signatures therefore two signatures having the same identi\002er are assumed to be identical and cannot both exist in the database The phenomenology of the signature 050LWIR MWIR SWIR VIS/NIR\051 is also indicated by metadata properties 3 


Figure 3  Sulphur Signature from the ASTER Spectral Library A set of characteristic mathematical functions are selected based on a set of desirable properties 017 Each function is two-dimensional because the comparison spectra are two-dimensional 017 Each function is real and differentiable within the domain of interest so that a spectral angle mapping against any real spectra will yield a real-valued solution 017 Each function generates a broad range of score values against available library spectra within the domain of interest 017 Each function is linearly independent and preferably orthogonal from the other selected characteristic functions within the domain of interest so that each presents a unique spectral vector With each of the desirable properties we attempt to guide and constrain the selection of characteristic functions to those that generate a wide distribution of real-valued spectral angle scores within the database of spectra Thus the selection of appropriate speci\002c characteristic functions is contingent on the nature of the library against which it is applied The number of functions to be used is likewise 003exible more axes for comparison lead to less ambiguity in the set of solutions at the expense of computation time and volume of score data The choice of characteristic functions can be validated by a set of empirical desirability tests against the database 1 When the function is calculated against the library spectra are any of the produced scores NaN 050unde\002ned in\002nite or otherwise non-real\051?\227 If so this indicates the function is not real and/or differentiable throughout the entire domain of interest 2 Are the produced spectral scores broadly distributed?\227 If not the function is not a good discriminator for the signatures of interest 3 Does the function produce scores that are highly correlated with scores produced by another function?\227 If so the functions may not be linearly independent or they may measure highly correlated spectral features One of the functions may be used but not both The cSAM algorithm is used to determine score values for the database as shown in Algorithm 1 The procedure compares each signature against the characteristic functions at the exact domain locations in which the former is de\002ned Because the characteristic functions are real and continuous real Y values are always returned at any signature-speci\002ed domain location NaN values are ignored in the comparison 050lines 910\051 and thus removed or suppressed bands have no impact on the score For each real-valued datapoint the product is accumulated through the algebraic de\002nition of the dotproduct 050line 12 of the algorithm\051  A 001  B  M X i 1 a i b i  a 1 b 1    a M b M 0502\051 M is the dimensionality of the spectral vector and each a i is the Y value of one data point in the signature Here B is an arti\002cial vector that is automatically generated based on a function f j  Correspondingly b i  f j 050 x i 051  where x i is the X value corresponding to a i s Y value The geometric de\002nition of the dot product then determines the angle between the spectral vectors

loop 050lines 13-14\051 Each resulting 022 AB is that signature's score against a characteristic function f j  together they result in a score vector  002 S i  0 B B  022 Sif 1 022 Sif 2    022 Sif N 1 C C A 0505\051 The procedure is performed against every signature in the library to create a baseline set of score values The twodimensional array of scores is indexed by each signature's unique identi\002er If additional signatures are added to the library sets of scores are calculated for the new additions and stored When an unknown signature S 037 is introduced the same method is used to calculate a set of scores A Euclidean distance value is then computed against each existing signature's set of scores The scores of each database signature serve as its coordinates in the N-dimensional function space The unknown signature's location as determined by its own scores should then be located closest to other signatures that share similar spectral characteristics These nearest neighbors are then selected for further automated or visual analysis at the user's discretion The k-means clustering algorithm 050Algorithm 2\051 is applied any time the spectral library is updated The set of k cluster centroids C is initialized as a random sampling of locations within the dataset 050line 5\051 Each signature S i is associated with the centroid closest to it by Euclidean distance 050lines 79\051 then new centroid locations are calculated for each cluster representing the average of the cluster constituents locations 050lines 10-12\051 Then the sum change in centroid positions 001 between the current iteration and the previous is calculated 4

schema representation of spectral signatures and an associated Java-language software application 224SigDB\224 to aid in exchange preliminary analysis comparison and classi\002cation of collected spectra The scoring and clustering methodology described herein was developed as a plug-in capability for the SigDB application which enabled immediate access to a large quantity of spectral data and a framework for analysis SigDB stores signature data in an SQL relational database as IEEE754 64-bit 003oating Table 1  Selected Characteristic Functions 050 x in microns\051   Name  Equation

050ASTER\051 Spectral Library 2.0 a collection of spectra of natural and man-made materials produced by a collaboration of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory the Johns Hopkins University and the United States Geological Survey The data spans the 0.4 to 15.4 026 m wavelength which includes the visual and near-infrared 050VIS/NIR\051 shortwave 050SWIR\051 and thermal infrared 050TIR\051 electromagnetic bands All of the selected signatures describe directional hemispherical re\003ectance as collected by the NASA Terra spaceborne hyperspectral imaging platform are represented in percent re\003ectivity and consist of approximately 400-600 data points each The data are not uniformly sampled for example some begin at 0.43 026 m and others at 0.3 026 m However all of the data do exhibit the same sampling resolution 2-nm up to 0.8 026 m 20-nm between 0.8 026 m 5 026 m and 100-nm between 5 026 m 14 026 m Table 1 lists the preliminary characteristic functions selected as reference spectra for this paper The selections all cosine functions of varying frequency are intended to mirror the desirable properties identi\002ed above while remaining computationally trivial to execute Under the assumption that all signature wavelength values are represented in microns the selected functions capture spectral features at the 10nanometer 1-micrometer and 100-micrometer resolutions The computation of discrete values for these functions with respect to the described Signature Scoring algorithm was hard-coded into the software implementation 1,800 samples of various minerals soils vegetation and manmade materials were selected from the ASTER library for comparison Spectral angle scores were generated against the three characteristic functions above and stored in

site\051 was chosen to represent the unknown signature 050Figure 4\051 Its score data was manually removed from the database then the cSAM plugin was run to recalculate the score and determine its cluster association The runtime of both the database scoring  clustering process and the signature classi\002cation process were recorded Also to evaluate the accuracy and run-time of the scoring process without clustering the unknown signature's score values were recomputed and spatially compared against all 1,799 database spectra via Euclidean distance computation In addition a traditional
