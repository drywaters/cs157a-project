2 in a policy that in case of a failed backup job certain number of retries must be executed automatically Depending on the backup type e.g full incremental and differential th e content that will be transferred from a client to its backup server ma y vary signicantly in terms of data transfer size and backup duration For the ease of management backup clients are usually categorized into logical groups a.k.a zones su ch as Finance and Human Resources For each individual backup job the backup server will record many pieces of information of the job i.e metadata such as the associat ed client name the associated zone name the backup start time  the backup nish time the size of data transfer the experie nced network throughput the number of backup les the outcome of the backup job fail success or partial the backup job type full incremental and the number of open les encountere d opened by other applications and thus cannot be backed up among many others Such information are usually stored in an enterprise database server e.g DB2 or SQLServer Note th at our backup data analytics is performed on these backup job metadata rather than the actual user data from clients B Big Data Analytics Platform for Backup Management In order to exploit data mining techniques on collected back up job metadata we integrate a big data analytics platform w ith the existing enterprise backup architecture as shown in Fi gure 1 Our platform harnesses critical conguration and operat ional information from software and hardware components across a ll backup servers and analyzes the historical information to p rovide multi-tiered reporting monitoring alerting capabi lities Data from other management silos besides backup are also collected to bridge the information gap and create a single viewing governance and management console for the backup administrator A unied management stack is enabled which continuously collects each individual backup job's attrib utes more than 20 in the default setting such as the client name the start time the nish time the size of data transfer the experienced network throughput and the number of open les  along with their associated timestamps The data set we are collecting consists of backup jobs for over half million of clients over 2000 servers and over 3000 zones in total Our historical backup jobs metadata database contains up to 3 years of records for all client server and zone levels from whic h statistically signicant training data and insightful inf ormation can be obtained For client level backup job's information o nly more than 10 million time series data are available where each time series consists of historical data up to 3 years and contains rich information to be exploited for efcient enterprise ba ckup management design In order to analyze the massive backup job data which is also constantly expanding with new backup job information arrivals from operational data centers we build a scalable data mining platform to store process and perform advance d data mining techniques on the overall data set as illustrat ed in Figure 1 We leverage open source tools to reduce the overall cost while preserving exility For backup job meta data storage we leverage Cassandra NoSQL database due to its salient features of scalability and no central point of fail ure among others 3  T h e b a c k u p j o b m e t a d a t a a r e r e p l i c a t e d f r o m the database server in a background process for data analyti cs purpose The proof-of-concept Cassandra cluster consists of 7 nodes with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server and each node has 4 CPU cores 8 GB memory and 100 GB direct-attached disks which emulates a small cluster using low cost commodity hardware Note that our nodes are virtual machines and the allocated resources can be adjusted to experiment th e impact of heterogeneous cluster hardware congurations on the performance of parallel data mining algorithms which i s another research focus of ours and beyond the scope of this paper To facilitate parallel data mining for the massive data set we utilize Hadoop as the backend batch processing parallel computation platform which is congured on the same set of nodes with Cassandra to facilitate data locality In additi on we leverage the RHadoop framework 4 o n t o p o f o u r H a d o o p and Cassandra cluster RHadoop utilizes Hadoop streaming capability where each mapper and reducer function can be written in native R language instead of Java Therefore the rich capability of R in terms of statistic computing can be leveraged In our scenario we will store tens of millions ti me series data in Cassandra using customized schema and the data mining tasks for all time series data are distributed to all work nodes of the Hadoop cluster in parallel The platfor m can scale easily by simply adding commodity nodes with Cassandra Hadoop client and RHadoop packages installed Our parallel data mining platform integrates with the backu p analytics frontend tightly and provides graphical visuali zation to provide additional insights to the backup administrator via web-based management consoles III M INING OF M ASSIVE E NTERPRISE B ACKUP D ATA U SE C ASE S TUDIES In this section we discuss several massive data mining task s that we are implementing on the big data analytics platform t o facilitate advanced enterprise backup management capabil ities A Backup Capacity Planning Using Predictive Analytics In the enterprise backup architecture shown in Figure 1 our backup analytics component contains rich historical in formation across multiple servers which can be leveraged fo r backup capacity planning using predictive analysis At the storage backend a designated primary storage pool is allocated for each backup server which serves as a buffer to store incoming user data To prevent buffer overow background tasks such as data compression deduplication and policydriven information lifecycle management ILM processes a re executed to reduce the utilized storage space From a modeli ng perspective the primary storage pool can be viewed as a G/D/1 queue 5  a s s h o w n i n F i g u r e 2  w h e r e t h e a r r i v a l rate is the user data injection rate from consecutive backu p jobs and the departure rate is determined by the ILM policy e.g migration frequency the average compression rati o the average deduplication ratio among others While the queue s departure rate can be easily estimated and often congurabl e the arrival rate of the primary pool essentially captures th e 


3 rate of backup data growth which is not controllable by the backup administrator Therefore in order to perform capac ity planning of the primary storage pool an accurate forecasti ng of the future data injection rate is desired From the backup administrator's perspective over-provisioning the prim ary storage pool unnecessarily increases the backup cost whereas a n under-provisioning can potentially cause the primary stor age pool being overwhelmed quickly to cause backup job failures  Therefore our objective of the backup capacity planning is to provide predictive estimation of the backup data growth t o strike the balance between risk and cost which also facilit ates a simpler budgeting procedure Fig 2 A queueing model of the primary backup storage pool In order to predict the backup user data growth rate we leverage the historical time series data of Backup Data Transfer Size  which is one of the over 20 attributes that we collected for each individual backup job as the training set for our predictive model In a similar context 6 a p p l i e s p i e c e w i se linear regression model to capture the capacity growing spe ed of backup data In our work we extend the predictive analysi s by utilizing bagging  b ootstrap agg regat ing  method which is an ensemble method and has more robust and accurate predictions by aggregating multiple weak predictive model s 7 trained by bootstraping samples Our implemented predicti ve models for bagging include 1 Weighted Linear Regression with LASSO LASSO regulation is added to the weighted linear regression model to compensate overtting and the optimal penalty weight is determined using cross-validati on 2 Weighted Generalized Linear Regression Poisson with LASSO Similar to above with Poisson link function 3 Support Vector Regression Similar to the standard SVM method applied for regression instead of classication 4  Neural Networks A three layer forward neural network and 5 Random Forest 8  A l l a l g o r i t h m s h a v e b e e n i m p l e m e n t e d in the RHadoop framework due to the volume of time series data and their suitability for parallel implementation Th e predictive model training processes for all client level s erver level zone level time series of accumulative backup data si zes are distributed to all Hadoop nodes under the MapReduce framework In addition we periodically re-initiate the tr aining process to update the prediction models e.g once a week It is worth noting that our ensemble prediction framework enjoys the exility that each prediction algorithm is simpl y a pluggable building block and new predictive algorithms can be easily incorporated Furthermore the framework can optionally select a subset of algorithms among all algorit hms in the catalog for quick training For example we select tw o clients and utilize their historical accumulative data bac kup size information during the past two months 1 to train our 1 In this paper all absolute data

ensemble prediction principles refer to  9  B Backup Anomaly Identication Using Contextual Outlier Detections Outlier detection is also known as anomaly detection novel ty detection deviation detection fraud detection or exc eption mining in different contexts according to the application s In general an outlier is an observation usually a data point with 


4 possibly high dimension that appears to deviate remarkabl y from other samples in which it occurs While the concept is intuitive a formal mathematical denition largely depend s on the specic use case and application scenario for meaningfu l interpretations Various outlier detection techniques ha ve been studied in the literature ranging from identifying outlie rs in streaming data time series data to graph anomaly detectio n in emerging social network applications According to the underlying assumptions existing outlier detection solut ions can be divided into model-based and model-free methods Pop ular model-based outlier detection algorithms include sta tistic methods where usually a parametric model is assumed and tted using data where an observation is identied as outli er if it is highly unlikely to occur according to the statistica l model In contrast model-free methods such as density-bas ed and clustering-based solutions have no assumptions on the model and can be utilized in an unsupervised fashion For overview of state-of-the-art outlier detection technique s refer to survey papers such as 10  In the enterprise backup management context several facto rs may cause a backup job to exhibit abnormal behaviors For example if a network device becomes defective the backup jobs that traverse this device will experience much longer t ime to complete and the Job Duration metric will have larger values compared to previous backup jobs Therefore our backup analytics platform needs to capture such anomaly and alert the backup administrator for further problem determinatio n and troubleshooting to prevent more severe consequences such a s backup failures The detection of outliers must be performe d automatically promptly and accurately by comparing the metadata of the newly recorded backup job with historical backup job information In our framework we emphasize on four key performance indicating metrics among more than 20 metrics to determine the degree of abnormality of each backup job i.e 1 data transferred in KB 2 average network throughput in MBps 3 the number of backup les and 4 total job duration in seconds of the job Upon the completion of each backup job the metadata will be stored at the database server and replicated in our data analytics clu ster for processing Our outlier detection program implemente d in R and the Hadoop framework will be invoked to rst compute the outlier scores of each individual metric say s 1  s 2  s 3  s 4  and a nal outlier score which measures the degree of abnormality of this backup job is a weighted sum of  s  P i 4 i 1 w i s i where the weight w i has a default value of 1 4 and can be customized by the backup administrator to accommodate business-specic requirements Note that oth er methods of combining outlier scores can be incorporated in our framework straightforwardly To facilitate prompt out lier detection we distribute the outlier score computation tas k e.g calculating the distances to neighbor points across the un derlying Hadoop cluster using the MapReduce framework where each node uses R packages for efcient data processing and calculation Such a parallel implementation will signica ntly speed up the detection process in order to achieve a meaningf ul response time for the backup administrator to take appropri ate countermeasures However traditional outlier detection algorithms cannot be applied directly in our backup scenarios For example in the metric of number of backup les the value varies signicantly according to its backup job type For full backup jobs the average number of backup les is much larger than that of incremental backup jobs of the same backup client In our scenarios most backup clients have a mixture of backup job types specied by the backup policy e.g full backups at weekend and incremental backups durin g weekdays In addition the outcome of each backup job has a signicant impact on the values of the aforementioned metri cs For example a backup job may have an outcome marked as partial which suggests that the job nishes with an incomplete status possibly due to an expiration of the back up window Therefore it is not uncommon that the number of backup les will be smaller compared to a backup job with a successful outcome from the same client By levering the historical backup job information of each client it is meaningful to identify the outliers in backup jobs with same type and outcome status In other words our objective is to identify contextual outliers where whether a single observation is an outlier or not depends not only on its value but also on its context i.e its backup job type and its outcome To ach ieve our goal we extend a well-established point outlier detect ion algorithm Local Outlier Factor LOF 11  w h i c h i s k n o w n t o perform well in real world scenarios such as network intrusi on detections 12 v i a e x t e n s i v e v a l i d a t i o n s  I n t h e f o l l o w i n g we will use the metric of number of backup les as an example to illustrate how our contextual backup information can be incorporated Denote f n as the number of backup les for the new backup job and f  f f 1      f n  1 g as the sequence of number of backup les for all backup jobs associated with the same backup client Note that previous backup jobs for the backup client may have different outcomes and backup types For f n  we rst compute its k distance with respect to f where k is a controllable parameter as will be discussed shortly Formally the k distance of point f n is the distance d  f n  f 0  Euclidean distance in our scenario to another point f 0 2  f  where  f  f contains all backup jobs from the same backup client with the same outcome and backup job type with f n  and 1 at least k points of f 00 2  f exist such that d  f n  f 00   d  f n  f 0   and 2 at most k  1 points of f 00 2  f exist such that d  f n  f 00   d  f n  f 0   Conceptually the k distance of f n indicates the density around f n with respect to the elements in  f where a larger value suggests that f n is further away from the rest of points and is likely to be an outlier For notation brevity we use N k  f n  to represent the set of points such that f 0 2  f and d  f n  f 0   k distance of f n  For each data point f 0 2 N k  f n   dene the reachability distance between f n and f 0 as reach-d k  f n  f 0   max  k distance  f 0   d  f n  f 0   1 


5 The local density of f n is dened as lrd k  f n   j N k  f n  j P f 0 2 N k  f n  reach-d k  f n  f 0   which is the reciprocal of the average reachability distanc e of f n to its neighbors in N k  f n   Therefore points that are in the center of a cluster should have larger values of local dens ity whereas points further away from other neighbors will have smaller values of local density Finally dene the local outlier factor LOF outlier score of point f n as LOF k  f n   1 j N k  f n  j P f 0 2 N k  f n  lrd k  f 0  lrd k  f n  2 where the value of f n will be incorporated to compute lrd k  f 0   Therefore for each new backup job's metric i.e the number of backup les in our example our extended algorithm will assign an outlier score to it and from 2 it is apparently that most normal points will have an outlier score around 1 whereas an abnormal point will have a larger value of its outlier score The further an observation devia tes from its neighboring points the larger outlier score it has  Therefore by simply selecting an outlier score threshold we are able to identify whether the new backup job's number of backup les exhibits abnormal behaviors The degree of abnormality of this backup job can be obtained by a weighted sum of the outlier scores of key performance indicating metr ics such as the number of backup les the job duration the amount of data transferred the average network throughput experienced among others The algorithm is unsupervised and data-driven which requires no assumption on the data statistical distribution Also the framework is suitable for our Hadoop/MapReduce implementation since the computation of reachability distances to all neighbors in N k  f n  and their local density in 2 can be performed in a parallel fashion due to their uncoupled nature The only controllable parameter of the algorithm is k  which is the number of neighbors f n should be compared to for outlier score computation Unfortunatel y there is no systematic way to obtain the optimal value of k and it has been shown in 11 t h a t t h e c o m p u t e d o u t l i e r s c o r e is not monotonic with respect to k  Therefore we set a range of k from k min  10 to k max  20 and compute the outlier score of f n for each k  The maximum outlier score is used as the nal outlier score associated with f n  As an example Figures 4 shows the top 6 outliers that are identied by our extended algorithm within the most recent 60 backup jobs in terms of 1 number of backup les 2 data transferred 3 network throughput and 4 job durat ion for a particular backup client The top 6 outliers sorted in a decreasing order of the outlier score are labeled in circle s whereas the rest of points are labeled in stars Note that the examples are for demonstration purpose only to show the effectiveness of the contextual outlier detection solu tion From an operational perspective when a new backup job information is collected and recorded in the database our outlier detection algorithm will compute the outlier score of the job which is a weighted sum of the outliers scores of the four aforementioned performance metrics with respect to t he historical backup job information e.g in the last two mon ths If the overall score exceeds a predetermined threshold e.g  combined outlier score  2  our backup analytics system will generate an alert to the backup administrator The outlier s core computation leverages the parallelism and our Hadoop platform integrated with R packages It is worth noting that both the outlier score weights and the anomaly alerting threshol d can be adjusted by the backup administrator Our on-going research work is to enhance the outlier detection mechanism by adjusting the threshold automatically according to the bac kup administrator's actions to the reported outliers C Backup Failure Prevention Using Frequency Mining A backup job can fail for various reasons ranging from a simple network device failure to more complex scenarios where the root cause needs to be revealed by scrutinizing the detailed logs From a business continuity's perspectiv e a backup job failure increases the risk and the adverse impact of data loss and hence a preventive analysis of backup failures is extremely valuable for the backup administrato r In practice certain types of backup failures are preceded b y specic patterns of events a.k.a signatures  For example in the network failure example the dysfunctional network device may yield long processing delay and low throughput before dropping the trafc completely Therefore prior to the backup job which fails due to the unreachable network device  earlier backup jobs that traverse the same network device wi ll experience consecutive long delay and low network bandwidt h which can be observed in the backup analytics platform by mining backup job information across multiple servers If s uch patterns are identied before the device goes defunct completely the backup administrator can take preventive acti ons such as reconguring the backup servers to use an alternativ e network path Note that identifying such patterns may requi re a thorough trace analysis across multiple backup servers an d millions of time series data needs to be analyzed In our work  we extract a failure training set from all historical data where each element in the set is the sequence of backup job logs e.g up to 10 days prior to three consecutive backup job failures for the same client We assume that three consecuti ve backup failures for the same client is a critical event and ne eds to be prevented Within the failure training set we impleme nt a customized frequency mining solution to identify the most frequent patterns and events in preceding sequences of each three-day-consecutive-failures occurrence We model all the backup jobs in a single day as an event  where the metadata such as the network throughput and the number of backup les are the items within each event Our objective is to identify the most frequent appeared patterns i.e sequences of ite ms within 10 days window before a three-day-consecutive-failures occurs There are several frequency mining algorithms that have been proposed in the literature which can be divided into two categories depending on whether the order of each pattern is preserved One type of frequency mining algorithms such as FP-Growth and Eclat 13   1 4  i d e n t i f y t h e g r o u p o f

sequential freque ncy mining applications The algorithm starts from the most frequent singleton pattern and then evolves by adding more events satisfying a frequency threshold In our algorithm we set the frequency threshold to 0  8  which suggests that only the patterns that appear more than 80 from all samples with three consecutive failures will be pruned and presented Ne xt our solution utilizes customized MapReduce implementatio ns to distribute the computationally intensive tasks to multi ple commodity compute nodes for parallelism and scalability F or example the appearance counting process of each sequence is distributed to multiple work nodes in a similar fashion as the WordCount example 16 w h e r e e a c h m a p p e r f u n c t i o n i s the pruning process using

Much of the w ork on lar ge distrib uted systems has been based on 2D decompositions The y were introduced in  where the authors also gi v e a comparison between 1D and 2D partitioning Other w orks using 2D partitioning include the results on BlueGene  L described in  and the already mentioned  One of the problems with using a 2D decomposition is that the representation may become h ypersparse i.e there may be nodes with more edges assigned than v ertices In  as part of their w ork on sparse linear algebra the authors introduce a compression scheme suitable for dealing with the issue Another line of research has focused on single-node system shared memory graph algorithms using CPUs as in the case of   or man ycore architectures lik e   W e mak e e xtensi v e use of bitmaps to
