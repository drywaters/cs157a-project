Abstract 
204Matrix-factorization based collaborative filtering is an efficient approach to the problem of user-side quality-of-service \(QoS\prediction. In this work, we focus on building a matrix-factorization-based collaborative filtering model for QoS prediction under a non-negativity constraint. The motivation is that since QoS data such as response time, cost and throughput, are all positive, a non-negative model can better demonstrate their characteristics. By investigating a non-negative training process relying on each involved feature, we invent a non-negative latent factor model to deal with the sparse QoS matrix subject to the non-negativity constraint. We subsequently introduce Tikhonov regularization into it to obtain the regularized non-negative latent factor

INTRODUCTION How to predict the user-side quality-of-service \(QoS accurately is an important research topic in the area of service computing. According to pioneering research [1-10  o n e  efficient way to implement reliable user-side QoS-prediction is via collaborative filtering \(CF\ initially designed for recommender systems [11-15  W h en a p plying CF t o  QoS-prediction, the user-side QoS data on a specified QoS-property is organized into a user-service QoS matrix where each row denotes a specified user, each column denotes a 
 
 
specified service and each entry denotes the historical QoS data of this property by a specified user on a specified service. Since each user can only touch a finite service set, the QoS-matrix is usually very sparse with numerous missing values. Thus, the key problem in CF-based QoS-prediction is to estimate the unknown entries in the QoS-matrix based on known ones subject to globally high accuracy and other requirements 1-10 CF-based QoS-prediction can be implemented through several ways, among which the matrix-factorization \(MF  This research is in part supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant Number 61202347 and 61103036, and in part supported by the US National Sc ience Foundation under Grant Number CMMI-1162482.

QoS-predictions, a low-rank estimate to the original QoS-matrix is desired. In general, this low-rank estimate can be constructed by mapping both the users and services into the same latent feature space, training desired user/service features according to the original QoS-matrix, and then filling each entry in the desired estimate heavily relying on the products of user and service feature matrices. In other words, once the user/service features are obtained, the missing values can be estimated by the corresponding ones in the resulting low-rank estimate. Zhang

Then, the newly proposed NLF and RNLF are compared with it to validate if our newly proposed strategies can bring positive effect on performance in the QoS-prediction task The training process of each compared model on D1 and D2 is depicted in Figs. 1-2 respectively. The lowest MAE of each model during the training process is recorded in Table II. The consumed time of each training epoch by each model is summarized in Table III. Based on these experimental results we have the following findings a\ion accuracy of NLF and WNMF are very close on D1 and D2. As depicted in Figs. 1-2, the training process of NLF and WNMF is very similar. From Table II, we see that the lowest MAE of NLF and WNMF is also very close This indicates that the update rule of NLF given by \(12\ has the identical effect with that of WNMF given by \(5\. However NLF has much higher computational efficiency than WNMF does. This can be clearly seen from Table III. On D1, each training epoch of NLF consumes 7302 ms on average, which is about 56% that of WNMF. On D2, the situation is very similar This indicates that the training rule of NLF, which only iterates on the meaningful entries in the QoS matrix, is highly efficient as well as being able to maintain non-negativity b\troduction of Tikhonov regularization into NLF can bring significant improvement in prediction accuracy.

On D1, the consumed time of each training epoch by RNLF is 7683 ms only about 4.95% higher than that by NLF, and is about 59 that of WNMF. On D2 the situation is very similar. Actually, by comparing \(12\ \(16\, we see that the training rule of RNLF is nearly the same as NLF except for the integration of the penalty facto. Hence, RNLF and NLF are close in computational efficiency Based on the experiment results, we can conclude that NLF can address the task of QoS-prediction with high efficiency as well as maintaining non-negativity. Moreover, RNLF can bring significant improvement in prediction accuracy at the expense of insignificant increase in computational complexity V vol. 13, pp. 556-562, 2000 16 2012, pp. 464-471 7 Madrid Spain, 2011, pp. 1-10 9 Y.

We first carry out the non-negative training process relying on each involved feature, rather than on the whole feature matrices, to from a non-negative latent factor \(NLF\odel. Thus, the training process depends on only the known entries in the user-service QoS-matrix, and is able to deal with the incomplete QoS-matrix with high efficiency as well as maintaining non-negativity. We subsequently introduce the Tikhonov regularization into NLF to obtain the regulzarized NLF \(RNLF\odel, for further improving the prediction accuracy. Based on the experiments on a large, real QoS dataset we conclude that NLF can deal with the task of QoS-prediction with high computational efficiency subject to the non-negativity constraint, while RNLF can significantly improve the prediction accuracy at the expense of some minor increase in computational complexity R EFERENCES  1 B5.1.pd f pp. 1-21, 2012 5 vol. 20, pp 1257--1264, 2008 23 vol. 401, pp. 788-791, 1999 15 vol. 22, pp. 5-53, 2004 24 Z.-B.

Fig 10 Task execution time of three benchmarks In addition Spark pipelines computation with data input further diminishing any bene\002t of data locality Fig 10 demonstrates such argument It shows the comparison of average task execution times along with maximum and minimum values of three different benchmarks Task with local data denotes that the data input is obtained locally while Task with remote data indicates the data input from remote servers As shown in the 002gure enforcing tasks to achieve 100 locality provides little performance gain for all three benchmarks Taken together our evaluation and characterization of locality-oriented scheduling for the computeand data-centric con\002gurations suggest that 1 scheduling for good locality may not be effective in improving the performance of MapReduce jobs in HPC environments and 2 introducing delays for better task locality is even detrimental on computecentric systems because of the uniform reachability of storage resources to all computation tasks B Load Balance of MapReduce Tasks Although the compute nodes in a compute-centric environment are homogeneous there exist performance variations among compute nodes due to the skew of workloads over time As a result fast nodes tend to be assigned with more tasks by the scheduler When each of these tasks deposits a unit of intermediate data fast nodes end up with much more data to shuf\003e or move This leads to imbalanced distribution of intermediate data When a shuf\003e operation is needed such imbalanced distribution can cause straggler issue that prolongs the ensuing I/O-intensive data storing and shuf\003ing phases as depicted in Fig 11 Fig 11 Straggler issue caused by imbalanced intermediate data distribution during I/O intensive shuf\003e operation To investigate this issue we use GroupBy as the benchmark with a split size of 256 MB Three sets of experiments are conducted to run 2500 tasks on 50 nodes 5000 tasks on 100 nodes and 7500 tasks on 150 nodes respectively Fig 12 a and b illustrate the cumulative distribution functions CDF of task and intermediate data distributions a Task distribution b Intermediate data distribution Fig 12 Unbalanced task assignment leads to unbalanced intermediate data distribution As shown in Fig 12 a the workload among compute nodes varies substantially In the case of 100 nodes for the 002rst 3 nodes at the head of the distribution each machine only hosts 7 GB of intermediate data While for the last 10 nodes at the tail of the distribution each node accommodates more than 14 GB i.e 2 002 of workload difference Because the execution time of storing and shuf\003ing phases are directly determined by the slowest tasks those nodes with the most intermediate data can severely drag down the performance regardless of how fast other tasks have achieved In summary performance variations and workload skews on compute-centric systems can lead to imbalanced distribution of both MapReduce tasks and their intermediate data Without an appropriate solution such issue can hinder MapReduce systems from achieving the best performance on computecentric HPC systems We will demonstrate in Section VI-A that by taking into account of the intermediate data size the shuf\003e operation can be effectively accelerated VI O PTIMIZATIONS FOR S PARK ON C OMPUTE C ENTRIC HPC S YSTEMS Based on the characterization from Sections IV and V we have shown that there are two performance issues that need to be addressed for the memory-resident Spark framework in order for it to be effectively supported by the compute-centric HPC systems Firstly the scheduler should take into account of the need to balance the intermediate data among compute nodes and mitigate the variations of task execution thereby avoiding stragglers Secondly the MapReduce workers should be aware of the unique features of hierarchical storage devices such as SSDs to effectively utilize them Accordingly we introduce two optimizations namely Enhanced Load Balancer ELB and Congestion-Aware task Dispatching CAD to address these issues A Enhanced Load Balancer ELB We design ELB to address the issue of imbalanced distribution of intermediate data It considers the size of intermediate data generated by tasks before making further task assignment decision When a job starts ELB-enabled scheduler assigns tasks to the workers in a round-robin manner During the job execution ELB records the amount of intermediate data generated by each completed task and monitors the average data size among all nodes When the size on a node goes beyond the average by a threshold 25 currently ELB

a Storage is the bottleneck b Network is the bottleneck Fig 13 Dissection of GroupBy job execution time a Job execution time b Dissected of job execution Fig 14 Performance of Congestion-Aware task Dispatching noti\002es the scheduler to stop assigning more tasks to that worker node Instead it picks the nodes hosting the least amount of intermediate data to execute the pending tasks Once the average size goes up ELB resumes to assign more tasks to the original heavily loaded worker Although ELB can balance the size of intermediate data among compute nodes two issues arise under such design Firstly ELB may con\003ict with the data locality since the nodes hosting the least amount of intermediate data may not possess the input for the tasks However as shown in Section V-A enforcing data locality has negligible impacts on the task execution time in the HPC environment Thus it is desirable to trade off the locality of task scheduling for a balance of data distribution Secondly ELB can cause the idling of certain workers when they have completed their share of computation tasks and the entire computation phase can be consequently delayed due to the slowest task However we have observed that the cost of waiting for the slowest computation task is much less than the cost of waiting for the slowest I/O tasks In this context to demonstrate the performance improvement of ELB-enabled scheduler to communication and storage bottlenecks during the shuf\003e operations the GroupBy benchmark is used To create a scenario of storage bottlenecks SSD is used as the local storage device In Hyperion we are not allowed to use other networks other than In\002niBand So to create a scenario of network bottlenecks we reduce the data size set in FetchRequest from 1 GB to 128 KB Thus many more requests are needed to shuf\003e the same amount of data and the network bandwidth is consequently narrowed due to space constraint we only present the dissection of job execution and omit execution time of computation phases for clearness Storage Bottlenecks  Fig 13\(a shows that when the data size 024 900 GB Spark and ELB perform similarly However ELB outperforms Spark by 26 on average in terms of job execution time when the data size is between 1 TB and 1.5 TB Such improvement is mainly attributed to the accelerated staging phase introduced by the ELB When data sizes reach beyond 1 TB Spark performs worse than ELB by 2.2 002 on average in the staging phase On the contrary computation phases from both remain nearly the same Network Bottlenecks  Spark performs 14.8 worse than ELB on average in terms of job execution time Moreover when the network is the bottleneck unbalanced distribution has severe impact on small datasets showing up to 17.5 degradation when data size is 400 GB Such difference is strongly determined by the shuf\003ing phases as shown in Fig 13\(b On average Spark shuf\003es data slower than ELB by 29.1 when the input size ranges from 400 GB to 1.2 TB Taken together our ELB demonstrates that unbalanced distribution of intermediate data can prevent memory-resident Spark from achieving the optimal performance in the HPC environment B Congestion-Aware Dispatching CAD of Tasks We design CAD as a feedback control algorithm that aims to mitigate the task interference when SSD is used as the storage device for intermediate data CAD speculates the congestion status of SSD devices by monitoring the task execution time of completed Shuf\003eMapTasks When a signi\002cant jump of execution time is detected it throttles the dispatching of tasks by introducing a delay interval before each dispatching step In the current design we increase the interval by 50 ms whenever the average execution time increases by 2 002 these are empirically chosen during our tuning process Conversely we reduce the interval accordingly when the average task execution time drops by half Though simple we have observed that such mechanism is effective in optimizing the SSD writes This is because such delay interval allows more time for outstanding operations inside SSD to complete their work without worsening the congestion In addition it also provides more opportunity to group many small writes which are harmful to SSD thus further reducing the interference Fig 14 compares the performance of the original Spark with our CAD-enabled Spark by using the GroupBy benchmark with different input sizes Overall CAD effectively accelerates the intermediate data storing phase once the data size goes beyond 600 GB It achieves this without affecting another two phases as shown in Fig 14\(b On average CAD reduces the storing phase by up to 41.2 when the data size ranges from 700 GB to 1.5 TB Such acceleration is re\003ected in the job execution time as shown in Fig 14\(a The average improvement ratio reaches 19.8 VII D ISCUSSION In this section we summarize our major 002ndings and discuss their implications to the design of future systems The Impact of Storage Architecture  Computation intensity of MapReduce tasks determines how much impact the storage architecture of HPC systems will have on the 
806 


job execution For computation-intensive applications there is little impact between the storage architectures of dataand compute-centric paradigms In addition there is no locality to the storage for compute nodes on compute-centric systems tasks can be launched on any node with little loss of performance or even better performance compared to the data-centric environment However the data-centric paradigm still exhibits superior performance for applications with low computation intensity and high data intensity Therefore it is critical to consider the characteristics of MapReduce jobs before making data placement decisions This is important for system providers in planning the evolvement of their computecentric HPC systems for data-centric analytics applications In addition the storage architecture may use distributed locking mechanism for maintaining 002le consistency which can severely degrade the performance of intermediate data movement So we show that designing shuf\003ing mechanisms can avoid the cascading effects of locking contention and keep the ef\002ciency of intermediate data shuf\003ing Users need to avoid a pitfall to use traditional HPC parallel 002le system as a bridge for fast storage of intermediate data When SSDs are used as the storage device for intermediate data our analysis shows that Spark is currently incapable of utilizing them ef\002ciently Uncoordinated resource utilization can cause severe congestion on the device leading to significant task interference as also shown in Our 002ndings suggest that comprehensive examinations are needed to assure the performance of MapReduce applications while evolving the underlying storage of a system to SSDs Optimization strategies such as task throttling as shown by our study can be leveraged to improve the ef\002ciency of SSD device utilization The Effectiveness of Locality-Oriented MapReduce Schedulers in HPC Environment  Our characterization reveals that when a data-centric storage architecture is con\002gured for computer nodes of an HPC system MapReduce schedulers that strive for maximum data locality is not critical Moreover they may even hurt the performance by forcing a task delay for future opportunistic locality We have also revealed that while HPC systems generally have homogeneous computer nodes load imbalance can still arise The current scheduler is oblivious to the size of intermediate data generated by computation tasks leading to imbalanced data distribution that can cause many stragglers during shuf\003e operations Our study demonstrates that such imbalanced distribution can cause suboptimal performance to MapReduce jobs MapReduce applications on HPC systems shall not focus on locality-oriented task scheduling but other critical factors such as balancing distribution of intermediate data VIII R ELATED W ORK Spark is a critical cornerstone of Berkeley Data Analytics Stack BDAS that aims to compete with the opensource Hadoop It plays a pivotal role in many industry and academia projects 19 20 21 etc Shark is a query processing framework on top of Spark It compiles user-submitted SQL queries into Spark jobs and leverages optimization strategies commonly used in database systems to optimize the execution plan Also coupled with Spark BlinkDB is another approximate query engine that trades query accuracy for response time so that it can delivery near instant response for interactive queries over massive scale datasets Spark streaming e xploits the potential of Spark to process real-time streaming data It partitions streaming computations into small-sized deterministic batch jobs to 002t the computation model of Spark Sparkler optimizes the Spark to support large-scale matrix factorization more ef\002ciently It identi\002es a major inef\002ciency existing in current Spark's broadcast variable and introduces a Carousel Maps to spread large dataset via using distributed hash table Our work is orthogonal to those efforts In addition Zaharia et al have introduced LATE Ananthanarayanan et al have introduced Mantri and small job cloning 23 to mitig ate the impact of stragglers However none of them considers the imbalanced intermediate data distribution issue Many parties have tried to incorporate MapReduce frameworks with distributed 002le systems for compute-centric paradigm Ananthanarayanan et al  e v aluated MapReduce when it runs with HDFS and GPFS Maltzahn et al  studied the combination of Hadoop with Ceph 002le system Panasas is also deli v ering the support for Hadoop Our analysis in this work provides researchers with the 002rst hand data about absorbing MapReduce into compute-centric HPC paradigm that relies on above high-performance 002le systems Many efforts have been conducted to investigate the performance of HPC applications on data-centric cloud Evangelinos et al  analyzed a scienti\002c HPC application on Amazon EC2 and revealed that the performance of network in cloud is worse than that of HPC by one to two orders of magnitude Gupta et al  observ ed similar performance on different cloud platforms Though raw performance difference between compute-centric HPC and data-centric cloud is pronounced Marathe et al  pointed out that queue w ait time is another critical factor to consider when choosing which environment is the best for the applications Our work stands on the other side of the spectrum by investigating the datacentric analytics framework on compute-centric paradigm IX C ONCLUSIONS While many existing HPC facilities are evolving new capabilities to support ef\002cient analytics of big data this research addresses an important question on how to support the traditional compute-centric paradigm for HPC applications and the emerging data-centric paradigm for big data analytics applications on the same HPC systems We have examined the design and architecture of a state-of-the-art MapReduce framework  Spark  on HPC systems Our work sheds light on the performance issues and design inef\002ciency when running Spark jobs on HPC systems with distinct data-centric and compute-centric con\002gurations In particular we have investigated the impact of storage architecture locality-oriented scheduling and emerging storage devices to memory-resident MapReduce applications on HPC systems Based on the
