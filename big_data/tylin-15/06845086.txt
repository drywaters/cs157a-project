1 jiashucong.bupt@gmail.com 2 zhanglin@bupt.edu.cn Abstract Floating car data FCD application is an urban sensing application which collects the status position velocity and heading of vehicles to feed a trafìc management server and estimate the travel time of vehicles and can be carried by long term evolution LTE or a heterogeneous network composed by LTE and vehicular ad hoc network VANET However this application is characterized by high frequency and small data size which occupy network resource frequently and may have an impact on other LTE trafìc such as human to human H2H trafìc which is characterized by low frequency and big data size In this paper we aim to analyze and reduce the impact of FCD trafìc on the H2H trafìc in a LTE-VANET heterogeneous network For this purpose we design a novel FCD transmission scheme and evaluate its impact on H2H trafìc which is represented by the rise of the blocking ratio of the H2H trafìc through a Markovian model The results of the model show that comparing with other schemes the novel scheme has a relatively lower impact on the traditional cellular trafìc H2H trafìc I I NTRODUCTION Vehicular ad hoc network VANET is a type of vehicular communication network which uses vehicles as elements in a mobile ad hoc network to realize vehicle-to-vehicle communication through 802.11p Se v eral sorts of applications can run on this kind of network to make trafìc environment safer and more intelligent and improve peopleês life during their journey Vehicle-to-infrastructure V2I communication network is another emerging type of vehicular communication network which is composed by not only vehicles but also roadside units However ubiquitous roadside unit deployment costs are very expensive Future vehicles are likely to have cellular communication modules so replacing roadside units by ready-made cellular network infrastructures i.e base stations seems to be an another approach to achieving V2I communication In fact a lot of articles  ha v e designed and studied cellular-VANET heterogeneous network to support V2I communication However the previous works mainly studied the feasibility of such kind of heterogeneous network and how to improve its V2I communication performance by various kinds of technologies such as cluster The negative impact of supporting V2I trafìc in the heterogeneous network on the performance of the traditional cellular trafìc human to human H2H trafìc was ignored For example oat car data FCD trafìc transmission through cellular network may have impact on H2H trafìc FCD application is an urban sensing application which collects the status position velocity and heading of vehicles to feed a trafìc management server and estimate the travel time of vehicles This type of V2I trafìc is characterized by high frequency and small data size In each second each car in a cell should transmit its status to base station which is a strong inîuence on H2H trafìc The contributions of this paper are listed below We rst evaluate the negative impact of one kind of V2I trafìc i.e FCD trafìc on H2H trafìc in a cellular-VANET heterogeneous network composed by long term evolution LTE and VANET through a Markovian model Second we design a novel FCD transmission scheme to reduce the negative impact on H2H trafìc and evaluate its performance by the Markovian model The results of the Markovian model show that the novel transmission scheme can signiìcantly reduce the negative impact on the H2H trafìc The paper is organized as follows In section II we brieîy discuss previous related work The scenario of LTE-VANET heterogeneous network and FCD trafìc are described in section III How to evaluate the negative impact of FCD trafìc on H2H trafìc through Markovian model is introduced in section IV In section V the novel FCD transmission scheme which prevents unnecessary FCD transmission of some vehicles and avoids transmitting FCD data from some vehicles in bad LTE channel condition to LTE base station i.e eNodeB is described Then the impacts of different kinds of FCD transmission schemes on the H2H trafìc are compared by investigating the blocking ratio of the H2H trafìc in section VI Finally a conclusion is drawn in section VII II R ELATED WORK In the area of V2I communication there have been a lot of articles about heterogeneous network In an L TE-V ANET heterogeneous network was designed In the network some vehicles are selected as gateway between LTE and VANET and then coalition game theory was applied to stimulate other vehicles to join coalition which has a gateway and some other vehicles to ensure the proper functioning of the LTE-VANET heterogeneous network In the cluster head selection problem in LTE-VANET heterogeneous network was discussed In  an architecture that inte grates 3G/UMTS netw orks with VANET was introduced and the authors aimed at selecting a minimum number of gateways All above mentioned three papers provide appropriate architectures of cellular-VANET heterogeneous network They focused on the structure design and gateway organization However they did not discuss in detail the performance of some vehicular application in those architectures in spite of in which FTP traf c was evaluated Authors in scanned and discussed some work and running standardization about using LTE to support vehicular

trafìc on H2H trafìc i.e the blocking ratio of H2H trafìc in case of different V2I trafìc density Secondly we consider a scenario that M vehicles which are adjacent can compose a cluster and in each cluster one cluster head is selected which collects the FCD data from cluster members and compresses as well as relays it to LTE base station i.e eNodeB Then each vehicle has the probability of 1 M to be selected as a cluster head and the arrival ratio of cluster head is  v M  As mentioned above the FCD data of one vehicle is 1 kByte so the FCD data needed to be sent by a cluster head is M kBytes Cluster heads compress data of cluster members before sending it to the eNodeB The compression ratio is   The regular running of cluster architecture needs control data We deìne  as the result of dividing the size of FCD date by the size of FCD and control data As a result the service rates of the cluster heads are  7   M     8   M     12   M    By using formula 3 and 4 we can calculate the impact of V2I trafìc on H2H trafìc i.e the blocking ratio of H2H trafìc in case of different V2I trafìc density when FCD data is compressed and relayed to eNodeB by cluster heads V A NOVEL FCD TRANSMISSION SCHEME In this section we provide a novel FCD transmission scheme in LTE-VANET heterogeneous network as shown in g 5 The scheme comprises two components The rst one is avoiding some valueless FCD data transmission Second selecting the optimal cluster head i.e gateway of the cluster can cut down the RB consumption of V2I trafìc and consequently reduce the negative impact of V2I trafìc on H2H trafìc Firstly we design an algorithm to avoid useless FCD data transmission When the velocity and direction of a vehicle is unchanged between two FCD data samplings the second FCD data is valueless It is because the location information velocity information and the direction information in the FCD data can be used to predict the condition of the vehicle in TABLE V C LUSTER H EADS I

120 7/4800  v 7 10 the following FCD data samplings A vehicle can compare its condition and the prediction by their last FCD data If the error isnêt large than a threshold   the vehicle neednêt generate a new FCD data Otherwise the vehicle generates a new FCD data and sends it to cluster head or eNodeB  is composed by  l   v and  d  which represent the maximum tolerable error values of the prediction of location velocity and driving direction respectively We observed the traces of several taxis for a long observation period through GPS system to calculate the ratio of valueless FCD data We found that the ratio depends on road shape and trafìc condition Assigning  l 2 m   v 5 km/h   d 10 o and frequency of FCD data 1Hz the ratio of valueless FCD data  is range from 10 to 50 in different road shapes and trafìc conditions When generation of valueless FCD data is avoided the arrival rate of cluster head drops to 1      v M  Secondly selecting the optimal cluster head which has the best LTE channel condition the lowest velocity and the highest SNR can cut down the RB consumption of V2I trafìc and consequently reduce the negative impact of V2I trafìc on H2H trafìc Because cluster numbers are adjacent to each other we assume that the SNRs of cluster numbers are within same SNR fraction and the velocities of cluster numbers are within two different velocity fractions v  90 km/h and 90 km/h v  Therefore the optimal cluster head is the vehicle with the lowest velocity As mentioned above the velocities of vehicles are equally divided between the two velocity fractions If vehicles are randomly compose a cluster with size M  then the probability that at least one cluster numberês velocity is within the rst velocity fraction is 1  1  2 M  After the optimal cluster head selection the ratio of the arrival ratio of cluster head with velocity within the rst fraction and the arrival ratio of cluster head with higher velocity is 1  1  2 M  1  2 M  Then the arrival rates of cluster heads in six kinds of channel conditions are 1  1  2 M   1      v 3  M  1  2 M  1      v 3  M  1  1  2 M   1      v 3  M  1  2 M  1      v 3  M  1  1  2 M   1      v 3  M  1  2 M  1      v 3  M respectively It is quite clear that the arrival rate of cluster head with bad LTE channel condition i.e high velocity declines VI R ESULTS In this section we assume that M 5  0.3  0.4 in tar-gzip format and  0.7 and present the parameters of Markovian models for different FCD transmission schemes in table IV and V The blocking probability of H2H or V2I trafìc vs arrival rate of V2I devices for different FCD transmission schemes are calculated and shown in g 6 or g 7 There are four FCD transmission schemes The rst one is transmitting the FCD data from vehicle to eNodeB directly The second one is a channel sensitive transmission scheme CST in which some vehicles in bad channel condition high velocity and low SNR transmit FCD to eNodeB directly with a lower 2014 21st

  Fig 6 Blocking probability of H2H users vs arrival rate of V2I communication probability than in good channel condition low velocity and high SNR There are two parameters in CST  and 012  to control the intensity of the channel sensitive transmission scheme In g 6 and g 7  and 012 are all set as 0.5 The third one is gathering FCD data by a cluster head which transmit the gathered FCD to eNodeB The forth one is similar to the third one The difference is in the forth scheme we cut down RB consumption of FCD data by avoiding some useless FCD data and selecting the optimal cluster head AU&OCH Comparing the curves of the rst scheme and the third scheme in g 6 it is obviously that transmitting FCD data by combining LTE and VANET has less impact on H2H trafìc than transmitting FCD data by LTE only The reason for that is cluster head in VANET can compress the FCD data of cluster numbers It is same why V2I trafìc blocking fate fo the third scheme is lower than the rst one as shown in g 7 It can be seen in g 6 or g 7 that the blocking probability of H2H or V2I trafìc of the second scheme is lower than the rst and third schemes It is because some vehicles in bad channel condition may not generate FCD data to transmit Compared with other three schemes the forth one has the best performance since we cut down RB consumption of FCD data by avoiding some useless FCD data and selecting the optimal cluster head VII C ONCLUSION In this paper a novel FCD transmission scheme in LTEVANET heterogeneous network is designed We evaluate the impact of FCD transmission in LTE network and LTE-VANET heterogeneous network on H2H trafìc by using a Markovian model and compare our scheme with previous schemes The results show that compared with other schemes the novel scheme has a relatively lower negative impact on the conventional cellular trafìc H2H trafìc Therefore by using the novel FCD transmission scheme H2H trafìc and FCD trafìc can be served by the LTE network simultaneously and have a relatively smaller impact on each other However the impact of FCD on the LTE H2H trafìc is reduced at the expense of increasing the overhead on the VANET In the future we will analyze the combination of FCD trafìc an beacon trafìc in VANET to relieving the impact of FCD trafìc on VANET   Fig 7 Blocking probability of V2I users vs arrival rate of V2I communication A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work has been partially sponsored by EU FP7 IRSES MobileCloud Project Grant No 612212 111 Project No.B08004 the major project of Ministry of Industry and Informationization of China 2013ZX03001026 and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities R EFERENCES  Jiang Daniel and Luca Delgrossi IEEE 802.11 p T o w ards an international standard for wireless access in vehicular environments Vehicular Technology Conference 2008 VTC Spring 2008 IEEE  IEEE 2008  Li Y uyi et al Cooperati v e data dissemination in cellular V ANET heterogeneous wireless networks High Speed Intelligent Communication Forum HSIC 2012 4th International  IEEE 2012  Si v araj Rajarajan et al QoS-enabled group communication in inte grated VANET-LTE heterogeneous wireless networks Wireless and Mobile Computing Networking and Communications WiMob 2011 IEEE 7th International Conference on  IEEE 2011  Benslimane Abderrahim T arik T aleb and Rajarajan Si v araj Dynamic clustering-based adaptive mobile gateway management in integrated VANETõ3G Heterogeneous Wireless Networks Selected Areas in Communications IEEE Journal on 29.3 2011 559-570  Remy  Guillaume et al Lte4v2x Lte for a centralized v anet or ganization Global Telecommunications Conference GLOBECOM 2011 2011 IEEE  IEEE 2011  Araniti Giuseppe et al L TE for v ehicular netw orking a surv e y   Communications Magazine IEEE 51.5 2013 148-157  Ide Christoph et al Ef cient Floating Car Data T ransmission via LTE for Travel Time Estimation of Vehicles Vehicular Technology Conference VTC Fall 2012 IEEE  IEEE 2012  Ide Christoph et al Channel sensiti v e transmission scheme for V2Ibased Floating Car Data collection via LTE Communications ICC 2012 IEEE International Conference on  IEEE 2012  Y aacoub Elias and Nizar Zorba Enhanced connecti vity in v ehicular ad-hoc networks via V2V communications Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing Conference IWCMC 2013 9th International  IEEE 2013  3GPP TR 25.996 V6.1.0 Spatial channel model for Multiple Input Mutiple Output MIMO simulations September 2003  Kaufman Joseph Blocking in a shared resource en vironment  Communications IEEE Transactions on 29.10 1981 1474-1481 2014 21st International Conference on Telecommunications \(ICT 92

server which would create a session compute the current shortest paths and return the edge list to the requester with a session identiìer In subsequent requests the requester need only reference the session identiìer and receive a list of edge insertions and deletions since the last query that can be used to keep the requester in sync with the server The visualization corresponding to such a query can be seen in Fig 7\(b We have also used monitor processes to periodically checkpoint the state of the graph to disk for an additional layer of resilience Monitor processes can perform tasks such as checking the consistency of metadata within the data structure to identify errors We provide a monitor process that periodically snapshots a client result store to a MongoDB instance VI C

be most important will be stored This environment will create the need for new infrastructures and execution models for computation In this paper we have described the STINGER framework for streaming data analytics The system utilizes heterogeneous clusters to ingest data from multiple social media services form in-memory graph representations of relational data store raw data in traditional databases for historical search and give analysts up-to-the-minute insight into a suite of streaming analytics The system design is focused on performance and modularity minimizing latency and increasing throughput The infrastructure that we have described is free and open source software It is BSD licensed and available at www.stingergraph.com  In Figure 7 you will nd screenshots of several web-based tools that have been implemented on the STINGER architecture These tools combine complex graph analytics topic classiìcation text sentiment analysis and geolocation for real-time
