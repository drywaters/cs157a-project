Heterogeneity-Aware Data Regeneration in Distributed Storage Systems Yan Wang   Dongsheng Wei   Xunrui Yin   and Xin Wang   School of Computer Science Fudan University Shanghai China  Department of Computer Science University of Calgary Canada Abstract Distributed storage systems provide large-scale reliable data storage services by spreading redundancy across a large group of storage nodes In such big systems node failures take place on a regular basis When a node fails or leaves the system to maintain the same level of redundancy it is expected to regenerate the redundant data at a replacement node as soon as possible Previous studies aim to minimize the network traf“c in the regeneration process but in practical networks where link capacities vary in a wide range minimizing network traf“c does not always mean minimizing regeneration time Considering the heterogeneous link capacities Li et al proposed a tree-structured regeneration scheme called RCTREE to bypass the low-capacitated link encountered in direct transmissions However we nd that RCTREE may rapidly lose data integrity after several regenerations In this paper we reconsider the problem of minimizing regeneration time in networks with heterogeneous link capacities We derive the minimum amount of data to be transmitted through each link to preserve data integrity We prove that building an optimal regeneration tree is NP-complete and propose a heuristic algorithm for a near-optimal solution We further introduce a exible regeneration scheme which allows providers to generate different amount of coded data Simulation results show that the exible tree-structured regeneration scheme can reduce the regeneration time signi“cantly I I NTRODUCTION Large-scale distributed storage systems are widely used today to provide reliable data storage service by spreading data redundancy over a large number of storage nodes Users can access their data anytime anywhere Such application scenarios include large data centers like Google File Systems  T otal Recall 3 OceanStore 4 and peer to-peer storage systems such as Wuala In such big systems nodes fail frequently and the failures should be handled on a routine basis After a node fails or leaves the system the reliability degrades and the protected data becomes vulnerable To maintain the same level of redundancy it is important to regenerate the lost data at a replacement node called newcomer  as soon as possible  A direct w a y t o solv e this problem is to minimize the amount of data transferred during the repair process Thus Yan Wang is

bandwidth and storage ef“ciency with two extremal cases the minimum-storage regenerating MSR point where each node stores the minimum amount of data and the minimum-bandwidth regenerating MBR point where the storage ef“ciency is sacri“ced for minimum repair bandwidth For simplicity they assumed each surviving node participating in the regeneration called provider  sends the same amount of data to the newcomer However minimizing repair bandwidth does not always mean minimizing regeneration time especially in heterogeneous networks where link capacities vary in a wide range The heterogeneous networks are common in distributed storage systems For example within a data center servers are usually placed in racks and servers in the same rack enjoy much higher bandwidth than those located in different racks Meanwhile the available bandwidths among servers are different because of different background traf“cs even if the link capacities are the same The dif ference of link bandwidths becomes even larger when using multiple geo-distributed data centers for distributed storage which is a conventional practice for large companies e.g Google to safeguard their users data from the failure of an entire data center In these netw orks the time of regeneration process is determined not only by the amount of data transmitted from providers to the newcomer but also by the bandwidths of bottleneck links between them For fast regeneration in heterogeneous networks Li et al  ha v e proposed a tree-structured topology data regeneration with regenerating codes called RCTREE  They achieve high utilization of network links by building a tree-structured path to transfer data in addition to reducing the regeneration traf“c by coding data on the intermediate node of the tree However because of transmitting insuf“cient amount of data their codes may lose data integrity i.e  the data collector may fail to reconstruct the original le Speci“cally a distributed storage system is usually described with parameters  n k d   where n is the number of storage nodes k is the number of nodes accessed by data collector to reconstruct the le and d is the number of providers participating in the regeneration In literature the ability to reconstruct the le from any k storage nodes is called MDS property 10 In this paper we study the problem of minimizing regeneration time

tree-structured regeneration approach with regenerating codes for which we develop the information ow graph method from Using this method we derive the minimum amount of data to be transmitted on each link of a given regeneration tree and formulate the problem of building an optimal regeneration tree to minimize the regeneration time Unfortunately we nd this problem is NP-complete mainly because the ow on each link exhibits a correlation with the number of providers using this link We propose a heuristic algorithm called Tree-structured Regeneration TR to nd a near-optimal regeneration tree Second we introduce a new approach to further reduce the regeneration time by exibly determining the amount of data generated by each provider In previous studies such as regenerating codes and RCTREE they both assume that each provider generates the same amount of coded data to be transmitted to the newcomer However we nd that this assumption is not necessary If we allow the provider with low end-to-end bandwidth to generate less data the regeneration time will be further reduced Note that as a compromise the provider with high end-to-end bandwidth will have to generate more coded data to maintain the MDS property We derive a suf“cient condition for determining the amount of data generated by each provider to preserve the MDS property and combine it with the tree-structured regeneration scheme The resultant regeneration scheme is called Flexible Treestructured Regeneration FTR These ideas can be intuitively illustrated with the example shown in Fig 1 Consider the overlay network shown in Fig 1\(a where v 0 is the newcomer and v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 are the d 4 providers The bandwidths are labeled on the links which range from 5 Mbps to 60 Mbps We assume that the redundancy is coded as an  n 5 k 2 MDS code such that any 2 out of 5 storage nodes are able to reconstruct the le Suppose the size of the original le is M  480 Mb and each storage node stores   M/k  240 Mb In order to regenerate the lost data at v 0  regenerating codes require downloading   M k  d  k 1 80 Mb data from each provider Fig 1\(b shows the conventional regeneration scheme STAR which uses the star-structured topology v 0 receives data directly from the four providers The regeneration time of STAR is determined by the slowest transmission which takes  15 M bps 5  33 seconds Fig 1\(c shows the regeneration tree used by TR and RCTREE They coincide with the same tree in this example In RCTREE each provider generates  coded data with its local storage encodes them with its received data if any and nally transmit  data to its parent node which means v 1 only transmits  data to v 0 in the example We nd that this is not suf“cient for the MDS property refer to Sec II for more details According to our analysis the minimum amount of data transferred on edge  v 1 v 0  is 2   160 Mb at least Thus it costs TR max  2  60 M bps   20 M bps  4 seconds to accomplish the regeneration Fig 1\(d shows the exible tree-structured regeneration FTR scheme Each provider is allowed to generate different amount of coded data We nd that if providers v 1 v 2 v 3 v 4 generate  1 90 Mb  2 90 Mb  3 60 Mb  4 90 Mb respectively and v 1 transmits  1   4  180 Mb to v 0  the MDS property is maintained The regeneration time of FTR is reduced to max   1   4 60 M bps   3 20 M bps   4 35 M bps   2 50 M bps  3 seconds To evaluate the performances of our algorithms we implement all these regeneration schemes and run simulations with practical link capacities Experimental results show that according to the variance of link capacities our proposed algorithm can reduce the regeneration time by 10  90  compared with conventional regenerating codes And the FTR scheme even outperforms RCTREE in many scenarios The remainder of the paper is organized as follows In Sec II we formulate the process of data regeneration in distributed storage systems and analyze the loss of MDS property in RCTREE by theory and practice In Sec III we reconsider the tree-structured regeneration scheme by analyzing the corresponding information ow graph In Sec IV we propose a exible scheme based on tree-structured

5 for short is NP-complete To demonstrate this we start with the formal de“nition of the ORT problem De“nition 1 For a given overlay network G  V E  with link capacity c  u v    u v   E  the optimal regeneration tree problem is to nd a spanning tree T such that its regeneration time max  f  u,v   c  u,v    u v   T  is minimized where f  u v in  m u    and m u is the number of nodes in the sub-tree rooted at u  To study the complexity of ORT problem it is equivalent to restate this optimization problem as a decision problem which aims to determine whether the regeneration time of an optimal regeneration tree is no more than 1  The following theorem shows that this problem is NP-complete Theorem 2 The ORT problem is NP-complete Proof We rst show that ORT  NP Suppose we are given a graph G  V E   The certi“cate we choose is the optimal regeneration tree T  The veri“cation algorithm checks for each edge  u v   T  that f  u,v  c  u,v   1  This veri“cation can be performed in polynomial time We now prove that the ORT problem is NP-hard by reduction from the VERTEX-COVER problem which is known to be NP-complete In particular given an undirected graph G  V E  and an integer k  the VERTEX-COVER problem asks whether all edges can be covered by k nodes where node u  V can cover edge e  E only if they are adjacent For an instance of the VERTEX-COVER problem we construct a regeneration scenario in an overlay network G   V  E    such that the regeneration time is less than 1 if and only if G has a vertex cover of size k  We construct G  in the following way G  has four layers of nodes The rst layer has only one node that is the root t  The second layer has two nodes node a and node b  Both a and b are connected to the root The link capacity of edge  a t  is k   E  1 and the link capacity of edge  b t  is unlimited The nodes in the third layer correspond to the vertices in graph G  all of them are connected to both a and b  The link capacity of their edges connected to a is unlimited and the link capacity of edges connected to b is 1  The nodes in the last layer correspond to the edges in graph G  Each node in the last layer is connected to two nodes in the third layer which is connected by the corresponding edge in graph G  The link capacity of these edges which connect the nodes in the third layer to the nodes in the last layer is unlimited Links which are not mentioned in the construction are supposed to have zero capacity From the construction graph G  can be constructed from G in polynomial time Fig 6 shows an example of this reduction Fig 6\(a is an instance  G k 2 of the VERTEX-COVER problem Fig 6\(b is the graph G  constructed from  G k   We next show that this transformation of G into G  is a reduction First suppose that G has a vertex cover set V   V  where  V    k  We claim that we can nd a tree whose regeneration time is no more than 1  We construct this tree according to the vertex cover for each node e i of the fourth layer let its parent be v j which covers the edge e i in the vertex cover of G  For each node v i of the third layer let its parent a b Fig 6 Reducing VERTEX-COVER problem to Optimal Regeneration Tree problem a An undirected graph G  V E  with k 2  b The graph produced by the reduction procedure be a  if it belongs to the vertex cover V   Otherwise let its parent be b  Finally let the parent of a and b be the root It can be veri“ed the regeneration time is 1  Conversely suppose that G  has a tree whose regeneration time is no more than 1  Then we claim that the edges of G can be covered by no more than k nodes Let V   V be the set of nodes that correspond to children of node a in the regeneration tree First V  is a vertex cover of G since otherwise some nodes in the fourth layer will have to be connected to the root through b  causing some ow entering b larger than 1 and the regeneration time less than 1  Second  V   k because there are no more than k   E  1 nodes transferring data from node a to root t  and as all the  E  nodes in the fourth layer must transfer data through the link a to t  the number of third layer nodes with parent a is no more than k to ensure the ow on the link a to t is no more than k   E  1  C The heuristic algorithm In this section we propose a heuristic algorithm to solve the ORT problem mentioned in Sec III-B The algorithm is inspired by Prims algorithm for the maximum weighted spanning tree problem We start from a tree containing only the newcomer and iteratively add the remaining nodes to the regeneration tree until it spans all providers In each iteration we try all possible positions for each remaining provider and choose the best one and position to add it to the regeneration tree The details are shown in Algorithm 1 The most time consuming step is to test all possible positions for each provider which has  V  2 choices Each test takes O   V   to compute the regeneration time Thus the algorithm runs in polynomial time O   V  3   IV T REE STRUCTURED R EGENERATION WITH F LEXIBLE E ND TO E ND T RAFFICS In section III we assume that each provider has the same amount of data to be transmitted to the newcomer This assumption is actually not necessary As the available bandwidth varies for different providers we may repair faster if we allow providers to generate different number of blocks according to their bandwidths IEEE

8 case Since the process of exibly determining  is done after TR algorithm We also nd that FTR algorithm can save more regeneration time than TR algorithm when d grows B Effect of the bandwidth variance In order to show the impact of network bandwidth variance we run simulations with 5 different link capacity distributions U 1 0  3  120 Mbps U 2 3  120 Mbps U 3 30  120 Mbps U 4 60  120 Mbps U 5 90  120 Mbps The number of providers d is set to 10  Results are shown in Fig 8 In general the performance of our algorithms is better when the variance of network bandwidth is large For uniform distribution U 1 0  3  120 Mbps both TR and FTR can reduce 90 of regeneration time compared with the traditional STAR scheme When the variance of network bandwidth becomes small for example at U 4 60  120 Mbps and U 5 90  120 Mbps TR has the same regeneration time as STAR but FTR still reduces the regeneration time by 10  20   0.3,120]Mbps 3,120]Mbps 30,120]Mbps 60,120]Mbps 90,120]Mbps 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 Regeneration time percentage MSR, n = 20, k = 5, d = 10, file size = 1GB   RCTREE/STAR TR/STAR FTR/STAR Fig 8 Regeneration time of RCTREE TR and FTR normalized by STAR for different bandwidth The parameters are n 20 k 5 d 10 and M 1 GB C Effect of the storage capacity per node  Our previous tests mainly focus on the MSR point which achieves the optimal storage ef“ciency However as shown by Dimakis et al  the repair bandwidth can be reduced by storing more data on each storage node Speci“cally the MBR point achieves the minimum repair bandwidth We vary the storage  from the MSR point to the MBR point to test its impact on our algorithms Fig 9 shows the regeneration time for different   We can see that every regeneration schemes repair faster as  grows to the minimum repair bandwidth point and the tendencies of different repair schemes are the same Compared with STAR we nd that the ratio of reduced regeneration time does not change much for different values of   This implies that our previous simulation results and conclusions for the MSR case also apply to different storage   205 211 221 236 256 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Storage per node MB Regeneration time\(s n = 20, k = 5,d = 10, file size = 1GB, bandwidth = [10,120]Mbps   STAR RCTREE TR FTR MSR MBR Fig 9 Regeneration time of STAR RCTREE TR and FTR vs storage capacity of each node    where  vary from MSR point to MBR point The parameters are n 20 k 5 d 10 and M 1 GB VI R ELATED W ORK Li et al  rst considered the heterogeneity of netw ork bandwidth in data regeneration process and proposed a treestructured regeneration scheme to reduce the regeneration time They also proposed a scheme of building parallel regeneration trees to further reduce the regeneration time in the network with asymmetric links Ho we v e r  the y only discussed the case that the regeneration scheme requires k providers which means the minimal regeneration traf“c is equal to the size of original le M  To further reduce the regeneration time they considered the regenerating codes in the tree-structured regeneration scheme and proposed RCTREE in The y emplo y a minimum-storage re generating MSR codes in RCTREE which means the minimal regeneration traf“c is d k  d  k 1 M bytes i.e  in a regeneration with d providers each provider sends  d  k 1 blocks to its parent node To make sure that the newcomer has enough information to restore  blocks it has to receive data directly from at least d  k 1 providers The details of how to construct an optimal regeneration tree can be found in Algorithm 1 in their paper  Although the y h a v e done this in their algorithm to ensure that the degree of newcomer is at least d  k 1  the MDS property can not be preserved after data regeneration Sun et al  considered the scenario of repairing multiple data losses and proposed two algorithms based on treestructured regeneration to reduce the regeneration time However they assumed the amount of data transferred between providers and newcomer is designed to be the same as  in regenerating codes According to our analysis their regeneration schemes can not preserve the MDS property either Some researches such as 17 considered the heterogeneity of nodes availability and optimized the erasure code deployment to reduce the data redundancy Some researches such as jointly considered the repair cost and heterogeneity of communication\(download cost on each links They exibly determine the amount of data to minimize the total repair cost which is different from the regeneration time IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer Communications 1885 


9 VII C ONCLUSION We reconsider the problem of how to reduce the regeneration time in networks with heterogeneous link capacities We analyze the minimum amount of data to be transmitted on each link of the regeneration tree and prove that the problem of building optimal regeneration tree is NP-complete We propose a heuristic algorithm to construct a near-optimal regeneration tree and further reduce the regeneration time by allowing non-uniform end-to-end repair traf“cs Simulation results show that our regeneration schemes are able to maintain the MDS property and reduce the regeneration time by 10  90 compared with traditional star-structured regenerating codes With the non-uniform end-to-end repair traf“cs we can exibly determine the amount of coded data generated by each provider

method increases slightly which is due to two reasons 1 the data before In this experiment we investigate the performance of OLTP queries when OLAP queries are running The workload is update-only and the keys being updated are uniformly distributed We launch ten clients to concurrently submit the updates when the system is deployed on 100 nodes Each client starts ten threads each of which submits one million updates 100 updates in batch Another client is launched to submit the data cube slice query That is one OLAP query and approximately 50,000 updates are concurrently processed in R-Store The system reaches its maximum usage in this setting based on our observation When the system is deployed on other number of nodes the number of clients submitting updates is adjusted accordingly Figure 11\(a shows the throughput of the system The throughput increases as the number of nodes increases which demonstrates the scalability of the system However when OLAP queries are running the update performance is lower than running only OLTP queries This result is expected because the OLAP queries compete for resources with the OLTP queries We also evaluate the latency of updates when the system is approximately fully used As shown in Figure 11\(b the aggregated response time for 1000 updates are similar with respect to varying scales VII C ONCLUSION MapReduce is a parallel execution

MapReduce HBase-R has to scan all the of the table Since the is materialized to HDFS when it is full these 223les are sorted by time Thus instead of scanning all the and between  only the between   are scanned The value of decides the freshness of the result There is a trade-off between the performance of the query and the freshness of the result the smaller is the fewer real-time data are scanned Figure 9 shows the query processing time with different freshness ratios which is de\223ned as the percentage of the real-time data we have to scan for the query In this experiment  1600 million and 800 million updates on 1 distinct keys are submitted to HBase-R When the freshness ratio is 0 the input of the query is only the data cube Thus the cost of scanning the real-time data is 0 When the freshness ratio increases to 10 the cost of scanning the real-time data is around 1500 seconds because the cost of scanning the real-time table dominates the OLAP query As the freshness ratio increases the running time of and  and when it is not  and  We submit 800 million updates to the server each day and the percentage of keys updated is 223xed to 1 The data cube is refreshed at the beginning of each day and the OLAP query is submitted to the server at the end of the day Since the data are compacted after the data cube refresh the amount of data stored in the real-time table are almost the same at the same time of each day The processing time of and are thus almost constant In contrast when the compaction scheme is turned off HBase-R stores much more data and the cost of locally scanning these data becomes larger than the cost of shuf\224ing the data to MapReduce As a result the processing time of and increases over time and and a user speci\223ed timestamp still need to be scanned and 2 the amount of data shuf\224ed to mappers are roughly the same with different ratios Figure 10 depicts the effectiveness of our compaction scheme In this experiment we measure the

the data scanned by MapReduce are unchanged during the execution of a MapReduce job In reality the real-time results from the most recently updated data are more meaningful for decision making In this paper we propose R-Store for supporting real-time OLAP on MapReduce R-Store leverages stable technology HBase and HStreaming and extends them to achieve high performance and scalability The storage system of R-Store adopts multi-version concurrency control to support real-time OLAP To reduce the storage requirement it periodically materializes the real-time data into a data cube and compacts the historical versions into one version During query processing the proposed adaptive incremental scan operation shuf\224es the real-time data to MapReduce ef\223ciently The data cube and the newly updated data are combined in MapReduce to return the real-time results In addition based on our proposed cost model the more ef\223cient query processing method is selected To evaluate the performance of R-Store we have conducted extensive experimental study using the TPCH data The experimental results show that our system can support real-time OLAP queries much more ef\223ciently than the baseline methods Though the performance of OLTP degrades slightly due to the competition for resources with OLAP the response time and throughput remain good and acceptable A CKNOWLEDGMENT The work described
