Context-aware work\224ow systems can adapt their behavior based on the changes of real world which is often gathered by a big amount of sensors Thus the modeling of context-aware work\224ow is the key issue in context-aware 
work\224ow systems because context information is often varied and complex To better describe context information in business processes this paper proposes an OWL-based Web Ontology Language approach to model context-aware work\224ows The context model and process model elements is de\223ned based on OWL so it can not only express the context information involved in business processes but also the corresponding work\224ow control items as OWL The modeling rules which make the model more normalized are also designed Case study and analysis show that our approach has good adaptability and can be used to easily describe any sophisticated context-aware work\224ows Work\224ow Context-Aware Computing Work\224ow Model OWL

1 INTRODUCTION 
With the development of work\224ow technology work\224ow management system has been greatly applied in enterprise business process management\(BPM Work\224ow management system as an integration platform of enterprise business process plays a key role in business process automation and highly effective workfow management With the deepened application of work\224ow technology people have realized the disadvantage of traditional work\224ow management system when capturing and utilizing the context information of business processes In traditional BPM the context is not considered in architecture design and it lacks context expressing mechanism and context modeling On the other hand with the arrival of Internet of Things 
and Mobile Internet era business processes becomes increasingly closely related with context so the business process needs to be advanced and executed under contextaware environment to make it more smooth and intelligent Context-aware work\224ow modeling is the fundamental problem of context-aware work\224ow management system\(CWMS Context-aware work\224ow model needs to include the context information such as activity context elements control 224ow data stream role and actor etc Although current work\224ow languages such as WS-BPEL WSFL and XLANG can specify the data 224ow among services based on Web services these work\224ow languages do not support the ability to select services using context pro 
223le or event information in ubiquitous computing environments Therefore it is dif\223cult to express the relationships among the services using traditional work\224ow languages in ubiquitous computing en element

2014 26th Chinese Control and Decision Conference CCDC 4162 OWL is a ontology modeling language developed by W3C OWL language has the following characteristics 1 Major language elements of OWL language are class property individual among which property is categorized into object property and datatype property 2 Class in OWL that is essentially a set concept is different from the class in the program design languages Class of OWL includes subClass and superClass and any class is its own subclass and superclass In fact we can consider subclass as subset and superclass as superset In OWL two classes Thing and Nothing are prede\223ned The thing class can be seen as a universal set and Nothing can be seen as empty set 2 DEFINITIONS OF CONTEXT-AWARE WORKFLOW 3 CONTEXT-AWARE WORKFLOW MODELING 3.1 OWL Language is in the awaited state the context management system produces an event noti\223cation After that the work\224ow system delivers the event noti\223cation to the concrete work\224ow instance By de\223ning event handlers the work\224ow can react to the occurring event in a prede\223ned way A context query allows synchronous query oriented the access of context data with a query language The query language can support object selection based on the spatial predicates and the 223ltering of the results A context decision allows the process to route process control 224ow based on context data using context-aware operators The context data used by the context-aware operators can be internal process data or can be gathered by a context query from process external sources Liliana Ardissono et al proposed Context Aware Work\224ow Execution\(CAWE framew which used abstract work\224ow description method for context-aware work\224ow modeling The abstract work\224ow is a work\224ow that has at least one abstract activity Each abstract activity has an associated set of context-dependent implementations representing the alternative courses of action which the work\224ow engine should actuate depending on the context This paper mainly study context description and contextaware process integration methods in work\224ow environment which are the most important problem in contextaware work\224ow a context-aware work\224ow modeling approach using Web Ontology Language\(OWL is proposed OWL that based on ontology when it is used for modeling complex context in work\224ow exhibits unique advantages OWL can completely describe and express context in work\224ow is platform independent and supports logic reasoning etc This paper is organized as follows in section 2 basic concepts of context-aware work\224ow are introduced section 3 presents context-aware work\224ow modeling methods based on OWL a modeling instance of the proposed modeling method is given in section 4 we summarize this paper in section 5 Context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity An entity is a person place or object that is considered relevant to the interaction between a user and an application including the user and applications themselv Conte xt can be cate gorized as follo ws according its attributes 1 Computing context\204network connectivity communication cost communication bandwidth and nearby resources etc 2 User context\204user location pro\223les and social status etc 3 Physical context\204temperature brightness noise traf\223c condition etc 4 Time context\204hour minute day week season etc 5 Social context\204institution law custom and habit etc De\223nition 1 Context-aware work\224ow management system\(CWMS CWMS is a work\224ow management system that is context-aware CWMS can capture recognize analyze and understand environment information can react intelligently according to context information especially in Internet of Things and mobile internet environments In CWMS the functions of context are 1 transfer 2 allocation 3 instance starting 4\ork\224ow exception handling 1 Transition condition It is a basic working mode When a work\224ow instance is executing work\224ow engine that uses context to control work\224ow routing determines work\224ow transition according to the user location network bandwidth user\220s social state etc 2 Work\224ow resource allocation In a task node of the work\224ow the actor is called resource\(operator application machinery and equipment etc The status of resource are considered as context The performance of work\224ow management system can be greatly enhanced according to the context baesd resource allocation For instance resource can be allocated according to the operator\220s state\(idle/busy and the context-aware system evaluates the operator\220s busyness degree according to the related sensors in intelligent space and the work\224ow engine pushes tasks according to the degree and the tasks can be reallocated to the idle operators 3 Work\224ow instance starting When an event occurs in the context work\224ow instance is started according to the prede\223ned rules For example in a smart warehouse when the stock of one instrument falls below its threshold then the context-aware system will trigger a corresponding inventory inef\223ciency event Driven by this event work\224ow engine will automatically start a purchase process and notify related staff to purchase the instruments 4 Work\224ow exception handling Work\224ow exception means that activity failure and/or work\224ow failure caused by outer exception of work\224ow system exception of work\224ow and activity execution exception which causes the work\224ow does not work normally according to the prede\223ned work\224ow model Work\224ow management system can handle the exceptions when the process is executing according to context thereby enhances its exception handling ability of work\224ow

  to reach to the RL again \(slow start phase duration\. Then the congestion avoidance phase is ente red. This is the reason why the forwarding rate decreases and increases alternately. This process is performed over and over until the end of the attack This is determined when the PF senses that the incoming rate is less than the forwarding rate \(the drop rate is zero In the proposed system, the filtering decision is made by the module at the victim end, so the module does not incur any overhead on the edge routers for making such filtering decisions. In addition, filtering is an embedded and a key feature of almost all the Internet edge routers, so there is no overhead related to installing such a feature on an edge router. The overhead of the modules on the edge routers is as low as computing the packet drop rate and communicating with the module by sending the ACK and the update messages. Therefore, a very low processing overhead \(in our experiments a few milliseconds\ incurred at the edge routers V C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  One of the major defense chal lenges against DDoS attacks is how to control the attack traffic to preserve the quality of service of the legitimate traffic. To address this issue, we have proposed TDFA, a traceback based defense system against flooding attacks that make use of spoofed addresses. The proposed framework uses the strategy of detecting the attack as well as finding the source of the attack at the victim end, and responding to the attack at the source end. These tasks are carried out by the traffic adjustment module \(TF\, DFM IP traceback algorithm at the victim end, and the packet filtering module at the edge router of the source end, respectively The recovery process is also triggered if the traffic returns to normal. In this work, we have implemented and evaluated the proposed system, TDFA, against the real-world DDoS and normal traffic traces. Our results show that TDFA efficiently drops the attack packets at the source end of the attack, while imposing a low overhead on the edge routers participating in the defense. Moreover, the location of defense modules are fully in line with the location of DFM IP traceback modules making the scheme more deployable. For future work, we plan to implement and evaluate the se curing of the TDFA system itself. In the absence of an appropriate security mechanism, an attacker can deceive the edge router into doing wrong filtering A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This research is supported by the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada \(NSERC\ grant, and is conducted as part of the Dalhousie NIMS Lab at https://projects.cs.dal.ca/projectx R EFERENCES  1

 11    Figure 7: Cost estimated per subsystem \(bar chart on top\of one spacecraft  Small Satellite Cost Model \(SSCM\ based on inputs for a candidate nano-satellite mission \(bottom excel spreadsheet   The SSCM model was then used to calculate the total cost of developing and manufacturing only the first small satellite of mass 10 kg and other specifications listed  Figure 7 The cost calculated for every subsystem and the total cost of $15.08 million in FY 2010 is therefore a function of technological variables like power and pointing and not just mass  To check the sensitivity of technology used to cost we varied some of the input parameters and checked its effect on cost in FY97 $million. Changing the data rate from 10 kbps to 10 MBps to 1 GBps resulted in a cost of $11.35 11.4 and 11.45 million respectively Since COTS products will be used to support the communication link these cost estimates imply that there will be only a 100,000 difference in deploying a radio transmitter 10 kbps\ or deploying an optical transmitter \(1 GBps\ on the 10 kg nano-satellite While previous proposals have certainly supported the availability for laser technologies 50   t h e o p tical d e m o n s tr ati o n s  t h at ar e c u r r en tl y  b ei n g  developed by DLR in Germany and the Aerospace Corporation in the US 51  clea r l y  d e m o n s tr ate  th a t t h e  cost of optical technology is more than that Similarly changing the pointing accuracy from 0.1 0.01 to 0.001 degrees resulted in the cost increasing from FY97 $ 6.45 11.33 and 22.21 million respectively The technology to support 0.1 degrees \(sun sensors\ is different from that to support 0.001 degrees star trackers However current COTS quotations \(e.g. Blue Canyon technologies XACT show that it costs 100,000 for a nanosat star tracker system Integration may cost a few additional thousands but estimating it to 18 million more sounds a bit too much  The SSCM sensitivity study above highlights the need to have cost models that are more sensitive to different technologies and their associated complexities Complexity and risk assessment has been proposed by the Aerospace Corporation in the form of their COBRA model  We used the COBRA model in our next study where the methodology and data sets are detailed in \([39   40    5 2     T h e d ata s et r elati v e to  w h ic h  co m p le x ities  ar e  calculated included 120 DoD and NASA missions from after FY89 excluded launch delays or failures and projects with heavy international cooperation. Complexity drivers include  Table 4  column 1 subsystem technical parameters e.g mass power performance technology choices\ and programmatic factors \(e.g., heritage, level of redundancy, foreign partnership  Forty such parameters are considered that are either continuous e.g mass power and represent a range of values bounded by a minimum and maximum, or discrete such as propulsion type \(none, cold gas, monopropellant bipropellant or ion engine\ that represent a finite number of choices    For our smallsat case study, the factors corresponding to spacecraft complexity as they proposed are listed in Table 4 along with the minimum and maximum value that the component takes within their data set The column  candidate nano-satellite which will be a part of a DSM  different 3D angles from the same ground spot as it formation flies in LEO 53  5 4 55    Fo r  ea ch  f ac to r   the complexity of the nanosat is calculated as a percentage of where the data point corresponding to the nanosat lies with respect to the data points for all the other space missions considered. For discrete data, the discrete rank of the data is assessed and then converted into a percentage The average complexity of the proposed nanosat is calculated to be 21.64 


 12  Table 4: Cost estimated for a spacecraft as a function of the relative complexity of its components with respect to components used in previous missions  Based Risk Assessment \(COBRA\ model. Inputs \(Data in Column 3\ are from a candidate nanosatellite mission    The map between complexity percentile and required mission cost and development time for successful missions green triangles is shown in Figure 8  using a green trend line. The missions plotted are among the 120 studied missions and equations are mentioned within the  attempted cheaper than or faster than this model predicts then there is a large probability of failure as highlighted by the red and yellow crosses on Figure 8  Using the above model the estimated cost for our candidate nanosatellite 10 kg mission is 35.824 million and the estimated development time is 35.074 months The high cost is in keeping with the intuition expressed in the data collection section that the cost of LEO small satellites are driven more by technology than mass so the utility of shrinking the satellite should be critically assessed and avoided if the mission technology is very state of art In such cases, micro satellites would win the performance to cost ratio battle    Figure 8: Predicted mission cost and development time as a function of relative mission complexity with respect to other missions evaluated by the Aerospace Corporation [39    4 0     5 2    M is s io n c o m ple x it y  is  a  function of component complexities as calculated in Table 4 The candidate mission is a LEO satellite measuring passive Earth reflectance as part of a DSM  We ran a sensitivity analysis for the COBRA model by varying the deltaV and pointing accuracy required by the candidate satellite It does a great job in predicting the increase in costs from 1 degree to 0.01 or 0.1 degree, by 


 13  estimating a $ 200-250 increase. It overshoots the COTS quotations by a slight margin but is certainly better than the SSCM estimate of  18 million more When the required delta-V is increased from none to 40 m/s to 80 m/s to 120 m/s the respective costs are estimated to be FY97 $ 35.79, 35.82, 35.85 and 35.88 million. Quotations from a 3D cold gas propulsion system printing company called AustinSat revealed that their 1U propulsion unit capable of providing 40 m/s of delta V costs 100,000 with 6DOF thrusters included and would scale almost linearly as more 1U units are added for 40 m/s of more delta-V  The COTS systems therefore cost more than what the COBRA model predicts. The model can thus be improved and made more suitable for COTS-supported small satellites if COTS data and figures were included in the data set to calculate complexity. Since we do not have the data set only the published Figure 8  we could not make the changes  Since many small satellite missions are collaborations between many organizations, the COBRA model could be improved by adding a foreign partnership complexity factor that captures the number of collaborators not just the nationality For example a recent paper 56   formulated a data supported method of capturing international cooperation related complexity using cyclometric  complexity where CGF  0.917  0.0575*CyclometricNumber and CyclometricNumber  f\(nodes, edges, outputs    Figure 9: Cost growth required to support increasing TRL for any component as published in [57    Small satellites are always pushing the boundaries of technology. It is very probable that some of its component values will fall out of range available from past missions In such a case, cost models of TRL transition such as the one shown in Figure 9  57  s h o u ld  b e in co r p o r ated  in to  the COBRA model for the relevant factors Although TRL transition correlates to the spending it does not follow traditional 80-20 rule The COBRA model also does not capture the structural complexity of a small tightly packed satellite which has been theoretically shown to drive development costs. Structural complexity can be quantified using a simple framework shown in Figure 10 35  34   an d  ca n  b e ea s il y  i n tr o d u ce d  i n  t h e COBRA model via a new factor and recalculating the data fit  Capturing the above development costs is important for small satellites whose costs are driven more by technology than by mass. Again, since we do not have the data set \(only the published Figure 8 we could not make the changes   Figure 10 Structural complexity metric introduced and validated in [35  a nd   3 4    5  C ONCLUSIONS    We identify three major problems with current cost and risk models that limit their direct application to estimating the costs of DSMs They are the absence of reliable learning curve factors small satellite 20 kg costing tools and operations costing  Existing models and methodologies that may be applicable in part to DSMs have been identified and presented using an extensive literature survey We select ed  some appropriate methods and applied them to estimate the cost of small satellites and small satellite DSMs The exercise helped us point out valuable insights and/or inconsistencies in the results with respect to the data We also suggest methods to modify the models so that they become more suitable for small satellite DSMs  As future work the operations cost model and dynamic complexity of the mission is expected to be captured by a Systems Dynamics Model Re sults from model simulations can provide insight into the effect of design and operation decisions on lifecycle cost and risk expected to improve upon the Monte Carlo results The model results can guide the trade-off of cost with performance and can help in the se lection of a final point design for any given DSM
