2014 IEEE International Conference on Acoustic Speech and Signal Processing ICASSP COMPUTING PERSISTENT FEATURES IN BIG DATA A DISTRIBUTED DIMENSION REDUCTION APPROACH Adam C Wilkerson Harish Chintakunta Hamid Krim North Carolina State University ABSTRACT Persistent homology has become one of the most popular tools used in topological data analysis for analyzing big data sets In an effort to minimize the computational complexity of finding the persistent homology of a data set we develop a simplicial collapse algorithm called the selective collapse This algorithm works by representing the previously devel oped strong collapse as a forest and uses that forest data to improve the speed of both the strong collapse and of per sistent homology Finally we demonstrate the savings in computational complexity using geometric random graphs Index TermsSimplicial complex persistent homology simplicial collapse topological data analysis strong collapse 1 INTRODUCTION Topological data analysis particularly the tools of homology and persistent homology  from algebraic topology has found a wide variety of applications as a data analysis tech nique including sensor network coverage 4 6 11 21  gene expression in cancer data  dynamics in biological systems  astronomical data  and social networks 17  The fundamental idea behind these tools is that a data set has a shape which can inform a user on some of its global properties Homology gives an algebraic description of topo logical features of the data which are coarse geometry-free structures such as holes or voids in the data These features may be viewed as generalizations of connected components which are the result of many classification algorithms to higher orders It is also well known that there is no meaning ful clustering algorithm  without determining the scale at which the data should be analyzed When such an a priori scale is not available it is advisable to use hierarchical clus tering algorithms  which give a summary over all scales An analogue of this generalization to higher order fea tures which gives a summary of homology over all scales is persistent homology Owing to the importance of such analysis especially for large data sets a fair amount of at tention has been paid to efficient computation of homology  and to persistent homology  which has been shown to have the same complexity as that of computing homology at a single scale  The worst case complexity 978-1-4799-2893-4/14/$31.00 2014 IEEE 11 of this is on the order of matrix multiplication time of a matrix with size equal to the number of simplices in a complex It is widely believed that the current state of the art com plexity in the number of simplices is the best possible As a result much research has gone into developing techniques which might reduce the number and degree of the simplices paralleling the efforts of dimension reduction in the field of machine learning These techniques range from computing the persistent homology of some intelligently selected sub sample of the data  to collapsing the data in ways that pre serve its topology  These collapsing methods come in several forms One branch of study focuses on com puting discrete Morse functions on the simplicial complexes in the persistence computation  While the collapsed com plexes yielded from this method are theoretically small find ing optimal Morse functions is known to be NP-hard in gen eral  Furthermore there is no guarantee that the local structure about the topological features will be preserved Another method introduced in  collapses a complex with the guarantee that cycle lengths are preserved the tight est subset of the data around any topological feature is kept in tact thus allowing feature-localization algorithms to discover the original position of the features Moreover the algorithm can be distributed  and because persistence utilizes a par ticular family of simplicial complexes called Rips complexes each node only needs knowledge of its immediate neighbors in the data in order to execute the collapse Applying this collapsing algorithm to the persistent homology of a data set is our focus In contrast to the parallel research on applying Morse theoretic collapses to the persistence algorithm  we introduce a new method here that uses the strong collapse to achieve 1 a distributed algorithm which can leverage the power of massively parallel computing architectures and 2 automatically localizes the persistent features in the data set This paper is organized as follows in section 2 we in troduce the basics of the mathematics underlying persistent homology and the strong collapse In section 3 we construct the algorithm and prove that the persistent homology of the collapsed filtration is the same as that of the original data In section 4 we implement the algorithm and demonstrate its utility to persistence over the strong collapse Finally we pro vide a conclusion and future directions in section 5 


2 PRELIMINARIES This section introduces some background concepts for algo rithm used in this paper These concepts include the building blocks of simplicial complexes and homology followed by an introduction to persistence computations and finishing at the definition of the strong collapse used to reduce the data 2.1 Simplicial Complexes and Homology Simplicial complexes often referred to as complexes are the basic building blocks of algebraic topology A complex can be formally defined as any set of sets closed under the subset operation Geometrically a simplicial complex is a general ization of a graph that includes not only vertices and edges but also higher-dimensional structures such as triangles tetra hedra and higher order convex hulls of vertices in an ambient space A simplicial complex may also be viewed abstractly as a special case of an hypergraph Each of these structures is called a simplex and the number of vertices in a simplex determines its dimension A vertex is a O-simplex an edge is a I-simplex and the convex hull of n 1 points will be called an n-simplex indicating it has dimension n Homology is a linear algebraic tool that takes as its input a simplicial complex X and outputs a sequence of real vector spaces Ho\(X HI X   Of specific interest are the Betti Numbers  X X   of X where  X  rank  Hi X While  X counts the number of connected components in X the i th Betti number counts the number of i  1 dimensional holes  X yields the number of holes in X  X counts the 3-dimensional voids and higher Betti numbers count higher dimensional cycles The details of these computations are involved and so are not included here but any introductory algebraic topology text contains a good introduction The authors suggest Hatcher  which is freely available at the authors website 2.2 Persistent Homology Persistent homology is a higher order equivalent of hierar chical techniques used for clustering It takes as its input a nested sequence of simplicial complexes and outputs a sum mary of topological features at all scales In fact persistent H 0 X gives the same result as single-linkage clustering A very common approach is to treat the data as a point cloud in some ambient metric space Then for any non-negative real number E a simplicial complex known as the Vietoris-Rips complex XE is constructed using the points in X as vertices such that the pairwise distance between vertices in each sim plex is no more than E As in the hierarchical clustering set ting E is allowed to increase from 0 to 00 but instead of ob serving only H 0 X over that interval we also observed the other homology spaces and how they change with E It imme diately follows from the definition that for E  6 XE C X b  Since our data set X is made up of a finite number of points 12 there are a finite number of pairwise distances between points in the data and we can order them 0  El  E2    Em Hence we observe a series of inclusions called a filtration oj-1 oj oj+1  XEj-1 000 XEj 000 XEj+1 000  This in tum induces a series of linear maps on the ho mology spaces of each complex in every dimension The persistent homology of a data set takes as input the data set and outputs a persistence diagram This persistence diagram helps to keep track of the existence of persistent fea tures in the complex over the range of the parameter E A homology class v E H  XEb  is said to be born at Eb if it is in the cokemel of 000i\000~\000-\0001 in the persistence diagram It is said to persist from time Ej to time Ej+l ifit is not in the kernel 000o\000f\000i\000~\000 Finally it dies at the minimal d for which 000i\000 0  0 000i\000  v  o The diagram can visually represent these births and deaths in many ways  One popular visualization is the barcode a chart whose x-axis is the range of E and whose y-axis is dis crete having one entry for each persistent homology class Then we display a bar for each class v which runs horizon tally from Eb to Ed By observing those features which persist for the largest parameter range Ed Eb we can infer a great deal about the topology of the data 2.3 Strong Collapse The final technique required to describe the new algorithm presented here is the strong collapse developed in 24  This collapse is based on a novel concept of relevance of the nodes and has a simple implementation In general the strong collapse requires the knowledge of all the simplices in the complex and in some cases these are determined by the problem at hand 17  But it is usually the case we are only presented with a point cloud and a filtration using Rips complexes is generated as described in the previous section Computing all the simplices cliques in the Rips complex is however very expensive Fortunately the relevance of the nodes can be computed directly described below without the need to compute all the cliques  The strong collapse also has the added advantage of requiring only the local informa tion thus facilitating parallel and distributed computations In the distributed strong collapse each node broadcasts its neighbor set to each of its neighbors Every node then com pares its own neighborhood to that of each of its neighbors If its neighbor set contains the neighborhood of one of its neigh bors it tells that neighbor to turn off thus removing it and all of its incident simplices from the simplicial complex It can be shown that the collapse map and the inverse inclusion in duce isomorphisms in homology  Each node adjacent 


to a deleted node then updates its neighbor set and the col lapse iterates again and again until it converges This collapse has the benefit of not only preserving the topology of the sim plicial complex but also preserving the shortest generator of each homology class in the original complex For example when computing HI X the shortest path around every hole is preserved This allows hole-localization algorithms to find the tightest bounds around topological features in the original data using only the collapsed data 3 SELECTIVE COLLAPSE Given a persistence diagram we can exploit the techniques outlined in the previous section to build a new structure oj-1 oj oj+1  XEj-1 000 XEj 000 XEj+1 000  The dotted maps are those induced by composing f C 0 i 0 in where C  X  X is the strong collapse map and in  X  X is the inclusion Each square in the above diagram commutes by construction and the induced maps on homology by the vertical maps are isomorphisms as stated in Section 2.3 Thus if a generator exists at H XEj-1  and persists to H XEj then its image in H XEj-1  will persist to H  XEj  Likewise any class not persisting above will not persist below Hence the persistent homology of the original data above is isomorphic to the persistent homology of the reduced data below However there is no guarantee that vertices collapsed by C  XEi  XEi will be collapsed by C  X E i+1  X E i+1 and vice-versa Hence these dotted maps are not necessarily inclusions which is a prerequisite for traditional persistence However they are simplicial maps Thus the bottom row is computable if we can compute persistence for a sequence of general simplicial maps Such a technique has been recently presented in  Unfortunately reducing the complex at each stage is time consuming thus necessitating a careful use of the collapse at one stage to efficiently compute the collapse at the next Given a complex XE and the strong collapse of that complex C  XE  XE we represent the collapse with aforest or col lection of directed trees denoted FE The nodes in this forest correspond to the vertices of the simplicial complex XE and the collapsed complex XE is the subcomplex induced by the root nodes of the forest Each node in the forest is a parent to all the nodes which collapse to it 3.1 Selective Collapse Algorithm In constructing the algorithm we justify each step as it is presented F or ease of notation we also define the E13 neighborhood N E  v  w E X I d v w  E for every point vEX We can assume without loss of generality that each inclusion in the filtration corresponds to the addition of a single edge in the uderlying graph of the complex The al gorithm begins by collapsing the first complex in the filtration X E 1 and proceeds by distributively modifying this forest at each stage Every node v E FEi is either a root v E R\(FEi in the forest or a non-root v E N R FEi  In the case that v E N R\(FEi v has a parent v p  The algorithm continues to make the assumption that the starting forest represents a strong collapse and that one edge is then added to the parent complex XEi to obtain X E i+1 Then to transform the forest FEi  F E i+1 we add the new edge to XEi to get X E i+1 and propogate the following algorithm at each node v starting with the endpoints of the new edge and working our way away from the new edge Receive w  N R\(FEi  R\(FEi transition notification from neighbor if v E N R\(FEi then if w E N vp then v remains unchanged else v  N R\(FEi  R\(FEi notifies neighbors w E N v of change end if else Continue Roots do not change state end if After the algorithm has been completed each node which is still a non-root maintained its status by either not having its neighborhood disturbed or by testing any new roots entering its neighborhood to see if its parent also contained the root it its own neighborhood In so doing every non-root is domi nated in the network and as such the resulting forest FEi 1 is a partial strong collapse of X E i+1 It may not be the com plete strong collapse C  X E i+1  X E i+1 in that there still may be collapsible nodes in the root set of the resulting forest So we take the final step of strong collapsing the remaining subcomplex to obtain X E i+1 The collapse however operates on a subcomplex of X E i+1 and therefore must complete far fewer computations to achieve the complete collapse 4 SIMULATION RESULTS In this section we demonstrate the utility of the proposed se lective collapse algorithm using an illustrative example of the Rips filtration of random points in a plane A set of points V are chosen from a uniform distribution on a unit square and a sequence of geometric graphs G V E is generated using an increasing sequence of values for E A geometric graph with parameter E contains an edge VI V2 whenever the distance between VI and V2 is less than or equal to E and therefore the sequence G V E has the property that G V E I is a sub graph of G\(V E2 whenever EI  E2 An example sequence 


Fig 1 The left column shows the sequence of geometric graphs obtained using increasing value for the parameter E along with the inclusion maps The problem of interest is to compute the persistent homology of the filtration obtained using the corresponding flag complexes The right column shows the collapsed complexes Given the first collapsed complex Section 3 presents an efficient algorithm to com pute the next reduced complex along with the simplicial map f is shown in Figure 1 The filtration we consider here is the sequence of the Rips complexes of the geometric graphs Figure 1 shows a sequence of the graphs underlying the full and collapsed complexes in one run of the experiment Note that the useful properties of the strong collapse that it preserves homology and shortest cycles are both clear in the examples found in figure 1 Even though the sequence of orig inal complexes forms a filtration note that the sequence of collapsed complexes does not However the simplicial map induced between the complexes is computed using the col lapse forests described in Section 3 The algorithm described in Section 3 also provides an ef ficient way to compute the sequence of collapsed complexes Figure 2 demonstrates the utility of this algorithm by compar ing the time required to compute strong collapse entirely for each complex without utilizing the information from the pre vious collapses The figure shows the ratio of the time taken for selective collapse T r by algorithm given in Section 3 to that taken for collapsing the entire complex T f  The compu tations used to generate these ratios are in fact centralized This figure shows that we see significant reductions in com14 Fig 2 Figures shows the ratio of the time taken by the al gorithm presented here to that taken for collapsing the entire collapse for each step in the filtration As seen the ratio de creases with increasing number of nodes a desirable feature for algorithms designed for large data sets plexity even in the centralized case When the geometric ran dom graph has 120 nodes the algorithm runs about 15 times faster than if the entire complex is collapsed at each stage in dividually The primary feature about the algorithm is that this ratio decreases as the number of data points increases suggesting that for large data sets the algorithm potentially provides a significant increase in performance It should also be noted that the degree to which the collapse can be formed depends largely on the specific type of complexes The spe cific purpose of these experiments is to show that a collapse obtained for a complex may be exploited to efficiently col lapse a bigger complex into which it is included 5 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION We proposed an algorithm called the selective collapse which speeds up the computation of persistent homology a tool with wide and various applications in topological data analysis We presented the framework of collapsing the complex at each step and utilizing the persistence algorithm proposed in  to make the computations tractable We rep resented the strong collapse with a forest and used that infor mation to ease the processing of persistence across collapsed complexes We also outlined the distributed computations used to execute the selective collapse algorithm and proved that the resulting forest corresponds to a strong collapse Furthermore we showed through simulations on geometric random graphs that the selective collapse algorithm is a faster method for collapsing the simplicial complexes in a persis tence diagram while maintaining all pertinent topological information within the complex Finally we showed that the collapse exhibits a trend towards greater efficiency with and increased number of data points thus displaying the potential for this method in analyzing big data sets
