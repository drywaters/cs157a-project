 MIXDES 2014, 21 st International Conference Mixed Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems June 19-21, 2014, Lublin, Poland   Background MIXED  DESIGN  VESTIC; bipolar transistor; small signal compact model and 204VES-BJT is a novel bipolar device in VESTIC technology proposed by W. Maly This paper extends previously published considerations abou t expected features of such a device. It contains import ant information about using earlier introduced definitions in context of calculating small signal parameters of VES-BJT i.e. an unit gain frequency and an unit power gain frequency. Theoretical considerations are illustrated with simulation results. Presented data and methodology are the basis for future development of complete compact model of VESBJT. Simulation and analytical results confirm the big potential of bipolar devices in VESTIC technology Abstract I    Keywords\204 P ROBLEM O UTLINE  The VES-BJT was not manufactured yet, but to support this development the information about small signal performance is very crucial. To overcome a lack of real device the numerical simulations were provided. Si mulations were conducted with Synopsys TCAD simulator. The sub ject of the simulation was the device with structure depict ed in Fig. 1. It was the same structure as in earlier presented papers. Simulation outcome was several data sets with calculated collector current IC and frequencies  w b0 f T f max Small Signal Performance of VES-BJT Piotr Mierzwinski Institute of Microelectroni cs and Optoelectronics Warsaw University of Technology Warsaw, Poland pmierzwi@elka.pw.edu.pl    I NTRODUCTION  The VES-BJT transistor is a bi polar junction transistor in VESTIC technology [1], previously pr esented in  is fully compatible with production process of VES-FET  a y be incorporated in the sam e integrated  circuit. Similar outlines and dimensions of devices should simplify production process, i.e. by simplified patterning. The ability to fabricate many different kinds of active devices with minimal changes in th e cell structure and manufacturing process is the unique feature of the VESTIC technology. By limiting the number of masks needed VESTIC technology may be the answer for limitations in integration of unipolar and bipolar devices The main difference in the physical structure of VES-BJT in comparison with VES-FET is absence of insulating layer. It results in n-p-n or p-n-p struct ure with gate regions serving as an emitter and a collector while a slit between them serving as a base region. Each region is uniformly doped, moreover emitter and collector have the same doping level. None of junctions is plane-parallel, and the base region has a minimum width A in the middle and increases towards the two base contacts. Technological compatibili ty requires that emitter and collector regions should be made of doped polysilicon. The device structure is designed to be fabricated on a SOI substrate in a top silicon layer of given thickness. Resulting structure may be compared with lateral bi polar devices reported in [5   The outline of the device is presented in Fig. 1. As can be easily noted the basic shapes are circles and rectangles with rounded corners The VES-BJT transistor is signi ficantly different from wellknown modern vertical devices and  Typical relations are no more adequate, i.e. because of nonplane-parallel junctions and pol ysilicon emitter and collector regions, but as it was presented in previous papers 3  is possible to overcome t hose shortcomings by proper adjustments. The main idea of accommodating typical bipolar equations is based on an idea of the effective base width. This paper extends this idea for th e analysis of basic small signal parameters II This publication is a part of work which was supported by the National Centre for Research and Development in the frame of PBS programme under Research Project \215VESTIC\216 project no. 177244  This publication has been co-financed with the European Union funds by the European Social Fund  Fig. 1.

 V  P ERFORMANCE OF T IERED S TORAGE WITH G ENERIC S PECTRAL D ATA  In designing a new data storage system for long-term use, three major factors were of interest: cost, scalability and reliability. Using a single RAID server with a large number of drives would provide similar total capacity, but with significant storage overhead, a single point of failure and the speed limit ations of individual drives. Traditional SANs were deemed to be too expensive and difficult to scale to big-data capacity Existing research [11 at WiNCom using object storage provided insight into the scalability, redundancy, and cost effectiveness of object based storage. Increasing the ability to perform greater analyses on spectral data requ ires greater retrieval speeds Figure 6 shows a comparison of the different tiers used in TSGSD. Figure 6 shows the maximum speed of each tier   the RAM for the cache table, the disk for the metadata database, and dsNet for the object store By taking advantage of available memory in the database server, a cache of approximately 64GB of recent objects can be maintained \(Approximately 3 days  worth of full-resolution measurements\. This allows direct analysis without the need for disk access Another feature of TSGSD is the reduction of distance between data storage and analysis servers, which eliminates data transfer times. Custom software developed at WiNCom for preprocessing binary RFeye files executes faster than vendor-provided software, an d physical locality of data eliminates file transfer times. The elimination of data transfer times reduces the overall processing time by 18 Using the multi-core processor of the database server, up to 6 pre-processing threads can be spawned concurrently via multi-processing techniques to cut down data insertion times 6 fold. The object-storage-daemon runs in the background on the database server, and processes synchronized measurements on arrival; eliminating the need for researchers to wait for file prep rocessing.  Table II compares the wait times for pre-processing data using a standalone workstation versus the TSGSD system  TABLE II  D ATA P ROCESSING T IMES C OMPARED  Processing Times for single day data Preprocessing Manufacturer Software at local workstation TSGSD with Custom Software Transfer Wait Time  307 s  0.00 s  Preprocessing Time  1645 s  1638.4 s  The metadata database operations are expected to be mostly selection operations with insertion operations reserved for raw measurement data and for storing preanalyzed results. For queries and/or insertions from multiple sources, the database server supports hundreds of connections. At 100 concurrent connections, the database server can support 67327 selection operations per second With a query involving 8 search fields, this provides access to 8415 individual objects per second. Assuming each query represents an individual uncached 4 MB object, the queries would saturate the dsNet object storage link speed of 2x1 Gbps. This means the only bottleneck is the link speed between the database server and dsNet. It is technically easy to expand the network link capacity by acquiring additional dsNet accessor devices. Crucially, neither the metadata database nor the dsNet disk speed is a bottleneck for the TSGSD system in this design By using LZ77 compression through the gzip python library, JSON data is stored in a compressed format in TSGSD and can be read by analysis software sweep-bysweep, without requiring conversion of the entire file. The compression reduces intermediate file sizes by 79%, and allows a greater amount of measur ements and statistics to be stored at the caching layer. The various storage format sizes for a typical day s worth of spectral measurements from a single site are shown in Table III TABLE III  P ROCESSED DATA S IZES  Processed and Raw Dataset Sizes Local workstation with vendorprovided preprocessor TSGSD using gzip Data Size  3276.8 \(MB  3276.8 \(MB  Processed size  24985.6 \(MB  5177.3 \(MB  VI  C ONCLUSION  The new band plan for the spectrum measurement system allows collection of spectrum data with higher sensitivity through careful use of band-pass filters to attenuate strong out-of-band tran smissions, and by using an amplifier for the weaker transm issions in the 3-6 GHz band The earlier band plan did no t take into account the RF response of the measurement de vice, which thus caused the noise floor to fluctuate within the measurement sweeps This problem has been eliminated by the new band plan Figure 6. Comparison of Speed of Individual Storage Tiers 


The expansion of spectrum measurement data collection in multiple sites at higher resolutions has required the use of more complex computing infrastructure to store and analyze vast amounts of data efficiently. Traditional methods for storage and analysis have reac hed their effective limits, and TSGSD presents a method of archival storage combined with fast query capabilities and a high-speed network Through the development of software on top of the system presented in TSGSD, the results of analysis operations that occur at multiple sites will be stored to save time in further research involving more complex analysis tools.  The database components within TSGSD scale through replication, and the dsN et can later be expanded to multiple geographically distributed sites. Through careful system design, dsNet objects ca n be stored redundantly at multiple sites, where read operations would only activate closest local-site nodes The on-server analysis and aggregation system in TSGSD allows for high-performance international research by centralizing the analysis work near the data storage system. Centralized aggregation and analysis near the data system ensures only the minimum required dataset is sent to international researchers over the Internet During 2014 the spectrum occupancy data collection will be enhanced even further. Portable “backpack measurement unit will be utilized to provide complementary information on the utilization of specific systems, and the most interesting frequency bands from the dynamic spectrum access point-of-view. It is still under debate whether a few fixed measurement locations are sufficient to produce spectrum occupancy evaluations that could be used a basis for radio frequency regulation. The portable unit can be used to focus on detailed spatial variations. Currently one of the most interesting frequency bands in the Europe is 2,3-2,4 GHz, which is the first the first band considered for licensed shared access \(LSA\The portable measurement system will provide insight for example how wireless cameras are used in the field Through continued development of in-browser plotting combined with the on-site aggregation of data, researchers at IIT, VT, VTT, Oulu University and Turku University of Applied Sciences can quickly an alyze and view features of the data collected from all the measurement sites. Moving forward, the computer infrastructure presented in this paper will be a central resource and key enabler of future international research undertaken in this WiFiUS project    Figure A1.
