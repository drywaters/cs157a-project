there have been efforts to provide interoperability among differ ent IoT   e things in the Internet Thus all the data generated by the de vices are considered as updates of the devices and the dissemination of the update is based on the social relationship among the devi ces  can create social neighbor relationships among the devices and  
ly  uss  I I NTRODUCTION There have been many data brokers and cloud services for the interoperability of the IoT applications For examp le ThingWorx 1  E V R Y T H N G  2   a nd S e ns e  3  a r e t he m os t popular cloud platforms In all these cloud platforms the k ey functionality is to collect the data from the Things and combine them to create useful applications The existing platforms are known to successfully provide such functionality However  as the number of devices increases rapidly and the real-time processing of the data is required the existing platforms m 
ay not provide satisfactory services In this paper we focus on the real-timeness and the huge size of things Thus we present the design of an IoT platform that handles the data in real-time and is simple enough to deal with the incoming data from a huge number of devices We call the platform SNSoT namely SNS of Things The main idea is that we consider all the things as a user in a SNS Thus each thing posts an update and the update is  the characteristic of the applications As a simple example  let\222s consider a travel application Suppose a person plans to travel from a city to another Then the application searche s  
friend relationship between a map application of the user\222s mobile device and the monitoring devices The data generate d by the monitoring devices is now forwarded to the map This research was supported by Seoul Creative Human Develo pment Program HM120006 and by Basic Science Research Program th rough the National Research Foundation of Korea\(NRF funded by the Mi nistry of Education Science and Technology\(NRF-2013R1A1A2007113  application whenever the data is generated just like the SNS update messages are propagated This simplistic collection and dissemination mechanism of the data enables SNSoT to deal  timeness We provide the conceptual design of SNSoT and 
discuss the issues and challenges to implement SNSoT at the following sections II SNS O T:T HE S YSTEM D ESIGN In this section we describe the conceptual design of SNSoT and discuss the issues and challenges to implement SNSoT Furthermore we propose an algorithm for big data analysis i n SNSoT which is one of the key algorithms for the success of SNSoT A Overall System Design As the name implies SNSoT adopts the idea of SNS and applies it to the interoperability framework for IoT applicat ions To make the framework cover a broad range of applications we want to make the data collection and dissemination proces s  
suitable for this purpose The general procedure to constru ct a social network among things is as follows First each Thing devices users applications etc registers itself to th e platform namely SNSoT Then the Things post their status to SNSoT Application developers search the Things that are suitable for the application and create the friend relation ship among the chosen Things The relationship depends on the  needs to receive some data from another Thing there should be a link from the latter to the former It should be noted that such relationship is asymmetric After the relationsh ip is established the postings from the Things are forwarded to the friends of the owner of the postings Application 
developers can implement their applications based on this data forwarding mechanisms Fig 1 shows an overview of the SNSoT architecture Each Thing posts their updates to th e   Each Thing has real-time architecture in itself so that real time processing can be achieved B Issues in the Overall Design of SNSoT For this conceptual design to work in the real-time environments there are many issues and challenges We discuss some of the most prominent ones in the following First of 315

3 outputs a new ciphertext CT  corresponding to the new access policy A   C Security Model The cloud server is assumed to be semi-trusted curious-buthonest it is curious about the data it stored and the messages it received but it will update the ciphertext correctly for data owners We also assume that the server may send the owners data to the users who do not have access permission The data owners are assumed to be fully trusted The users are assumed to be dishonest i.e they may collude to access unauthorized data The authorities can be corrupted or compromised by the attackers We assume that the adversaries can corrupt authorities only statically but key queries can be made adaptively We now describe the security model for our system by the following game between a challenger and an adversary Setup The global setup algorithm is run The adversary speciìes a set S  A  S A of corrupted authorities The challenger generates the pairs of public key and the secret key by running the authority setup algorithm For uncorrupted authorities in S A  S  A  the challenger sends only the public keys to the adversary For corrupted authorities in S  A  the challenger sends both the public keys and secret keys to the adversary Phase 1 The adversary makes secret key queries by submitting pairs  GID  S GID  AID  to the challenger where GID is an identity and S GID  AID is a set of attributes belonging to an uncorrupted authority AID  The challenger gives the corresponding secret keys SK GID  AID to the adversary Challenge The adversary submits two equal length messages m 0 and m 1  In addition the adversary gives a set of challenge access structure   M  1    1      M  q    q   which must satisfy the constraint that the adversary cannot ask for a set of keys that allow decryption in combination with any keys that can obtained from corrupted authorities The challenger then ips a random coin b  and encrypts m b under all access structures   M  1    1      M  q    q    Then the ciphertext  CT  1    CT  q  are given to the adversary Phase 2 The adversary may query more secret keys as long as they do not violate the constraints on the challenge access structures The adversary can also makes update key queries by submitting the pair  M  i    i    M  j    j   the simulator returns the update key UK m b to the adversary Guess The adversary outputs a guess b  of b  The advantage of an adversary A in this game is deìned as Pr  b   b   1  2  Deìnition 2 Our scheme is secure against static corruption of authorities if all polynomial time adversaries have at most a negligible advantage in the above security game III A TTRIBUTE BASED A CCESS C ONTROL WITH D YNAMIC P OLICY U PDATING FOR B IG D ATA We construct our dynamic-policy access control scheme based on an adapted CP-ABE method in Our scheme consists of ve phases System Initialization Key Generation Data Encryption Data Decryption and Policy Updating A System Initialization The system initialization includes the global setup and the authority setup 1 Global Setup In the global setup two multiplicative groups G and G T are chosen with the same prime order p and the bilinear map e  G  G  G T between them A random oracle H maps global identities GID to elements of G  Let g be a generator of G  the global parameters is set to be GP  p  g  H  2 Authority Setup Each authority AID runs the authority setup algorithm to generate its secret/public key pair Let S AID denote the set of all the attributes managed by the authority AID  For each attribute x  S AID  the authority chooses two random exponents  x   x  Z p and publishes its public key as PK AID   e  g  g   x  g  x   x  S AID  It keeps SK AID    x   x   x  S AID  B Key Generation To generate the secret key for user GID  each authority AID will rst assign a set of attributes S GID  AID to this user Then it runs the secret key generation algorithm to generate a set of secret keys as SK GID  AID   K x  GID  g  x H  GID   x   x  S GID  AID  C Data Encryption The owner rst encrypts the data m by running the encryption algorithm Encrypt  The algorithm takes as inputs a set of public keys  PK  for relevant authorities the global parameters the data m and an n  l access matrix M with  mapping its rows to attributes It chooses a random encryption exponent s  Z p and a random vector  v  s  y 2    y l   Z l p  where y 2    y l are used to share the encryption exponent s  For i  1to n  it computes  i  M i   v  where M i is the vector corresponding to the i th row of M  It also chooses a random vector  w  Z l p with 0 as its rst entry and computes w i  M i   w  For each row i of M  it chooses a random r i  Z p and computes the ciphertext as CT  C  m  e  g  g  s   i  1 to n  C 1  i  e  g  g   i e  g  g     i  r i  C 2

ciphertext the user rst obtains H  GID  from the random oracle If the user has the secret keys  K   i   GID  for a subset of rows i of M such that  1  0  0  is in the span of these rows then the user proceeds as follows For each such i  the user computes C 1  i  e  H  GID   C 3  i  e  K   i   GID  C 2  i   e  g  g   i e  H  GID   g  w i  IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer

the policy updating Proof We prove the correctness for each operation in our scheme as follows  LSSS Structure/Threshold Gate Updating  The secret s is re-randomized under the new access policy such that the correctness is guaranteed by the secret sharing scheme  Attr 2 OR  Suppose c j is the coefìcient chosen for x j during the decryption We can simply get the coefìcient c n  1  c j  a m for x n  1 when the new attribute x n  1 is chosen instead of x j during the decryption  Attr 2 AND  Suppose c j is the coefìcient chosen for x j during the decryption under the previous access policy To decrypt the ciphertext under the new access policy we still choose c j as the coefìcient for x j and set the coefìcient c n  1   c j a m for x n  1   AttrRmOR  This operation will not affect the coefìcient choices of the remaining attributes in the OR gate  AttrRmAND  The same as threshold gate updating B Completeness Proof Theorem 2 Our scheme is complete for updating any types of access policies Proof The proposed policy updating method is designed based on access policies with LSSS structures i.e it can convert any  M    LSSS structure to a new one  M       For any access tree policy which is constructed with several threshold gates and a set of attributes we have proposed an operation to update a threshold gate to any other threshold gate by converting the threshold gates into LSSS structure Thus our scheme can also update any access tree policy Considering the boolean formula is a special access tree only with AND and OR gates we propose a more efìcient method to update the policy with boolean formulas Any new boolean formulas can be derived from the previous boolean formulas by iteratively doing the operations Attr 2 AND  Attr 2 OR  AttrRmAND and AttrRmOR  Therefore our proposed operations are complete for updating any access policies C Security Proof Our access control scheme is constructed on prime order groups because the group operations on prime order groups are much faster than the ones on composite order groups In this section we will prove that our dynamic policy access control scheme is secure in the generic bilinear group model  12 13 and random oracle model 14 Ho we v e r  our scheme can also be easily extended to be provable secure in the random oracle model by using groups with composite orders Theorem 3 Our scheme is secure in the generic bilinear group model and random oracle model if no polynomial time adversary can get non-negligible advantage in the security game deìned in Section II-C Proof Our access control scheme is constructed based on the CP-ABE method with primer group order CP-ABEPrimer in which is pro v e d t o b e secure under generic bilinear group model and random oracle model At an intuitive level this means that if there are any vulnerabilities in the scheme then these vulnerabilities must exploit speciìc mathematical properties of elliptic curve groups or cryptographic hash functions used when instantiating the scheme Let A be an adversary who can break our scheme with non-negligible advantage and we will construct an A  such that it can break the CP-ABE-Primer scheme in with non-ne gligible advantage Different with the security game in in our security game the adversary returns a tuple of policies   M  1    1      M  q    q   together with two messages  m 0  m 1   and the adversary receives an encryption of M b under each of these policies Moreover our security game also allows the update key query for the challenging messages  m 0  m 1  between two access policies  M  i    i  and  M  j    j   A  initializes the CP-ABE-Primer security game and forwards the public key PK to A  To simulate the key generation oracle of A  A  queries its key generation oracle for all x  S to respond to a SK  GID  S  query The simulation of challenge ciphertext of A is the same with the one of A   Now we prove that the update key query in our security game will not increase the advantage of A   Considering two update key queries UK  m 0   M  i    i    M  j    j  and UK  m 1   M  i    i    M  j    j   the update key generation oracle returns the same update keys which do not involve with the challenge data if we consider the encryption random numbers are the same in encrypting m 0 and m 1 this is because only one challenge message is chosen by the simulator by tossing a coin in the security game Therefore the update key will not reveal any information on the chosen challenging message This completes the proof IEEE INFOCOM 2014 - IEEE Conference on Computer

sharing-scheme according to the above deìnition also enjoys the linear reconstruction property Suppose that  is a LSSS for the access structure A  Let S  A be any authorized set and let I  1  2    l  be deìned as I   i    i   S   Then there exist constants  w  Z p  i  I such that for any valid shares   i  of a secret s according to  we have  i  I w i  i  s  These constants  w i  can be found in time polynomial in the size of the share-generating matrix M We note that for unauthorized sets no such constants  w i  exist B Access Tree Structure An access tree is deìned as a tree T  where every noleaf node x represents a threshold gate  k x  num x   num x is the number of its children and every leaf x is described by an attribute att  x  and a threshold value k x  The function parent  x  denotes the parent of the node x in the tree T also deìnes an ordering number for each child node and the function index  x  returns such a number associated with the node x  Policy Checking  To determine whether or not an access tree T is satisìed by a set of attributes S  the policy checking algorithm recursively computes as follows If node x is a nonleaf node it returns 1 iff at least k x children return 1 otherwise returns 0 If x is a leaf node then it returns 1 iff att  x   S  otherwise returns 0 Tree Implementing  The secret s to be shared is rst assigned to the root node of the tree by using a random polynomial q root with q root  0  s  The rest of the nodes are used to distributed this root polynomial amongst the other nodes as smaller degree polynomials as illustrated in

Figure 12 226 Recursive Octree Search Path 4 R ESULTS Each pilot 003ies two missions a forward version and a backward version of the same trajectory Basic mission parameters are listed in Table 1 along with basic CMG parameters to re\003ect the CMGs used in the actual missions 003own by the pilots Table 1 226 Simulation Parameters Parameter Nominal Value  Simulation Time 12 min Number of Targets 4 Asteroid Itokawa Trajectory Flight Order Varied ACS Flight Order Varied  CMG Parameters  Architecture Pyramid Flywheel Speed 12,000 rpm Max Gimbal Rate 50 rpm Flywheel Inertia kg-m 2 Flight data is recorded for each pilot so that fuel consumption and attitude error comparisons could be drawn between the two control modes of interest a thrusters-only mode and a combined control mode consisting of both RCS thrusters and CMGs There were a total of thirteen human subjects evaluated Each subject was given a brief 10-15 minute overview of the project background as well as a short overview of the HUD before being placed into the setup shown in Figure 8 After being out\002tted with the appropriate helmet and sensors the pilot operated the simulation for several minutes to gain familiarity with the controller layout The controller layout can be seen in Figure 13 The labels for the buttons describe the 001 V inputs that would be applied if that button is selected The buttons map to the Jetpack's body coordinate frame so a commanded 001 V input of  x would result in the user accelerating forward The minimum commanded 001 V was calculated using the minimum on-time for the thrusters and the mass of the Jetpack system 050including the mass of the astronaut\051 When the user holds down the button the 001 V input continues to increase and when the user releases the button the Jetpack immediately stops accelerating and maintains a constant velocity A one-way analysis of variance 050ANOVA\051 test is used to analyze the differences between the parameters of interest The ANOVA test is a technique that can be used to compare the means of two or more groups of data against the null Figure 13 226 Simulation Hand Controller Layout hypothesis The null hypothesis states that the samples in the groups are drawn from populations with the same mean values If the null hypothesis is accepted it would indicate that there is no statistically signi\002cant difference between the treatment groups and that the statistical results from the treatment groups shows no evidence of signi\002cantly changing the performance of the observations In order for the null hypothesis to be accepted or rejected the p-value must be compared to a statistical threshold If the p-value obtained from the experimental data is greater than the signi\002cance threshold then one cannot readily reject the null hypothesis If the p-value obtained from the experimental data is less than the signi\002cance threshold then the null hypothesis can be rejected The treatment groups for this ANOVA test correspond to the ACS designs used by the pilot during evaluation Each pilot conducted j  2 trials 050one for each ACS\051 and the order of the mission trajectory and ACS were randomized such that there would be no learning bias associated with 003ying each course Also the pilots were told to choose a piloting style 050i.e minimum fuel quickest time most accurate etc.\051 and to use that throughout both trials As stated previously the subjects were also given a few minutes to familiarize themselves with the controller and the simulation The ACS used for the practice was also randomized to minimize any bias There were a total of i  13 subjects supplying a total of 26 050 i 002 j 051 observations For the purposes of the one-way ANOVA test the pilot data were grouped into two treatments 050columns\051 one representing the fuel consumed using the combined and RCS-only control modes The thirteen row-wise entries in the table yields a total of 25 050 i 002 j 000 1 051 DoF and only 1 050 j 000 1 051 DoF between the treatments The signi\002cance threshold used for this test is p  0  05  which is a common value for one-way ANOVA tests Table 2 shows the one-way ANOVA results using MATLAB Table 2 226 One-way ANOVA Table Source SS df MS F Prob  F  Columns 7.8069 1 7.80688 16.96 3  91 002 10 000 4 Error 11.0506 24 0.46044 Total 18.8575 25 The mean for the treatment group using the combined ACS 9 


is 1.39 kg and the mean associated with the treatment group using the thrusters-only ACS is 2.49 kg The computed Fvalue is 16.96 which corresponds to an experimental p-value of p  3  91 002 10 000 4  Since the experimental p-value is much less than the signi\002cance threshold one can say that the data shows a statistically signi\002cant difference between the two control modes in fuel consumption This extremely low p-value is indicative of a statistical fuel savings associated with using a blended control mode This result makes physical sense because CMGs use only electrical power for maneuvering Therefore when the CMGs are being used to control attitude no thrusters are being 002red which implies that no fuel is being consumed Rejecting the null hypothesis supports the idea that a blended control mode can provide the user with a comparable experience at an average fuel savings of 45 and a maximum of 84 shown in Table 3 Table 3 226 Fuel Consumption Data Control Mode  Subject Combined RCS Only j Fuel Saved j 050kg\051 050kg\051 050%\051  1 3.07 3.49 11.89 2 0.60 1.97 69.66 3 1.32 1.81 26.89 4 1.26 1.83 31.05 5 0.65 1.88 65.65 6 0.46 2.92 84.22 7 1.14 2.91 60.88 8 1.73 3.14 44.91 9 1.19 2.29 48.02 10 1.19 2.58 53.98 11 2.32 2.81 17.17 12 2.33 2.78 16.13 13 0.83 1.94 57.31 The electrical power required by the batteries would come from a rechargeable source and could be used on several missions Also by 002ne tuning the gains to a speci\002c astronaut's choosing the system can be highly adaptable as far as work platform stiffness response time desired overshoot The CMGs provide a continuous control mechanism compared to the discrete on-off times of the thrusters and can eliminate errors associated with attitude or pointing requirements whereas a thrusters-only ACS can only work within the limits of a particular deadband set by the control system As a result the combined control mode provides a much smoother response to attitude disturbances than the thrusters Figure 14 shows box plots with the 002rst second 050median\051 and third quartiles of the data as well as the minimum and maximum On the left are the results from the combined ACS while on the right are the results from the RCS only ACS Figure 14 demonstrates that the entire 002rst through third quartiles of the combined ACS are below the 002rst quartile of the RCS thrusters only ACS Figure 15 plots the fuel consumption data for both control modes for each of the subjects The fuel consumption data reveals many interesting things such as the variation between subjects on the amount of fuel needed for the same control mode 050i.e subject 1 and subject 3 use a different amount of fuel for the RCS only control mode\051 Also the data shows that there is always a reduction in fuel used when switching Figure 14 226 Fuel Consumption Box Plot Figure 15 226 Plot of Fuel Consumption vs Subject 050Both Control Modes\051 between the RCS only control mode and the combined control mode 050the difference between the vertical lines\051 5 C ONCLUSION The use of real-time visualization software for simulation validation and testing is an extremely bene\002cial tool The graphics can provide insight into the behavior of the system During the initial setup actual thruster plume models were used to show which thrusters were being commanded by the ACS The observed behavior of the jets facilitated the veri\002cation of the DCM transformation between the Jetpack's body and asteroid's ACI coordinates Also the incorporation of graphics gave a more robust complete feeling to the simulation environment Pairing the graphics component with the VR Lab hardware 050helmet gloves 6-DoF electromagnetic tracking etc.\051 produced an immersive environment for algorithm testing since the subject could actually sit down and feel as if he/she were piloting the actual Jetpack system Current work already under progress and future work include modifying the simulation for various CMG architectures modeling CMG power consumption and selecting an optimal CMG size based on parametrically varying CMG parameters 050i.e 003ywheel speed 003ywheel inertia and gimbal rate\051 and a Monte Carlo sim framework Overall the combined ACS proved to be the preference of the 10 


human subjects Also from a design standpoint the combined control mode is also the preferred choice CMGs use electrical power which in turn reduces overall fuel consumption and extends mission life with the same given amount of propellant CMGs also are a continuous control actuator and therefore achieve a much 002ner pointing resolution than the thruster's discrete control actuator model By varying the control system gains one can create a much stiffer work platform and/or a faster response time depending upon the particular preference of the user Including four CMGs in a pyramid con\002guration provides a level of redundancy while also simplifying the steering law A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank NASA Johnson Space Center and in particular the VR Lab for their gracious support and help during this effort The members of the VR Lab helped with overall EDGE design and interface requirements They also helped with initial setup hardware integration and testing of the pre-existing hardware This work was supported by the Draper Laboratory Internal Research and Development 050IR&D\051 program We are very grateful for the support and acknowledgment from our Draper colleagues R EFERENCES   B Chapman A Crenshaw A Guertin and C Gwennap 0502013\051 A v ailable http://poe.olin.edu/poe2013/s  engr2210groundbots/Mechanical  Subsystem.html   N S Bedrossian J Paradiso E V Bergmann and D Rowell 223Redundant single gimbal control moment gyroscope singularity analysis,\224 Journal of Guidance Control and Dynamics  vol 13 pp 1096\2261101 1990   M Jackson and R D McDonald 223Draper simulation analysis tool 050dsat\051 Graphical object simulation techniques and tools for simulink,\224 in AIAA Modeling and Simulation Technologies Conference and Exhibit  Providence Rhode Island Aug 2004   M.Carpenter B Cohanim K Duda J Rize C Dopart J Hoffman K Jackson and et al 223Next-generation maneuvering system with control-moment gyroscopes for extravehicular activities near low-gravity objects,\224 in AIAA International Conference on Environmental Systems  Vail Colorado Jul 2013   Metecs 0502010\051 Onli A v ailable http://www.metecs.com/products-edge.php   J Harrington 0502013\051 Available http://www.ascensiontech.com/realtime/rt\003ockofbirds.php   C Ericson Real-Time Collision Detection  New York NY Focal Press 2005   R Winkler and W Hays Statistics Probability Inference and Decision 0502nd edition\051  New York NY Holt Rinehart and Winston 1975 B IOGRAPHY  Jared Rize received his B.S in Mechanical Engineering 050Aerospace concentration\051 in 2012 from Lehigh University He is currently an M.S student in Aeronautical/Astronautical Engineering at MIT He is currently a Draper Laboratory Fellow at the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory in Cambridge MA His current research activities include design and development of control laws for spacecraft or space vehicles with blended attitude control actuators Michele Carpenter is a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Draper Laboratory She received a B.S in Astrophysics from UCLA in 2002 and a Ph.D in Theoretical and Applied Mechanics from Cornell University in 2009 Her Ph.D research focused on the dynamics and control of gyroscopically actuated space robotic systems At Draper she specializes in Guidance Navigation and Control algorithm development and analysis for strategic and space programs Prior to her graduate work she spent two years working in the Ballistic Missile Defense division at MIT Lincoln Laboratory Bobby Cohanim is the Mission Design Group Leader and a Principal Member of the Technical Staff at Draper Laboratory He joined Draper Laboratory in September 2006 He has led several space and autonomy R&D efforts while at Draper Before coming to Draper Bobby also worked at JPL He received his B.S from Iowa State University in Aerospace Engineering 0502002\051 his S.M in Aero/Astro from MIT 0502004\051 and ScD in Aero/Astro from MIT 0502013\051 Jeffrey Hoffman is Professor of the Practice of Aerospace Engineering in the Aero/Astro Department at MIT He received a B.A in Astronomy from Amherst College 0501966\051 a Ph.D in Astrophysics from Harvard 11

  15   module Trade studies of performance with respect to required delta chief orbit and the cost of ground operations support form important considerations in the design of the cluster architectures, and will be studied. Global designs will also need to consider the biome spread of the Earth so that the clusters are in optimal configuration when they fly over the appropriate biomes Finally this work can be extended to calculate many geophysical parameters beyond snow albedo such as vegetation GPP and radiative forcing of clouds to demonstrate the impact of improved BRDF using clusters on critical science application s  7  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS   The authors are grateful to the following people for very useful discussions on the topics presented in this paper Warren Wiscombe  Jacqueline LeMoigne Alexis Lyapustin and Ralph Kahn from NASA GSFC Marco Sabatini from Universit\340 degli Studi di Trento in Italy David Miller from MIT and Thomas Hilker from Oregon State University   R EFERENCES   1   autonomous and distributed scatter manoeuvres for  Acta Astronaut vol. 82, no. 1, pp 95 109, Jan. 2013 2    System F6 Program Value-Centric Design  Proceedings of the AIAA Space Conference Anaheim, California, 2010 3  S Nag    crowdsourcing spaceflight software and STEM  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 2012 4  S Nag   J   G  Katz   a n d  A   Saen z Oter o    STEM ed  Acta Astronaut  vol 83 no 0 pp 145 174 Feb 2013  5   spacecraft reorientation for earth orbiting clusters  Acta Astronaut vol. 53 no. 11, pp. 863 877, Dec. 2003 6   satellite systems for Multi-angular Multi-spectral  Proceedings of the 64th International Astronautical Congress  Beijing China, 2013 7   of Nano-satellite Cluster Formations for Bi-Directional Reflectance Distribution Function  AIAAUSU Conf.
