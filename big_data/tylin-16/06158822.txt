INTRODUCTION  Computer based information Systems are becoming an important part of our organizations  By connecting our computer to the Internet we increase the risk that someone may install malicious programs and use it to attack other machines on the Internet by controlling it remotely Computer security is the ability to protect a computer system and its resources in reference to Confidentiality Integrity and Availability   I n o r d e r  to protect from the computer threats various protocols and firewalls are used   Confidentiality requires that information can be accessible only to those authorized for it integrity requires that information remain unchanged without any modification by malicious attempts and availability means the computer system and its resources always available to authorized users when they need it. B y this definition, a computer system is said to be reliable if  confidentiality integrity and availability is a part o f its security requirements     A computer system is said to be secure if it can protect s its data and resources from unauthorized access modification and denial of use Intrusion is a type of attack that tries to deny the security aspects of a computer  system It is generally believed that intrusions show something differs from the normal pattern and that any unknown intrusion will present patterns more similar to known intrusion   B a s e d on t he  a bove  a s s u m p t i o n  intrusion can be defined as a data analysis problem Patterns of the intrusions and patterns of the normal behavior can be computed using data mining  Since a large volume of network traffic that requires processing we use data mining techniques To apply data mining techniques in intrusion detection, preprocessing is the first  step to be done on the collected data Then convert the data into a particular format for the mining process. N ext the formatted data is used for classification and clust ering The classification model can be rule based decision tree  based Bayesian network based or neural network based Data mining technique provides the guarantee that no intrusion will be missed while checking the real time data  in the network, thus ensuring the accuracy and efficiency in the detection process Data mining techniques also helps in intrusion prevention mechanisms They can detect both known and previous unknown patterns of attacks  This paper is organized as follows Section 2 gives the  details of intrusion detection and the general working strategy of Intrusion Detection Systems Section 3 gives the details of data mining concepts and the system desig n based on Data Mining Intrusion Detection Pattern. Section 4 gives the details of different data mining techniques an d explains how each technique helps in detecting intrusions Section 5 presents our conclusion  II. INTRUSION DETECTION  Taxonomy of Intrusion  Detection Intrusion is a set of actions that attempt to compromise the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of any resour ce on a computing platform    A n i n t r us i o n  de t e c t i on  s y s t e m  IDS is a combination of hardware and software that detect intrusions in the network An IDS can monitor all the network activities and hence can detect the signs of intrusions The main objective of IDS is to alarm the system administrator that any suspicious activity happened There are two types of Intrusion detection techniques   Anomaly Detection Detecting malicious activities based on deviations from the normal behavior are 978-1-4577-1583-9/ 12/ $26.00 © 2012 IEEE  


   2012 International Conference on Computer Communica tion and Informatics ICCCI 2012\, Jan. 10 – 12, 2012, Coimbatore, INDIA   considered as attacks Although it can detect unknown intrusions, rate of missing report is low   Misuse Detection Detecting intrusions based on a pattern for the malicious activity   I t  c a n  be  ve r y  helpful for known attack patterns Also rate of missing report is high  One disadvantage of Misuse Detection over Anomaly Detection is that it can only detect intrusions which contain known patterns of attack  Working of  Intrusion detection systems Authors of   p r e s e n t e d  a  f our  s t e p a pp r o a c h  f o r  t he  generalized working of IDS    Data collection  It involves collecting network traffic using particular software and thus helps to g et the information about the traffic like types of packets hosts and protocol details   Feature Selection: - The collected data is substantiall y large because of the huge network traffic we generate feature vectors that contain only necessary information In network-based intrusion detection it can be IP header information which consists of source and destination IP address, packet type, layer 4 protocol type and other flags   Analysis: - The collected data is analyzed in this step to determine whether data is anomalous or not. Here we use various methods for detecting intrusions   Action :- IDS alarm the system administrator that an attack has happened and it tells about the nature of the attack.IDS also participate in controlling the attacks by closing the network port or killing the processes  III. DATA MINING TECHNOLOGY  The term data mining is used to describe the process of extracting useful information from the large databases  Data mining analyses the observed sets to discover the unknown relation and sum up the results of data analysis to make the owner of data to understand   H e nc e  d a t a  mining problems are considered as a data analysis problem Data mining framework automatically detect patterns in our data set and use these patterns to find a s et of malicious binaries.ie Data mining techniques can detect patterns in large amount of data, such as byte cod e and use these patterns to detect future instances in simila r data  In intrusion detection system information comes from various sources like host data network log data alarm messages etc.Since the variety of different data source s is too complex, the complexity of the operating system als o increases Also network traffic is huge so the data analysis is very hard The data mining technology have the capability of extracting large databases it is of gre at importance to use data mining techniques in intrusion detection By applying data mining technology intrusion detection system can widely verify the data to obtain a model thus helps to obtain a comparison between the abnormal pattern and the normal behavior pattern. Manual analysis is not required for this method One of the main advantages is that same data mining tool can be applied to different data sources. An important problem in intrusion detection is  how effectively can separate the attack patterns and normal data patterns from a large number of network data and how effectively generate automatic intrusion rules after collected raw network data To accomplish this various data mining techniques are used such as classification clustering association rule mi ning etc.Examples for Data Mining based Misuse detection model of IDS are JAM Java Agents for Metalearning\,MADAM ID Mining Audit Data for Automated Models for Intrusion Detection and Automated Discovery of Concise Predictive Rules for Intrusion Detection  Examples for Data Mining based Anomaly detection model for IDS are MINDS and EBays.Examples for Data Mining based both Anomaly and Misuse detection model for IDS are IIDS Intelligent Intrusion Detection Syste m Architecture and RIDS-100 Rising Intrusion Detection System  System Design   Figure 1.

   2012 International Conference on Computer Communica tion and Informatics ICCCI 2012\, Jan. 10 – 12, 2012, Coimbatore, INDIA Data Preprocess module Certain techniques like data cleaning data integration data reduction techniques etc are used to convert a data packet into suitable mining forms   Data Mining module Data obtained from the data preprocess module is stored in the data warehouse. Also it mines the training data which the control module outputs Data in the data warehouse becomes more and more rich since the data gathering process carries on continuously So data warehouse contains all kinds of data and mine useful information. Data mining algorithm library consists of different data mining algorithms like sequence pattern analysis algorithm connection rule algorithm sorting algorithm clustering algorithm etc.Data mining process control is responsible for choosing efficient and appropriate mining algorithm from the library and hence it is the key of the system model Here system design considers training dataset, the data mining control module may extract features and the patterns for detection using the algorithms from the algorithms library When the system begins running and the dataset is not trained, th en the data mining control module may be trained by taking data from the data warehouse. Then data in the dataset can be categorized as normal data and attack data by choosi ng clustering algorithm.Finally the output of the mining is transmitted to intrusion detection module   Intrusion Detection Module Intrusion detection module is a combination of rule library Intrusion detection. Rul e library is the repository of rules that is needed for intrusion detection and check for a matching with the output from the data mining modules  Manager Interface Module This module is responsible for making decision on the normal pattern and abnormal pattern. If the decision result is normal pattern, adds it to its close normal pattern in the library If the result i s abnormal pattern add it to its close abnormal pattern  in the library and carries out necessary preventive measur es  IV. DATA MINING TECHNIQUES  AND INTRUSION DETECTION   Data Mining is used in variety of applications that requires data analysis Now a day’s data mining techniques plays an important role in intrusion detection systems Different data mining techniques like Classification Clustering and Association rules are frequently used to acquire information about intrusions by observing network data This section describes different data mining techniques that help in detecting intrusions   Classification Classification is a form of data analysis which takes each instance of a dataset and assigns it to a particular class. It extracts models defining important data classes Such models are called classifiers 9  A  classification based IDS will classify all the network traffic into either normal or malicious. Data classifi cation consists of two steps  learning and classification A classifier is formed in the learning step and that model is used to predict the class labels for a given data in the classification step. Classification analysis requires t hat the end-user/analyst know ahead of time how classes are defined  E a c h r e c o r d  i n  t he  da t a s e t  a l r e a d y  h a v e  v a l ue  for the attribute used to define the classes The object ive of a classifier is not to explore the data to discover different classes but to find how new records should be arranged into classes. Classification helps us to categori ze the data records in a predetermined set .It can be used as attribute to label each record and for distinguishing elements belonging to the normal or malicious class 1  D i f f e r e nt  t y pe s  o f  c l a s s i f i c a t i on t e c h ni qu e s  a r e  decision tree induction Bayesian networks-nearest neighbor classifier, genetic algorithm and fuzzy logic   As compared to the clustering technique classification  technique is less efficient in the field of intrusion detection The main reason for this is the enormous amount of data needed to be collected to use classification To classify the dataset into normal and  abnormal large amount of data is required to analyze its proximity Classification method can be useful for both misuse detection and anomaly detection but it is more commonly used for misuse detection  Authors of [1  pr e s e nt e d  a  d a t a  c l a s s i f i c a t i on  f o r  i n t r u sion detection that can be achieved by the following steps 1  In order to study about the classification models of the normal and abnormal sequences of system calls we want to supply it with a training data set containing pre-labeled normal or abnormal sequences Different techniques like linear discrimination, decision tree or rule based methods is used to scan the network traces Then generate a collection of unique sequence of system calls and named it as normal list 2  Next scan each of the intrusion traces Find each sequence of system calls in the normal list. If an exact  match can be found then labeled it as normal Otherwise it is labeled as abnormal 3  Next ensure that the normal traces consist of all possible normal short sequence of system calls An intrusion trace contains combination of normal and abnormal sequences of system calls since abnormal sequence only appear in some places  Clustering Since the amount of available network data is too large human labeling is time-consuming and expensive Clustering is the process of labeling data a nd assigning into groups.ie Clustering is a division of data into groups of similar objects. Each group, called cluster consists of members from the same cluster are quite similar and members from the different clusters are

Clustering is an unsupervised  machine learning mechanism for discovering patterns in unlabeled data with many dimensions Clustering is the collection of patterns based on similarity. Patterns wit hin a cluster are equivalent to each other but they are different with other clusters Therefore patterns that are far from any of these clusters indicate that an unusual activity happened That can be part of a new attack Clustering can be applied on both Anomaly detection and Misuse detection  Authors of [1  pr e s e nt s  ba s i c  s t e p s  i n v ol v e d i n i d e nt i f y i ng  intrusion are follows 1  Find the largest cluster which consists of maximum number of instances and label it as normal 2  Sort the remaining clusters in an ascending order of their distances to the largest cluster 3  Select the first K1 clusters so that the number of data instances in these clusters sum up to N and label them as normal where  is the percentage of normal instances 4  Label all other clusters as malicious 5  After clustering heuristics are used to automatically label each cluster as either normal or malicious The self labeled clusters are then used to detect attacks in a separate test dataset  Association Rule The association rule considers each attribute/value pai r as an item Collection of items referred as an item set in a  single network request. The algorithm searches to find an item set from large number of dataset that frequently appears in network. The main aim of association rule is to derive multi-feature correlations from a database table  1  A s s o c i a t i o n  r ul e  m i ni n g  de t e r m i ne s  a s s o c i a t i on  r ul e s  and/or correlation relationships among large set of data items Association rule shows conditions for attribute values that occur frequently in the dataset. An example of association rule mining is Market Basket analysis Association rules are obtained from the dataset and they are in the form of if-then statements.Apriori was the first scalable algorithm developed for association rule mining  Association rule mining in intrusion detection is very useful in many ways Authors of  p r e s e nt s  ba s i c  s t e ps for incorporating association rule for intrusion detectio n as follows 1  First network data need to be arranged into a database table where each row is an audit record and each column is a field of the audit records 2  It is always shows that the intrusions and user activities shows frequent correlations among network data. Consistent behaviors’ in the network data can be captured in association rules 3  Also rules based on network data can continuously merge the rules from a new run to the aggregate rule set of all previous runs 4  Thus with the association rule we get the capability to capture behavior in association rule for correctly detecting intrusions and hence lowering the false alarm rate  V.CONCLUSION  In this paper, we describe different data mining technique  applied for detecting intrusions This paper provides the details of two types of intrusion detection and general working principle of IDS.Misuse detection techniques are not sufficient for identifying unknown attacks For detecting unknown intrusions, we need to go for anomaly detection Also this paper presents the main concepts of data mining process and the system design for data mining based intrusion detection pattern Different Data mining techniques like classification clustering and association rule are very helpful in analyzing the network data. Since  large amount of network traffic needs to be collected for  intrusion detection clustering is more suitable than classification in the domain of intrusion detection Data mining technology helps to understand normal behavior inside the data and use this knowledge for detecting unknown intrusions  REFERENCES  1   Chang-Tien Lu,Arnold P.Boedihardjo,Prajwal Manalwar  Exploiting efficient data mining techniques to enh ance Intrusion Detection Systems 0-7803-9093-8/05/$20.0 0 2005 IEEE,512-517 2   Sandeep Kumar Classifications and Detections of c omputer intrusions A Thesis Submitted to the Faculty of  Purdue University,1995 3   Christine Dartigue Hyun Ik jang,and Wenjun Zeng A  New Data-Mining Based Approach for Network Intrusion Detection”,2009 Seventh Annual Communication Network s and Services Research Conference IEEE,pg 372-377 4   Khaled Labib Computer Security and Intrusion Dete ction from Crossroads TheACM students magazine 5   Mohammadreza,Ektefa,Sara,Memar,Fatimah,Sidi,Lilly Suriani Affendey, “Intrusion Detection Using Data Mining Te chniques 2010 IEEE,pg 200 -203 6   Xiao bin Wang  Guang-yuan yang,Yi-chao Li,Dan Liu  Review on the application of Artificial Intelligenc e in Antivirus Detection System” 2008 IEEE 7   Matthew G.Schultz and Eleazar Eskin,Erez Zadok,Salv atore J.Stolfo .”Data Mining Methods for Detection of New Malicious Executables”.2001, In Proceedings of the IEEE Sympo sium on Security and Privacy 8   LI Min, An Yang Institute of Technology,.”Applicati on of Data Mining Techniques in Intrusion Detection

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to ef“ciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
