With the increase in the number of rules, the performance of pattern matching algorithm has been a gradually decline and has been a bottleneck. A new type of pattern matching based on suffix tree is proposed. The method mines rule\222s data structure and prunes rule set based suffix tree, the model size of the search space has been reduced Experiments show compared to the conventional pattern matching method, it is an effect ive method to reduce the time of pattern matching, and improves the detection efficiency of intrusion detection systems Keywords- Pattern matching; Intrusion Detection; Suffix tree I I NTRODUC ION Intrusion Detection System \(IDS\s become an indispensable part of the network security system. There are two types of detection technology i n int rusi on det e c t i on system: one is the Anomaly Detection; the other is Misuse Detection. In misuse detec tion system, when the system receives a new network packet or session process the new data will be matched with the pre-defined patterns of behavior. If there is a pre-defined patterns of behavior matched successful the new data will be regarded as an "invasion At present there are several classical pattern matching algorithm   AC, M W M A C _BM a nd E2 XB With the increasing network traffic and rule library, intrusion detection systems had to detect more and more objects, the efficiency of the matching algorithm has be more urgent problem to be resolved. Experts put forward some new methods to improve the efficiency of matching 4,5,6  but  there were still some deficiencies II S UFFIX TREE in practice. For fast increasing search time of rule matching, a suffix tree-based pattern matching algorithm is proposed. This algorithm mines association rule set and draw simple rules set to construct a descending suffix tree, and effec tively reduce the pattern search time, and it improves the efficiency of intrusion detection Experimental demonstration shows that the algorithm can effectively improve the effici ency of intrusion detection Let S [1 S [1]S [2 205S n  be a string of length n on an alphabet A with | A n. S i s a u n i que t e rm i n at or which alphabetically precedes all other symbols. The j-th suffix of S is defined as S [ j S j S j+1 205 S[n and exp re ssed by S j The suffix tree of a String S 1 i s a co m p ressed t r i e bui lt  on all suffi has n l e aves, each of wh i c h corresponds to a suffix of S. Each label is labeled by a string called edge-label. The concatenation of labels on a path from the root to a node is called the path-label of the node. The path-label of each leaf coincides with a suffix. For each internal node, its children are sorted in the alphabetic order of the first characters of edge-labels. The le aves are then sorted in the lexicographic order of suffixes. We store the indices j of suffixes S A substring S [1 i s cal l e d a prefi x  of T j in this order in an integer array SA[1..n Th is is called the suffix array. Figure 1 shows the suffix tree for a string 223ababac$.\224 Leaf nodes are shown by boxes, and numbers in the boxes represent the elemen ts of the suffix array Internal nodes are shown by circles, and the numbers in them represent their inorder ranks, which are defined later The string-depth of a node is the length of the string represented by the node, while the node-depth of a node is the number of nodes on the path from the root node to the node including itself and excluding the root node Suffix links are defined for all internal nodes, except the root node, The suffix link sl v nternal node v with path-label x where x denotes a single character and  denotes a possibly empty substring, is the node with path-label  Suffix links are not only necessary to construct a suffix tree in linear time but also solve problems efficiently, for example finding the longest common substring of two strings in linear time A suffix tree is decomposed into five components: string tree topology, node-depths, edge-labels and suffix links. A basic representation is the following: String is the string S  which is encoded in n lg A bits. Tree topology represents This work is completed under the suppor t of the 863 Project of China \(No 2009AA043507 Plan of China \(No. 2008GH531170 21 978-1-4577-1415-3/12/$26.00 \2512012 IEEE 


parent-child relationships of nodes and consists of O n  pointers, which occupies O\(n lg n its. Node-depths store the string-depth for each internal node in n lg n bits. An edge-label between internal nodes is represented by a pointer to the string in n lg n bits. Note that the length of the edge is computed from node-depths of both endpoints of the edge. An edge-label between an internal node and a l eaf is represented by the suffix array of S, which occupies n lg n bits. Suffix links are pointers between internal nodes and are represented in n lg n bits III D ESCENDING SUFFIX TREE BASED PATTERN MATCHING ALGORITHM DST_PM On string searching and matching in the rules set, if a rule is a frequent item, then it\222s an y substring set is frequent. The suffix tree based tree structure is used to search through space for frequent patterns and to judge the resulting of closed mode Then search space will be reduced by cutting branches, in order to avoid generating larger candidate rules items, while the link will be generated as suffix between the nodes. Thus, the rule base structure will become smaller and more efficient under the mining process in the search Finally, complete content and organizational editing before formatting. Please take note of the following items when proofreading spelling and grammar A Definitions Set a collection of items I={I 1 I 2 I N and transaction data set T={T 1 T 2 T N Ti I, Ti is a transaction of I. Transaction T contains item set X, if and only if X T. In the transaction data set T, the number of item set X of T is called supported count, denoted by count \(X\ Support of X is expressed as support \(X X\N is the total number of transactions in T Given transaction data set T and the minimum support threshold min_sup, item set X is frequent if and only if support \(X min_sup. Search in the transaction data set can be described as mining problem: Given a transaction database T and the minimum support threshold min_sup Definition 1 Given a transaction database TDB and the minimum support threshold min_sup, Item set X is closed mode, if and only if the following two conditions hold 1\ item set X is frequent 2 Y X, Meet the support\(Y support\(X Definition 2 Given a transaction data set T and the minimum support threshold min_sup, when X and X Y is closed mode, the rules X Y as a closed model that's based on simple association rules Definition 3 Descending Suffix Tree \(DST\is a clue to the tree, defined as follows 1 contains a root node, with null tag, each node in the tree as subtree is a child of the root. Subtrees do not contain the root node, and support with a large node closer to the roots 2\de contains a su btree suffix field, which is a pointer pointing to the suffix chai n. The chain contains itemsets in the current study issues arising from items. This field is initially set to null 3\pport descending suffix tree is a trail tree. All nodes with same item value are horizontal pointer is linked together to form a node chain. There are two arrays, link-head and link-head o i n t ed to  th e v alu e of the tree with th e first node, and total [item record s t h e n ode co unt of no de chai n  4\With the mining in-depth search, DST continuously adjusts to form a new leaf node and the suffix node chain, Also updates and sets up each leaf node of the suffix B Mining and pruning rules based suffix tree  In search of the entire rule space, descending suffix tree may cut off non-closed candidate, and detects the common suffix item, then clears non-cl osed mode. When the search finished digging an item, it will delete the corresponding nodes or links into the suffix, do not need to do additional operations While the suffix tree creates nodes it needs to set the suffix chain 1 rules mining process In mining process, set CF \(i m i 2 i 1  i 1 i 2 i m  indicates that the search exca vation, resulting in item set {i 1 i 2  i m for the beginning of the candidate frequent closed patterns set. When the CF\(i m i 2 i 1 is set to null, then all the smaller items i i 1 non-empty set CF \(i m  i 2 i 1 When candidate simple rules set is created, sub-frequent closed patterns and frequent closed patterns will be generated in closed patterns. Then it should be calculated it\222s confidence and form a simple association rule s, then put forward. As the mining process, intermediate candidates closed mode need not to be saved, and mining results generated in accordance with the order of items, so only a small amount of simple candidate association rules set will be saved pty 2 item pruning process When an item is assessed, if the public item found in this node chain, it will be cut down When item e is assessed, if the suffix contains the public item f, in the current mining including the term f must contain e; f can not be composed of longer closed mode, then it should be cut When the suffix tree has finished mining an item, it merged all assessed nodes to form the suffix chain, without re-creating the suffix chain of the parent node. If the parent suffix chain is empty, put the current node and its suffix links as parent\222s suffix. When a candidate creates suffix tree and sets the suffix the common suffix item appeared in original suffix tree will not be copied With the deepening of mining and branches the suffix tree becomes smaller and simple 3 Algorithm steps Start Create a descending suffix tree \(DST Loop DST proceeds as follows step 1: Traversal query DST, obtain the most pending frequent items i k and set CFCS  22

AC and DST_PM, reflecting the better performance, take more peaceful on time consump tion growth. But DST_PM compared with AC has better performance B Experiment 2 testing algorithm performance on memory consumption To test the performance of algorithm\222s memory consumption changed with the number of rules, DST_PM, AC algorithm, and BM algorithm take experiment with rule\222s number increasing with 500, the result shown in Figure 3 Memory consumption performance of the three algorithms BM does not use complex algorithms to preprocess the data structure, so its space consumption is minimal. Compared with AC DST_PM spent more memory consumption because it should convert the original rules set into rule suffix tree V C ONCLUSIONS A simple suffix tree-based pattern matching algorithm was presented. It adopted rule set\222s mining and pruning mechanism based on the suffix, shown an effective rules item pruning, and generated a clean association ru le set with avoiding duplication of data sets. Thus DST_PM improves the matching algorithm efficiency on time consumption. Tested by experiments, our algorithm can improve the efficiency of matching time in IDS There was a shortcoming on the increase in space consumption which would be the focus of our further study A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work is completed under the support of the 863 Project of China \(No. 2009AA043507\d the National Torch Plan of China \(No. 2008GH531170 R EFERENCES  Boy er R s,M oor e Rs   A fast str i ng sear ching algor ith m  J   Communication of the ACM,1977,20 10\772  A ho AV Corasick MJ.

distance metric d A  e.g edit distance or cosine similarity  o n t e x t or the m etric o n numeric data 2 The s election o f distance metric is out of the scope of this study Please refer to  f or a s urv e y  Let d A  a 1 a 2  denote the distance between two values a 1 and a 2 on attribute A  A differential dependency  DD    X 002 Y 002   speci는s a pattern 002 of distance thresholds on attributes X and Y  also denoted by 002  XY   The projection 002  A  on attribute A 005 X 006 Y denotes the distance threshold of A  A DD states the constraint that for any two tuples t 1 and t 2 in a relation instance r of R if d A i  t 1  A i  t 2  A i  003 002  A i   007 A i 005 X  then it must have d A j  t 1  A j  t 2  A j  003 002  A j   007 A j 005 Y where 002  A i  and 002  A j  are distance thresholds on the attributes of A i and A j respectively For example a DD  Address  002  Region   8  3   in the Hotel relation speci는s the constraint that if two tuples have similar Address with edit distance no greater than 002  Address  8  then their Region values are also similar with edit distance 003 002  Region   Note that the distance thresholds on the determinant attributes X could be large If 002  X  is close to d max the maximum distance value it states that no matter whether the X values are similar or not the constraints on Y can be achieved anyway The larger the 002  X  is the weaker the Y side depends on the similarity of X When 002  X  d max  the constraint on X is unlimited i.e any tuple pair can always have distance 003 d max  In fact for any attribute A 005R  X 006 Y  that does not appear in a DD  X 002 Y 002  it already implies an unlimited constraint 002  A  d max on A  We say that 002  Y  is independent of A  B Statistical Measures In order to compute the measures of support con늓ence and dependent quality we de늝e the following statistics Following the support and con늓ence measures de늝ed on tuple pairs we study the statistics of tuple pairs with respect to metric distance Given an instance of relation R with N data tuples  we conduct a pair-wise matching of all N tuples The metric distance of each tuple pair is denoted by a matching tuple b  where b  A  is the distance of the data tuple pair on attribute A 005R  As illustrated below for the evaluation of each 002  we have to visit all the tuple pairs once To avoid the recomputation among the evaluation of different 002  we can precompute the matching tuples from all tuple pairs and store them for reuse Let M be a matching relation with total M  M  N  N  1 2 matching tuples obtained from the pair-wise matching If the distance values on X of a matching tuple b can satisfy the corresponding thresholds 002  X   we say that b satis는s 002  X   denoted by b 002 002  X  Let count  b 002 002  X  denote the total number of matching tuples b 005M that can satisfy 002  X   We introduce the following statistics D 002  count  b 002 002  X  M 1 Indeed D 002  can be regarded as the support of 002  X  in the left-hand-side of 002  To illustrate the computation of statistical measures we consider the previously used running example in Table I in the introduction Since there are 15 tuple pairs in Table I and 6 of them have distance 003 8 on Address we have D dd 1   15  0  4  C 002  count  b 002 002  XY  count  b 002 002  X  2 Moreover C 002  is exactly the con늓ence de늝ition of 002  i.e the ratio of tuple pairs satisfying 002  XY  to the pairs satisfying 002  X   For example in Table I among 6 pairs of tuples satisfying 002  X  of dd 1  there are 4 tuple pairs also having Region distances 003 3  Thereby the con늓ence of dd 1 is 4  6  Consequently the overall support of 002 is S 002  002  002   i.e the proportion of tuple pairs whose distances satisfy the thresholds in 002  XY  on both attributes of X and Y  e.g S dd 1   15  Q 002  002 A 002 Y d max  002  A   Y  d max 3 Finally the dependent quality Q 002  denotes the quality of tolerance in the dependent side i.e how the distance thresholds 002  Y  on dependent attributes Y is close to the equality Intuitively as presented in formula 3 the smaller the distance thresholds on Y are the higher the dependent quality Q 002  is When the distance thresholds are set to the smallest 0 the dependent quality will be the highest 1  0  i.e the equality case On the other hand the largest threshold d max will have the lowest dependent quality 0  0  C Threshold Determination Problem There are various distance threshold settings that can be associated to the DD son X 002 Y  while only some of them with high utility are interesting to users i.e those ones with high support con늓ence and dependent quality The determination process often needs users to specify the minimum requirements of these three statistical measures As mentioned in the introduction it is dif늒ult to set parameters of minimum support con늓ence and dependent quality respectively Setting some requirements high may lead other measures to be low To avoid tuning parameters manually we are interested in an overall evaluation of utility Let b be any matching tuple We study the following prediction probability U 002 Pr b 002 002  Y   Q 002  is high  b 002 002  X   4 i.e the conditional probability of b satisfying 002  Y  with high dependent quality given b satis는s 002  X   Intuitively to accurately detect the violations with small distance we expect the above probability of a 002 to be high This U 002  can roughly denote the utility of con늓ence and dependent quality while support is not investigated Therefore we aim to compute an expected utility to re늝e U 002  w.r.t con늓ence and dependent quality by using support  U 002  E U 002   C 002   D 002   Q 002

where C 002   D 002  and Q 002  are the statistics observed from the matching relation M  The computation and properties of the expected utility are discussed in the following Section IV In short we can nd that the expected utility of a 002 is high if it has high support con늓ence and dependent quality Finally we formulate the determination problem without manually specifying the individual requirements De늝ition 1 The distance threshold determination problem is to nd a distance threshold pattern 002 for the DD on X 002 Y with the maximum expected utility  U 002   IV C OMPUTING E XPECTED U TILITY In this section we present the detailed computation steps of the expected utility and then analyze the corresponding properties Computation Given a data instance we can compute the statistics C 002   D 002   Q 002  denoted by C  D  Q  According to the Bayesian rule we have the expected utility as follows  U 002  E U  C  D  Q  003 uP U  u  C  D  Q du  003 u P U  u C  D  Q P C  D  Q du  003 u P C  Q  U u D P U  u  D P C  Q  D du  004 uP C  Q  U u D P U  u  D du P C  Q  D  Consider all possible u values 003 P U  u  C  D  Q du 1 010 003 P U  u C  D  Q P C  D  Q du 1 010 003 P C  Q  U u D P U  u  D P C  Q  D du 1 010 P C  Q  D  003 P C  Q  U u D P U  u  D du Based on the above two derivations we have E U  C  D  Q  004 uP C  Q  U u D P U  u  D du 004 P C  Q  U u D P U  u  D du  P C  Q  U u D can be modeled exactly as a Binomial distribution  denoted by DCQ 011 B D u   Recall the de늝ition of Binomial distribution Consider a set of n objects each of which yields success with probability p  then the probability of k successes in n objects is given by the probability mass function of Binomial distribution f  k  n p  005 n k 006 p k 1  p  n  k  In our scenario we nd D instances from the matching relation M satisfying 002  X  i.e n D  Among them we observed DCQ instances satisfying 002  Y  with high dependent quality i.e k DCQ successes Moreover according to formula 4 u is the probability of predicting Y with high dependent quality given X i.e p  u  Finally the probability of observing C  Q is given by f DCQ D u   Thereby we can rewrite the computation formula E U  C  D  Q  004 uf DCQ D u  P U  u  D du 004 f DCQ D u  P U  u  D du  P U  u  D is exactly P U  u   since the utility U is independent of D which concerns X only The prior P U  u  denotes the distribution of 002  i.e the fraction of 002 with U u  Note that the observed CQ can be interpreted as an estimation of the prediction probability of utility u  i.e the probability of matching tuples that satisfy 002  X  also satisfying 002  Y  with a high dependent quality Thus we use the histogram P CQ to estimate P U  u   which can also be modeled by the Binomial distribution P U  u  003  u  f  u 1  CQ  where CQ is the mean of CQ  Finally we can compute the expected utility  U 002  by  U 002  E U  C  D  Q  004 uf DCQ D u  003  u  du 004 f DCQ D u  003  u  du  5 Property We discuss the properties of the expected utility that is how the support con늓ence and dependent quality measures of 002 contribute to the expected utility  U 002  All the proofs of the following lemma theorem and proposition can be found in the full version Theorem 1 For any 002 1 002 2 if 002 1 has higher support than 002 2  denoted by S 002 1  S 002 2   004 004 012 1  and the con늓ence and dependent quality of 002 1 are higher than those of 002 2 as follows C 002 1  C 002 2  012 004 Q 002 1  Q 002 2  012 1 003  then we have  U 002 1  012  U 002 2   This conclusion veri는s our intuition that higher support con늓ence and dependent quality will contribute to a larger expected utility Indeed to clarify the contributions of measures clearly we can x one of them and derive the contributions of the other two measures For instance as we will see in Theorem 2 below if any 002 1 002 2 have the same D measure then the higher con늓ence and dependent quality of 002 1 will yield a higher expected utility  U 002 1  than that of 002 2  So far we have presented the computation of expected utility with clari늒ation on the corresponding properties We are now ready to nd the distance threshold patterns for DD s with the maximum expected utility in a parameter-free style instead of studying how to specify the minimum requirements of several statistical measures V D ETERMINATION A LGORITHM In this section we study the nding of one or several setting of distance thresholds for the DD son X 002 Y with the maximum expected utility i.e 002 max argmax 002  U 002  The determination process has mainly two steps i to nd the best 002  Y  when given a xed 002  X   ii to nd the desired 002  X  together with its best 002  Y  which has the maximum  U 002

The previous FD s discovery considers the combination of attributes and t ar gets on minimizing a s ingle m easure such as g 3 18  I n c ontrast w e s tudy the determination of distance thresholds on certain attributes X Y and aim to maximize the expected utility with respect to three measures Recognizing the major difference and challenges in the following we investigate several pruning methods and bounds by exploring the unique features of the expected utility A Determination for Dependent Attributes First we consider the determination for the dependent attributes given a xed 002  X   to nd the corresponding best 002  Y  on the dependent attributes Y with the maximum  U 002   For an attribute A 005 Y  we can consider the search space of distance threshold 002  A  from 0 to d max  For example supposing that the maximum distance value is 9  we denote all the distance thresholds as dis   0  1  2  9   Let C Y denote the set of distance threshold patterns 002  Y  by enumerating all the distance thresholds 002  A  005 dis for all the dependent attributes A 005 Y  For instance as shown in Figure 1 a each node such as  1  1   corresponds to a 002  Y  005C Y  Suppose that two attributes in Y have the same dis   0  1  2  9   Figure 1 a illustrates all the distance threshold patterns in C Y  from  0  0  to  9  9   Since 002  X  on the determinant attributes X is xed in the current step according to formula 1 the D 002  value is the same for any 002 such that 002  Y  005C Y  Therefore we mainly study the other two measures C 002  and Q 002  in terms of contributions to the expected utility  U 002   Theorem 2 Consider any two 002 1 002 2  having the same D 002 1  002 2 D  If their con늓ence and dependent quality satisfy C 002 1  002 1  012 C 002 2  002 2   then we have  U 002 1  012  U 002 2   According to Theorem 2 for a xed 002  X  to늝da 002 with the maximum  U 002  is equivalent to nd the one with the maximum C 002  002   For each 002  Y  005C Y  we can directly calculate the dependent quality Q 002  by formula 3 Moreover together with the given 002  X  on the determinant attributes X  we can also compute the measure C 002  from M using formula 2 The result 002 with the maximum  U 002  can be found by one pass through all the 002  Y  005C Y  Algorithm 1 presents the approach of nding the best 002  Y  for a given 002  X  such that the expected utility  U 002  is maximized As mentioned to nd the result we only need to compute C 002 i  002 i  for each 002 i such that 002 i  Y  005C Y and 002 i  X  002  X   Line 3 in Algorithm 1 computes the C 002 i  from M by using formula 2 Let V max denote the maximum value of C 002  002  in the rst i  1 candidates i.e V max  i  1 max j 1 C 002 j  002 j   Initially we can set V max 0 The 002 max in Line 5 records the distance threshold pattern with the maximum C 002  002  value and will be returned as the result Suppose that we consider d values of distance thresholds in each attribute i.e  dis   d Inthis PA approach we need Algorithm 1 for Dependent Attributes PA  M 002  X  V max  1 for each 002 i  Y  005C Y do 2 let 002 i  X  002  X  3 compute C 002 i  from M 4 if C 002 i  002 i  V max then 5 002 max  002 i V max C 002 i  002 i  6 return 002 max  a b Fig 1 Pruning on dependent attributes to consider the combination of d distance thresholds in all Y attributes as the candidate patterns in C Y  i.e C Y   d  Y  in size For each candidate 002  there is a costly step to compute C 002   According to formula 2 for each 002  we have to count the number of matching tuples in M which can satisfy 002  XY   With the increase of data sizes the matching relation size M  M will be large as well The cost O  Md  Y   of PA is high Therefore we propose the following pruning techniques to reduce the number of candidates during the computation Pruning approach To study the pruning of pattern candidates let납 rst introduce the relationships between distance threshold patterns Consider any attribute set Z of R  De늝ition 2 For any 002 1 002 2 if 002 1  A  012 002 2  A  holds for all the attributes 007 A 005 Z  then we say that 002 1  Z  dominates 002 2  Z   denoted by 002 1  Z  002 002 2  Z   Figure 1 a shows the dominant relationships of candidates in C Y  An arrow from a node 002 2  Y  to 002 1  Y  denotes that 002 1  Y  dominates 002 2  Y   i.e 002 1  Y  002 002 2  Y  Wepresentthe dominant relationships between two neighbor levels For the domination between other levels we can derive them by the transitivity property i.e if 002 1  Y  002 002 2  Y  and 002 2  Y  002 002 3  Y   we have 002 1  Y  002 002 3  Y  as well For example in Figure 1 a  1  1  also dominates  0  0   which is not shown Lemma 1 For any two 002 1 002 2  having 002 1  X  002 2  X  and 002 1  Y  002 002 2  Y  then C 002 1  012 C 002 2  and Q 002 1  003 Q 002 2   According to Lemma 1 by a downward traversal of candidates in the dominant graph the dependent quality increases from 0 to 1 On the other hand as shown in Figure 1 b the con늓ence increases from 0 to 1 in an upward traversal Consider the current 002 i in traversal of C Y Let 002 max denote

the candidate with the maximum C 002 max  002 max  V max in the previously processed i  1 candidates in C Y  002 max argmax 002 j j 002 1 i   C 002 j  002 j   We have the opportunity of pruning the following two sets of remaining 002 k without conducting the costly computation of C 002 k   i Pruning by 002 max  The rst pruning opportunity is introduced by 002 max of the previously processed i  1 candidates Proposition 1 For any 002 k  Y  005C Y with Q 002 k  003 V max we have  U 002 max  012  U 002 k   We identify the candidates that can be pruned according to Proposition 1 Let S 0   002 k  Q 002 k  003 V max 002 k  Y  005C Y   Since con늓ence is always less than or equal to 1 we have C 002 k  002 k  003 Q 002 k  003 V max  As illustrated in Figure 1 b all the 002 k in S 0 can be safely pruned without computing C 002 k  from M  ii Pruning by 002 i  The second pruning opportunity is developed according to the current 002 i in i th step Proposition 2 For any 002 k  Y  005C Y with 002 i  Y  002 002 k  Y  and Q 002 k  003 V max C 002 i   we have  U 002 max  012  U 002 k   Similarly the candidates that can be pruned according to Proposition 2 are represented by S 1   002 k  002 i 002 002 k  Q 002 k  003 V max C 002 i  002 k  Y  005C Y   as shown in Figure 1 b According to 002 i  Y  002 002 k  Y  wehave C 002 k  003 C 002 i   It implies C 002 k  002 k  003 C 002 i  002 k  003 V max  Therefore all the 002 k in S 1 can be safely pruned as well without computing C 002 k   Based on the above two propositions we develop Algorithm 2 namely PAP  which prunes the candidates of S 0 and S 1 when passing through each 002 i 005C Y  The operation prune 002 q  removes all the patterns dominated by 002 from the candidate set C Y  whose dependent quality Q 002 k  is less than or equal to q  For example in Line 7 prune 002 i  V max C 002 i   removes patterns 002 in S 1 from C Y  according to Proposition 2 Note that any 002 k is dominated by 002 0  002 0  Y  002 002 k  Y  where 002 0 has 002 0  A  d max for each attribute A 005 Y  Therefore in Line 6 we can also use the same function prune 002 0 V max  to prune the set S 0  according to Proposition 1 Finally we discuss the processing orders of candidates in C Y  Heuristically in order to maximize the pruning power we would like to nd the largest V max as early as possible As illustrated in Figure 1 if we rst process patterns in the top the corresponding dependent quality is small  013 0  which leads to a small V max  indicating weak pruning power On the other hand when the patterns in the bottom are processed rst the corresponding V max is also small due to the low con늓ence  013 0  Therefore during the processing we heuristically choose the patterns in the middle to be processed rst namely midrst order in C Y  Algorithm 2 for Dependent Attributes with Pruning PAP  M 002  X  V max  1 for each 002 i  Y  005C Y do 2 let 002 i  X  002  X  3 compute C 002 i  from M 4 if C 002 i  002 i  V max then 5 002 max  002 i V max C 002 i  002 i  6 prune 002 0 V max   remove patterns in S 0 from C Y  7 prune 002 i  V max C 002 i    remove patterns in S 1 from C Y  8 return 002 max B Determination for Determinant Attributes Next we consider all possible distance threshold patterns of the determinant attributes X say C X and늝da 002 with the maximum  U 002   The straight-forward approach is to compute the best 002  Y  for each 002  X  005C X respectively by using PA  and then return the one with the maximum  U 002   Algorithm 3 presents the straight-forward computation of a distance threshold 002 max with the maximum expected utility For each 002 i  X  005C X  Line 3 computes D 002 i  from M by using formula 1 By calling the PA or PAP algorithm we can compute the best 002 i  Y  with respect to the current 002 i  X   For the initial bound V max  as mentioned before we can set V max 0 as illustrated in Line 4 Finally the expected utility  U 002 i  of each 002 i in Line 5 is computed by using formula 5 as presented in Section IV Here U max records the maximum expected utility in the rst i  1 candidates U max  i  1 max j 1  U 002 j   Initially we set U max 0  The returned 002 max is the distance threshold pattern with the maximum expected utility U max  Algorithm 3 for Determinant Attributes DA  M  1 U max 0 2 for each 002 i  X  005C X do 3 compute D 002 i  from M 4 compute 002 i  Y  by PA  M 002 i  X   0  5  U 002 i  E U 002 i   C 002 i   D 002 i   Q 002 i  6 if U max   U 002 i  then 7 002 max  002 i U max   U 002 i  8 return 002 max Again considering all d distance threshold values in each attribute there are d  X  and d  Y  candidates in set C X and C Y respectively Let c   X    Y  be the total number of attributes in X and Y  The total number of candidates evaluated in the algorithm is C X C Y   d c  Note that for each candidate we have to traverse the matching relation M in order to compute corresponding measures such as con늓ence Therefore the entire complexity of the approaches e.g DA  PA is O  Md c   where M is the total number of matching tuples in M Note that pruning version PAP can be applied to replace the basic approach PA  namely DA  PAP

Advanced pruning bound using 002 max  The most costly part of the above DA algorithm is still the computation of 002 i  Y  by using PA or PAP  which traverses M frequently As mentioned in order to improve the pruning power of PAP we expect to nd a larger pruning bound V max  Let납 rst study the following properties in terms of the expected utility Theorem 3 Consider any two 002 1 002 2  having D 002 1  012 D 002 2   If their con늓ence and dependent quality satisfy C 002 2  002 2  003 1  D 002 1  D 002 2  007 1  C 002 1  002 1  010 then we have  U 002 1  012  U 002 2   Intuitively we can prune those 002 2 whose C 002 2  002 2  is no higher than 1  D 002 1  D 002 2  007 1  C 002 1  002 1  010  i.e the new pruning bound V max  To apply this pruning bound we require a precondition D 002 1  012 D 002 2   Therefore we can adopt an ordering of candidates in C X having D 002 i 1  012 D 002 i 2  for any i 1 i 2  The ordering can be done in linear time by amortizing the D 002  values into a constant domain In the following algorithms we assume that the candidates in C X have already been listed in descending order of D 002  values Let 002 max be the current result with the maximum expected utility by evaluating the rst i  1 candidates in C X Sincewe process C X in descending order of D 002  values for the next 002 i wehave D 002 max  012 D 002 i   According to Theorem 3 we can compute an advanced pruning bound V max 1  D 002 max  D 002 i  007 1  C 002 max  002 max  010 6 for the computation of 002 i  Y  by using PAP  in the current 002 i  Algorithm 4 extends Algorithm 3 by introducing the advanced pruning bound V max instead of simply assigning V max 0 in the original DA  We compute the advanced pruning bound in Line 4 by using formula 6 and use this V max for pruning in the determination on dependent attributes Y Line 5 Note that all candidates in C Y might be pruned in PAP by the advanced V max  i.e no 002 i  Y  returned Line 6 Then the current 002 i  X  can be discarded safely without computing the corresponding  U 002 i   Algorithm 4 for Determinant Attributes with Pruning DAP  M  1 U max 0 2 for each 002 i  X  005C X do 3 compute D 002 i  from M 4 V max 1  D 002 max  D 002 i  007 1  C 002 max  002 max  010 5 compute 002 i  Y  by PAP  M 002 i  X  V max  6 if 002 i  Y  exists then 7  U 002 i  E U 002 i   C 002 i   D 002 i   Q 002 i  8 if U max   U 002 i  then 9 002 max  002 i U max   U 002 i  10 return 002 max Recall that when the advanced pruning bound is not available i.e V max 0 initially in DA  PAP weuseamid-rst order to process candidates in C Y in order to nd a large V max as early as possible However we now already calculate an advanced pruning bound V max  0 in DAP  Heuristically in order to prune more candidates we would like to process those ones in C Y which can dominate more candidates according to the prune operator in PAP  For example we can use a top-rst order which rst processes candidates in the top since the top candidates e.g  9  9  in Figure 1 a always dominate the bottom ones Therefore in the DAP  PAP approach with advanced pruning bounds the top-rst processing order of candidates in C Y is preferred to achieve better time performance which is also veri는d by our experiment results in Table V If the calculated bound V max is less than 0 we can simply assign 0 to it Once the bound is V max  0  it can achieve a tighter pruning bound Therefore practically  the worst case of DAP is exactly the basic DA algorithm In fact as we can nd Theorem 2 is a special case of Theorem 3 when D 002 1  002 2  Inotherwords theoretically  the advanced pruning e.g DAP  PAP  developed based on Theorem 3 is a generalization of the basic pruning DA  PAP based on Theorem 2 Our experiments in Section VI also verify that DAP  PAP is at least no worse than DA  PAP  Algorithm Extensions When users require more than one answer for speci늒 applications the proposed algorithms can be easily extended to nd the distance threshold patterns with second or third or l th largest expected utilities Speci늒ally instead of the maximum C 002  002  weuse V max to denote the l th maximum C 002  002  in Algorithms 1 2 and so on Then the return results are a set of l patterns of distance thresholds with the largest expected utilities Since we relax V max from the 1st maximum to l th maximum the pruning power will be weaker with the increase of l  We report the time performance on different answer sizes l in the experiments VI E XPERIMENTAL E VA L UAT I O N We now report the experimental evaluation of the proposed methods All the

Figure 6 is not as signi늒ant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to ef늒iently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features닥y PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found 늢he values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
