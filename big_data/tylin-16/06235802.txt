en-US 2  Rules with low   and high    en-US The rules are called sporadic rules which represent rare cases that are scattered sporadically through the database but with high confidence of occurring together The rules can indicate a rare but fatal pattern, i.e. the symptoms of a rare but fatal disease In order to find the sporadic rules from our generated LBS anonymity datasets we constraint the support threshold values into an interval range, i.e         In this experiment we set it as 0.1 5  an d  s et  t h e confidence threshold values as 60 The mined rules are shown in en-US 0 en-US and their mapping display is shown as Fig.5.Similarly the rules can be divided into three categories both the antecedent and the consequent of the rules only include one spatial relationship i.e rules 1~6 only the antecedent of the rules include two spatial relationships i.e rules 7~8; only the consequent of the rules include two spatial relationships, i.e. rules 9 en-US  en-US a en-US  en-US b en-US Figure 4  Mapping display of mined spatial association rules en-US TABLE VIII   B ASIC I NFORMATION OF M INED S PATIAL A SSOCIATION R ULES  en-US No  en-US Content  en-US Support  en-US Confidence  en-US 1  en-US CROSSES_roadnetworks     CONTAINS_firstclassroad  en-US 68 1  en-US 99   en-US 2  en-US OVERLAPS_mainresidentialarea     CROSSES_roadnetworks  en-US 68 1  en-US 80  en-US 3  en-US OVERLAPS_mainresidentialarea      CROSSES_firstclassroad  en-US 68 1  en-US 80  en-US 4  en-US CROSSES_firstclassroad OVERLAPS_mainresidentialarea  en-US 68 1  en-US 99   en-US 5  en-US CROSSES_roadnetworks CROSSES_firstclassroad  en-US 68 6  en-US 1 00  en-US 6  en-US CROSSES_firstclassroad CROSSES_roadnetworks  en-US 68 6  en-US 1 00  en-US 7  en-US OVERLAPS_mainresidentialarea     CROSSES_roadnetworks     CROSSES_firstcla ssroad  en-US 68 1  en-US 1 00  en-US 8  en-US CROSSES_roadnetworks   CROSSES_firstclassroad   OVERLAPS_mainresidentialarea  en-US 68 1  en-US 99   en-US 9  en-US OVERLAPS_mainresidentialarea   CROSSES_firstclassroad CROSSES_roadnetworks  en-US 68 1  en-US 1 00  en-US 10  en-US OVERLAPS_mainresidentialarea  en-US CROSSES_roadnetworks  en-US CROSS ES_firstclassroad  en-US 68 1  en-US 80  en-US 11  en-US CROSSES_roadnetworks OVERLAPS_mainresidentialarea    CROSSES_firstclassroad  en-US 68 1  en-US 99   en-US 12  en-US CROSSES_firstclassroad  en-US OVERLAPS_mainresidentialarea    en-US CROSSES_roadnetworks  en-US 68 1  en-US 99   en-US  en-US Figure 5  Mapping display of mining sporadic spatial association rules en-US TABLE IX  B ASIC I NFORMATION OF M INING S PORADIC S PATIAL A SSOCIATION R ULES  en-US No  en-US Content  en-US Support  en-US Confidence  en-US 1  en-US CONTAINS_mainresidentialarea CONTAINS_vegetation  en-US 0. 19   en-US 100  en-US 2  en-US CONTAINS_vegetation CONTAINS_mainresidentialarea  en-US 0. 19   en-US 6 3  en-US 3  en-US CONTAINS_mainroad CONTAINS_firstclassroad  en-US 0. 5 3  en-US 100  en-US 4  en-US CONTAINS_mainroad CONTAINS_roadnetworks  en-US 0. 5 3  en-US 100  en-US 5  en-US CONTAINS_roadnetworks CONTAINS_firstclassroad  en-US 2 2  en-US 100  en-US 6  en-US CONTAINS_firstclassroad CONTAINS_roadnetworks  en-US 2 2  en-US 100  en-US 7  en-US CONTAINS_mainroad   CONTAINS_roadnetworks CONTAINS_firstclassroad  en-US 0. 5 3  en-US 100  en-US 8  en-US CONTAINS_mainroad   CONTAINS_firstclassroad CONTAINS_roadnetworks  en-US 0. 5 3  en-US 100  en-US 9  en-US CONTAINS_mainroad  en-US CONTAINS_firstclassroad   en-US  CONTAINS_roadnetworks  en-US 0. 5 3  en-US 100  en-US  


en-US It is well-known that   represents the minimum amount of evidence and   specifies how strong the implication of a rule must be to be considered valuable Both the rules mentioned above have high   then which can be interpreted as conditional expressions i.e the rule 7 in TABLE VIII which is expressed as follow en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US I t states that the LBS anonymity datasets that overlap main residential areas and cross road networks will have with confidence 99 a great percentage of crossing first-class roads. The rule 9 in TABLE IV which is expressed as follow en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US It  means that if the places where the LBS anonymous requests happen contain main roads it will have with confidence 100 a great percentage of containing first-class roads and containing road networks en-US Then based on the rules especially for the rules with low   it can make predictions that LBS queries requested in a certain spatial area will have a high probability to happen in a specific time range Through accurate prediction of LBS user movements  LBS providers can provide to LBS users with personalized service s in an efficient manner, thus leading to an improvement in resource utilization and a reduction in the latency in accessing the resources Another benefit of this prediction will be to help make decision of urban traffic flow guidance syst em  en-US IV  C ONCLUSIONS  en-US In this paper Firstly we raised the problem that SpatialTemporal K-Anonymity and its variants suffer from a common drawback that they severely decrease utilization of LBS anonymity datasets Secondly we proposed the algorithms of mining spatial association rule from LBS anonymity dataset Finally we performed the experiments that adopting the proposed algorithm to mine a series of spatial association rules and analyzed the experimental results with a visual form to help the analyst interpret them en-US However we also found that the experimental results can  rules attackers can infer temporal information of the specific users such as entering into or departing from a privacy sensitive region \(i.e. prohibited military zone, red light district etc\.

obtained compared to other setting i.e 6.59 for conìdence and 6.50 for conviction when the left boundary is 50 and the weight is 1 0.5 0 Then we vary the right boundary between 300 and 450 with a step of 50 when the left boundary is xed to 50 which is the best left boundary beforehand The results indicate that ranking performance is good when the right boundary is less than 400 That is the best performances the lowest average ROM are 6.57 for conìdence and 6.48 for conviction when the right boundary is 400 and the weight is 1 0.5 0 As conclusions the result of manual boundary setting implies that the left boundary should be set to 50 while the right boundary should be placed around 400 Furthermore the boundaries assigned by the manual setting are close to ones obtained from the automatic setting This result implies that our automatic boundary setting region-based weighting approach can provide suitable regions for setting different weights in ranking mechanism This paper proposed a region-based ranking method to improve discovering news relations The proposed method achieved the best performance by setting the weighting of the rst the second and the third region to 1 0.5 and 0 respectively with the average ROM of 6.57 and 6.46 for conìdence and conviction consecutively By comparing to the non-region method when the weights are set to 0 0.5 and 1 the experimental results showed that for the whole range the proposed method improves the performance with the average ROM improvement of 11.87 1.21 and 28.32 for conìdence and 11.91 4.83 and 29.04 for conviction respectively As future works to provide more practical similarity the possibility of applying latent semantic indexing or some disambiguation methods will be examined It is possible to apply a machine-learning approach to nd the optimal parameter setting in ranking mechanism This work was granted by Strategic Scholarships Fellowships Frontier Research Networks 2006 from the Commission on Higher Education and NECTEC under project number NTB-22-KE-38-54-01

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental
