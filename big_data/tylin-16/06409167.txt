Frequent item set originates from association rule mining that uses to find association rules of items in large transactional database. Many existing algorithm to mine for the frequent itemset from static transaction database that is definite known and precise. In this paper we conducted a study on uncertain 
data and fuzzy association rule mining approach. The main contribution of this paper is three manifolds. First we presented a review on existing method for finding frequent patterns form uncertain data. Second a new approach is proposed for finding frequent patterns from uncertain data, and third, the experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of proposed approach for uncertain data. In this approach we have used fuzzy concept and originate the frequent patterns. The experimental results from the survey demonstrate that this proposed approach for valuable frequent pattern set the influential uncertain data mining  Keywords: - Uncertain Data, fuzzy set, fuzzy logic, Association Rule 
Mining, precise data I  I NTRODUCATION  Data mining is the analysis of large datasets to find unsuspected relationship and to summarise the data in novel ways that are both understandable and useful to the data holder 1,2,11,12 Pop ul ar l y re ferr ed t o  a s kno w l e d ge di sco v e r y 12  in da ta bas e K DD  l i e s  at  th e in te rf ac e of d a ta b a se  technology machine learning, high performance computing statistics etc.[8  T h e r e a r e m a n y res e a r ch  to pi cs in d a ta m i n i ng  one of the most important topics is association rule mining Mining frequent patterns is a sub process of association rule mining. Frequent item set mining is a common data mining task for many real life applications association rule mining 
helps to generate the previously unknown , potentially useful set of the item that are frequently co-occurring. It support to motivated by decision support problems faced by many mining algorithms have focused for discovering association rules [4, 8 10, 13, 18, 22   In 1994 Agrawal and Srikant  pro po s e d A p r i o r i  algorithms to generate frequent itemset in a database. Since then almost studies in the field have focused and improved efficiency of mining process. Other algorithm like as FP growth algorithm by Han at.el.[1  D e p t h-fi r s t  b a c k t r a c k i ng Pincer algorithm, graph based algorithm [2 e t c    These algorithms mine traditional statics database \(like web

A transaction \(Boolean data mining\, or each attribute of a transaction is associated with a quantitative values, however there are \(e.g. environmental survey, medical diagnosis, stock market\ in that users are uncertain about the presence or absence of some item or event [2, 12, 15 t h at ne ed to b e  modified in order to handle uncertain data. The Figure.1 shows classification of data mining algorithms based on nature of data                 Figure 1 A Tree Structure of data mining methods can be classified on the data 
  Uncertain Data The concept of a possibility measure was introduced by Zadeh [30   A possibility measure on a universe is a function from \(0, 1\, the basic difference between precise and uncertain data are that each transaction of the later contains items and their existential probabilities [5, 10, 13, 15  Th e uncertainty of such suspicion can be expressed in terms of existential probability [13, 16  In u n c e r ta in  da ta  ea ch i t em in a  transaction is associated with probability that indicate the possibility that the item exists in the transaction. Normally we can say it is over predication to come the item in the transition This kind of data item set is called uncertain dataset. Figure.2

        Figure 2 Difference between Precise and Uncertain Data  An uncertain dataset T consists of n transactions T 1 T 2 T 3  T n A transaction T n contains a number of items. Each item I m  in T n is associated with a non-zero probability P Tn I m hich indicates the likelihood that item I m is present in transaction Tn For example a shop has \(i\ bread sold. \(ii\ butter iii\4% milk and \(iv\ 81% egg. That denote as I 1 I 2 I 3 I 4 is respectively. It is represented as in Table 1  I 1 I 2 I 3 I 4  T 1  0.76 0.25 0.64 0.81 T 2  0.24 0.15 0.68 0.48 T 3  0.12 0.34 0.48 0.45 Table 1 Uncertain Data  Each item indicates the chances that those item exist, rather than the item has definitely or doesnít have them To find the frequent patterns from uncertain data is not as simple as such are precise data[5,6,7,1 S o n o r m al  approaches those are work for precise data isnít feasible for uncertain data. These are just example of real life situation in which data are uncertain, hence efficient algorithm for mining uncertain data as in demand [4,8   It is generally recognized that, the various real world relationships are basically fuzzy. Therefore, the concept of fuzzy sets can help for data mining and discover novel and meaningful patterns from data. Fuzzy logic is a logical system which is an extension of multivalued logic. It is almost synonymous with the theory of fuzzy set, a theory this relates to classes of objects with unsharp boundaries in which membership is a matter of degree Fuzzy association rules [1, 8, 13, 15, 25 ar e ex ten s i on of  association rules based on fuzzy sets. Fuzzy association rules extraction is performed as the following steps. Let F = {A, B C} denotes the fuzzy itemset that consists of fuzzy sets in different attribute, where A, B, and C denote the fuzzy sets Support of the itemset F is defined as s \(F F Z i n Where Z i denotes the transaction of the database F Z i  denotes the membership value calculated by the product operation \(t-norm\of each item\(Fuzzy Set\in F, and n denotes the total number of transactions in the database. It is obvious that the definition is equivalent to the wel1-known "Boolean mining problem" when the item sets consist of "crisp sets using the support value, confidence of the fuzzy association rule A->B is calculated by A B\= s \(A U B\/s \(A Where A and B are fuzzy item sets. The fuzzy association rule is extracted when these values of the rule are more than predefined minimal support and pre-defined minimal confidence. One of the main problems of mining fuzzy association rules is how efficiently find the "frequent itemsets from the database This research study used fuzzy based rule mining approach on uncertain data to find the fuzzy association rule that reduces the database scans and improve the efficiency and accuracy II  L ITERATURE R EVIEW  There are several different approaches for frequent pattern mining of uncertain data[5,7,10,18,21 R e ce nt l y  t h e co nce p t of fuzzy sets has been generally used in association rules mining. This technique has been used in various applications such as finding fuzzy association rules from quantitative transactions, work with biological data, genetic algorithms etc Unfortunately, many researches have been done in certain data mining. Such as Hong et al. [13,14 a s p r opo sed i n  2 003 t o  finding fuzzy association rules from quantitative transactions by Hu et al.

Although this work is interesting, the significant power of this model is limited because it cannot handle other types of uncertain data Some researchers have extended association rules mining techniques to imprecise or uncertain data. somebody have proposed different approaches and design framework In 2006 Wang Kay Ngai et. al has proposed, ìEfficient Clustering of Uncertain Dataî[26 in th is p a p e r th ey stu d i e d  t h e problem of uncertain object with the uncertainty regions defined by pdfs.

It also proposes a probabilistic frequent closed itemset mining PFCIM\ algorithm to mine probabilistic frequent closed itemsets from uncertain databases As pointed out in the literature review of previous research as applied fuzzy sets to discover fuzzy association rules from certain data rather than uncertain data. Since the possibility theory is appropriate for human to express their opinions judgments and decisions with uncertainty [7  in  th is a p p r o ach  to combine these both theories and then discover fuzzy association rule from uncertain data.

To demonstrate the performance of proposed approach, we have used large number transaction set of uncertain data, and compared its performance with other existing approaches. Clearly our approach shows the effectiveness with minimum count ratio as compare with to Uapriori, UF-Tree & UF-growth algorithm, as it captures the whole data set in only one scan. Figure.3 shows the experimented count ratio performance of our approach with these Algorithms. The experiments were performed on an Intel core 2 Duo, 2.94 GHz system running Windows 7 professional with 2 GB of RAM   Figure 3 Count Ration Performance Compairsion  V  C ONCLUSION  Most of the research finds the patterns from transactional data that containing precise data, so there are many real life conditions, when we deal with uncertain data. In This paper we have used concept of fuzzy approach, in uncertain dataset and used multiple minimum supports to find fuzzy association rules in a given uncertain data set. This works well with problem of uncertain data relationships, which are represented by fuzzy set concepts. The proposed approach can thus generate large frequent itemsets and then derive fuzzy association rules from uncertain dataset. The advantage of fuzzy association rule mining is that; the algorithm performs scanning our dataset only one time. By this also we have to do less effort for the calculation of various relations. This approach scale well when handling large amount of dense data. As ongoing work, we are investigating ways to further reduce the data structure problems, and generated frequent patterns will be useful for clustering 2012 World Congress on Information and Communication Technologies 713

We present an evaluation of the time gains that can be obtained for wide-area transfers in the context of a scientiìc application from bio-informatics A-Brain which joins genetic and neuro-imaging data analysis Due to the large resource requirements that could not be obtained from the cloud provider within a single datacenter the application runs a MapReducebased processing across 3 datacenters the nal global result is computed using a Meta-Reducer that aggre gates results from all the datacenters We compare the transfer times of 1000 les representing partial data sent from each datacenter towards the Meta-Reducer using AzureBlobs as a transfer backend and our solution GEO-DMS The results are shown in Figure 10 for multiple le sizes resulted from different input data sets and conìgurations For small datasets 108 MB from 3x1000x36KB les the overhead introduced by our solution due to the extra acknowledgements makes the transfer inefìcient However as the data size grows 120 GB the total transfer time is reduced by a factor of 3 VII C ONCLUSION This paper introduces a cloud-based data management system for Big-Data science applications running in large

Fig 8 Transfer time when the data size is varied for our approach GEODMS and other existing options Fig 9 The throughput between NEU and NUS datacenters for different multi-datacenter path transfer strategies The throughput is evaluated a in time while the overall number of nodes across datacenters is xed to 25  b based on multiple nodes while the time frame is kept xed to 10 minutes So far the evaluation focused on sending data between the nodes in the source datacenter and the destination datacenter We now consider the scenario in which the nodes from additional datacenters can be used as intermediate hops to transfer the data For this experiment we considered an application deployed across all the 6 US and EU sites Figure 9 presents the evaluation of the proposed approach described in Algorithm 1 for multi-datacenter path transfer compared with 3 other transfer strategies The rst one considers direct transfers between the nodes of the source datacenter and the destination i.e DirectLink As the direct link between source and destination might not be in fact the shortest the other strategies consider the shortest path i.e Dijkstraês algorithm The selection of the shortest path can be done once at the beginning of the transfer i.e ShortestPath static or each time the monitoring systems provides a fresh view of the environment i.e ShortestPath dynamic The static strategy shows the throughput obtained when the monitoring system is not used For all strategies the same number of nodes was used to perform the transfer In Figure 9 a we present the cumulated throughput achieved when 25 nodes are used to perform data transfers between the NEU and NUS datacenters We notice that the performance of the shortest paths strategy and the one that we propose Fig 10 Execution times of the A-Brain application across 3 datacenters using AzureBlobs and GEO-DMS as a transfer backend The bar indicate the total time of transferring the les towards the Meta-Reducer located in NUS are sometimes similar This happens because our algorithm extends the shortest path algorithm with mechanisms for selecting alternatives paths when the gain brought by a node along the initial path becomes too small due to congestions The performance gain increases with time reaching 20 for the 10 minute window considered Alternatively selecting the route only once and not being environment aware decreases the performance in time becoming inefìcient for large transfers In Figure 9 b we analyze the throughput variation when using an increasing number of nodes We observe that for a small number of nodes the differences between the strategies are very small However as more nodes are used for the transfer distributed across different geographical sites our algorithm is capable to better orchestrate their placement and achieve higher throughput

federated and highly dynamic environments Our solution is able to effectively use the high-speed networks connecting the cloud datacenters through optimized protocol tuning and bottleneck avoidance while remaining non-intrusive and easy to deploy At its core it uses a sampling-based model for cost-performance in a cloud setting to enable efìcient transfer operations across a group of geographically distributed datacenters As an example by distributing data locally it enables high wide-area data throughput when the network core is underutilized at minimal cost Our experiments show that the system achieves high performance in a variety of settings it substantially improves throughput and reduces the execution time for real applications by up to 3 times compared to stateof-the-art solutions Encouraged by these results we have started to explore other data-management research issues from a cloud providers perspective Apart from the practical applications shown in this paper our approach can be used to study the performance of inter-datacenter or inter-cloud transfers This is especially useful for cloud users to provide them with an enhanced visibility into the actually-supported service levels We believe that cloud providers could leverage this tool as a metric to describe the performance of resources with particular conìgurations As a further evolution they could provide Introspection-as-aService to reveal information about the cost of internal cloud operations to relevant applications A CKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported by the joint INRIA Microsoft Research Center The experiments presented in this paper were carried out using the Azure Cloud infrastructure provided by Microsoft in the framework of the ZCloudFlow project The authors would like to thank the Azure support teams from ATL Europe for their valuable input and feedback R EFERENCES  W  Allcock GridFTP Protocol Extensions to FTP for the Grid
