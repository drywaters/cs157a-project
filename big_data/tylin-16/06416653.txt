B Cut-like representation The second representation is inspired by the notion of an a cut of a fuzzy set Recall that for a fuzzy set A 2 L U and a degree a 2 L  the a cut a A of A is the ordinary subset of U de\002ned by a A  f u 2 U j a 024 A  u  g  It is well known that each fuzzy set is uniquely represented by the system of its a cuts Depending on the properties of the scale of truth degrees one may introduce an appropriate notion of a nested system of subsets of U in such a way that nested systems become just the system of a cuts of fuzzy sets see e.g One may easily verify that straightforward conditions such as  a A 1  a A 2  3  a  A 1  A 2  3  do not hold for tradic fuzzy Galois connections Nevertheless a cut-like representation of triadic fuzzy Galois connections is possible as shown in the rest of this section The representation is based on the following notion De\002nition 4 Let f i j k g  f 1  2  3 g  A system fh 1 a   2 a   3 a  i j a 2 L g of ordinary triadic Galois connections is called L nested iff 1 for each a b 2 L such that a 024 b  and A i 2 L X i  A j 2 L X j it holds  A i  A j   k a  023  A i  A j   k b  2 for all x i 2 X i  x j 2 X j  x k 2 X k the set f a 2 L j x i 2  f x j g  f x k g   i a  g has a greatest element We need the following lemmas Lemma 4 For f i j k g  f 1  2  3 g  let I 2 L X 1 002 X 2 002 X 3 be an L relation h 1  2  3 i be the triadic L Galois connection induced by I and for a 2 L let h 1 a   2 a   3 a  i be the triadic Galois connections induced by the cuts a I  Then a for every A i 2 2 X i  A j 2 2 X j  and a 2 L we have a  A i  A j   k    A i  A j   k a   b for all fuzzy sets A i 2 L X i  A j 2 L X j  and b c 2 L we have a  A i  A j   k    b;c 2 L  b A i  c A j   k a n b n c   Lemma 5 Let h 1 1  2 1  3 1 i and h 1 2  2 2  3 2 i be triadic L Galois connections let I 1 and I 2 be the corresponding L relations between X 1  X 2  and X 3  Then for f i j k g  f 1  2  3 g it holds that I 1 022 I 2 iff for each A i 2 L X i  A j 2 L X j it holds  A i  A j   k  1 022  A i  A j   k  2  Using the above lemmas one may proove the following theorem which provides the cut-like representation of triadic fuzzy Galois connections Theorem 4 For a triadic L Galois connection h 1  2  3 i between X 1  X 2  and X 3 denote C h 1  2  3 i  fh 1 a   2 a   3 a  i j a 2 L g  For an L nested system fh 1 a   2 a   3 a  i j a 2 L g of triadic Galois connections between X 1  X 2  and X 3 denote by h 1 C  2 C  3 C i the mappings de\002ned for f i j k g  f 1  2  3 g  and A i 2 L X i  A j 2 L X j by  A i  A j   k  C  x k   _ f a

2  3 i  2 C h 1  2  3 i  3 C h 1  2  3 i i  and C  C h 1 C  2 C  3 C i  i.e the mappings between the sets of all triadic L Galois connections and all nested systems of triadic Galois connections are mutually inverse bijections C Application of the Cartesian representation In this section we present as an application of the previous results a theorem saying that every fuzzy concept trilattice is isomorphic to some ordinary concept trilattice via a natural isomorphism A particular consequence of this result is the claim that a fuzzy concept trilattice is indeed a trilattice see below for the notion of a trilattice Let us recall the following notions Let V be a non-empty set and for i 2 f 1  2  3 g let  i be quasiorder relations on V  h V  1   2   3 i is called a triordered set if and only if the following two conditions hold for every f i j k g  f 1  2  3 g  1 v  i w and v  j w implies w  k v for every v w 2 V  2 030 i  030 j  030 k is an identity relation on V  For triordered sets h V  V 1   V 2   V 3 i and h W  W 1   W 2   W 3 i  a mapping h  V  W is called an isomorphism if it is bijective and satis\002es v 1  V i v 2 iff h  v  1  W i h  v 2  for every v 1  v 2 2 V and every i 2 f 1  2  3 g  Let V i  V k 022 V  An element v 2 V is called an ik bound of h V i  V k i if v i  i v and v k  k v for every v i 2 V i and v k 2 V k  An ik bound v is called an ik limit of h V i  V k i if u  j v for every ik bound u of h V i  V k i  In every triordered set  V  1   2   3  there is at most one ik limit v of h V i  V k i satisfying v  k u for every ik limit u of h V i  V k i  If such v exists we call v an ik join of h V i  V k i and denote it by r ik  V i  V k   A triordered set  V  1   2   3  in which the ik join exists for all i 6  k  i k 2 f 1  2  3 g  and all pairs h V i  V k i of subsets of V is called a complete trilattice  It is easy to see that the set of all triadic concepts of a triadic L K Galois connection forms a triordered set w.r.t inclusions 022 of fuzzy sets as the quasiorders We utilize the facts that the set of all triadic concepts of an ordinary triadic Galois connection h 1  2  3 i forms a trilattice denoted here by T  X 1  X 2  X 3  h 1  2  3 i   Lemma 6 For a triadic L K Galois connection h 1  2  3 i the triordered sets T  X 1  X 2  X 3  h 1  2  3 i  and T  X 1 002 L X 2 002 L X 3 002 L h h 1 i 1  h 2 i 2  h 3 i 3 i  are isomorphic Moreover T  X 1

The only excep tions here are the scenario S2 for the datasets Retail and Adults. In the dataset Retail, HA yielded the best results of misses cost with up to 2 sensitive rules being sanitized. As the number of sensitive rules increased, the HA yielded the best values of misses cost. The same behavior can be observed in the dataset Adults.

As can be seen, the same trends were observed, except in scenario S4 for the dataset Retail in which the algorithm RRA y ielded better results than those in the RA. However, the results for misses cost in the RRA are slightly better Table 3 Summary of the best algorithms for misses cost under condition C3 Dataset  0%, 6 varying the values of                S1 S2 S3 S4                 Kosarak HA HA HA HA                  Retail HA HA RA RRA                  Adults HA HA HA HA                  Webdocs HA HA HA HA                                 Under condition C2, when the number of rules to be sanitized was increased, the algorithms RA, RRA yielded the best results for the differential between the original and the sanitized datasets, that is, dif\(D,D   Based on the results for dif\(D,D atural question arises: how can RA, and RRA get the best results for dif\(D,D ot for misses cost? The main reason is that the victim items in these three algorithms are dynamic, that is, a new victim item is selected for each sensitive transaction to be sanitized. This approach reduces support of every item in a sensitive rule \(one item is selected for each sensitive transaction\ regardless of whether an item has high or low support. Reducing items with high support would prune the candidate generation of discovered rules in the sanitized dataset compromising the values of misses cost. On the contrary the victim item selected by the HA, for a sensitive rule, is fixed for all sensitive transactions. Moreover, the HA always selects the item with lower support for each rule which greatly improves the values of misses cost Regarding the third performance measure, artifactual patterns, and one may claim that when decrease the frequencies of some items, the relative frequencies in the database may be modified by the sanitization process and new rules may emerge. However, in these experiments, the problem artifactual pattern AP was always 0% with all algorithms regardless of the values of Sanitization, indeed, does not remove any transaction On the other hand, some of the sanitizing algorithms introduced in [23 presen t the case i n  w h ich artif ac tu a l  patterns appear \(i.e., AP > 0 since the sensitive rules are hidden by reducing their confidence below a privacy threshold. To do so, some ite ms are added to transactions that participate in the generation of the antecedent part X but not the consequent part Y of a rule, where the rule is the fo rm X Y. Adding items to some transactions results in the generation of new association rules that are not supposed to exist in the original database  CPU Time for the Sanitization Process The scalability of the sanitization algorithms was tested with the size of the database as well as the number of rules to hide. To do so, the Kosarak dataset was selected since it is the sophisticated one used in the experiments We varied the size of the original database D from 150K transactions to 900K transactions, while fixing the disclosure threshold 0% and keeping the set of sensitive rules constant \(6 original sensitive rules that are mutually exclusive\ig. 4 shows that the algorithms scale well with the database size. The algorithms IGA RRA, RA and HA yielded lower CPU time. The algorithms IGA, RRA, RA and HA require only two scans   Fig.4 \(a\esults of CPU time for the sanitization process   Fig. 4 \(b\Results of CPU time for the sanitization process  


Hybrid Framework for Privacy Preserving Data Sharing  205  12th & 13th December 2013  2013 International Conference on Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions \(ICTer As can be observed, the algorithms IGA, RRA, RA and HA increase CPU linearly, even though their complexity in main memory is not linear. If we increase the number of sensitive rules or even if we select a group of sensitive rules with very high support, these algorithms may not scale linearly. However, there is no compelling need for sanitization to be a fast operation since it can be done offline The I/O time \(scans over the dataset\lso considered in these figures. This demonstrates good scalability with the cardinality of the transactional database The number of sensitive rules to hide were also varied from approximately 20 to 100 selected randomly while fixing the size of the dataset Kosarak and fixing the support and disclosure thresholds to 0%. Fig. 6.4 \(b shows that the algorithms scale well with the number of rules to hide The values are plotted in logarithmic scale. Although HA requires 2 scans, it was fastest. The main reason is that the HA performs a number of operations in main memory to fully sanitize a database. The HA requires one scan to build an inverted index where the vocabulary contains the sensitive rules and the occurrences contain the transaction IDs. In the second scan, HA sanitizes only the transactions marked in the occurrences. Note that when the number of sens itive rules increases, the intersection of items among the rules tends to increase as well The scalability of the sanitizing algorithms is mainly due to the inverted files use in the approaches for indexing the sensitive transaction IDs per sensitive rule There is no need to scan the database again whenever want to access a transac tion for sanitization purposes The inverted file gives direct access with pointers to the relevant transactions C ONCLUSION   In the context of HMPPDT, It was noticed that sanitization is a challenging ta sk. It can render a released database almost useless when not done properly. To alleviate the difficulties of sanitizing a database, different conditions were investigated under which a data owner can tune the parameters of the sanitizing algorithms to get the most of the sanitization process Data sharing based and pattern sharing based algorithms were evaluated by performing a broad set of experiments against real datasets. This evaluation was carried out to suggest guidance on which algorithms perform best under different conditions. In particular, It was observed that the algorithm HA \(Hybrid Algorithm presented an outstanding performance in our experiments. In almost all the cases, HA yielded the best results in terms of misses cost and hiding failure. Another interesting point observed from the experiments was the fact that the best results of misses cost and hiding failure were obtained as we increased the size of the datasets The inability to generalize the results for classes of categories of data mining algorithms may be a tentative threat for disclosing information. Developing hybrid methodologies and techniques for data mining provide new opportunities to achieve the task early and leads the researches in to new profiles R EFERENCES   1  L i nde l l an d B.

Figure 6 is not as signi“cant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to ef“ciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
