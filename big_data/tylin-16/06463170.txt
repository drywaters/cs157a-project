the description of the concept of hierarchy layer and to describe the relationship between the concepts of generalization and its advantages are 1 a higher level object association patterns mnung resulting in a generally clear revealing a more general concept 2 the number of rules extracted at a high level much is less than the low-level data mining will produce fewer rules and easier to

multi-level association rule mining But at the same time the 290 introduction of the parent class in frequent itemset calculation make the need to calculate the project have increased the performance of the algorithm will have an impact so future research should focus on considering the optimization algorithm design V CONCLUSION The association rule mining is an active research area of data mining

we can obtain the optimization model for CS  Also by taking I  I CS O  we can obtain the optimization model for CS-O  In other words the optimization model for CS and CS-O are similar except the denition of the set of ISets which is different  P CS is a non-convex problem The non-convexity of the problem is related to the following  Power splitting model the SINR of a link is a nonlinear function of K  The general lack of convexity of the rate functions on non-linear SINR functions makes the feasible region non-convex  Non-convexity of constraint 11 However by xing K in  P CS  we can dene P CS  K  as a parametrized problem which is a convex optimization problem and thus can be solved efciently to obtain a global maximum for small to medium sized problems The solution to the original problem can then be derived as P CS  K   where K   arg max K 2f 0  1   M g P CS  K  16 C Optimization models for FS Unlike the Channel Splitting based resource allocation Full Sharing does not require any conguration of a resource allocation parameter All M subchannels are allocated to all the BSs Moreover the capacity constraints for the wireless links need to be redened The capacity constraint is obtained by replacing M  K by M for the MBS-UE links and K by M for the PBS-UE links as shown in 19 We formulate the optimization problem for FS with the set of ISets I  as follows  P FS  max   s    x f l     f  X f 2F log  f  17 Subject to X l 2L  o  l  n x f l  X l 2L  d  l  n x f l  8    f n  f s    f  n  f d  0  o.w  8 n 2N  8 f 2F 18 X f 2F x f l   bM P s 2I R l  s 1 f l 2 s g  8 l 2 L 0  L C o  l   8 l 2 L 19 X s 2I  s  1 20 Eqs 2  3  4  21 x f l   s   f  0  8 f 2 F  8 l 2 L  8 s 2 I 22 where I  I F S results in the optimization model for FS and I  I F S O results in the optimization model for FS-O  In other words the optimization model for FS and FS-O are similar except for the denition of the set of ISets which is different    Fig 1 4 Pico BSs are placed in a grid layout on a macro coverage of a 500 m  500 m square V T IGHTNESS OF THE UPPER BOUNDS BASED ON MULTIPATH ROUTING So far our models consider multipath routing and thus a UE can associate to more than one BS However in cellular networks conventionally a UE associates to only one BS In the earlier section we called such an association as single-association and mentioned that the optimization problem under single-association restriction results in an integer non-linear program which has a much larger complexity than its multi-association counterpart Clearly the optimization models based on multipath routing provide upper bounds to systems with single-association constraints In order to show that the upper-bounds based on multipath routing are tight we present a simple user association rule called the picocell rst PCF rule with a parameter   This PCF   rule was rst introduced in 3  U n d e r t h e P C F    rule a user associates to the PBS that provides the best SINR as long as it is greater than or equal to   even if the MBS is offering strictly greater SINR This simple user association rule can be translated into the routing variables  x f l  For example if user i associates to BS j  the corresponding ow routing variable x f l where ow f corresponds to user i and thus f d  i  will be 0 for all wireless links l that do not belong to BS j i.e o  l  6  j  We can compute the optimal settings of the other parameters under a given user association by solving the four problems given above with xed  x f l   This will provide a feasible solution to the optimal single-association problem By numerically showing that these feasible solutions are performing close to the upper-bounds provided by the multipath routing we will show that our ow models provide good upper-bounds VI N UMERICAL R ESULTS We take a square deployment area of length 500 m with a centrally placed MBS X  4 PBS are deployed on a 2  2 grid as shown in Figure 1 We consider N  75 users  deployed uniform randomly in the area We use the path-loss model recommended by 3GPP 2  The path loss P L j;i for the transmitter-receiver pair  j i  separated by a distance d ji m is given as P L 0 i  20  A:G  128  1  37  6 log 10  d 0 i 1000   dB   d 0 i  35 m for MBS links and P L j;i  20  A:G p  140  7+36  7 log 10  d ji 1000   dB   d  10 m for PBS links i.e j 2 P  A:G represents the antenna gain of

method extends previous work by considering combined cause factors and the identi“ed combined causal rules can be potentially useful in a wide range of areas To cope with the computational complexity of partial association tests we have proposed to use QuickSort in the algorithm which has signi“cantly improved the ef“ciency When applying our approach to a set of real-world diagnostic data the algorithm is able to ef“ciently produce both single and combined causal rules In the future we plan to evaluate the performance of this algorithm with a wider range of large scale data sets In addition we will conduct further comparisons of our approach with other causality discovery methods The algorithm proposed aims at discovering causality from observed binary data with known target so we intend to extend the algorithm to make it adapt for various data types and discover causal relationship effectively from more complex cases R EFERENCES  J Pearl and T  S V erma  A theory of inferred causation

The system scales very well with dataset size because the SPARQL graph patterns are mostly evaluated with index-based nested loop joins, which tend to have execution times proportional to result size. Q5 shows the worst scalability because the execution cost is dominated by the regular expression filter on the unselective triple pattern, and the number of intermediate results that must be scanned for the regular expression filter grows significantly as the dataset size increases B  Computing SEM_CONTAINS_COUNT This experiment studied the overhead of computing sem_contains_count by executing two variations of the five sem_contains queries \(Table V\ against the LA130 dataset: \(1 sem_contains only and \(2 sem_contains  sem_contains_count The results of the experiment are shown in Figure 4. As expected, computing sem_contains_count adds some overhead. This overhead is proportional to the result s et size because the count has to be computed once for each document in the result set The overhead required to compute the count value is reasonable. For example, the overhead ranged from 0.001 sec Q2\ to 0.081 sec \(Q3\. The larger overhead observed for queries Q1 and Q3 can be attributed to the larger result size The overhead of computing sem_contains_count is relatively small for Q2, Q4, and Q5, which can be attributed to the fact that the result set size is small for these queries 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Query Number Execution Time \(sec sem_contains sem_contains + sem_contains_count  Fig. 4 Overhead for sem_contains_count on LA130 dataset C  Ordering Results by SEM_CONTAINS_COUNT This experiment tested the scalability of computing and sorting results by sem_contains_count as the query result set size increases.

0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 12345678 Partitions Accessed Execution Time \(sec Partitioned Non-Partitioned  Fig. 6 Benefit of partition pruning on LA130 dataset The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 6. As expected, partition pruning shows a significant speedup in query execution time when only a few partitions are accessed The speedup ranged from 2.8 times faster when one partition is accessed to 1.2 times faster when three partitions are accessed. Not surprisingly, the benefit of partition pruning is reduced as more partitions are qu eried.  This can be attributed to two opposing factors in play In our implementation, each semantic index partition results in a single RDF model, so the non-partitioned index yields one large RDF model, and the partitioned index yields eight small RDF models. The single B  tree index structure, in case of non-partitioned table, is organized independently of the partitioning key pubdate and hence does not benefit from locality of reference when the query is selective requiring access to one or a few partitions. However, for the partitioned index case, the local indexes have triples grouped by pubdate which tends to perform better for selective queries. These benefits start to diminish as the number of partitions to be accessed by the query goes up and eventually the non-partitioned index starts to perform better. When all eight partitions are accessed, the query using the \(local partitioned index runs 1.4 times slower VI  C ONCLUSIONS  The paper presented the semantic indexing feature of Oracle Database, which allows indexing unstructured text columns to generate RDF content that can subsequently be searched with a SPARQL query pattern. It described a model of a semantic index that can be incrementally composed by a combination of base extractor policies, knowledge bases, and entailments. A model for querying semantic index was discussed that allows both searching for matching documents and/or matching triples. An experimental study involving TREC documents demonstrated the feasibility of our approach The proposed semantic indexing framework is intended to create a synergy between the database, semantic web, and information extraction communities. Specifically, the integration and inference benefits of semantic technologies become available for use against unstructured data in the databases. The semantic web community benefits as large volumes of RDF data, hitherto residing as unstructured text can now drive the development of semantic applications Information extraction community benefits as their technologies are put to immediate use by the database and semantic web communities Although extracted data, stored in standard RDF format, is amenable to querying, it tends to be verbose. Further work is needed, in conjunction with the information extraction community, to come up with levels of summarization that will also result in compact and efficient SPARQL query formulation. A more complete realization of the semantic indexing framework would involve work in several areas including optimized processing of blocking queries involving ancillary operators, devising s ophisticated ranking measures for capturing document r elevance, and incremental maintenance of entailments at the document \(named graph level A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Zhe Wu and Vlad Kolovski for providing support for named graph inferencing R EFERENCES  1  S G.
