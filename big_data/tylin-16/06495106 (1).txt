The huge number of association rules represent the main hamper that a decision maker faces In order to bypass this hamper an ef\036cient selection of rules has to be performed Since selection is necessarily based on evaluation many interestingness measures have been proposed However the abundance of these measures gave rise to a new problem namely the heterogeneity of the evaluation results and this 
created confusion to the decision In this respect we propose a novel approach to discover interesting association rules without favoring or excluding any measure by adopting the notion of dominance between association rules Our approach bypasses the problem of measure heterogeneity and unveils a compromise between their evaluations Interestingly enough the proposed approach also avoids another non-trivial problem which is the threshold value speci\036cation

being a rational choice Several works have been devoted to the study of the interestingness of association rules 5  6 7  As a c ons equence a p anopl y o f s t a t i s t i cal meas ures  obeying different semantics have been proposed Although these measures allow evaluating rules from various sights yet their abundance

 has yielded another problem for the decision maker Indeed the outputs of evaluations vary from a measure to another one and may even be contradictory since the measures evaluate differently the rules That is why it is common that a given rule be considered relevant according to a measure and irrelevant with respect to another one The problem caused by the abundance of measures has led to a trend of works that focuss on proposing approaches 
to assist the user in selecting the measures quali\036ed to be the most adequate to the decision scope These approaches can be classi\036ed into two main categories namely the expertbased approaches and the property-based ones In the 036rst category different studies have compared the ranking of rules by human experts to that yield by various measures Then they suggested choosing the measure that yields the closest one to the expert ranking 8 9  Thes e s t udi es were bas e d on speci\036c datasets and experts Thus their results cannot be taken as general conclusions Moreover in a real problem it is not always possible to easily get expertís ranking As for the second category to reduce the number of measures many properties have been reported in 10 Gen g an d Ham ilto n 
surveyed the interestingness of measures and summarized nine properties to address that issue Using properties facilitates a general and practical way to automatically identify interesting measures This trend has been enriched by different other works 11 12    13  14  wi t h an addi t i onal number o f properties Nevertheless these properties are not standards 13  H ence t h e y do not guarant ee s e l ect i n g onl y one bes t measure Indeed a wide range of UCI 1 datasets were also used to study the impact of different properties The results show no single measure can be elected as an obvious winner 12 Then in the case of selecting many measures the problem related to the variety of outputs mentioned above persists In other words the user cannot proceed towards a unique selection 
of rules Whatever one measure is selected or more nothing guarantees that they are the best ones and some better suited measures may be excluded for the simple reason that the used properties do not take into account the speci\036city of decision context Our contribution lies within this scope In this paper we introduce a novel approach that aims at discovering interesting association rules without favoring or excluding any mesure among the used measures For this purpose we integrate into the rule selection process the

Rule Dominance Given two rules   the dominance relationship according to the set of measures is de\036ned as follows dominates  denoted iff      If and      then and are said  denoted  If and such that     t h e n is by and we note  It is easy to check that the strict dominance relationship ful\036ls the following properties   is false for each    and if and then  Given the relation table in Table I\(b the rule strictly dominates since         n d     Whenever a rule dominates another one with respect to thismeansthat is equivalent to or better than for all measures Hence the dominance relationship allows comparing concurrently two rul es with respect to all measures Hence it can be used to bypass the problem of difference of evaluations Rules dominated by other ones at least one according to  are not relevant and have to be eliminated The skyline operator for association rules formalizes this intuition Skyline operator The skyline of over  denoted by   is the set of rules from de\036ned as follows    In other words the skyline of is the set of undominated rules of with respect to  For instance from the relation table in Table I\(b    since there is no rule in dominating or  III DISCOVERING UNDOMINATED RULES To discover undominated rules we adopt the principle of approaches oriented divide-and-conquer search 19 us ed for answering queries in database applications In the following we introduce the necessary formalization that would be of need for the generation of the undominated rules Based on this formalization we propose an algorithm called S KY R ULE  that puts the skyline operator To discover the undominated rules a na 031ve approach consist in comparing each rule with all o ther ones However association rules are often present in huge number which make it very costly to perform pairwise comparisons In the following we show how to remedy this problem First we introduce the notion of  Reference Rule A reference rule is a 036ctitious rule that dominates all the rules of  Formally   From the relational table given in Table I we can consider as the 036ctitious rule such that for each measure  is the maximal value appearing in the active domain of  0.2 0.67 0.10  Hence it does not exist any rule in that dominates  In practice measures are heterogenous and de\036ned within different domains For our purpose have to be normalized into within one interval    In other w ords  each meas ure must be normalized into within    The normalization of a given measure is performed depending on its domain and the statistical distribution of its active domain We recall that the active domain of a measure is the set of its values in  The normalization is a statistical problem which is beyond the scope of this paper Worth of mention the normalization of a measure does not modify the domination relationship between two given values Degree of similarity Given two rules   the degree of similarity between and with respect to is de\036ned as follows with is the absolute value of xandy  and  Letís consider our running example using the relation table in Table I\(b Since all measures are de\036ned within the same dom ain  w e can compute without normalization the degree of similarity between each rule and the reference rule given in the previous example     0.02     0.12     0.11    0.09     0.14     0.11     0.22     0.23 After giving the necessary de\036nitions reference rule and degree of similarity the following lemma gives a remedy to the issue evoked in the beginning of section III-A Indeed it offers a swifter solution rather than pairwise comparisons to 036nd undominated rules Let be a rule having the minimal degree of similarity with respect to then   Let be a rule having the minimal degree of similarity with respect to and we suppose that   then there exists a rule that strictly dominates  which means that      n d      Hence we ha v e       The latter inequivalent contradicts our hypothesis since has the minimal degree of similarity with respect to  After identifying an undominated rule  the rules dominated by must be identi\036ed by comparing them to Na 031vely must be compared to all rules in  yet we show in the following that we can even reduce the set of rules to be compared with into a subset of

IV RANKING ASSOCIATION RULES The S KY R ULE algorithm allowed identifying the undominated rules which are supposed to be the most relevant ones However this output might not be enough answer to a personalized user query Indeed the user often needs a speci\036ed number of relevant rules which may be more or less than what the S KY R ULE algorithm generates In the 036rst case the user asks for a subset of the undominated rules a selection is required among the S KY R ULE output Since S KY R ULE generates only relevant rules the most relevant among them must be returned to the user This selection cannot be performed unless a ranking has been done within the undominated rules In the second case the user asks for a set of relevant rules larger than the set of undominated rules the rules that must be added to the S KY R ULE output are necessarily a part from the set of dominated rules The composition of this part requires a selection among all the dominated rules This selection cannot be performed unless a ranking has be carried within the dominated rules Hence a ranking process must be performed on the whole set of rules In the remainder we introduce our second contribution we show that we can perform a comprehensive ranking using S KY R ULE  For this purpose we give the two following objective conditions 1 Any dominated rule cannot be better ranked than an undominated one 2 Two undominated rules must be ranked based on degree of similarity with respect to reference rule In the following we introduce the notion of  This notion is based on the dominance relationship First we de\036ne it at the level of rules Then we de\036ne it at the level of rule sets Both de\036nitions are essential to state Lemma 4 That lemma puts the corner stone of our approach that uses the skyline operator to establish a ranking process This process is described by R ANK R ULE  Algorithm 2 Successor rule Letís consider two rules   we say that succeeds  denoted by iff and such that  Consider the relation table in Table I\(b then we have but since  Succession Operator Let be a set of rules such that  The successeur set of in with respect to is de\036ned as follows      Letís consider our running example using the relation table in Table I\(b and suppose    Then we have   and then      Notice that although    ince  Given a set of rules  the following relation is ful\036lled   Let be a set of rules such that  1 First we have to show that    Given   then   For all   two cases have to be distinguished If then which means that   such that  If then in   such that and Thus cannot be dominated by any rule in    2 Second we have to show that    Given then   such that  Moreover since  hen   such that  Thus a and b leads to that  Furthermore we suppose that   such that and then   such that which contradicts our hypothesis see a  Thus   such that  Hence according to c and d  belongs to    Algorithm 2 R ANK R ULE Input     Output  Ordered sets of ordered rules Begin 1 0 2 While 1 4 S KY R ULE   5    7 return In this example we apply the R ANK R ULE algorithm on of Table I\(b Since both and are undominated rules then    Now we ignore and  the rules which are not dominated are and  In fact is only dominated by and is only dominated by then    Now we also ignore and  the rules which are not dominated are and  In fact is dominated by and is only dominated by then    Finally we have    This example is illustrated by Figure 1 The arrow indicates the process direction starting from the undominated rules contains the top ranked rules which are themselves ranked within from left to right based on  is better ranked than

The R ANK R ULE algorithm performs ranking by starting from the set of the most relevant rules  the undominated rules The latter are then used to identify the next ranked set  the successor Nevertheless another dual possibly remains explorable It relies on starting from the set of the less relevant rules  rules that do not dominate other ones and use them to identify the previous ranked rule set that we called it set A complete formalization of this dual perspective is beyond the scope of this paper Nevertheless we explain how it works by the following illustrative example We consider of Table I b First we identify the set of rules which do not dominate any other rules These rules are  and then we have    Now we have to ignore these rules The rules which do not dominate any other rules are and  In fact dominates only and dominates only and then   Nowwe also ignore and  The rules that do not dominate any other rules are and since they dominate and respectively then    Finally   Fig 2 The dual R ANK R ULE applied on In this subsection we show the ability of our approach to considerably reduce the huge numbers of rules generated from our experimental datasets Our experiments batch aims to compare our approach to another one based on thresholds For this purpose we assign for each measure  a threshold such that is the minimum value of the skyrules with respect to      This ensures that all undominated rules will be generated from the algorithm based on thresholds For instance in our running example  Table I\(b  0.10 0.17and  0.00 The set of resulting rules is called the threshold-based rules denoted by  These experiments have the bene\036t of quantifying the reduction of rules brought by SkyRules in the case where a user is able to perfectly specify thresholds for mining association rules algorithm based on thresholds Hence we compare the number of undominated rules with respect to that of and the total number of association rules denoted  We considered a number of combinations of measures Con\036dence 1  R ecal l 21 Pearl 22  Loe v inger 23  Z hang 24   For each set of measures Table III compares the size of undominated rules versus that of and that of all association rules The goal is to illustrate the problem of the huge number of association rules even with thresholdbased algorithm which makes dif\036cult to discover interesting ones In contrast the number of undominated rules is always low and does not exceed 9784 Interestingly the gain of a undominated rules is always important very high in almost all datasets Table IV summarizes this result by sketching for each set of measures the minimal average maximal number

and the average gain of undominated rules versus the The average gain rate is measured as follows  In what follows we put the focus on the evolution of the undominated rules cardinalities with respect to measure variation Table III shows the effect of variation of on undominated rules and all rules We can notice that the number of all rules is obviously constant In contrast the number of is sensitive to the variation of cardinality of  Indeed by adding each time a measure to  the number of decreases However the number of undominated rules may decrease or increase The decrease can be explained by the fact that an association rule can be undominated with respect to a set of measure and dominated with respect to  such that  For example if two rules and are equivalent and undominated with respect to thereisa possibility that one of them dominates the other by considering one more measure On the other hand the increase can be explained by the fact that an a ssociation rule can be dominated with respect to and undominated with respect to For example consider a rule which dominates another with respect to  by adding a mesure to  such that     then is no longer dominated by  VI CONCLUSION In this paper we introduced an approach that addresses the problem of rule selection and ranking This approach is not hindered by the abundance of measures which is the issue of several works These works have been devoted to measure selection in order to 036nd one best measure whereas the real issue lies in selecting and ranking rules to help with decision making We proposed two algorithms S KY R ULE and R ANK R ULE to perform these two tasks based on the dominance relationship When using our algorithms the user does not have to worry neither about the heterogeneity of measures nor about specifying thresholds On the other hand experimental results carried out on benchmark datasets showed important pro\036ts in terms of compactness of the undominated rules

An important direction for future work is to take into account similarity between rules in order to eliminate redundant undominated rules Indeed similar rules often have the same quality they have almost identical values for the various measures Another important task consists on setting up an approach aiming at discovering undominated rules during the phase of the extraction rules which will improve the performance of the S KY R ULE algorithm Finally an importante prospective is to plan to formalize the dual of R ANK R ULE and to 036nd the relationship between them that allows to obtain the output of one of them from the output of the other This work is partially supported by the French-Tunisian project CMCU-Utique EXQUI 11G1417 and the Auvergne Region Thanks to Alain Quillio t for his support of this work R EFERENCES  R A gra w al T  Im ielins k i and A  S w a m i   M i ning as s o ciation r ules between sets of items in large databases in

The system scales very well with dataset size because the SPARQL graph patterns are mostly evaluated with index-based nested loop joins, which tend to have execution times proportional to result size. Q5 shows the worst scalability because the execution cost is dominated by the regular expression filter on the unselective triple pattern, and the number of intermediate results that must be scanned for the regular expression filter grows significantly as the dataset size increases B  Computing SEM_CONTAINS_COUNT This experiment studied the overhead of computing sem_contains_count by executing two variations of the five sem_contains queries \(Table V\ against the LA130 dataset: \(1 sem_contains only and \(2 sem_contains  sem_contains_count The results of the experiment are shown in Figure 4. As expected, computing sem_contains_count adds some overhead. This overhead is proportional to the result s et size because the count has to be computed once for each document in the result set The overhead required to compute the count value is reasonable. For example, the overhead ranged from 0.001 sec Q2\ to 0.081 sec \(Q3\. The larger overhead observed for queries Q1 and Q3 can be attributed to the larger result size The overhead of computing sem_contains_count is relatively small for Q2, Q4, and Q5, which can be attributed to the fact that the result set size is small for these queries 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Query Number Execution Time \(sec sem_contains sem_contains + sem_contains_count  Fig. 4 Overhead for sem_contains_count on LA130 dataset C  Ordering Results by SEM_CONTAINS_COUNT This experiment tested the scalability of computing and sorting results by sem_contains_count as the query result set size increases. We used the following graph pattern template for this experiment s :hasValue ìA Cityî. ?s rdf:type :city  A City ranged over the following seven cities: Athens, Atlanta, Sacramento, Boston San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. Queries were executed against the LA130 dataset. The results of this experiment are illustrated in Figure 5.

As expected, partition pruning shows a significant speedup in query execution time when only a few partitions are accessed The speedup ranged from 2.8 times faster when one partition is accessed to 1.2 times faster when three partitions are accessed. Not surprisingly, the benefit of partition pruning is reduced as more partitions are qu eried.  This can be attributed to two opposing factors in play In our implementation, each semantic index partition results in a single RDF model, so the non-partitioned index yields one large RDF model, and the partitioned index yields eight small RDF models. The single B  tree index structure, in case of non-partitioned table, is organized independently of the partitioning key pubdate and hence does not benefit from locality of reference when the query is selective requiring access to one or a few partitions. However, for the partitioned index case, the local indexes have triples grouped by pubdate which tends to perform better for selective queries. These benefits start to diminish as the number of partitions to be accessed by the query goes up and eventually the non-partitioned index starts to perform better. When all eight partitions are accessed, the query using the \(local partitioned index runs 1.4 times slower VI  C ONCLUSIONS  The paper presented the semantic indexing feature of Oracle Database, which allows indexing unstructured text columns to generate RDF content that can subsequently be searched with a SPARQL query pattern. It described a model of a semantic index that can be incrementally composed by a combination of base extractor policies, knowledge bases, and entailments. A model for querying semantic index was discussed that allows both searching for matching documents and/or matching triples. An experimental study involving TREC documents demonstrated the feasibility of our approach The proposed semantic indexing framework is intended to create a synergy between the database, semantic web, and information extraction communities. Specifically, the integration and inference benefits of semantic technologies become available for use against unstructured data in the databases. The semantic web community benefits as large volumes of RDF data, hitherto residing as unstructured text can now drive the development of semantic applications Information extraction community benefits as their technologies are put to immediate use by the database and semantic web communities Although extracted data, stored in standard RDF format, is amenable to querying, it tends to be verbose. Further work is needed, in conjunction with the information extraction community, to come up with levels of summarization that will also result in compact and efficient SPARQL query formulation. A more complete realization of the semantic indexing framework would involve work in several areas including optimized processing of blocking queries involving ancillary operators, devising s ophisticated ranking measures for capturing document r elevance, and incremental maintenance of entailments at the document \(named graph level A CKNOWLEDGMENT  We thank Zhe Wu and Vlad Kolovski for providing support for named graph inferencing R EFERENCES  1  S G.
