South Wales 3 National Institute of Informatics 4 University of Technology Sydney and 5 National ICT Australia ABSTRACT Scalability to large numbers of classes is an important challenge for multi-class classiÆcation It can often be computationally infeasible at test phase when class prediction is performed by using every possible classiÆer trained for each individual class This paper proposes an attribute-based learning method to overcome this limitation First is to deÆne attributes and their associations with object classes automatically and simultaneously Such associations are learned based on greedy strategy under certain conditions Second is to learn a classiÆer for each attribute instead of each class Then these trained classiÆers are used to predict classes based on their attribute representations The proposed method also allows trade-off between test-time complexity which grows linearly with the number of attributes and accuracy Experiments based on Animals-with-Attributes and ILSVRC2010 datasets have shown that the performance of our method is promising when compared with the state-of-the-art Index Terms  Large scale object classiÆcation attribute-based learning greedy strategy Bayes rule sublinear complexity 1 INTRODUCTION ClassiÆcation with a large number of classes becomes more important in the computer vision community This is because image collections have been signiÆcantly growing over time Meanwhile the standard one-vs.-all strategy can be inef cient in large scale multi-class classiÆcation because its testtime complexity grows linearly with the number of classes Recently several methods       ha v e been proposed to address sublinear testing cost for large multiclass tasks All these methods rely on a tree-based learning In particular Bengio et al proposed an algorithm for learning a label tree of classiÆers by optimizing the overall tree loss Each node of the label tree consisted of a subset of class labels and its corresponding linear classiÆer In the classiÆcation phase a given test image started at the root node which contained all class labels traveled down the tree where a decision was made at each node to determine which branch to follow and ended at a leaf node which contained a single class label For a well balanced tree the test-time complexity can be reduced from O DK  to O D log K  where D is the feature dimension and K is the number of classes The method  has been demonstrated to outperform the other tree-based methods including Conditional Probability Tree CPT and Filter Tree FT Ho we v er  it also has se v eral limitations First sets of class labels in an y tw o nodes at a same depth of the tree are disjoint This can sensitively lead to a misclassiÆcation when closely related classes are assigned to different nodes at a top layer of the tree Second the tree can be unbalanced which will lead to a suboptimal complexity To improve the performance of the method in Deng et al proposed an algorithm for learning an ef cient label tree which has been shown to be the state-of-the-art The method simultaneousl y determined the tree structure and learned the classiÆers for the tree nodes It allowed overlapping of class labels among children of each node This resulted in an efÆcient optimization It also allowed precise control of the trade-off between accuracy and efÆciency which can guarantee balanced trees Although the tree-based learning has been reported to be successful in reducing test-time complexity for large scale object classiÆcation it is limited to several practical constraints First the tree-based methods cannot be further speeded up by using parallel computing which is a very important and useful methodology to solve a computational problem in real applications In practice parallel computing is a way to perform multiple processes simultaneously by using multiple compute resources Since the tree-based methods rely on a hierarchical structure multiple classiÆers cannot be applied in parallel on a given test image but in sequence This is because a selection of classiÆer used in each level of the tree depends on a decision making of classiÆer used in previous level of the tree Second the tree-based methods consume expensive memory for storing and loading all classiÆers at all nodes of the tree in test phase All classiÆers must be presented because it cannot be known beforehand that which classiÆers will be used for each given test image Based on our investigation the total number of classiÆers for each tree is  K   K for a well balanced tree where K is the total number of classes This can cause a trouble in memory consumption when K is very large and/or a tree structure is heavily unbalanced To avoid these limitations this paper proposes a new solution from different perspective using an attribute-based learning It is also shown to achieve comparable performance to the state-of-the-art i.e the balanced label tree re g arding sublinear test-time complexity and accuracy However

classiÆcation our method can be more exible and preferable for real applications This is because its efÆciency can be practically enhanced by using parallel computing Since same classiÆers are known beforehand to be used for any test image multiple classiÆers can be applied in parallel on a given test image Besides a total number of classiÆers used in our attribute-based learning   K  is less than used in the tree-based learning   K  for all cases Thus our method will consume less memory for storing and loading classiÆers in test phase Fig 1 shows the framework of the proposed method A concept of attribute-based classiÆcation is adopted for this study to reduce test-time complexity In previous works   it w as applied for dif ferent purpose to detect uns een object classes Moreover our method will make signiÆcant difference in learning attribute representation by using visual correlations between classes instead of manual human efforts as in or semantic relatedness as in 10 This mak es attributes more related to visual information in images and sequentially leads to the better classiÆcation Our framework contains three main steps in the training process as shown in the rst three rectangles of Fig 1 The rst step is to compute a similarity matrix  S  based on onevs.-all classiÆcation using training and validation datasets The matrix S represents correlations between different object classes Then the second step is to build up relations between classes and attributes which are virtually deÆned based on S  Object classes are represented by different sets of attributes and each attribute may belong to several related classes The third step is to learn a classiÆer for each attribute instead of each object class In this way classes are associated with the trained classiÆers by using their attribute representations Afterwards at test phase the per-attribute classiÆers are applied to generate predictions of attribute values for each test sample The nal prediction score of the test sample against each class is calculated from the relevant attribute values Based on our proposed method it can be seen that the testtime complexity grows linearly with the total number of attributes  M  instead of the total number of classes  K  Thus M can be selected to be much less than K  in order to significantly reduce the complexity The rest of this paper is organized as follows Attributebased classiÆcation is explained in section 2 Constructions of correlations between different classes and associations be                     n   n Fig 2  Direct Attribute Prediction DAP for attribute-based classiÆcation z 1   z K are K object classes a 1   a M are M attributes a k m is an association between z k and a m  p  a m j x  is a posterior probability of that a m being present in an image x  which is estimated from a classiÆer for a m  tween classes and attributes are proposed in section 3 Experimental results are shown in section 4 and conclusions are drawn in section 5 2 ATTRIBUTE-BASED CLASSIFICATION Given that there are total M attributes  a 1  a 2   a M   each class k  z k  is represented by a set of attributes A k   a k 1  a k 2   a k M  where a k m  1  m  M  is a binary number a k m  1 means z k is associated with a m  otherwise z k is not associated with a m  Fig 2 shows the Direct Attribute Prediction DAP suggested by Attrib utes are used as in between layer to decouple images from layer of class labels In this study the probabilistic formulation of the DAP in  is adopted and re vised for our attrib ute-based classiÆcation It starts by learning a probabilistic classiÆer  m for each attribute a m   m is trained by using images of all classes k for which a k m  1 as positive training samples and the rest as negative training samples In this way  m can provide a posterior probability p  a m j x  of that a m being present in an image x   m models the relation between an image x and an attribute a m  Next is to consider the relation between an attribute a m and a class z k  based on Bayes rule as p  z k j a m   p  a m j z k  p  z k  p  a m   a k m p  a m  K 1 where p  z k   1 K by assuming identical class priors and p  a m j z k   a k m which represents the association between an attribute a m and a class z k  Then the posterior probability of a class k given an image x can be calculated as p  z k j x   M X m 1 p  z k j a m  p  a m j x   1 K M X m 1 a k m p  a m j x  p  a m  2 where p  a m   1 K P K k 1 a k m by empirical means over all classes Equivalently p  z k j x  can be estimated in the product form as suggested by as p  z k j x   M X m 1 p  z k j a m  p  a m j x   1 K M Y m 1  p  a m j x  p  a m   a k m 3 where p  a m  can be approximated by the empirical means or set to 0.5 Based on our e xperiments equations 2 and 3 yield comparable performances Therefore the best output class label  b k  for an image x is predicted as 


b k  argmax 1  k  K p  z k j x  4 where p  z k j x  is obtained from equation 2 or 3 By contrast the standard one-vs.-all classiÆcation predicts p  z k j x  by using the trained per-class classiÆers Challenge The remaining challenge is to construct the associations between classes and attributes  a k m  The method in uses manual human judgments to seek out the relat i v e strength of these associations The attributes represent highlevel descriptions of object classes such as colors and geometric patterns To reduce this dependency on human labeling effort the method in performs mining such associations by measuring their semantic relatedness using linguistic knowledge bases including WordNet World Wide Web and Web Image Search The methods in  estimate the associations wi thout using any visual information from training image samples This is because they learn to detect unseen object classes and thus image samples of test classes are not available in the training process They also use pre-deÆned attributes while our method will automatically learn attributes based on correlations between classes These lead to the following limitations First some high-level concepts describing attributes in   such as smelly f ast acti v e and strong are unrelated/weakly related to visual information in images Second 85 attributes are used for 50 classes  This cannot reduce the test-time complexity in our study because M  K  On the other hand this paper does not deal with the problem of unseen object classes Thus training samples of all classes will be used as a basis to virtually deÆne attributes and their associations with object classes see section 3 3 ATTRIBUTE REPRESENTATION In this paper attributes are not used to explicitly represent the high-level descriptors as in  Instead the y are l earned from relations between object classes We deÆne a matrix A 2 f 0  1 g K  M to represent the associations between M attributes and K classes The matrix A can be written in three different forms as A  2 6 6 6 4 a 1 1    a 1 M    a K 1    a K M 3 7 7 7 5   A 1  A 2   A K  T   B 1  B 2   B M  5 where A k is a set of attributes representing a class z k such that A k   a k 1  a k 2   a k M  2 f 0  1 g 1  M  B m is a set of classes representing an attribute a m such that B m   a 1 m  a 2 m   a K m  T 2 f 0  1 g K  1  and A  k m   a k m representing the association between z k and a m  As mentioned in section 2 z k is associated with a m when a k m  1  while z k is not associated with a m when a k m  0  Moreover to reduce the test-time complexity M must be less than K  However since attributes are in the binary forms M  d log 2 K e in order to differentiate all K classes Thus the optimal complexity of our method grows by O  log K   which is equivalent to the complexity of the perfect balanced tree M can be selected empirically by trading-off between test-time complexity and accuracy Basically classes that share the same attribute should be highly related Thus the matrix A will be determined based on the similarities between object classes using the greedy strategy under certain conditions This section will discuss three issues 1 measurement of such similarities see section 3.1 2 conditions for the matrix A see section 3.2 3 construction of the matrix A see section 3.3 3.1 Correlations between different classes We deÆne a matrix S 2  K  K to represent similarities between object classes S  i j   1  i j  K  is the similarity of class z j to class z i  which can be measured from probability scores of that samples of class z j being predicted as belonging to class z i  In this way the matrix S will be obtained based on one-vs.-all classiÆcation in the training process which can be done ofØine beforehand Given a training dataset a classiÆer  k is learned for each class z k  Thus  k can provide a posterior probability p  z k j x  of that an image x being predicted as belonging to class z k  Then the trained per-class classiÆers are applied on a validation dataset containing image samples of all classes S  i j  is computed as S  i j   P N n 1 p  z i j x n;j  N 6 where x n;j is image sample n of z j on the validation dataset 3.2 Conditions for attribute representation In this study the attribute representation must be constructed under the following ve conditions C1  No identical sets of attributes representing different classes i.e A i and A j are not identical for any 1  i j  K and i 6  j  In order to differentiate all classes their attribute representations must be different C2  No identical sets of classes describing different attributes i.e B m and B n are not identical for any 1  m n  M and m 6  n  Otherwise it will lead to duplicated classiÆers which will increase test-time complexity without additional beneÆt C3  No subset among sets of attributes representing different classes i.e A i should not be a subset of A j for any 1  i j  K and i 6  j  This is to avoid a bias classiÆcation based on equations 2 and 4 A i is a subset of A j if and only if there is at least one attribute a m  1  m  M  such that a j m  1 and a i m  0 and there is not any attribute a n  1  n  M  such that a i n  1 and a j n  0  C4  Each class must be associated with at least one attribute That is for any A i  1  i  K  there is at least one attribute a m  1  m  M  such that a i m  1

class z k and attribute a m  In this study attribute a m is presented by the set of classes Thus s k m can be equivalently calculated from correlations between class z k and all other classes that share the same attribute a m  4 EXPERIMENTS In our experiments two datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method which include 1 Animalswith-Attributes AwA and 2 ILSVRC2010 12 Besides classiÆers are trained based on RBF-SVM 4.1 AwA AwA is used to 1 roughly expose implicit high-level concepts of attributes and 2 clearly demonstrate trade-off between accuracy and efÆciency of the proposed method It consists of 30475 images from 50 animal classes We use 20  for training 10  for validation and the rest 70  for testing The provided pre-computed features are used in our experiments which include RGB color histograms local selfsimilarity histograms SIFT rgSIFT PHOG and SURF Thus the total feature dimension is 10940 4.1.1 Implicit high-level concepts of attributes In this paper attributes are represented by using sets of classes without any pre-deÆned explicit high-level concept as used in  Instead the y are obtained through the lear ning processes as explained in sections 3.1 3.2 and 3.3 However to reveal high-level meanings of our learned attributes they can be implicitly matched against high-level concepts by investigating common visual features among classes sharing the same attribute As an example we discuss three attributes  a 1  a 2  a 3  learned by using our method on AwA dataset where a total number of attributes is 20 a 1 is associated with classes dalmatian siamese cat skunk chihuahua weasel a 2 is associated with classes persian cat siamese cat hamster chihuahua rat weasel mouse a 3 is associated with classes gorilla chimpanzee giant panda a 1 can be linked to concepts of black and white However panda and zebra also contain black and white colors but do not share a 1 because global shape structure of panda and stripe pattern of zebra are too different from other classes sharing a 1  a 2 can be linked to concepts of whisker triangular ears big eyes and small Other classes such as lion tiger and bobcat do not share a 2  although they also have whisker triangular ears and big eyes This is because their size is big a 3 can be linked to concepts of black tree and big The class spider monkey is also one type of monkeys as similar to gorilla and chimpanzee but it does not share a 3  This is because its main colors are brown and grey and its size is small 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35  Accuracy Test time \(minutes Fig 3  The trade-off between the test-time and the accuracy using the proposed method Many concepts mentioned above such as black white small big tree are also used in  Moreo v er  as discussed in this section it can be seen that each attribute can be well linked to multiple high-level concepts In contrast each attribute in  is represented by a single high-le v el concept This is the main reason why the methods in  use M  85  K  50  In our study M  K in order to reduce test-time complexity Thus each attribute must be implicitly linked to multiple high-level concepts 4.1.2 Trade-off between accuracy and efÆciency Since this dataset contains K  50 classes the minimum number of attributes is d log 2 50 e  6  In this section experiments have been carried out based on 10 different numbers of attributes i.e M  6 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Figure 3 illustrates the trade-off between the test-time and the accuracy It can be seen that the accuracy grows faster than linear i.e approximately polynomial with the test-time which only grows linearly with the number of attributes When M  K i.e 50 attributes for 50 classes the proposed method is equivalent to the one-vs.-all classiÆcation regarding both accuracy and test-time complexity The onevs.-all scheme has been conÆrmed to be as accurate as any other more complicated schemes So it is used as a baseline in this study In our method a proper M can be selected to signiÆcantly reduce test-time complexity but only slightly reduce accuracy when compared with the one-vs.-all strategy Two examples are shown in Figure 3 In the rst example shown as the green dashed lines when M  35  the test-time complexity is reduced by 30  but the accuacy is reduced by 2 only In the second example of a better efÆciency shown as the red dashed lines when M  30  the test-time complexity is reduced by almost 50  but the accuacy is reduced by just 4  However selecting the number of attributes can be properly decided by programmers based on natures of applications and datasets 4.2 ILSVRC2010 ILSVRC2010 is used for a fair comparison with the state-ofthe-art on lar ge scale object classiÆcation It incl udes a large number of classes i.e 1k classes which contains 1.2M images for training 50k images for validation and 150k im

pyramid 1x1  2x2 to obtain a 50k dimensional feature vector As shown in Table 1 the proposed method is compared with the efÆcient label tree-based methods  The m ethod in has been sho wn to achie v e state-of-the-art performanc e in testing for large scale object classiÆcation We follow the same experiments as in There are three dif ferent cases where test speedups are 10.3 18.2 and 31.3 respectively The test speedup is deÆned as the speedup of the test cost compared to the baseline i.e one-vs.-all classiÆcation In our method given a test speedup  t  M  K=t  Thus our experiments have been carried out based on the three cases by using three different numbers of attributes which are 97 55 and 32 respectively From Table 1 it can be seen that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to the state-of-the-art Thus our method can be considered as an efÆcient alternative to the tree-based methods and it can be more preferable in real applications due to practical advantages as mentioned in the introduction That is the test speedup of our method can be further improved by using parallel computing Also our method uses much smaller number of classiÆers in test phase This leads to smaller memory consumption for storing and loading the classiÆers In the proposed method the number of classiÆers  C  equals to the number of attributes Thus we use 97 55 and 32 classiÆers in cases 1 2 and 3 respectively On the other hand in the tree-based methods  C equals to the number of nodes in the tree which varies on the number of children  Q  for each node and the maximum depth  H  of the tree For a well balanced tree C  P H h 1 Q h  Two parameters Q and H are xed in the experiments  as case 1 Q  32  H  2  case 2 Q  10  H  3  and case 3 Q  6  H  4  Thus they use approximately 1056 1110 and 1554 classiÆers in cases 1 2 and 3 respectively 5 CONCLUSION This paper has proposed a new framework for large scale object classiÆcation by using attribute-based learning Object classes are represented by sets of attributes which are virtually deÆned in a middle layer between class labels and images Associations between attributes and classes are learned by using classical greedy strategy based on correlations between classes Then per-attribute classiÆers are trained instead of per-class classiÆers as in standard one-vs.-all scheme Finally the trained classiÆers are applied on a test image to predict its class label based on the learned attribute representations In order to reduce test-time complexity a number of attributes can be selected to be less than a number of classes That is trade-off between test-time complexity and accuracy can be precisely carried out Experimental results have demonstrated efÆciency of the proposed method compared to the existing methods based on tree structure 6 REFERENCES  R Rifkin and A Klautau In defense of one-vs-all classiÆcation  Journal of Machine Learning Research  vol 5 pp 101±141 January 2004  S Bengio J W eston and

Figure 6 is not as signiìcant as that of 1st largest answers For example in Rule 1 with 1m data size DA  PAP has an improvement about 2200 from 5500 to 3300 in Figure 2 while the corresponding improvement is only about 1500 from 5500 to 4000 in Figure 6 Nevertheless DAP  PAP can still keep the lowest time cost in all the test in Figure 6 VII C ONCLUSIONS Motivated by the utility of differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
