of potential rules grows quickly as the number of items in the antecedent grows It is therefore dificult for an expert to analyze the rules and identib the useful An approach for generating representative association rules for transactions that uses only a subset of the set of frequent itemsets called frequent closed itemsets was presented in 6 We employ formal concept analysis to develop the notion of frequent closed episodes The concept of representative association rules is formalized in the context of event sequences 
Applying con straints to target highly signi$cant rules further reduces the number of rules Our approach results in a sign@cant re duction of the number of rules generated while maintaining the minimum set of relevant association rules and retaining the abili9 to generate the entire set of association rules with respect to the given constraints We show how our method can be used to discover associations in a drought risk man agement decision support system and use multiple climatol ogy datasets related to automated weather stations minimizing the number of association rules 
discovered 2 Most of these approaches introduce additional measures for interestingness of a rule and prune the rules that do not sat isfy the additional measures as a post-processing step A set of representative association rules on the other hand is a minimal set of rules from which all association rules can be generated, during the actual processing step Usually the number of representative association rules is much smaller than the number of all association rules and no additional measures are needed for determining the representative as sociation 
rules 4 Recently Saquer and Deogun developed a different ap proach for generating representative association rules 6 Similarly Zaki 8 used frequent closed itemsets to gener ate non-redundant association rules in CHARM We use closure as the basis for generating frequent sets in the context of sequential data We then generate se quential association rules based on representative associa tion rule approaches while integrating constraints into our approach By combining these techniques, our method is well suited for time series problems that have groupings 
of events that occur close together in time but occur relatively infrequently over the entire dataset We apply this technique to the drought risk management problem 1 Introduction 2 Frequent Closed Episodes Discovering association rules is an important data mining problem The problem was first defined in the con text of the market basket data to identify customers buy ing habits  11 The problem of analyzing and identifying interesting rules becomes difficult as the number of rules increases In most applications the number of rules discov 
ered is usually large Two different approaches to handle this problem have been reported 1 identifying the associ ation rules that are of special importance to the user and 2 This research was supported in part by NSF Digital Government Grant No EIA-0091530 and NSF EPSCOR Grant No EPS-0091900 Our overall goal is to analyze event sequences, discover recurrent patterns of events, and generate sequential associ ation rules Our approach is based on the concept 
of repre sentative association rules combined with event constraints A sequential dataset is normalized and then discretized by forming subsequences using a sliding window 5 Using a sliding window of size 6 every normalized time stamp value xt is used to compute each of the new sequence values yt-6/2 to ylt+6/2 Thus the dataset has been divided into segments each of size 6 The discretized version of the 0-7695-1119-8/01 17.00 0 2001 IEEE 603 


time series is obtained by using some clustering algorithm and a suitable similarity measure Each cluster identifier is an event Qpe and the set of cluster labels is the class of events E The newly formed version of the time series is referred to as an event sequence An event sequence is a triple tB to S where tB is the beginning time to is the ending time and S is a finite time-ordered sequence of events p is the step size between each event d is the total number of steps in the time interval from time tg to time to and D  B  dp Each et is a member of a class of events E and t 5 tz+l for all i  B    D  lp A sequence of events S includes events from a single class of events E A window on an event sequence S is an event subse quence W  et7   etk where tB 5 t and tk 5 tD  1 5 The width of the window W is width\(W  tk  t The set of all windows W on S with width\(W  wzn is denoted as W\(S win The width of the window is pre specified An episode in an event sequence is a combination of events with a partially specified order The type of an episode is parallel if no order is specified, and serial if the events of the episode have a fixed order An episode is injec tive if no event type occurs more than once in the episode We extend the work of Mannila et al 5 to consider closed sets of episodes We use formal concept analysis as the basis for developing the notion of closed episode sets 6 Informally a concept is a pair of sets set of objects windows or episodes and set of features \(events common to all objects in the set That is s  etn 1 Q/3+IS eto+np   etr3+dp  et 1 where Definition 1 An episodal data mining context is defined as a triple W\(S win E R where W\(S win is a set of all windows of width win defined on the event sequence S and E is a set of episodes in the event sequence S and R C w x E Definition2 Let W,E,R be an episodal data mining context X C W and Y C E Define the mappings a p as follows p  2  2 Q  2E  2 p\(X  e E E I w e E R b w E X a\(Y  w E W 1 w e E R b'e E Y The mapping p\(X associates with X the set of episodes that are common to all the windows in X Similarly, the mapping a\(Y associates with Y the set of all windows containing all the episodes in Y Intuitively p\(X is the maximum set of episodes shared by all windows in X and a\(Y is the maximum set of windows possessing all the episodes in Y It is easy to see that in general for any set Y of episodes p\(a\(Y  Y A set of episodes Y that satisfies the condi tion p\(a\(Y  Y is called a closed set of episodes 6 The frequency of an episode is defined as the fraction of windows in which the episode occurs Given an event sequence S and a window width win the frequency of an episode P of a given type in S is I w E W\(S win  P occurs in w I fr\(P S win  I W\(S,win I Given a frequency threshold min P is frequent if fr\(P,S win 2 min-fr A frequent closed set of episodes FCE is a closed set of episodes that satisfy the minimum frequency threshold Closure of an episode set X C E denoted by closure\(X is the smallest closed episode set containing X and is equal to the intersection of all frequent episode sets containing X To generate frequent closed target episodes we develop an algorithm called Gen-FCE shown in Figure 1 Gen FCE is a combination of the Close-FCI algorithm the WINEPI frequent episode algorithms 5 and the Direct al gorithm Gen-FCE generates FCE with respect to a given set of Boolean target constraints B an event sequence S a window width win an episode type a minimum fre quency minyr and a window step size p The Gen-FCE algorithm requires one database pass during each iteration I Generate Candidate Frequent Closed Target Episodes of length I CFC1.a 2 k=l 3 while CFCk,a  8 do 4 Read the sequence S one window at a time let FCEk,a be the elements in CFCk?B with a new closure and with a frequency 2 minfr 5 6 k Generate Candidate Frequent Closed Target Episodes CFCk+l.Bfrom FCEk,t3 7 return U,=1 k 1 FCE,,p.closureandFCE,,B f requency Figure 1 Gen-FCE algorithm We incorporate constraints similar to the Direct algo rithm This approach is known to work well at low minimum supports and in large datasets 7 This approach requires an expensive cross-product operation so for dis junctive singleton constraints, the candidate generation al gorithm is used 5 3 Representative Episodal Association Rules We use the set of frequent closed episodes FCE pro duced from the Gen FCE algorithm to generate the repre sentative episodal association rules that cover the entire set of association rules The cover of a rule r  X  Y denoted by C\(r is the set of association rules that can be generated from r That 604

episodes When using drought constraints, the increase is at a much slower pace than WINEPI For the sample dataset and a window width of 3 months Gen-FCE produces 53 frequent drought serial episodes while WINEPI produces 5779 more 3 1 16\episodes 4.2 Gen-REAR vs WINEPI Association Rules We next experimented with finding association rules in the drought risk management dataset for Mead NE with various confidence thresholds and window widths using the Gen-REAR and WINEPI AR algorithms for injective par allel and serial episodes The number of rules decreases rapidly as the confidence threshold increases and increases rapidly as the window width widens In all cases Gen REAR produces fewer rules than the WINEPI AR algo rithm Using the Gen-REAR approach all the rules can be generated if desired even though the meaning of the addi tional AR\222s is captured by the smaller set of REAR\222s Gen-REAR performs extremely well when finding drought episodal rules as shown in Table 3 The number of REAR\222s decreases rapidly as the confidence interval in creases For the sample dataset at a confidence threshold of 0.20 and a window width of 2 months Gen-REAR pro duces 24 drought parallel episodal rules while WINEPI AR produces 20892 more \(5038 rules. With the same param eters Gen-REAR produces 14 drought serial episodal rules while WINEPI AR produces 16257% more 2290 rules Table 3 Gen-REAR parallel and serial rules I I Parallel 1 Serial fl L Confidence Distinct Distinct threshold rules rules 0.20 24 14 0.25 24 12 0.30 19 9 0.35 13 7 0.40 10 6 0.45 8 5 Confidence threshold 10 A5 the window width widens Gen-REAR overwhelm ingly produces fewer rules than the WINEPI algorithm The number of REAR\222s increases as the window width For the sample dataset at a window width of 3 months Gen REAR produces 30 parallel drought episodal rules while WINEPI AR produces 53763 more 16159 rules With the same parameters Gen-REAR produces 8 serial drought episodal rules while WINEPI AR produces 24825% more 1994 The savings are obvious The Gen-REAR algorithm finds the drought REAR\222s for all reasonable window widths and confidence levels on the Mead NE drought risk man agement dataset in less than 30 seconds As the window widens the WINEPI AR algorithm quickly becomes com putationally infeasible to use for the drought risk manage ment problem 5 Conclusion This paper presents Gen-REAR a new approach for gen erating representative episodal association rules We also presented Gen-FCE a new approach used to generate the frequent closed episode sets that conform to user-specified constraints Our approach results in a large reduction in the input size for generating representative episodal associ ation rules for targeted episodes, while retaining the ability to generate the entire set of association rules We also stud ied the gain in efficiency of generating targeted representa tive episodal association rules as compared to the traditional WINEPI algorithm on a multiple time series drought risk management problem References  11 R.

The purpose of using the parameter BV and nawp in function MineSamePrefixFreq is to acquire the bit-vector and the support of itemset I\222s extension conveniently Using the two parameters we can avoid generating bit-vector and support of new itemset from the beginning Theorem 2 Algorithm GRG can finds out all frequent closed itemsets and all association rules on frequent closed itemsets ProoEFrom the lemma 3 itemset I is a frequent closed itemset if and only if I not covered by any other frequent closed itemset That means I is neither covered by any frequent closed itemset in S nor covered by any frequent closed itemset in Sah Fmm lemma 8 if I is not covered by any itemset of extended itemset cluster of I we can say I is not covered by any frequent closed itemset in S.k In function MineSamePrefixFreq\222s 3th step, we set the variable \223covered\224 to FALSE. in 10th step, if I is covered by any itemset of the extended itemset cluster of I then set the variable \223covered\224 to TRUE I can\222t be frequent closed itemset S equals to the current set of frequent closed itemsets FC that have been found out If we can confirm that I not covered by any itemset of FC I is frequent closed itemset The function InsmltsmSefToGFc will retum FALSE if the itemset lis found to be covered by other frequent closed itemsets during the insert process From the discussion above GRG can fmds out all the frequent closed itemset Since all frequent closed itemset are found out according to theorem 1 we can fmd out all association rules on lattice graph 111 Experiment evaluation and performance study In this section we present a performance comparison between the GRG algorithm and the Apriori-based algorithm A-closeL6\222 and FP-tree based algorithm CLOSETI\222\222 All of the experiments are performed on 1.7GHz PC machine with 256 megabytes main memoly running on Microsoft Windows Me All the program are written in Microsow Visual Ctc6.0 The data set used for performance study include one real data set and two synthetic data sets The real data set is the Traditional Chinese Medicine TCM database which has 1378 prescription records each prescription has several drugs The synthetic data sets are generated using the procedure described in l The parameters of the synthetic data sets are described in table 1 We first test the speed property of the two algorithms on the real and synthetic data set by changing the minimum support threshold The results of the experiments are shown in figure 2 3 and 4 Then we test the scale up property of the two algorithms by fixing the minimum support threshold to specified value I and changing the size of the data set The results of the experiments are shown in figure 5 All the response time only include the period of mining frequent closed itemset From the above mentioned performance study, we can see that GRG algorithm has good performance both in speed and scale-up property The good performance of GRG comes from the following reasons Firstly GRG adopts the technique of bit vector which substantially compresses the information of the transaction database Secondly the construction of association graph makes the algorithm avoid candidate set generation The generation of new frequent closed itemset can be guided by the association graph efficiently Furthermore by the conshuction of graph the times of database scan are substantially reduced Only twice database scans are needed. Finally the concept of extended itemset cluster also reduces the search space when judge weather one frequent itemset is closed Parameter Total item 1000 1000 I OK IV Conclusion For the task of mining association rules on frequent closed itemsets this paper proposes a graph-based algorithm named GRG The new algorithm adopts the technique of bit-vector and constructs an association graph to represent the frequent relationships between frequent items The GRG generates frequent closed itemsets based on that association graph of fiequent items GRG also introduces lattices graph of frequent closed itemsets for the association rules mining The experiment evaluation and performance study on real data set and synthetic data set show that the new algorithm has good performance both in speed and scale up property Fig.7 Performancc test using TCM Dataset 858

For the spatial partitioning we use the Military Grid Reference System MGRS Thus w ay  we represent an y location on the surface of the Earth at multiple granularities ranging from 1 002 1 m 2 to 100 002 100 km 2  by an alphanumeric value For temporal partitioning we use the typical temporal hierarchies from data warehousing hour day week month We drop cells with very low activity speci\002cally cells where the most popular term occurs in fewer than 5 messages at the 002nest granularity hour We will shortly describe how we 002x the spatio-temporal hierarchy in AFIA based on the considered workload We perform three sets of experiments The 002rst measures the space and accuracy of the proposed algorithms and compares them with two baselines The second evaluates the throughput memory consumption and number of checkpoints when varying the targeted k parameter The third evaluates the query processing performance when varying the size of the spatio-temporal query range We also show the number of checkpoints created during a time period B Data and Queries We collected all geo-tagged messages from the public Twitter FireHose during May 2013 The dataset contains 110,426,053 tweets yielding an average rate of circa 41 tweet per second Figure 9 provides insight into the workload and helps choose an appropriate spatio-temporal hierarchy Figure 9a shows the total number of cells that receive at least one tweet Thus the graph shows the expected number of active summaries at the given granularities For example every hour the number of 0.1 002 0.1 km 2  1 002 1 km 2  10 002 10 km 2  and 100 002 100 km 2 spatial grid cells that receive at least one tweet is circa 0.5M 200K 40K and 10K respectively i.e the 223Hour\224 curve in the 002gure Figure 9b considers the cells at the 0.1 km 002 0.1 km 002 1 hour granularity The y-axis depicts the number of such cells subject to different loads the number of terms t processed This shows that the number of 223interesting\224 cells with at least 100 terms is quite low barely reaching 100 Therefore we 002x the 002nest temporal granularity at an hour Figure 9c considers the cells at the 100 km 002 100 km 002 1 week granularity The 002gure shows that thousands of such cells have summaries that receive more than 1 thousand terms We 002x k at 25 and generate 2 query sets each consisting of 100 queries Each query in the 002rst set has a temporal extent with a length chosen at random among 1 hour 1 day and 1 week and it has a randomly selected spatial region The spatial granularity of the coarsest cell that is contained in the spatial query region is the query's spatial granularity and the query region is enlarged to cover all the cells at that granularity that it intersects with In visual terms this procedure corresponds to 223snapping\224 the spatial query region to the coarser granularity The underlying rationale for adopting this procedure is that 002ner-granularity cells do not contribute with term counts at the same magnitude as do cells at the granularity of the coarsest fully covered cell Since any rectangle can be created from a number of merged squares we limit the experiments to squares Each cell contains 10 002 10 cells at the next 002ner granularity Thus the largest number of cells any query square can cover is 18 002 18  324 As a result we employ queries that may cover up to 1,800 002 1,800 km 2  While the 002rst query set focuses on variation in the spatial range the second focuses on temporal variation Each of the 100 queries has a spatial region chosen at random from one of the spatial granularities The query resulting in most temporal summary merges is the query that spans from the 002rst hour after midnight on the 002rst day in May until the hour before midnight on the last day of May This query covers 2 002 23 hours 3  5 days and 3 weeks which amounts to 57 temporal summaries To avoid empty results we do not consider regions that only cover empty cells Note that we do not perform compaction on the last active temporal granularities to better re\003ect the real-life scenario where a stream is constantly keeping these summaries active To simplify the experiments the initCounters parameter which determines the initial number of counters is set to the same value as targeted k  C Baselines We consider two baselines for comparison and validation of our proposal SS In each active spatio-temporal summary we aggregate the most frequent items using the SpaceSaving algorithm Active summaries maintain a 002xed number  m  of items and their counts while archived summaries are compacted by keeping only the counters for the k most frequent terms Choosing a value for m represents a trade-off between storage size and result accuracy HT In each active spatio-temporal summary we maintain a full list of terms using a hash table Once the summary becomes inactive and is archived its time granularity passes the list is sorted and cleaned up by discarding all but the counters for the targeted topk terms This approach maintains the exact topk items at all spatio-temporal granularities and serves to measure the accuracy of the other approaches However since HT has excessive storage requirements we do not expect it to scale under the considered workloads D The Space Versus Accuracy Trade-Off In the 002rst set of experiments we evaluate the accuracy of our approach by comparing it with the baselines Since HT maintains the exact counts at all granularities its storage requirements are too high for large scale experiments Similarly SS maintains a 002xed number m of counters at all granularities and m cannot be set too high for large scale experiments Thus we consider only tweets occurring in the spatial region with the 11S grid zone designator a region in the US of size ca 900 002 550 km 2  We use the local machine We consider variants of SS where m is set to 50 100 and 200 In AFIA we set targeted k to 50 The 002rst week four days in May is used for warm-up and only the accuracies of the subsequent summaries are evaluated We perform topk queries on all summaries at each spatio-temporal granularity We compare the topk most frequent terms in each summary produced by AFIA and SS and compare with the corresponding topk items produced by HT We set k  20  156 


a Total number of active cells b Terms per hour per 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 cell c Terms per week per 100 002 100 km 2 cell Fig 9 Twitter Workload Intensity at Different Spatio-Temporal Granularities The results are shown in Figure 10 We measure the fraction of correct topk for varying spatial granularities and we report separate graph for each temporal granularity The coarser spatio-temporal summaries are subject to higher loads and more diverse terms At the 002nest granularity 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 in Figure 10a all approaches produce quite accurate results However as the spatial or temporal granularity gets coarser the accuracy of SS deteriorates Increasing m does not solve the problem but just postpones it On the other hand AFIA is virtually as accurate as HT at all spatial and temporal granularities Its Aggressive Increment procedure is effective in making it adapt its number of counters as needed to capture the most frequent items very accurately Due to checkpointing when several summaries have to be merged few topk terms are missed and we did not observe accuracies below 0.99 0.98 and 0.97 for hours days and weeks respectively Figure 11 reports the average number of counters maintained per summary in the same experiment Note the logscaled y-axis The 002gure con\002rms the impracticality of using HT in large scale scenarios SS maintains a 002xed number of counters The 002gure shows how AFIA adapts At hours and days Figures 11a\22611b AFIA follows SS  m  100  implying that on average 100 counters is enough to achieve the desired accuracy At weeks Figures 11c the adaptivity of AFIA is even clearer for 002ner cells it uses much fewer counters than for coarser cells This experiment shows how AFIA achieves the best of two worlds accuracy is at the level of HT which is 100 accurate while the space requirements are at the level of SS with a small number of counters Having demonstrated the accuracy of our approach we proceed to large scale performance experiments on the HMC machine E Varying targeted k In this experiment we vary targeted k and consider two cases where the 002nest spatial granularity is 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 and 1 002 1 km 2  For each case we also maintain all the coarser granularities Figure 12 shows the results AFIA always has a throughput of more than 13,000 items per second Figure 12a As expected the throughput increases as either targeted k decreases or the 002nest granularity becomes more coarse Figure 12b shows how the memory consumption increases with increasing targeted k  This is because increasing numbers of counters have to be maintained to guarantee correctness when there are more terms The memory consumption increases slowly at 002rst due to fewer checkpoints occurring Figure 12c Thus for small values of targeted k  much of the space consumption is due to checkpoints As expected more memory is required for maintaining 002ner granularities The results show that a single HMC machine can maintain between 2 and 3 months of data meaning that it takes 4 to 6 machines to support a full year At current costs 1  this is feasible for larger companies Note that the measured memory consumption represents the entire Java heap memory used by the application The actual aggregates not shown require much less When targeted k is set to a low value the number of required counters will most often also be low With only a few counters any small change in activity of a cell may impact the targeted k counters resulting in a checkpoint Therefore we see that the number of checkpoints decreases with targeted k  Having a high number of counters makes a cell more robust to changes in activity and any small changes can be captured without checkpoints The number of checkpoints increases as expected when a 002ner granularity is maintained F Varying Q:R and Q:T We 002x targeted k at 100 and vary the spatial and temporal extents of the queries We employ the two query sets and measure the average runtime Figures 13a and 13b show the results Retrieving a summary requires one or more constant time lookups in Algorithm 3 Line 3 depending on the spatial or temporal granularity of the query and it may also require the merging of checkpointed summaries Because 002ner granularity cells generally receive fewer items than coarser granularity cells the runtime is lower at 002ner granularities Fewer merges are required because more cells are empty The results show that this applies to both the spatial and the temporal granularities When the spatial extent increases more lookups are performed resulting in an expected higher runtime With more coarse temporal granularities more merges are performed increasing the runtime further The runtime is not made worse  1 The price for a Spot Instance in June 2013 was USD 0.343 per hour 157

Fig 14 Checkpoints Over Time V C ONCLUSIONS We present a new framework for the processing of spatiotemporally constrained topk most popular terms queries on streaming spatio-temporally tagged text content such as microblog posts The framework's index extends existing techniques for counting frequent items in summaries to allow the summaries to grow and shrink dynamically to adapt to changes in the incoming data Query processing works by merging relevant summaries To provide guarantees about the query results a new merging algorithm is proposed that supports spatio-temporal query regions Experimental studies with an implementation of the framework offers insight into the accuracy scalability and performance of the processing of incoming data and queries and they demonstrate that the framework is capable of offering very accurate query results at high performance at scale A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported in part by the MADALGO research center and in part by the

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
