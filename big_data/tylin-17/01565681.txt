mining in a stream ing environment Our algorithm has provable deterministic bounds on accuracy Unlike the only other existing work in this area that we are familiar with  our algorithm does not require any out-of-core summary structure We believe that this is a very desirable property since stream mining algo rithms may need to be executed in 
Such algorithms can only guarantee an approximate result In this paper we present a new approach for frequent  item set mining Our work has two main contributions In-core Mining in Streaming Environment We present a single pass algorithm for frequent  
and infinite data streams In a streaming environment a mining algorithm must take only a single pass over the data

another pass can be taken on the sequence and the frequency of all remaining elements can be counted the goal of their work is to de termine the elements that occur with frequency greater than

single pass on the sequence as we show in Figure  Our work is derived from the recent work by Karp  padimitriou and Shenker on finding frequent elements or  itemset  0 A trivial algorithm for this will involve counting the fre quency of all distinct elements and checking if any of them has the desired frequency If there are n distinct elements this will require  N/2  s.count p.count p.count 0  distinct elements in the se quence and eliminate them together This can be repeated un til no more than  distinct elements remain in the sequence It can be claimed that any element appearing more than  times will be left in the sequence The reason is that the elimination can only be performed at most  times During each such elimination, any distinct element is removed at most once Hence for each distinct element the total number of eliminations during the entire process is at most NO Any element appearing more than NO times will remain in the sequence Note however the elements left in the sequence do not necessarily appear with frequency greater than NO Thus, this approach will provide a  item whose count has now become  space It computes a  itemset 1 in a single pass Note that their algorithm can be directly extended to find i-itemsets in the case where each transaction has a fixed length  R\(\(1/0 space which becomes extremely high when  i al.'s superset space to find potential

potentially frequent items We maintain a count for each item in the set P This set is initially empty As we process a new item from a sequence we check if it is in the set P If yes its count is incremented, otherwise it is inserted with a count of 1 When the size of the set  becomes larger than  assumes that a sequence is comprised of el ements  i.e itemset mining each trans action has a

element in a sequence A majority element is an element that appears more than half the time in an entire sequence We find two distinct elements and eliminate them from the sequence We repeat this process until only one distinct element remains in the sequence If a majority element exists in the sequence it will be left after this elimination At the same time any element remaining in the sequence is not necessarily the majority element We can take another pass over the original sequence and check if the frequency of the remaining element is greater than  0 of Potentially  P  U P  if

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
