However it was considered as a method of saving time with more storage spaces It is put forward in this paper that all frequent item sets of several minimal supports can be stored in a table with a little additional storage and a representation model is given Based on this model the paper systematically discusses the problem of incrementally updating based on discovered association rules of several minimal supports Theoretical analysis shows that the approach makes full use of the previous results and reduces the complexity of incremental updating algorithms I INTRODUCTION Mining association rules is 
a very important issue in knowledge discovery in databases KDD proposed originally by Agrawal 1 2 which mines potentially useful association rules from transaction database Apriori the classical algorithm proposed by Agrawal must scan the transaction database for many times Due to the transaction database is usually very huge D W Cheung et al proposed the incrementally updating algorithm to reduce the times of scanning the database 3 Hereafter many researchers have studied and extended the incrementally updating algorithms 4-9 It is widely accepted that incrementally updating based on multiple previously mined results can dramatically reduce 
the times of scanning the original transaction database However it is also regarded as a method of saving time by increasing storage spaces 9 We suggest in the paper that a little additional storage can store frequent item sets of several minimal supports and present a representation model Based on this we systematically study the problem of incrementally updating association rules according to several previously mined results Theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that the method presented in this paper utility the previous results to a great extent The paper is organized as follows In Section 2 
we briefly introduce some concepts and notations of association rules mining Section 3 presents the frequent item sets representation model of several minimal supports Section 4 studies the incrementally updating algorithms based on several previous mining results The time and space efficiency of the algorithms are analysed in section 5 The conclusions are drawn in section 6 II NOTATIONS OF ASSOCIATION RULES MINING Let I il  i2 9 9,m  denote the set of all of the items An item set is a non-empty subset of 1 DB is a transaction database of I A transaction T is a 
subset of I Association rule is an implication of the form X  Y where X c I Y c  and X r Y  DP Support number of item set X is the length of the set T X c T T c DB  denoted by X.count The support degree of item set X is denoted by support\(X X.count/IDBI where IDBI denotes the number of the transactions in the database The support degree of item X U Y is called as the support degree of association rule X  Y  The confidence degree of association rule X 
 Y is conf X  Y   X U Y  X To mine the potentially useful association rules two important thresholds are given minimal support degree denoted by s and minimal confidence degree denoted by c X is called as frequent item set if and only if support\(X  s The key issue in association rules mining is to find all frequent item sets in the transaction database efficiently Frequent item sets relate to transaction database DB and minimal support s In this paper we use L\(s DB to denote the set of all the 
frequent item sets of DB with the minimal support s i.e L\(s,DB X X C I and support\(X Let X.countDB be the support number of item set X in DB A frequent item set with k items is called as frequent k-item Lemma 1 if s<s then L\(S DB C L\(S,DB Proof Vc E L\(S DB  3 c c I and support\(X s s i.e c

mum support decreases, and long rules are more likely to be excluded by the informative rule set than short rules There is little difference in size between an association rule set and a non-redundant rule set So in the following comparisons we only compare the informative rule set with the associa tion rule set Now we will compare generating efficiency of the in formative rule set and the association rule set We imple mented Apriori on the same data structure as the proposed algorithm and generated only single target association rules Our experiments were conducted on a Sun server with two 200 MHz UltraSPARC CPUs I iln Figure 3 Generating time for different rule sets The generating time for association rule sets and infor mative rule sets is listed in the Figure 3 We can see that mining an informative rule set is more efficient than mining a single target association rule set This is because the in formative rule miner does not generate all frequent itemsets and does not test all items as targets in a frequent itemset The improvement of efficiency becomes more evident when the minimum support decreases This is consistent with the deduction of rules being excluded from an association rule set as shown in Figure 2 I L I i 33 Figure 4 The number of times for scanning the database Further, the number of times of scanning a database for generating an informative rule set is smaller than that for an association rule set as showed in Figure 4 This is because the proposed algorithm avoids generating many long fre quent itemsets that contain no rules included in an informa tive rule set. From the results we also know that long rules are easier to be excluded by an informative rule set than short rules Clearly this number is significantly smaller than the number of different antecedents in the generated rule set which are needed to scan a database in aother direct algorithm To better understand of improvement of efficiency of the algorithm for mining the informative rule set over that for the association rule set we list the number of nodes in a candidate tree for both rule sets in Figure 5 They are all frequent itemsets for the association rule set and partial frequent itemsets searched by mining the informative rule set We can see that in mining the informative rule set, the searched itemsets is less than all frequent itemsets for form ing association rules So this is the reason for efficiency im provement and reduction in number of scanning a database 7 Conclusions We have defined a new informative, rule set that gener ates prediction sequences equal to those generated by the association rule set by the confidence priority The infor mative rule set is significantly smaller than the association rule set especially when the minimum support is small We have studied the upward closed properties of informative rule set for omission of unnecessary rules from the set and presented a direct algorithm to efficiently mine the informa tive rule set without generating all frequent itemsets first 367

constrained frequent itemset search are NP-hard and they are at least P-hard meaning t hey will remain intractable even if P=NP This work gives evidence it is not a good idea to mine all frequent itemsets above a support threshold since the output size is combinatorial In 13 t h e a ut hors d eri v e a bound on the number of candidate itemsets given the current set of frequent itemsets when using a level-wise algorithm Covers and bases 37 21 a re an alternati v e t o s ummarize association rules using a comb inatorial approach instead of a model Clusters have some resemblance to bases in the sense that each cluster can be used to derive all subsets from a maximal itemset The model represents an approximate cover for all potential associations We now discuss closely related work on establishing relationships between association rules and other data mining techniques Preliminary results on using clusters to get lower and upper bounds for support is given in 27  I n g eneral there is a tradeoff between rules with high support and rules with high conÞdence 33 t h i s w o rk propos es an al gorithm that mines the best rules under a Bayesian model There has been work on clustering transactions from itemsets 41  H o w e v er  t hi s a pproach goes i n t he oppos i t e di rection it rst mines associations and from them tries to get clusters Clustering association rules rather than transactions once they are mined is analyzed in 22  T he out put is a summary of association rules The approach is different from ours since this proposal works with the original data set whereas ours produces a model of the data set In 42 the idea of mining frequent itemsets with error tolerance is introduced This approach is related to ours since the error is somewhat similar to the bounds we propose Their algorithm can be used as a means to cluster transactions or perform estimation of query selectivity In 39 t he aut hors explore the idea of building approximate models for associations to see how they change over time 6 Conclusions This article proposed to use clusters on binary data sets to bound and estimate association rule support and conÞdence The sufÞcient statistics for clustering binary data are simpler than those required for numeric data sets and consist only of the sum of binary points transactions Each cluster represents a long itemset from which shorter itemsets can be easily derived The clustering model on high dimensional binary data sets is computed with efÞcient operations on sparse matrices skipping zeroes We rst presented lower and upper bounds on support whose average estimates actual support Model-based support metrics obey the well-known downward closure property Experiments measured accuracy focusing on relative error in support estimations and efÞciency with real and synthetic data sets A clustering model is accurate to estimate support when using a sufÞciently high number of clusters When the number of clusters increases accuracy increases On the other hand as the minimum support threshold decreases accuracy also decreases but at a different rate depending on the data set The error on support estimation slowly increases as itemset length increases The model is fairly accurate to discover a large set of frequent itemsets at multiple support levels Clustering is faster than A-priori to mine frequent itemsets without considering the time to compute the model Adding the time to compute the model clustering is slower than Apriori at high support levels but faster at low support levels The clustering model can be built in linear time on data size Sparse matrix operations enable fast computation with high dimensional transaction data sets There exist important research issues We want to analytically understand the relationship between the clustering model and the error on support estimation We need to determine an optimal number of clusters given a maximum error level Correlation analysis and PCA represent a next step after the clustering model but the challenges are updating much larger matrices and dealing with numerical issues We plan to incorporate constraints based on domain knowledge into the search process Our algorithm can be optimized to discover and periodically refresh a set of association rules on streaming data sets References 1 C  A ggar w al and P  Y u F

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
