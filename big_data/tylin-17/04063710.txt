E-mail: hfli@csie.nctu.edu.t w Abstract  Online mining of closed frequent itemsets over stre aming data is one of the most important issues in mining data streams In this paper we propose an efficient one 
pass algorithm, NewMoment to maintain the set of closed frequent itemsets in data streams with a transaction-sensiti ve sliding window. An effective bit-sequence representation of items is used in the proposed algorithm to reduce the time a nd memory needed to slide the windows. Experiments sho w that the proposed algorithm not only attain highly accur ate mining results but also run significant faster and  consume less memory than existing algorithm Moment for mini ng closed frequent itemsets over recent data streams  1. Introduction Online mining of data streams is one of the most in teresting research issues of data mining in recent years Dat 
a streams have the unique characteristics as described below 3, 8, 10   1\ Unbounded size of input data; \(2\ Usage of main memory is limited; \(3\ Input data can only be handled once 4\ Fast arrival rate; \(5\ System can not control the order data arrives 6 Analytical results generated by algorithms shou ld be instantly available when users request 7 Errors of analytical results should be bounded in a range tha t users can tolerate Many previous studies contributed to the efficient mining of frequent patterns in streaming data [4, 5, 6, 7 11, 12, 13 14 15 16 17 18 19   A c c o r d i n g  t o  t h e  s t r e a m  p r ocessing model 20   t h e  r e s e a r c h  o f  m i n i n g  f r e q u e n t  p a t t e r n

frequent closed itemsets  FCI from online  data streams with a transaction sensitive sliding  window A summary data structure called CET Close d Enumeration Tree is used in the Moment algorithm to maintain a dynamically selected set of itemsets ove r a transaction-sensitive sliding window. These selecte d itemsets consist of closed frequent itemsets and a boundary between the closed frequent itemsets and the rest of the it emsets. CET can cover all necessary information because any sta tus changes of itemsets \(e.g. from infrequent to freque nt or from frequent to infrequent\ must be through the boundar y in CET Whenever a sliding occurs it updates the counts of 
 the related nodes in CET and modifies CET Experiments of Moment show that the boundary in CET is stable so t he update cost is little However Moment must maintai n huge CET nodes for a closed frequent itemset The ratio of CET nodes and closed frequent itemsets is about 30:1. I f there are a large number of closed frequent itemsets the mem ory usage of Moment will be inefficient The purpose of this work is on closed frequent item sets mining over online data streams with a transactionsensitive sliding window. An efficient algorithm, called NewM oment is proposed to mine the set of closed frequent item sets over online data streams with a transaction-sensitive sl 
iding window Experiments show that the proposed NewMomen t algorithm not only attains highly accurate mining r esults, but also runs significantly faster and consumes less me mory than Moment algorithm 6  f o r  m i n i n g  c l o s e d  f r e q u e n t  i t e msets over the most recent w transactions of a data strea m  The remainder of the paper is organized as follow s The problem is defined in Section 2 Section 3 presents  the proposed NewMoment algorithm. Experiments are discu ssed in Section 4. Finally, we conclude this work in Sec tion 5  2. Problem Definition Let Y  i 1  i 2 205 i 
m be a set of items A transaction  T   TID  x 1 x 2 001 x n  x i  316  Y for 1 243  i  243  n is a set of items, while n is called the size of the transaction, and TID is the unique identifier of the transaction. An itemset is a non-empty set of items An itemset with size k  is called a k-itemset  A 


transaction data stream  TDS   T 1  T 2  205 T N  is a continuous sequence of transactions where N  is the TID of latest incoming transaction T N  A transaction-sensitive window   TransSW  in the transaction data stream is a window that slides for ward for every transaction The window at each slide has a f ixed number w  of transactions and w  is called the size  of the window. Hence, the current transaction-sensitive window  is TransSW N 001 w+1  T N w 1  T N w 2 205 T N    w h e r e  N w 1 is the window id of current TransSW The support of an itemset X  over TransSW  denoted as sup  X  is the number of transactions in TransSW containing X as a subset   Definition 1 Frequent itemset An itemset X  is called a frequent itemset   FI  if sup  X  263  s 327 w  where s  is a userdefined minimum support threshold \(MST\ in the rang e of [0 1   T h e  v a l u e  s 327 w  is called the frequent threshold   FT  of TransSW  Definition 2 Closed frequent itemset  An itemset X  is a closed frequent itemset  if there exists no itemset X\222  such that \(1 X\222 is a proper superset of X and \(2\ every transaction containing X also contains X\222  Figure 1 is an example of transaction-sensitive  window used in this paper. In Figure 1, the size of the sl iding window is 4. The first transaction-sensitive widow TransSW 1 consists of the transactions from T 1 to T 4 When the transaction with T 5  comes the transaction-sensitive window eliminates  the oldest transaction \(T 1 from the current window and appends the incoming transaction \(T 5 The second window TransSW 2  is the result after the first time of window slidin g   A transaction data stream is formed by transactions arriving in series Figure 1. Example Transaction-Sensitive Window   3. The NewMoment Algorithm In this section we introduce the proposed NewMomen t algorithm. A bit-vector based representation of ite ms is used in the NewMoment algorithm to reduce the time and m emory needed to slide the windows. A new summary data str ucture NewCET 1 based on a prefix tree structure is developed to maintain the essential information of closed freque nt itemsets in the recent w transaction of a data stream      1  New C losed E numeration T ree  3.1. Bit-Vector Representation of Items In the NewMoment algorithm, for each item X in the current TransSW  a bit-sequence  with w  bits denoted as Bit  X  is constructed. If an item X is in the i th transaction of current TransSW the i th bit of Bit  X is set to be 1; otherwise, it is set to be 0 For example in Figure 1 the first window TransSW 1  consists of four transactions T 1  abc  T 2  bcd  T 3   abc   and  T 4   bc   but the second window TransSW 2  consists of transactions T 2  bcd  T 3  abc  T 4  bc  and T 5  bd Because item a appears in the 1st and 3rd transactions of TransSW 1  the bit-sequence of a  Bit  a  is 1010 Similarly Bit  b   111 Bit  c   1111 and Bit  d   0100. The most left bit of a bit sequence represent s the oldest transaction in current window and the most right bi t represents the newest transaction   3.2 Window Sliding Using Bit-Sequences The bit-sequence is efficient in window sliding pro cess. The sliding process consists of two steps delete the o ldest transaction and append the incoming transaction  3.2.1 Delete the Oldest Transaction In this step the bit-sequences of items are used t o left-shift one bit to delete the oldest transaction For examp le in Figure 1 the bit sequence of item a  Bit  a  is 1010 in the first window TransSW 1  If transaction T 1  is deleted from TransSW 1  Bit a becomes 0100 Now the most left bit represents the transaction T 2  The most right bit is meaningless and is conserved for next step  3.2.2 Append the Incoming Transaction After deleting the oldest transaction from current transactionsensitive window we set the most right bit of each  bitsequence of items by checking the new incoming tran saction T N We set the most right bit of the bit-sequence of item X to 1 if T N contains X as a subset. Otherwise, we set the bit to 0 For example in Figure 1 the bit-sequence of i tem a  Bit  a  becomes 0100 after deleting the expired transact ion T 1  Because the incoming transaction T 5  does not contain item a  we set the most right bit of Bit  a  to 0 i.e Bit  a  changes form 1010 to 0100 Similarly Bit  c  changes from 1111 to 1110 and Bit  d changes from 0100 to 1001  3.3 Counting Support using Bit-Sequences The concept of bit-sequence of item can be extended  to itemset For example in Figure 1 the bit-sequence  of 2itemset ab  Bit  ab  in the TransSW 1  is 1010 That means transactions T 1 and T 3 of TransSW 1 contain the itemset ab  The process of counting support of an itemset i s described as follows. Assume that there are two k itemsets X and Y and their corresponding bit-sequences Bit  X and Bit  Y The bitsequence of the k 1\-itemset Z  X   001 Y can be obtained by the bitwise AND of Bit  X   and Bit  Y For example, the bitsequence of 2-itemset ab  Bit  ab  in the first window TransSW 1  is 1010 which can be obtained by bitwise AND the bit-sequences of items a and b where Bit  a 1010 and c d  T 6  b d  T 5  b c  T 4   a b c T 3   b c d  T 2   a b c T 1  Transaction  TID                   Window size w 4  TransSW 1  TransSW 2  TransSW 3        


Bit  b 1111  3.4 Building the NewCET The proposed summary data structure, called NewCET New  C losed E numeration T ree is an extended prefix tree structure. NewCET consists of three parts 1  The bit-sequences of all 1-itemsets in the current transaction-sensitive window TransSW NN 001 w 1  2  A set of closed frequent itemsets in TransSW NN 001 w 1   3  A hash table For checking whether a frequent itemset is closed or not we use a hash table to store all clo sed frequent itemsets with their supports as keys Similar to a prefix tree each node n I  in the NewCET represents an itemset I  A child node n J  is obtained by adding a new item to I But, NewCET only maintains a set of closed frequent itemsets, not all itemsets Figure 2 gives the algorithm of building NewCET In the building algorithm, each n I has a corresponding bit-sequence Bit  I to store the support information in the current sliding window Function Build  is a depth-first procedure Build  visits the itemsets of the current NewCET in a lexicographical order. Function leftcheck uses the support of n I as a hash key to speed up the checking Figure 3 shows the NewCET in the first transactionsensitive window TransSW 1  when Build  is done The tree nodes with shadow are closed frequent itemsets For  simplicity, the hash table is not displayed in this figure  Build  n I N, s  1 if support n I  001  s  002  N  then  2 if leftcheck n I false then  3 foreach frequent sibling n K of n I  do  4:                generate a new child n I K 001 for n I  5:                bitwise AND Bit  I and Bit  K to obtain Bit  I  001 K  6 foreach child n I 001 of n I  do  7:                Build n I 001  N  001  8 if a child n I 001 of n I such that support n I 001 support n I  then  9:                retain n I as a closed frequent itemset 10:              insert n I into the hash table Figure 2. Algorithm of building NewCET  3.5 Deleting the Oldest Transaction Deleting the oldest transaction is the first step o f window sliding First of all all bit-sequences of 1-items ets are leftshifted one bit. Then, all items in the deleted tra nsaction are kept. The process can be done by observing the most left bit before the left-shifting Figure 4 gives the algorithm of deleting the ol dest transaction after left-shifting all the bit-sequenc es of 1itemsets In the Figure 4 the function Delete  generates the prefix tree including the itemsets whose supports a re s 002 N 226 1 This is because the supports of a set of closed fre quent itemsets in previous window would be s 002 N and then becomes s 002 N 226 1 after the deletion Function Delete  is a depth-first procedure When the recursive calls of n I 222s children return Delete is performed, if n I  is a closed frequent itemset the NewCET is mainta ined and the hash table is updated. In the lines 19 and 23, if n I is closed frequent itemset in previous window n I is marked as a non-closed itemset. In this case n I will not be retained when the function Delete  is done 002 003 igure 5 shows the NewCET after deleting the oldest transaction T 1  306 a\: <1010 b\: <1111               c\: <1111 d\: <0100             a, b, c\: 2           b, c\: 4  Figure 3.

3.6 Appending a New Incoming Transaction Appending the incoming transaction is the second st ep of window sliding All the bit-sequences of 1-itemsets  are set their most right bit to 1 or 0 based on the incomin g transaction T N We set the most right bit of the bit-sequence of itemset X to 1 if T N contains X as a subset. Otherwise, we set the bit to 0  Append  n I N, s  1 if support\(n I  001 s 002 N  then 2 if leftcheck n I false then  3 foreach frequent sibling n K of n I  do  4:            generate a new child n I K 001 for n I  5 002\002\002 bitwise AND Bit  I and Bit  K to obtain Bit  I 001 K  6 foreach child n I 001 of n I  do  7:                Append n I 001  N  s  8 if a child n I 001 of n I such that support n I 001 support n I  then  9 if  n I  is closed frequent itemset in previous sliding window then  10:                  update the support of n I   11:                  update n I in the hash table 12 else  13:                   retain n I as a closed frequent itemset 14:                   insert n I into the hash table Figure 6.

We c an observe that memory used by Moment is more than 120 MB but used by NewMoment is about 15MB When the minimum support is down to 0.05 the memory used b y NewMoment is just 50MB but memory of Moment is out of bound \(more than 512MB Figure 9 shows the loading time the first window I n the first window, both NewMoment and Moment need to bui ld a prefix \(lexicographic\ tree. We can observe that Ne wMoment is a little faster than Moment The reason is that generating candidates and counting their supports with bit-seq uences is more efficient than with an independent sliding win dow in 027\002\013\002\003\030\003\005\031\030\032\032\006\020\r\005\033\034\035 001 002 003 004 002 003 005 002 003 006 002 003 007 


MomentFP, a FP-tree [6  i s  u s e d    Figure 10 shows the average time of window slid ing In the experiment NewMoment is a little slower than M oment because NewMoment do not use TID sum as another key to speed up left-check step But we can observe that t he difference is about 0.02 seconds The steps of wind ow sliding can be finished in one second for both algo rithms and the difference is meaningless We also test NewMoment with different window si ze and different number of items. NewMoment is still more efficient than MomentFP in executing time and memory usage Because of the space limit, we do not list these ex periments in the paper  5. Conclusions In this paper we propose an efficient single-pass algorithm NewMoment to mine the set of closed frequent itemse ts over data streams with a transaction-sensitive sliding w indow In New-Moment algorithm an effective bit-sequence representation is developed to reduce the memory requirement of the online maintenance of closed fre quent itemsets generated so far  References 1  R   A g r a w a l   T   I m i e l i n s k i   a n d  A   S w a m i   M i n i n g  Association Rules between Sets of Items in Large Databases In Proceedings of the 1993 International  Conference on Management of Data, pp. 207-216, 1993  2  R   A g r a w a l  a n d  R   S r i k a n t   F a s t  A l g o r i t h m s  f o r  Mining Association Rules In Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases pp 487-499, 1994 3  B   B a b c o c k   S   B a b u   M   D a t a r   R   M o t w a n i   a n d  J Widom.

sketches is far more pronounced MSE is on average 48.9 higher with HC than CM with relative size of 50 and the difference between CM and CS is on average 69.26 for the same size In both cases any relationship between the difference and the number of items is doubtful  r  0  5  For MRE CS again has the lowest error but this time HC is similar to CM with a relative size of 100 and outperforms it when the size is 50 The errors are extremely high when compared to the Gaussian distribution with the smallest error being 78.55 and the largest 650.23 MRE is invariant with the number of items for CS  p  0  16  but is larger for smaller sizes For CM the error increases with the number of items  r  0  968  p  2  98 e  5  the same relationship appears for HC  r 0  913  p 0  0016  When it comes to the entropy estimation however while CS continues to outperform CM HC has comparable error to CS In fact HC averages a 28.5 smaller error than the best case of CS Unlike with the other distributions the error in entropy estimation actually increases with the number of items for CM but for CS the relationship is doubtful with statistical signi“cant for one size 75 but not the others With a xed relative size of 50 and varying skew the picture is slightly complex For MSE Fig.6\(a the skew has a large impact on the error with larger skews producing much smaller errors In all cases HC performs similarly to CM with CS having the lowest error For MRE Fig 6\(b the dependence on skew is still very evident but the order of performance changes With low skew CS has the smallest error followed by HC then CM but as the skew increases CS performs increasingly badly relative to CM and HC When the skew is 2.5 CM and CS have similar performance and HC is the best performing When the skew increases to 3 CS now has the largest error followed by CM and then HC The story for the entropy estimation Fig 6\(c is different again It remains the case that as the skew increases the errors decrease but this time HC always has the smallest error followed by CS and then CM When the skew is 2 the errors for the sketches increase with the number of items  p  0  0038  but when the skew is 3 the errors fall as there are more items  p 0  0008  for CM but there is no statistical signi“cance to the relationship for CS  p 0  659  At low skew the average error for CM is 42.92 11.81 for CS and 6.07 for HC When the skew is high the averages become 3.25 0.27 and 0.23 for CM CS and HC respectively D Orders of Magnitude The results for the uniform distribution Fig 7\(a show that CS has the largest errors followed by CM with HC having no errors at all The errors for                  a MSE                 b MRE                 c Entropy Fig 5 Performance of CM CS and HC for a synthetic Zip“an distribution with skew=2 relative size shown in brackets CM are virtually zero for all magnitudes with the average across all data set sizes being just 0.22 with a relative size of 1 In comparison the average error for CS is 10.15 for the same size and is a signi“cant 5.88 when no memory savings are being made A similar pattern is seen for the Gaussian distribution in Fig 7\(b Again HC has no error and the error for CM is an average of 0.22 even with just 1 relative size CS has slightly higher errors with the Gaussian distribution compared to a uniform one at 10.87 for 1 relative size and 6.12 for 100 relative size Things change dramatically in the Zip“an distribution shown in Fig 7\(c Here CM has the largest error averaging between 7.94 with 100 size and 8.90 84

item was seen If the true frequency is high then the discrepancy can become very large This cannot happen with CM The results for the Gaussian distribution are very similar to those of the uniform distribution but the errors are a little larger This is because the true frequencies in the Gaussian distribution do not vary by very large amounts Increasing the standard deviation lowers the errors because the frequencies become even more similar With the Zip“an distribution however the frequencies are scale-free That is there are very large differences in the true frequencies with a small number of items appearing a very large number of times and most items appearing only once For these distributions CM has the largest error because the heavy hitters can have a very large impact on a large number of items This is particularly true as the sketches become smaller and it is harder to avoid collisions with the most frequent items On the other hand CS can detect when an item has collided with a heavy hitter because its frequency is estimated as a negative number When this happens the frequency used is just one which is likely to be close to the true count for a non-heavyhitter CS therefore only needs to avoid heavy-hitters colliding with other heavy-hitters too often which is easier to do Although some measures have been used in this paper to examine the performance of sketches for probability estimation they are not objective The best that can be hoped for is to compare one or more estimators and consider their performance relative to each other but there can be no objective method of declaring an estimator to be good enough The question of whether an estimator is good enough depends entirely on what it will be used for We have therefore provided a straightforward estimator HC for comparison which we hope places the performance of the sketches into some context but we remain cautious about drawing strong conclusions from these results VII C ONCLUSION In this paper we have considered the use of sketches for estimating the probability of all items in very large data sets The sketches are memory-ef“cient data structures designed for identifying and estimating the frequency of so-called heavy-hitters They are however in theory capable of estimating the frequency of all items To the best of our knowledge this is the rst attempt to examine their applicability to this problem In order to gain some understanding of the performance of the sketches we considered three metrics mean square error mean relative error and the error in entropy estimation Our results show that for uniform and Gaussian distributions the CM sketch performs very well even with very small sketch sizes whereas CS performs less well estimating the entropy incorrectly by an average of over 10 For Zip“an distributions however it is CS that performs best with increasingly better performance as the data set becomes more skewed The measures we have used are not objective and inherently it is impossible to declare an estimator good enough without reference to a speci“c task Thus the results in this paper are illustrative and suggestive only Additionally we considered only pure distributions which may not be re”ected in real data In particular data may be mixtures of different distributions We do conclude however that the sketches produce estimates with smaller errors than might seem likely from their construction which suggests that for some applications at least sketches need not be restricted only to the problem of nding the most frequent items In the future we would like to examine how the sketches perform with real data sets and whether even small errors as seen in the entropy estimations might affect the ranking of items for feature

on the number of lters the total cost is dominated by the candidate ltering cost which explains the latter increase Among all of the tested cases the total cost is the smallest when f is 3  conÞrming our derivation in Section IV-D C Effect of Data Skewness We conduct experiments to evaluate the effect of data skewness on the performance of netFilter Figure 7\(a and b show the results under different 003 values data skewness with n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We adopt the optimal setting for netFilter obtained from similar experiments as in the above two subsections the lter size is set to 100 and the number of lters is set to 3 and 5 under n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We include the communication cost incurred by the naive approach for comparison For readability the y-axis is on log scale From these gures we can see that the cost incurred by netFilter is much smaller than that incurred by the naive approach For instance with n as 10 6 thecost incurred by netFilter is only 2  5 of that incurred by the naive approach In addition the cost incurred by both netFilter and the naive approach decreases with the data skewness For netFilter this is explained by the improved ltering performance under very skewed data For the naive approach as the data skewness increases the average number of distinct items that a peer propagates along the hierarchy is reduced resulting in reduced communication cost 1000 10000 100000 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness 001  netFilter  naive  1000 10000 100000 1e+06 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness

Figure 8 shows the results with 002 set to 0  1  0  01 and 0  001  Again we adopt the optimal setting for netFilter the size of lter and number of lters are set to 10 6 under 002  0.1 100 5 under 002  0.01 and 1000 2 under 002 0  001  From this gure we can see when the threshold ratio incr eases the communication cost decreases This is as expected since larger threshold implies less number of items satisÞes the threshold condition VI C ONCLUSION The need of identifying frequent items IFI appears in a variety of P2P applications In this study we investigate the problem of IFI in unstructured P2P

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con“gurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con“gure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef“ciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/˜manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
