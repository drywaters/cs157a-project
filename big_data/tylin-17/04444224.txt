A Single Pass Algorithm of Finding Frequent Vibrated Items over Online Data Streams   Guanling Lee and Qiao-Tzu Chen  Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering National Dong Hwa University, Hualien, Taiwan, R.O.C guanling@mail.ndhu.edu.tw  Abstract  Data streams are data items generated unbounded and continuously. To detect the vibration of data item\222s quantity  a single pass algorithm is proposed for mining vibrated items over online data streams in this paper. The change of data item can be reported at once by measuring its vibrated slope Not only the change of data item will be detected the period in which the data item is frequent vibrated is also reported. Moreover, a set of simulations is performed to show the benefit of our approach  1. INTRODUCTION  In recent years, researches on mining data stream have attracted much interest. There are numerous research problems in this topic, such as mining frequent patterns over data steam, streaming data modeling and fining interesting events on data streams. In order to adapt to the strict environment some category of frequency estimating approaches in mining frequent item develop gradually: sample based and hash based. In the sample base approach several amounts of counters are used for tracking the number of item occurs in the stream [5   6     1   I n  the hash base approach, a list of counters of item is stored in hash table, and some items may share with the same counter [2   3     The goal of our research is to monitor and detect variation of items between two data streams In real application, the managers of super market may concert the situation of stocking and selling goods. And they may ask \223which good is insufficient now and needed to be stocked?\224 or \223which good is overage and needed to stop stocking?\224 to control the goods for getting the great benefit. Managers can solve these questions by observing the difference of good\222s number between the streams of storage and sales volume To our best knowledge, [4 i s  t h e on l y research related to our approach. In the approach MFC-append is proposed for online mining frequent frequency change item in two continuous append-only data streams. However, in this approach, the change of entry\222s frequency can not be detected and reported instantly. Moreover, some vibrated frequency change items may not be reported by the algorithm. The detail discussions will be presented in the following section  In this paper, we propose a new approach to discover vibrated item effectively and efficiently over two data streams. In order to overcome the 


  problems described above, slope of itemís change support count between two window fragments is introduced for measuring the vibration degree of the items and to avoid the situation of ignoring the meaningful vibrated items. Moreover, the vibration of itemís count can be found and output immediately In our approach, not only the vibrated items at current time point but also the longest or newest time period where the item is frequent vibrated can be shown to the users   The rest of this paper is organized as follows In Section 2, the framework of our approach is introduced. The solution method is proposed in Section 3. The result of performance is present in Section 4. And we conclude our work in Section 5  2. PRELIMINARIES   A data stream is a sequence with consecutive and boundless data items entrance. In order to separate the old data from the recently one in the data streams, window base model is used in this study. A data is regarded as an old one after a window time passing since the data item arrival at stream. The size of the window is n time units where n is specified by users. The change support count of an item is the difference of its frequency between two data streams  4 pr e s e n t s t h e a p pr oa c h of i d e n t i f y i n g  vibrated frequency change items A data item is a vibrated frequency change item if its change rate are more than a user-specified thresholds minimum change rate over a time period. The change rate of an item is the number of frequency vibration divided by total time points observed in a time period, where frequency vibration is defined as the sign of change support count changes from positive to negative or contrariwise, as Figure 1 \(a\ indicates  Figure 1  An example of vibrated frequency change pattern  According to the definition and algorithm proposed in [4  t h e v a r i a tio n o f ite m s c h a n g e  support count may not be detected and reported instantly. It is because in the algorithm, the frequency of the item is accumulated continuously Moreover, some important vibrated frequency change items may be ignored in the approach. If the difference of one patternís change support count between two consecutive windows is very large but both of them are positive, negative, or less than the thresholds in positive and negative side but close to them, it will not be found. For example, the pattern shown in Figure 1 \(b\ \(c\ will not be found Obviously, these data are very important since the   Change support count Time  Approximation error   Time  Change support count 0 0   Chan g e support count Time  0  a b c 


  change amount of the change support count for the data is large In our approach, the problems of finding vibrated item and frequent vibrated item are addressed. For averting from the problems explained above, we change the approach of calculating the frequency of data item. By using decay, the influence of old data in the change support count is reduced as time goes by and it will become overdue and be pruned if it exceeds a time-span. The length of the time-span is set according to the type of the data item. For example, milk has shorter sell-by date than bread, therefore, the time-span of milk will be set shorter than bread. In this paper, we set the length of time-span of all data item is one window time. Furthermore, a new parameter vibrated slope  is introduced for measuring the vibration degree of the item. The vibrated slope of one data item is the absolute value of difference of change support counts between this window fragment and the preceding one divided by window size n And a data item is considered as a  vibrated item at the moment if its vibrated slope is no smaller than minimum vibrated slope  In our approach, not only the sudden variation of each itemís quantity will be detected in real time but also the long term situation of vibrated items will be monitored. A data item is identified as a frequent vibrated item during a time period, if its vibrated support is no less than minimum vibrated support where the vibrated support of an item is the ratio of the number of times the item identified as a vibrated item to the number of windows observed in the time period, and the corresponding time period is identified as a frequent vibrated period Here, we refer the time period as a sequence of continuous windows and the length of the time period is the number of windows in this period  Minimum vibrated support is specified by user, denoted as   3. PROPOSED METHOD   3.1 Mining vibrated item\(MVI  In order to accurately and effectively represent the most recent vibrated items over data streams, we break the streams into fixed size with no overlapping windows w 1  w 2  w i where w i is the latest window in the stream. For each incoming window w i we update the change support count of data item occur in the streams within current window w i When window w i terminates, the vibrated slope between w i and  w i-1 for each item is computed. To detect the variation of itemís change support count, the vibrated slope of all data items appear in the streams will be computed and compared with minimum vibrated slope. The data items whose vibrated slopes exceed the threshold will be output as vibrated items. After comparison the change support count of pr eceding window is set to the change support count of current window. And the change support count of current window is reset By repeating the steps described above, the vibrated items of each window are reported   3.2 Mining frequent vibrated item  MVI is used to report the vibrated items of each window. However, users may concert during which period an item is frequently vibrated, i.e. the frequent vibrated period of the item. Therefore, the mining frequent vibrated item \(MFVI\lgorithm is proposed In MFVI, we establish a track list, denoted as Track_list to record the vibrated items. We also retain two information start point and count for the 


  items in the list. The start point is set to the first time the item recognized as a vibrated item. In the following, how to identify the frequent vibrated period of each item is discussed  For each vibrated item output by MVI in current window, we will seek whether the item is in the Track_list If the look up failed, we insert the item into Track_list set its start point as the current window time and set count as \(1 where is the minimum vibrated support. Otherwise, the count of the item is increased by \(1 Moreover, the count of the item which is in the Track_list and not identified as a vibrated item in current window is decreased by After the computation, if the count of the item is no smaller than zero, the item is reported as a frequent vibrated item and its corresponding frequent vibrated period is the periods from the start point to the current window time Theorem 1 The item and its corresponding period cp, reported by MFVI is a frequent vibrated item in cp  Proof Assume g is an item in Track_list According to MFVI algorithm, if g is identified as a vibrated item in a window, the count of g is increased by 1  otherwise, decreased by Assume g is output as a frequent vibrated item and the length of the corresponding period is m. Without loss of generality, we assume that g is identified as a vibrated item x times during the period, we get   x 1   m x   0     x x   m   x  0   x  m  0    m x      Algorithm MFVI Input All data item in stream A and B  Output Frequent vibrated items with frequent vibrated time period  for each window w i in data stream A and B  do   for all items do  if item g is a vibrated item then   if  g is not in Track_list  then  add to Track_list   g.time set as window number now  g.count 1   if g.count 0 then  Output item g from g.time to now is frequent vibrated item  else   if  g is in Track_list then  g.count   if  g.count 0 then   Prune g form Track_list    Figure 2 MFVI algorithm   4. EXPERIMERNTAL RESULTS  The synthetic data is generated by sine function. Each data item has different frequencies in a time unit mixed with sine waves and noise Maximum frequency of an item in one second is 1000. A window size is 12 seconds. Table 1 shows the value of parameters used in our experiments  Table 1 Parameter setting in simulation  Parameter Range value Default value Number of item 1000 ~ 30000 10000 Minimum vibrated slope 400 ~ 1600 1200 Minimum vibrated support 0.2 ~ 0.8 0.6 Figure 3 shows the relation between minimum vibrated slope and the number of vibrated items. As 


  shown in the result, the larger the minimum vibrated slope is, the fewer number of vibrated items are found The relation between the minimum vibrated support and the length of frequent vibrated periods is shown in Figure 4. As shown in the result, the smaller the value of  is, the more the long frequent vibrated periods can be mined. The comparison of our work, MVI, and the method proposed in [4 s s h ow n i n F i g u r e 5 a n d F i g u r e 6 In  order to compare these two approaches, we set the range of the approximation error support between positive and negative sign is the same as the range of vibrated slope multiplied by window size Therefore, the approximation error support and minimum changed rate in the simulation of [4  is s e t as 0.3 and 0.6. Figure 5 shows the execution time of the two approaches. According to the result, MVI performs better than the method proposed in [4  Moreover, the number of vibrated items reported by our algorithm and [4  ar e co m p ar ed in f i g u r e 6   A s  show in the result, our approach detects more vibrated items than the approach in [4             Figure 3 Number of vibrated items w.r.t. minimum vibrated slope          Figure 4 Number of frequent vibrated periods w.r.t minimum vibrated support                 Figure 5 Execution time               Figure 6 Number of vibrated items   5. CONCLUSIONS   In this paper, two novel algorithms MVI and MFVI are proposed for mining vibrated and frequent vibrated items over two data streams Differ to previous works on mining vibrated item we use vibration slope to estimate the vibration degree of the item. Therefore, through our approach the vibration of itemsí change support count can be detected accurately and reported immediately. In MFVI, we keep tracing the change of vibrated items and output their corresponding periods in which they are frequent vibrated. The periods found by our approach have the guarantee that the ratio of the number of times the item identified as a vibrated item to the length in the period is no smaller than the minimum vibrated support. And our algorithm of mining frequent vibrated period also provides a factor for choosing long term or recently vibrated period   References  1  H  C h a n g a n d W  S  L e e   F i n d i n g re c e n t fr e q u e n t  itemsets adaptively over online data streamsî, in Proc ACM SIGKDD 2003, PP. 487-492

second This is 13–26 times slower than the processing speed on the GPU To compare against a parallel implementation we did 8 simultaneous runs using 8 cores which took 15.66 seconds Since the time did not grow noticeably we conclude that the computation does not yet have a memory bottleneck The number of set elements processed per second using 8 cores is 1  71  10 9  or 29–57 of the throughput of the GPU batmap computed above This means that performance is noticeably poorer on the CPUs than on the far less expensive GPU V C ONCLUSION We have shown that a GPU allows set intersection and frequent pair mining that extends to much larger number of items than previous algorithms Further we believe that our approach may be pushed further with careful tuning as we are still far from using the full memory bandwidth of the GPU Our techniques may open up for new applications of e.g association mining where there are tens of thousands of variables e.g genetic data One problem we leave open is to achieve similar results for intersections of more than two sets There are two ways in which our work could possibly be extended one is to use a generalization of batmaps that store items in d out of d 1 places This would ensure that itemsets of size up to d would have at least one position witnessing their intersection Another is to use batmaps to count for each item in S i 1  how many times this item appears in S i 2 S i 3   At the end one would need to sum up the counts for the two occurrences of each item to determine if the item appeared in all sets A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  We would like to thank Anna Pagh for taking part in showing theoretical results on our generalization of the cuckoo hashing insertion procedure and Kumar Lav for his participation in initial experiments with the method described in this paper Also thanks to the anonymous reviewers for numerous useful suggestions This work was supported in part by a grant from the Danish National Research Foundation for the project Scalable Query Evaluation in Relational Database Systems R EFERENCES  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases VLDB 94  pages 487–499 Morgan Kaufmann Publishers 1994  R R Amossen and R Pagh Faster join-projects and sparse matrix multiplications In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory ICDT  pages 121–126 ACM 2009  P Bille A Pagh and R Pagh Fast evaluation of unionintersection expressions In Proceedings of International Symposium on Algorithms And Computation ISAAC  volume 4835 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science  pages 739–750 Springer 2007  P A Boncz M Zukowski and N Nes MonetDB/X100 Hyper-pipelining query execution In Proceedings of Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research CIDR  pages 225–237 2005  C Borgelt Efﬁcient implementations of apriori and eclat In Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  volume 90 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings  CEUR-WS.org 2003  C Borgelt Recursion pruning for the apriori algorithm In Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  volume 126 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings  CEUR-WS.org 2004  C Borgelt An implementation of the fp-growth algorithm In Proceedings of the 1st international workshop on open source data mining OSDM  pages 1–5 ACM 2005  Computer language benchmark game http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all   E D Demaine A L  opez-Ortiz and J I Munro Adaptive set intersections unions and differences In Proceedings of Symposium on Discrete Algorithms SODA  pages 743–752 2000  M Dietzfelbinger and F M auf der Heide Simple efﬁcient shared memory simulations In Proceedings of the 5th Annual ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  pages 110–119 SIGACT and SIGARCH June 30–July 2 1993 Extended abstract  W Fang M Lu X Xiao B He and Q Luo Frequent itemset mining on graphics processors In Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware DaMoN  pages 34–42 ACM 2009  A Ghoting G Buehrer S Parthasarathy D Kim A D Nguyen Y.-K Chen and P Dubey Cache-conscious frequent pattern mining on a modern processor In VLDB  pages 577 588 ACM 2005  N K Govindaraju J Gray R Kumar and D Manocha GPUTerasort high performance graphics co-processor sorting for large database management In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 325–336 ACM 2006  J Han J Pei Y Yin and R Mao Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation A frequent-pattern tree approach Data Min Knowl Discov  8\(1 2004  B He K Yang R Fang M Lu N Govindaraju Q Luo and P Sander Relational joins on graphics processors In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data  pages 511–524 ACM 2008

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
