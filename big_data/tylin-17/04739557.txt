  Mining Self-adaptive Sequence Patterns Based on the Sequence Fuzzy Concept Lattice  Yun Li, Yunhao Yuan, Yan Sheng, Xin Guo, Ling Chen Institute of Information Engineering, Yangzhou University, Jiangsu, 225009, china E-mail: liyun@yzu.edu.cn;  yyhzbh@163.com   Abstract  Traditional algorithms in mining sequence patterns only discover the frequent sequences satisfying the minimum support threshold minsup; however, these methods donít consider the importance of actual sequences. In order to mine the important sequence patterns satisfying usersí many demands, this paper presents a new algorithm called SASeqP for mining selfadaptive sequence patterns based on sequence fuzzy concept lattice. The algorithm firstly introduces the weight for each item in sequences. On the basis of the weight, we define the sequence fuzzy formal context and sequence fuzzy concept lattice After these, we define selfadaptive sequence patterns and the self-adaptive coefficient that may dynamically adjust the minimum support threshold minsup. At last, this article presents the new algorithm SASeqP for mining self-adaptive sequence patterns. The experimental results show that the algorithm SASeqP has excellent performance on the timespatial complexity  1. Introduction  Since R.Srikant and R.Agrawal put forward to mine frequent sequences, mining sequence patterns has been one of main researches in data mining. And it has been widely applied in the action analysis of customer buying analysis of network visiting, the early diagnosis of disease analysis of DNA sequence patterns, and other fields At present, many scholars at home and abroad have presented various algorithms to detect sequence patterns These methods of mining sequence patterns may be approximately divided into two types: one is these algorithms based on the candidate sequence generationtest, for instance AprioriAll 1  GSP   SPADE  and so on. The other is these methods based on sequential growth for example FreeSpan   PrifixSpan  etc Above-mentioned two types of algorithms can mine the sequence patterns satisfying the minimum support threshold minsup However, these methods donít consider the importance of sequences and items, i.e., most of the frequent sequences which above-mentioned two types of algorithms detect may be unimportant for usersí attention Though some sequences donít satisfy the minsup they are very valuable for users. For example, in intrusion detection, most usersí sequential visiting modes belong to a normal mode on the website, whereas examiners expect to gain abnormal usersí sequential visiting modes. In DNA sequences, some special diseases may depend on some abnormal gene sequences, or some sequence patterns are not so important for usersí demand that they donít need to be detected. Therefore, it is very essential for algorithms mining sequence patterns to adjust selfadaptively to detect sequence patterns of satisfying users require. However, the existing mining algorithms donít take account of the feature not to mine the frequent sequences meeting usersí needs The concept lattice  thatís the core data structure of formal concept analysis only scans once in database to successfully construct the lattice structure. And it may strongly describe knowledge and hierarchical relation between conceptions. We only need to store the maximal common subsequence in the concept lattice. As a result the concept lattice can reduce the generation of redundant sequences to save much space. Therefore, in order to solve above-mentioned problem of mining sequence patterns, the paper presents a new algorithm called SASeqP for mining self-adaptive sequence patterns based on sequence fuzzy concept lattice. We firstly introduce the weight value for each item in sequence database and define the sequence fuzzy formal context and sequence fuzzy concept lattice. On the basis of sequence fuzzy concept lattice, then we define self-adaptive sequence patterns and the self-adaptive coefficient that may dynamically adjust the minsup The experimental results show that algorithm SASeqP has excellent performance on the time-spatial complexity  2. Basic concepts  In mining of frequent sequences, let an itemset be I  i 1  i 2  i n here the i j  j 1, 2 n represents an item. A sequence S is an ordered list of itemset, denoted as S  s 1  s 2  s m where s k  k 1, 2 m is an itemset, and I s k 002  The number of items in sequence S is called the length of sequence S i.e 000 003 003  m k k s S 1     A sequence S a  a 1  a 2  a n is called a subsequence of another S b  b 1  b 2  b m  and the S b is called a super-sequence of the S a denoted as

Sequence fuzzy concept lattice  3.1. Sequence fuzzy formal context   On the basis of the fuzzy formal context and fuzzy concept lattice 7 basic concepts refer to literature [7  this paper expands them so that they can organize and denote sequence patterns effectively. Considering the algorithm is to mine important sequence patterns and items, and delete the unimportant items, therefore, we introduce the weight value for each item in the SDB  Meanwhile, the SDB is transformed to sequence fuzzy formal context based on the item standard weight and item-position sets in sequences Definition 1 In sequence database SDB let the set of all items be I  i 1  i 2  i n item i j I  j 1, 2 n  calling the IW  i j is the weight of item i j and calling the IWV  W  i 1  W  i 2  W  i n is a weight vector that itemset I corresponds to, where the W  i j satisfies the 0 W  i j  1 In SDB weights of items may be specified by users require, or experts from relevant fields, as shown in Table 1 IWV  a  b  c  d  e  f  g 0.9, 0.1, 1, 0.25, 1, 1, 0.2 Definition 2 In the SDB let a sequence S be s 1  s 2  s m the times of any item i j  I appearing in sequence S is called item frequency, denoted as INum S  i j the position set of any item i j  I appearing in sequence S is called itemposition set, denoted as IPos S  i j where j 1, 2 n  For instance, there is a sequence e   abc   bde   f  whose sequenceid is 3 in sequence database SDB For each item in the sequence e   abc   bde   f the item frequency and item-position sets are respectively the following INum 3  a  INum 3  b 2 INum 3  c  INum 3  d 1 INum 3  e 2 INum 3  f  IPos 3  a 2 IPos 3  b 2, 3 IPos 3  c 2 IPos 3  d 3 IPos 3  e 3 IPos 3  f  Definition 3 In sequence database SDB for a sequence S  s 1  s 2  s m let the set of items included in sequence S  be Item  S hen for   S Item i j   calling the               S Item i j S j j sr i IW i INum i IW i IW is the weight of item i j relative to other items in sequence S For short relative weight of item i j where j 1, 2 Item  S  In definition 3, when the length of sequence S is longer, the relative weight of each item in sequence S will be smaller. Therefore, it is very necessary for the relative weight of each item to carry out the process of the standardization, as follows Definition 4 In the SDB for a sequence S  s 1  s 2  s m  if   S Item i j   its relative weight is   j sr i IW then calling the    max         1 k sr S Item k j sr j sr i IW i IW i FIW    is the standard weight of relative weight of item i j For short standard weight of item i j where j 1, 2 Item  S  On the basis of the standard weight of items and itemposition sets, this paper expands the definition of fuzzy formal context in order to denote sequence pattern with weight.

Experimental analysis  In this section, we experiment on a random-generating sequence set to test the efficiency and capability of algorithm  SASeqP We carry out algorithm SASeqP using Python2.5.1 The experiments are performed on the CPU2.8GHz Intel Pentium VI machine with the 512MB main memory running Linux system. In these experiments, let the sequential importance threshold be 0.5 In the following Figure 2 and Figure 3, the number of items M is 20; the number of sequences is 100. The average probability that every sequence object possesses items is 0.3; the thresholds m  and m  of each item attribute m and the weight of items are generated randomly between the value 0 and 1

  In the Figure 2, it reveals that the time complexity of algorithm SASeqP is how to be varied when the minimum support threshold minsup is changed. By the Figure 2, we may see that the time complexity of the algorithm SASeqP  becomes gradually small along with the increase of the minsup   Figure 2  time complexity of SASeqP increasing with minsup  In the Figure 3, It shows that the number of selfadaptive sequence patterns which are mined by algorithm SASeqP is how to be changed when the minsup is varied By the Figure 3, we can see that when the minsup  increases, the number of SASP will reduce quickly, this is because that the important sequence patterns are in small quantities in the whole sequence database SDB and many unimportant sequences which are perhaps frequent are pruned by the condition Sup  S   minsup   Figure 3 the relation between minsup and the number of SASP  In the Figure 4, the M is 20, the average probability that every object possesses items is 0.4; weights of items are generated randomly between the value 0 and 1, the minsup is 1%. The expression 0   represents that the threshold m  of every attribute is 0, the 1   represents that the threshold m  of every attribute is 1. Likewise, the meanings of the expression 3  0    9  0   and 5  0    6  0   are the same as above-mentioned 0   and 1    By the Figure 4, we can see that when the threshold m  is close to the threshold m  the number of selfadaptive sequence patterns become relatively small. So the algorithm SASeqP can satisfy usersí demand and reduce the generations of redundant sequence patterns. Therefore, it may save much storage space  Figure 4 the relationship between the number of objects and SASP under different thresholds  6. Conclusions  It is feasible for algorithm SASeqP to mine sequence patterns satisfying usersí needs. The experiments also show that algorithm SASeqP has excellent performance on the time-spatial complexity.

maximum number of levels on the size of the RSS is examined in result section                 Fig. 7: Pre-prune method  The generated ACC 2 is used to generate the reduced search space itemsets at all levels without any extra database scan The generation method is based on the concept that was introduced in lemma 4 for ACC 2 which is, the super k itemset of any infrequent 2-itemset at level k in the accumulative distribution is also infrequent. So the generation method uses only the frequent 2-itemsets in accumulative distribution. The reduced search space is generated level by level. At every level, the generation method is divided into three methods pre-prune, joint, post prune  As shown in Figure 7, Pre-prune is done in two steps; in the first step, the accumulative distribution is pruned, in the second step, the k-1 _itemsets that will joint to generate k itemset are pruned. In the first step, the min_support constrain is applied to get frequent 2-itemset at level k definition 6\. In the second step, we compare the frequent 2itemsets at level k and level k-1 and get the 2-itemsets that are frequent at level k-1 and infrequent at level k These 2itemsets are denoted as delta itemsets, then we remove \(label as not joinable\ll k-1 itemsets that is a super set of any delta itemset \(lemma 4\.The joint and post-prune method like what is used in Apriori  III PRFORMANCE EVALUATION  In order to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, two different sets of numerical experiments are conducted. The first set of experiments is designed to examine the effect of the number of levels in the accumulative distribution on both the execution time and the size of the reduced search space. In the second set of experiments, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to the Apriori performance with different datasets that varies in the number of items, the average transaction size, and the number of transactions. The examined datasets were generated using IBM synthetic data generator [17 t h a t  uses the following parameters D is the number of transaction N is the Number of items T is the average size of transactions, and I is the average size of maximal frequent itemsets. For example N1000.T10.I4.D100K specifies that the number of items is 1000, the average size of transactions is 10, the average size of maximal frequent itemsets is 4, and the database size is 100,000 transactions  The Apriori and the proposed algorithm are coded in java and all the experiments are performed on a Core 2 Duo processor with 2 GB main memory running under Open Suse 11.0 Linux operating system. In implementing the Apriori algorithm, one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays are used to reduce the required execution time for discovering frequent itemsets, in the first and second levels respectively as noted in [18 Fo r h i g h e r lev e ls, th e h a sh tree tech n i q u e is used. However, in implementing the proposed algorithm every two levels in the accumulative distribution are stored in one two-dimension array to reduce the used memory space  A. Experiment One  In this experiment, the effect of the number of levels in accumulative distribution on the proposed algorithm performance is examined. In Fact, the number of levels in accumulative distribution affects both the required memory for storing the accumulative distribution, and the size of the reduced search space. Increasing number of levels increases the required memory space while theoretically; reducing the number of levels increases the size of reduced search space Thus, it eliminates the effect of the pre-pruning method in reducing the search space for levels greater than the maximum number of levels in the accumulative distribution  The experiment is applied on the datasets T8I2L1000N1000D1000k and T10I6L1000N1000D1000k  For both datasets, As shown in Figure 8 the execution time is reduced in the first part within exponential form with increasing the number of levels, while in the second part the execution time is increased with increasing the number of levels. As prescribed earlier, the number of levels affects both the size of RSS, and required memory space. The effect of RSS size on the execution time is more dominant in the first part. This is because both size of RSS and the execution time are reduced with increasing the number of levels until increasing the levels does not reduce the size of RSS. On the other hand, the required memory space becomes more dominant in the second part  B. Experiment Two  In this experiment, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to Apriori. The experiment is divided into two parts; first, the execution time and number of candidate itemsets are measured for datasets have N1000 L1000, D100K and different T and I While in the second part, the effect of number of transactions on the performance is measured. Figure 9 shows the results of datasets T8I4  T10I4 and T10I6 for N1000L1000D100k As shown, the proposed algorithm has shorter  execution time than Apriori in all min-supports.

The reduced search space can provide better starting point for many ARM algorithms; moreover, we propose ARM algorithm based on reduced search space. The proposed algorithm requires only two database scans to discover all frequent itemsets, and generate number of candidate itemsets less than ones  generated by Apriori algorithm in most cases. The reduction in number of database scans, and candidate itemsets reduce the required I/O time and CPU time, which implies that increasing in the proposed algorithm performance up to several orders of magnitude compared to Apriori in most cases   R EFERENCES    A g ra w a l, T  Im ieli ns k i a n d A  S w a m i  M i n i n g association rules between sets of items in large databases in: Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD 1993, pp. 207ñ216  R  A g ra w a l  an d R  S r ik a n t F a s t a l g o rit h m s f o r m i n i n g  association rules in: Proceedings of International Conference on Very Large Data Bases 1994, pp. 487ñ499  J  S.

constrained frequent itemset search are NP-hard and they are at least P-hard meaning t hey will remain intractable even if P=NP This work gives evidence it is not a good idea to mine all frequent itemsets above a support threshold since the output size is combinatorial In 13 t h e a ut hors d eri v e a bound on the number of candidate itemsets given the current set of frequent itemsets when using a level-wise algorithm Covers and bases 37 21 a re an alternati v e t o s ummarize association rules using a comb inatorial approach instead of a model Clusters have some resemblance to bases in the sense that each cluster can be used to derive all subsets from a maximal itemset The model represents an approximate cover for all potential associations We now discuss closely related work on establishing relationships between association rules and other data mining techniques Preliminary results on using clusters to get lower and upper bounds for support is given in 27  I n g eneral there is a tradeoff between rules with high support and rules with high conﬁdence 33 t h i s w o rk propos es an al gorithm that mines the best rules under a Bayesian model There has been work on clustering transactions from itemsets 41  H o w e v er  t hi s a pproach goes i n t he oppos i t e di rection it rst mines associations and from them tries to get clusters Clustering association rules rather than transactions once they are mined is analyzed in 22  T he out put is a summary of association rules The approach is different from ours since this proposal works with the original data set whereas ours produces a model of the data set In 42 the idea of mining frequent itemsets with error tolerance is introduced This approach is related to ours since the error is somewhat similar to the bounds we propose Their algorithm can be used as a means to cluster transactions or perform estimation of query selectivity In 39 t he aut hors explore the idea of building approximate models for associations to see how they change over time 6 Conclusions This article proposed to use clusters on binary data sets to bound and estimate association rule support and conﬁdence The sufﬁcient statistics for clustering binary data are simpler than those required for numeric data sets and consist only of the sum of binary points transactions Each cluster represents a long itemset from which shorter itemsets can be easily derived The clustering model on high dimensional binary data sets is computed with efﬁcient operations on sparse matrices skipping zeroes We rst presented lower and upper bounds on support whose average estimates actual support Model-based support metrics obey the well-known downward closure property Experiments measured accuracy focusing on relative error in support estimations and efﬁciency with real and synthetic data sets A clustering model is accurate to estimate support when using a sufﬁciently high number of clusters When the number of clusters increases accuracy increases On the other hand as the minimum support threshold decreases accuracy also decreases but at a different rate depending on the data set The error on support estimation slowly increases as itemset length increases The model is fairly accurate to discover a large set of frequent itemsets at multiple support levels Clustering is faster than A-priori to mine frequent itemsets without considering the time to compute the model Adding the time to compute the model clustering is slower than Apriori at high support levels but faster at low support levels The clustering model can be built in linear time on data size Sparse matrix operations enable fast computation with high dimensional transaction data sets There exist important research issues We want to analytically understand the relationship between the clustering model and the error on support estimation We need to determine an optimal number of clusters given a maximum error level Correlation analysis and PCA represent a next step after the clustering model but the challenges are updating much larger matrices and dealing with numerical issues We plan to incorporate constraints based on domain knowledge into the search process Our algorithm can be optimized to discover and periodically refresh a set of association rules on streaming data sets References 1 C  A ggar w al and P  Y u F

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
