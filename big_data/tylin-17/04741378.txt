The current researches on classification rules mainly focus on the mining of the unevenly distributed and huge databases  The existing algorithms of classification rules mining support either multi-support thresholds or scalability of store memory. These algorithms mainly adopt the strategies of breadth-first, depth first, or both of them. However the algorithms with breath first strategy lik 2 3 are inefficient for dense datasets that contain long patterns. The algorithms with depth first strategy such 5    and et c, do no t scal e to large sparse datasets and are time-wasting in mining dense datasets. Some algorithms  8 p u tting br eath fir st and dep th fir st strateg ies  together but using single support are not good for mining unevenly-distributed business databases. Although algorithms  adopt multi-support method they ar e not scalable for store space with the limitation of memory  This paper presents a novel algorithm, multi-support algorithm CRMMS, for mining classification rules in business databases which is efficient on dense databases at all levels of support threshold, and scalable to very large databases. Our contributions are as follows: first, we present frequent classification item-set tree for constructing frequent pattern sets, and adopt both breath first and depth first strategies which enhances the build of frequent pattern tree. Second, we propose an array-based format for classification tree for pseudo projection with high efficiency and low memory cost and adopt multi-support thresholds to mine more potential and effective association rules Finally, we design and implement a multi-support algorithm CRMMS of classification rules mining. And with the compare experiments with Apriori FP-Growth and OP, CRMMS has certain advantages in mining efficiency and scalability of the large business databases    2 CONSTRUCTION OF FREQUENT  CLASSIFICATION ITEM-SET TREE  2.1. Problem Descriptions Definition 1 The classification database D=\(O,I,C\in which O is the finite set of da ta objects, I is the set of data attributes and C is the set of classification items  The data attribute set also known as an item set I={i1,i2 001\002 im}, in which ik is called data attribute. The data object set O={\(tid1 002 t1 002»\001\002 tidn 002 tn\which 002 tidk 002 tk 002 presents a data object or a transaction, and tidk is the identifier of the object or transaction, tk is the attribute set of classification objects, and tk 001 I 001 C 000 tk \002C 000 1. The classification item set C={c1 002»\001\002\002 cs}, in which ck stands for a classification item  According to the definition above, the database in table 1 can be described as I ={a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,j,k,l,m,p,s C={ c1, c2 O={\(01,t1\,\(02,t2 001\002 08,t8\ composed by 8 transactions, in table 1  c 2 b e k s 08 c 2 a d e g f j p 07 c 1 a k l 06 c 2 a e f m p s 05 c 2 b e f m p 04 c 1 a b e j p 03 c 2 a c e f g j l p 02 c 1 a b c d e f h p s 01 Class Items Tid c 2 b e k s 08 c 2 a d e g f j p 07 c 1 a k l 06 c 2 a e f m p s 05 c 2 b e f m p 04 c 1 a b e j p 03 c 2 a c e f g j l p 02 c 1 a b c d e f h p s 01 Class Items Tid Table 1.

Frequent Classification Item-set Tree Frequent classification item sets can be represented by a tree namely frequent classification item-set tree, abbreviated as FCIST, and in order to avoid repetitiveness, we impose an ordering on the items  FCIST is an ordered tree, where each node is labeled by an item, and associated with a weight. The ordering of items labeling the nodes along any path \(top down\and the ordering

of items labeling children of any node \(left to right\the imposed ordering. Each frequent classification item set is represented by one and only path starting from the root and the weight of the ending node is the support of the item set. The null root corresponds to the empty item set. The weights associated with nodes need not be actually implemented   Each node has its own classification projected transaction set abbreviated as CPTS\at support the item set represented by the path starting from the root to the node. CPTS of the null root is the original database CPTS of any node other than the null root is obtained by projecting transactions in CPTS of its parent node, according to the priori property. One CPTS is filtered if each transaction in the CPTS only maintains items that contribute to the further construction of descendants. In other words, filtered CPTS of a node only contains items that label the sibling of its parent node. Otherwise, the CPTS is unfiltered. Apparently, items in filtered CPTS are local frequent in its parent CPTS  Each FCIST node is represented by[i,w1 001\002  followed b y  its own CPTS, ws is the weight of item i belonged to the classification cs. Let 000 001 be the dictionary order, then the classification database in Table 1 can be represented as Figure 1 with the support thresholds minsup1 002 2 and minsup2 002 3 The pa 000  000 e,2,4 000 a,2 represents the  classification item sets{a,e,p c1} with support of 2 and{a,e,p,c2} with support of 3. The unfiltered CPTS of the root, namely priori classification database has 8 transactions in which transactions 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 07 support item p and transactions 01 and 03 belong to classification c1 transactions 02, 04, 05 and 07 belong to classification c2. So the CPTS of is com pos ed by such 6 transactions. The CPTS of all the nodes except the root is filtered, only containing the brother nodes ahead c 2 b e k s 08 c 2 a d e g f j p 07 c 1 a k l 06 c 2 a e f m p s 05 c 2 b e f m p 04 c 1 a b e j p 03 c 2 a c e f g j l p 02 c 1 a b c d e f h p s 01 c 2 b e k s 08 c 2 a d e g f j p 07 c 1 a k l 06 c 2 a e f m p s 05 c 2 b e f m p 04 c 1 a b e j p 03 c 2 a c e f g j l p 02 c 1 a b c d e f h p s 01 c 1 a 03 c 1 a 01 c 1 a 03 c 1 a 01  a,3,3  b 2 2   a,2,0 e,2,5 c 2 b 08 c 2 a 07 c 2 a 05 c 2 b 04 c 1 a b 03 c 2 a 02 c 1 a b 01 c 2 b 08 c 2 a 07 c 2 a 05 c 2 b 04 c 1 a b 03 c 2 a 02 c 1 a b 01 a,2,3 c 1 a 03 c 1 a 01 c 1 a 03 c 1 a 01 b,2,2 a,2,0 f,1,4 c 2 a e 07 c 2 a e 05 c 2 b e 04 c 2 a e 02 c 1 a b e 01 c 2 a e 07 c 2 a e 05 c 2 b e 04 c 2 a e 02 c 1 a b e 01 a,1,3  e  1 4 c 2 a 07 c 2 a 05 c 2 a 02 c 1 a 01 c 2 a 07 c 2 a 05 c 2 a 02 c 1 a 01 p,2,4 c 2 a e f 07 c 2 a e f 05 c 2 b e f 04 c 1 a b e 03 c 2 a e f 02 c 1 a b e f 01 c 2 a e f 07 c 2 a e f 05 c 2 b e f 04 c 1 a b e 03 c 2 a e f 02 c 1 a b e f 01 a,2,3 c 1 a 03 c 1 a 01 c 1 a 03 c 1 a 01 b,2,0 a,2 e,2,4 c 2 a 07 c 2 a 05 c 2 b 04 c 1 a b 03 c 2 a 02 c 1 a b 01 c 2 a 07 c 2 a 05 c 2 b 04 c 1 a b 03 c 2 a 02 c 1 a b 01 a,2 c 1 a 03 c 1 a 01 c 1 a 03 c 1 a 01 b,2,0 a,2,0 a,1 f,1 c 2 a e 07 c 2 a e 05 c 2 b e 04 c 2 a e 02 c 1 a b e 01 c 2 a e 07 c 2 a e 05 c 2 b e 04 c 2 a e 02 c 1 a b e 01 a,1,3  e 1 4 c 2 a 07 c 2 a 05 c 2 a 02 c 1 a 01 c 2 a 07 c 2 a 05 c 2 a 02 c 1 a 01 a,1,3 Figure.1 The FCIST in the example   2.3. Representing CPTS by ATTF and Pseudo-projecting  An array-based threaded transaction forest, ATTF, is adopted to represent CPTS because of its low memory spending. And two different pseudo-projecting methods are used to construct the FCIST. ATTF consists of two parts: an item list \(IL\, and a forest. Each local item in CPTS has an entry in the IL, with three fields: an item-id, multiple supports, and a pointer namely e.item, e.conut and e.link respectively. And the multiple supports e.count can be divided into ||C|| different parts, called e.count \(k\ representing the support in classification ck. Entries in IL are ordered by the imposed ordering. Each transaction in the CPTS is represented by one and only one path in the forest. Each node in the forest is labeled by an array [i,w1 001\002   where i is an item and wk  is a count that is the number of transactions in classification ck represented by the path starting from the root ending at the node. Items labeling nodes along any path are sorted by the same ordering as IL. All nodes labeled by the same item are threaded by the entry in IL with the same item. ATTF is filtered if only local frequent items appear in ATTF, otherwise unfiltered  For example, the filtered ATTF representation for the CPTS of the null root in Figure 1 is shown in Figure 2, where the path  b,2 0 e,2,0 p,2,0 repr esents tr ansactio n 01 and 03   e,0 2 f,0,1 p,0,1  r e pr esents transactio n 04, and  so on. The third item in FIL is item e, with multi supports 2 and 5 in classifications c1 and c2 respectively. The pointer arrow-headed broken line\s the nodes [e,2 e,0,3 and  tog ether   From the ATTF representation of the CPTS of a parent node in FCIST, we can project its childrenês ATTFs either in a bottom up way or in a top down way. The FCIST in Figure 1 is constructed in a top down projecting way, so we will introduce this way in the paper  In the top down way, the pseudo ATTF of a child CPTS consists of sub forest whose leav es are threaded together in its parent ATTF. Firstly, we choose the IL items one by one from the parent ATTF in the imposed ordering. Secondly, by traversing the sub forest threaded by the chosen IL, we can delimitate the CPTS by re-threading nodes in the sub forest count the support of each item in the sub forest by re-calculating the count of each node according to the leaves multi supports. For example, in Figure 3, the sub forest whose leaves, [f,0 a nd [f,0,1 are th readed b y  the e n tr y of it em f compresses transactions that support item f. By traversing this sub forest, we get local multi supports of item a, b and e of  0,1 and 0 4 respectiv el y, and the count of first node label by a is changed from [3,3 to [0,3 and n ode [b,0 2 is adjusted into node [e,0,2  into [e,0,1  Therefore the sub forest of the pseudo ATTF consists of two paths  e,0,3 and [b,0 1 e,0,1  The IL is {\([a,0 ptr  ptr  e,0,4 ptr is a r ecursion pro cess e.g  the child ATTF of the node [e,0 in Figure 3can be pseudo  projected as shown in Figure 4

   Such method of pseudo projection avoids recursively building projected transaction set, which is in the same number as frequent item sets. This method is not only space efficient in that no additional space is needed for any child ATTF, but the counting and projecting operation is also highly CPU-efficient Especially we adopt different supports for classification items which makes the FCIST construction more efficient   3 ALGORITHM CRMMS  Now we present the multi-support algorithm of classification rules mining, abbreviated as CRMMS, which integrates depth first and breadth first strategies, array-based threaded tree forest representation and filtered projection. First, CRMMS creates a null node for the root of the FCIST, whose CPTS is the priori classification database. Second, CRMMS calls BreadthFirst to grow the upper portion of FCIST by breadth first search until the reduced set of transactions can be held in a memory based structure. Third, DepthFirst is called to build the lower portion of FCIST by depth first search MSC 002 O 000 Minsup 002 create FCIST root R and let R.PTS=O BreadthFirst R,L 000  001 Minsup DepthFirst T 000  001 Minsup   BreadthFirst attaches counting vectors to all nodes at the current level L to accumulate local supports for items in the CPTS of each node. The counting vector has an element for the item of each sibling node that is before the node attached according to the imposed ordering 000 We project the transaction t along the path from the root to nodes at the current level L and accumulate counting vectors. If a transaction can be projected to a level L node and contribute to its counting vector, it may also be projected to level L+1 therefore record it in Dê. Otherwise it can be removed from further consideration. Then we create children for each node at the current level L for its local frequent items whose element in the counting vector has a value over the multi-support thresholds. The BreadthFisrt is a recursive procedure. We use the available free memory as parameter to control breadth first search process BreadthFirst\(R,L 001 000  001 Minsup,D for each node v at level L top down by 000 001 do CreateCountingVector\(v D for each transaction t in D do ProjectAndCount\(t,L,D for each node v at level L do GenerateChildren\(v If\(NoMem\(Dí\n BreadthFirst\(T,L+1 000  001 Minsup else return\(D   If bread first projecting ends at level L, then DepthFirst is called to build the sub trees with roots of the leaves in level L DepthFirst v 000  001 Minsup for each node e in v.PTS.IL top down by 000 001 do if e.count\(k 0011 minsupk for some class ck in C then create a child node d for v d.item= e.item d.weight\(k\= e.cuont\(k PseudoProj\(v,d 001 000  DepthFirst d 001 000  001 Minsup   In DepthFirst, first, the IL item s are chosen by the imposed ordering; second, if the classification items of the IL item are frequent then creates the corresponding children nodes; third calls the PseudoProj process. The PseudoProj process will adjust the weights and re-threading the sub trees to guarantee the children CPTS be contained in the parent CPTS   4 PERFORMANCE EVALUATIONS  To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithm CRMMS, we have done experiments on the dataset Forest from UCI machine learning data warehousing by comparing with Apriori and FP-Growth on a 286MHz Pentium III PC with 512 MB main memory and 30 GB hard drive, running on Windows 2000 Professional  The empirical results indicate that CRMMS is one to three orders of magnitude more efficient than Apriori and FP-Growth. For example, in Figure 5, when the support thresholds are lower than 0.1%, CRMMS is 2 to 12 more efficient than Apriori and 1.5 to 8 than FP-Growth. At the reasonable low support threshold of 0.05%, CRMMS requires 16 seconds, whereas FP-Growth requires 31 seconds and Apriori requires 65 seconds. At the even lower support threshold of 0.02 %, CRMMS requires 20, while FP-Growth  requires 72 seconds and Apriori requires 155 seconds. The rankings of algorithms are CRMMS 002 FP-Growth 002 Apriori  Figure 5.

Process of candidate generation Pruning Step Some candidates in NC sizek can be pruned earlier before counting. By definition, if a data sequence ds  n-contains a negative sequence ns  ds  pcontain  ns.mp In other word, if the support of ns.mp is less than min_sup  ns cannot be frequent in DB All the frequent maximum positive subsequences of the candidate negative sequences are the positive sequential patterns in DB All these positive sequential patterns had been discovered in Phase 1 and can be used to prune a candidate negative sequences ns by checking the support of ns.mp Additionally, we can exploit the properties of negative sequences to reduce the number of candidates. For example, a data sequence ds c\not n-cover   a b ds cannot n-cover any candidate sequence with leading subsequence a b the first element of ds is \(a b\is called the n-prefix of ns sizej In contrast ds could not n-cover  a c ds could n-cover a c d a e\difference between  b\<\(a c\ the last element. If the last element of the n-prefix is positive, we can use it to prune the candidate negative sequence. Similarly if the last element of the n-suffix is positive, we can use it to prune the candidate negative sequence. Thus ds   c n-cover e a c ds cannot n-cover a negative sequence ns sizen  e\222 1 e\222 2 205e\222 n-2 e\222 n-1 e n 222>, where e\222 n-2 e n-1  a n c\ther. The <\205\(e a c the n-suffix of ns sizen   3.2. Support Counting  PNSP adopts a hash-tree structure like GSP for storing candidates to reduce the number of candidates that need to be checked for each data sequence Originally, the hash-tree in GSP is designed to store candidates of the same length in the leaves. The leaf which a candidate should be placed in is the leaf reached by a consecutive ha shing on the items of the candidate. Nonetheless PNSP generates candidates of different lengths in each pa ss. Therefore, we modify the hashing procedure slightly to store the same prefixed candidates. If there are candidates of n  different lengths, we building n hash-trees Candidates would be placed in the same leaf if their leading items, starting from the first item, were hashed to the same node. The next item is used for hashing when an interior node, instead of a leaf node, is reached. The candidates requi red for checking against a data sequence are located in leaves reached by applying the hashing procedure on each item of the data sequence. The support of the candidate is increased by one if it is n-contained in the data sequence  3.3. Improvement by n-cover Checking  Checking whether a data sequence ds  n-cover a negative sequence ns is improved as follows. A candidate negative sequence ns  e\222 sizek  1 e\222 205e 2 k 222  where e i 222 is a negative itemset, both e i-1 222 and e i+1 222 are positive. Let d j  p-contain  e i-1 222 Checking e i 222 can be done in two steps. Step 1, we find the occurrence position of e i+1 222 from d j+2 to d t If no such position can be found ds does not n-cover ns Step 2, we check whether ds  p-contain  e i 222 from d j+1 to d n If no such e i 222  can be found, then e i+2 222 is checked. If d i  p-contains e i 222 we go backward to find an e i-1 222 from d i to d t Finally Step 1 and Step 2 are app lied recursively so that e i 222 can be checked  4. Experimental Results  Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the PNSP algorithm implemented by using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. All experiments were performed on an AMD 2800+ PC with 1GB memory, running the Windows XP. The datasets in the experiment, DB1 of C10.T2.5.S4.I1.25 N10K.D100K and DB2 of C8.T8.S4.I4.N1K.D10K were generated by the well-known method in   for the details of the param e ters Fig. 5 shows that the total execution times of mining DB1 using two different miss_freqs for various min_sups The results of min_sup 3% and 2% were similar because only few patterns satisfied miss_freq  When min_sup was less than 1%, a large number of negative sequential patterns appeared so that the execution times were increased as min_sup decreased When miss_freq was increased from 97 % to 97.5 the number of negative itemsets increased from 7 to 23. The number of candidates grows exponentially as

the number of negative itemsets multiplies quickly The reason in that candidate sizen negative sequences are composed of m negative itemsets. The number of these itemsets approximately equals to number of sizek positive patterns multiply by the number of size n-k   negative itemsets. For instance, if the number of positive itemsets is 23 and the number of negative itemsets is 7, the number of candidates of NPN type equals 343 \(7 23 7\If the number of negative itemsets rises to 23, the number becomes 12161 23 23 23 ecution time increases exponentially Fig. 6 presents the total execution times of mining DB2 using different min_sups When min_sup was decreased or miss_freq was increased, a large number of negative sequential patterns were discovered so that the execution times were increased            C10-T2.5-S4-I2.5, |DB|=100K, N=10K 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000 18000 20000 0.8 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 Minimum support T o t a l execu ti on ti me  sec  miss_freq 97.5 miss_freq 97  Fig.  5.

We improve the usefulness of the patterns by introducing three constraints. The proposed  PNSP algorithm extends the GSP algorithm and discovers sequential patterns having multiple negative itemsets PSNP utilizes the properties of negative sequences to speed up the discovery of negative sequential patterns. Additionally, the proposed ncontain technique may efficiently check whether a data sequence contains negative sequences having multiple negative itemsets. The devised pruning technique is effective for reducing a large number of negative candidate patterns. The experimental results show that PNSP may discover negative sequential patterns for practical applications  7.

Park Driving Park  VI  C ONCLUSIONS AND F UTURE W ORK  We have proposed a framework for mining interesting chronicles or narratives from multi-year consumer media collections, including themes related to the calendar date. The media in the collection is analyzed by a variety of algorithms to generate metadata of different types. We use metadata based on camera capture information, low-level image processing semantic image understanding, facial processing and event clustering to gather a large set of diverse metadata. The media and associated metadata are represented as a transaction database, and frequent itemset mining is employed to detect frequently occurring groups of images that share several meta             Figure 7. An example of temporal recurring groups detected data in common. A confidence and interest measure relevant to the consumer domain is used to determine the quality of the frequent itemsets, and create a  list of the top "themes" within the collection. Since a variety of metadata types are included for every media in the collection, we are able to capture a broad variety of recurring themes without a priori knowledge of the themes in a given collection. Because the system also discovers frequent patterns that the user may be unaware of, the system seems to display çintelligenté behavior by providing unexpected groupings that could not have been extracted by merely searching We also detect calendar-related recurring themes in multiyear collections. We define collections in terms of events, and represent them in an appropriate two-dimensional temporal space. We use density-based clustering followed by filtering to reduce the number of false matches in a group. Our approach detects personal special dates such as birthdays and anniversaries, seasonal activities and holidays celebrated. Since both the calendar-based groups and feature-based thematic groups detected are strictly data-driven \(with no a priori assumptions about a userês collection\ they are customized to the type of content in specific userês collections Further work in this area includes a user study to evaluate user reaction to these automatically generated narratives from their collection. Some of the user studies will focus on using the output of our method for slideshow-based reliving of a collection. We also plan to gather more collections with people and location metadata. Another direction of exploration is in improving the performance of scene, material and object classifiers by incorporating contextual information from seemingly unrelated metadata, as suggested by the frequent itemsets detected by our system. Also, further improvement of the precision of detecting recurrent themes can be obtained by incorporating the discrimination power of different features into the confidence score to avoid making groups based on generic features R EFERENCES  1  N.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
