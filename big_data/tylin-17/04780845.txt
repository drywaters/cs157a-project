Mining Negative Sequential Patt erns for E-Commerce Recommendations   Sue-Chen Hsueh 1 Ming-Yen Lin 2 Chien-Liang Chen 2 1 Dept. of Information Management, Chaoyang University of Technology, Taiwan  2 Dept. of Information Engineering and Computer Science, Feng Chia University, Taiwan schsueh@cyut.edu.tw  linmy, M9510560  fcu.edu.tw   Abstract  Sequential patterns in customer transactional databases are commonly mined for E-Commerce recommendations. In many practical applications, the absence of certain item-sets and sequences could have important implications. Mining frequent sequences comprising not only the occurrence but also the absence of certain sequences will increase the accuracy of product recommendations. A sequential pattern containing at least one absent itemset is called a negative sequential pattern. In this paper, we formulate the problem of negative sequential pattern mining by introducing practical constraints and propose an algorithm called PNSP for the mining. The discovered patterns can then be more interesting and effective to use. The exper imental results show that PNSP may discover negative sequential patterns for practical E-commerce applications  1. Introduction  Sequential pattern mining is an important problem that finds out temporal relationships among item-sets in a sequence data The t echni que can be applied to many applications, including customer shopping sequences, medical treatment diagnosis telephone calling patterns, DNA sequence analysis and so on. A classic application of customer shopping sequences is to discover the itemsets \(set of items future purchase after certain itemsets were bought. A discovered pattern may be MacBook, iPhone   Xbox which indicates that many customers who purchase MacBook and iPhone at the same time, would buy printing software at a later time. Discovering purchasing patterns of customers may assist the modeling of user behaviors for E-commerce recommendations, customer retention, or personalized servi M a ny al gori t h m s 1, 5, 7 have been developed for the mining of sequential patterns In general, frequent itemsets or sequences appearing in the database are the focus of frequent pattern mining. Actually, the absence of certain itemset may imply the appearance of other itemsets as well The absence of itemsets thus is becoming measurable in many applicati The absence of an itemset in a discovered pattern is referred to as a negative itemset Sequential patterns discovered in traditional mining are called positive sequential patterns In contrast, if a sequential pattern contains at least one negative itemset, the pattern is called a negative sequential pattern For example, a negative sequential pattern MacBook  iPhone  Xbox  indicates that if iPhone is absent after the presence of MacBook normally Xbox will appear. Practical applications call for the need of exploring patterns having negative itemsets, as illustrated in the following Example 1 Given a positive sequential pattern S 1   MacBook  iPhone  iPod   a  negative  sequential  pattern S 2     MacBook  iPhone  Xbox for an Ecommerce recommendation. If one had bought MacBook should the system recommend iPod or Xbox  If iPhone was purchased after purchasing MacBook  the system may recommend iPod by referring to pattern S 1 otherwise Xbox could be recommended by referring to pattern S 2  Example 2 Consider two negative sequential patterns S 2     MacBook  iPhone  Xbox  S 3   MacBook  iPhone  Xbox for an E-commerce recommendation. The occurrence of Xbox is highly dependent on the presence of iPhone in an antecedent transaction. Thus, given one has a purchasing sequence of MacBook ahead, an effective recommendation  of Xbox can be provided by validating the subsequent occurrence of iPhone in one’s sequence The above two examples show that negative sequential patterns could assist product recommendation systems to make more accurate decisions. To our knowledge, only very few studies have described the mining of negative sequential patterns. This paper formulates the problem of

negative sequential patterns and presents an algorithm called PNSP for the mining of negative sequential patterns. The experimental results show that PNSP  discovers negative sequential patterns efficiently The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate the problem of mining positive and negative sequential patterns. The proposed algorithm is presented in Section 3. The experimental evaluation is described in Section 4. Finally, Section 5 concludes our study    2. Problem Formulation  2.1. Traditional Sequential Patterns  Let  1  2 205 n be a set of literals, called items A positive  itemset  I  i 1 i 2 205, i m  nonempty set of m items such that I   Without loss of generality, we assume the items in an itemset are in lexicographic order. A sequence  s  e 1 e 2 205e k is an ordered list of k elements where each element e i is a positive\set. Sequence s is also called a positive sequence The size of a sequence s written as s is the total number of elements in s Sequence s is a sizek sequence denoted by s sizek if s  k The total number of items in all the elements in s is called the length of sequence s c\and b, c\l sequences of length 3. The first sequence is size3 sequence The second and third sequences are size2 sequences A positive sequence   b 1 b 2 205b p is a subsequence of a positive sequence   r 1 r 2 205r q if there exist 1   t 1  t 2 205 t p   q such that b 1   r t 1  b 2   r t 2 205 b p   r t p Positive sequence  p-contains positive sequence if is a subsequence of c, d, e p-contains a c, d Each positive sequence in a sequence database DB  is referred to as a data sequence The number of data sequences in DB is denoted by DB The support of sequence s denoted by s.sup is the percentage of data sequences p-containing  s in DB The min_sup is the user specified minimum support threshold. If s.sup   min_sup then sequence s is a frequent sequence or called positive sequential pattern A positive sequential pattern is called a positive  l-pattern if its length is l  and is called a positive  sizek pattern if its size is k  Given min_sup and the sequence database DB the problem of sequential pattern mining is to discover the set of all positive sequential patterns 2.2. Negative Sequential Patterns  In the mining of negative sequential patterns, the database is the same as that used in traditional sequential pattern mining. However, negative sequential pattern mini i s m o re chal l e ngi ng than traditional sequential pattern mining. Consider an example as follows Example 3 Give a DB having only one data sequence ds b\and  a, b}. Three positive b discovered. The number of negative sequences may be infinite if no constraints were added. Negative sequential patterns can be formed by any combinations of negative and positive itemsets. Not that <\(a a b a b\but also <\(a a b b a ab a b\number of negative itemsets can be infinitely added. A negative sequence can be formed by adding one or more negative itemsets to a positive sequence. Many of the negative sequential patterns could be meaningless in reality Meaningful negative sequential patterns need more constraints. The first constraint is the size constraint  To be reasonable, a data sequence cannot support a pattern whose size exceeds its size. In other words, the maximum size of negative sequences supported by a data sequence ds is ds For example, the maximum size of negative sequential patterns supported by ds  b\. Negative patterns 254 ab  254 ab b a 254 ab 254 ab 254 ab\be supported by ds but <\(a 254 ab a 254 ab 254 a b\. Note that 254 b a cannot be supported by ds because the \(a ds has no antecedent itemset Similarly b 254 a the \(b ds has no successor The second constraint to increase the practicability of negative sequential pattern is the frequency  constraint Given 10 distinct items in the total number of potential itemsets is 1023 = C\(10, 1\+ C\(10 2\+ \205+ C\(10, 10\\(m, n\s the number of combinations of choosing n items from m  distinct items. Assume that 10 among the 1023 are frequent. If the maximum size of data sequences in DB  is three, the total number of potential patterns is 1033 1  1033 2 1033 3 In fact, many of the combinations are uninteresting. The user is in terested in the absence of certain \223frequent\224 itemsets in a negative sequential pattern. Thus, the negative itemsets to be considered in a negative sequential pattern should have enough frequency. The negative itemsets of those frequent ones are to be considered only. The total number of potential patterns changes into 20 1 20 2 20 3 A v alid negative itemset  254X to form a negative sequential pattern is the negative itemset of a frequent itemset X  where X.sup   min_sup  The third constraint is the formation constraint In a formation of a negative sequence, two or more negative itemsets could contiguously exist. However

For example, given a data sequence ds b c ,d , e ds does not n-cover a, b 254 c, d c, d mp that is <\(a, b  is not pcontained in ds Although ds  p-contain  254 a c mp  that is <\(c ds does not n-cover  254 a c ds  p-contains  254 a c ce i.e., <\(a c ds does not ncover b 254 d c, d b 254 d c, d ce i.e b d c, d p-contained in ds  ds  n-covers   254 c\ does not n-contain  254 d c  254 d c ce i.e. <\(d c p-contained in ds  Finally ds  n-contains  254 b b 254 a c, d, e all the conditions are satisfied b\and a\\(a\and \(b\are missing after the occurrence of \(b\order of consecutive negative itemsets is trifling for many applications. We may use one negative itemset unifying the consecutive negative itemsets for the negative sequence. A negative sequence thus is defined to have no contiguous negative itemsets. Such negative sequences are more interpretable though some specific applications may allow consecutive negative itemsets The negative itemset of itemset I  i 1 i 2 205, i m  denoted by \254 I 254 i 1 i 2 205, i m  absence of I where all the items in I are absent altogether. \254 I is also called the inverse of I The inverse of a negative itemset \254 I is I itself. A positive itemset X  n-contain a negative itemset \254 Y if and only if Y X. A sequence ns  e The support of a negative sequence ns denoted by ns.sup is the percentage of data sequences in DB  ncontaining  ns Sequence ns  e 1 222e 2 222\205e k 222 is called a negative sequence where e j 222 is either a positive itemset or negative itemset, if \(1\ent e a 222  1 a k is a negative itemset, \(2\ery negative itemset e a 222  1 a k  e a-1 222 and e a+1 222 must be positive itemsets, and 3\set e a 222  1 a k  must be a  frequent itemset in DB The total number of elements in a negative sequence ns is called the size of the negative sequence ns written as ns Negative sequence ns is a sizek neg-sequence  ns sizek if ns  k  b  c a, b c b, c\sequence is ns size3 The second and third sequences are ns size2  An ordered list of all the positive elements in a negative sequence ns is called the maximum positive subsequence of ns denoted by ns.mp That is ns.mp is derived by removing all the negative elements in ns  For instance, the maximum positive subsequence of b, c\<\(a\and that of <\(b c a a\ditionally, the counterexample of a negative sequence ns written as ns.ce is derived by replacing each negative itemset e a 222 in ns by its inverse 254 e a 222 b, c counterexample  of <\(a b, c counterexample of <\(c d a b d c d, a b d A data sequence ds  d 1 d 2 205d v  n-covers a negative sequence ns  e 1 222e 2 222\205e k 222 if there exist integers p  q  r and e i 222  254 I in n s such that the two conditions hold: \(1 ds p-contains  ns.mp 2 e i 1 222   d p  e i+1 222   d r  e i 222   d q  where 1  i k 1 p  q  r   t In addition ds  n-contains  ns if ds  n-covers  ns but ds does not p-contain  ns.ce Note that if the first or the last element is a negative itemset, condition \(2\is different.

An example for Phase 1 Phase 2: Find all positive and negative itemsets  Positive itemsets are used to generate all negative itemsets which satisfy miss_feq The support of a negative itemset I of length one can be derived without scanning the database by I.sup  DB   I.sup  Phase 3 Mining negative sequential patterns Phase 3 is the core of PNSP The phase makes multiple passes over the database and finds out negative sequential patterns. In each pass, every data sequence is examined to update the support counts of the ncontained candidate negative sequences. The size2  candidate negative sequences are generated by permutations of positive and negative itemsets. The size2 negative sequential patterns are determined after checking all the data sequences in the database. In succeeding passes sizek candidate negative sequences are generated by appending a size\(k-1 candidate sequences with a positive or negative itemset. Again the supports of these candidates are counted by a scanning of the database to determine the frequent ones. This process terminates when there are no negative candidates any more. Fig. 3 shows an example of phase 3 in execution. The two essential sub-processes candidate generation and support counting are described in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2 respectively. The method of n-cover Checking is presented in Section 3.3. In the following context NC sizek represents the set of negative candidate sequence of size k  FNS size-k represents the set of frequent negative sequences of size k  3.1. Candidate Generation PNSP generates candidate negative sequences NC sizek by 2 steps. The sequences in NC size\(k-1 are appended with a positive or negative itemset to generate the set of NC in the first step. Candidates whose maximum positive subsequence is not frequent are deleted in the second step. Moreover, candidates having negative subsequences without enough n-cover  counts in DB are also deleted in the second step d FS size-3 c FS size-1 a, b c a\\(c b a\\(a Size-2-seq 0 0  a\\(ab 2 0 0 3 0 3 0 Count Cover Size-2-neg-seq 3  b 0  c 3  b\\(a  ab  c  b  a 2 0 0 0 a FS size-1 b NS size-1 0 0  a, ab 1 1  c 2 0 0 Count Cover Size-3-neg-seq 0  b  c  a 2 0 c Size-3-seq f NS size-2 PN g NS size-3 PPN j NS size-3 PNP i NS size-3 NPN h NS size-3 NPP e NS size-2 NP b c a, b a Itemset 1 1 ab a 1 0 0 2 2 1 1 Count Cover Size-2-neg-seq 2 b b 0 c a 2 a b ab b c b b a a a 1 0 2 2 d D 5 a D 4 a, e\\(a, b\\(c D 3 a, b D 2 b\\(c D 1 Sequence Sid a\atabase DB min_sup 25 2 2 1 1 Count Cover Size-3-neg-seq 2  b\\(b b 1  b\\(a b  b\\(b a  b\\(a a 2 1 2 2 1 1 Count Cover Size-3-neg-seq 2 b b 1 a\\(a b b a a\\(a a 2 1 b a Neg.

An example for Phase 3 Appending Step  We generate NC sizek  by appending a sequence in NC size\(k-1 with a positive or negative itemset. If the last element of a sequence in NC size\(k-1  is a negative itemset, a positive itemset is appended to form a candidate; Otherwise, it can be appended with a positive itemset and a negative itemset to form two candidates. Using NC instead of FNS size\(k-1 size\(k-1 to generate NC sizek  in that negative sequential patterns defy the Apriori property   FNS size\(k-1 is not necessary a subset of FNS sizek For example, give ds  a d and <\(a d e ds  n-contains a d e not n-contain a d a d\eans that \(d a e\eans that \(d e\his reason, if FNS size\(k-1 cannot be used to generate the complete set of NC sizek Fig. 4 shows the process of candidate generation. Initially, all positive and negative itemsets have been found in Phase 2. The P denotes a positive itemset, N denotes a negative itemset. A P type element can be appended with a P and a N to form two candidates. An N type element can be appended with a P. All sequences of forms PP, PN and NP are obtained in pass 1. Note that PP type is the set of all size2  positive sequential patterns, which are mined in Phase 1. Additionally, positive sequential patterns of all sizes sizek

forms PPP, PPPP, and so on 1. This process is repeated until no more new candidates are generated, or the size of candidates is bigger than the maximum size of data sequences that can support in DB  FS  P N PP PN NP PPP PPN PNP NPP NPN 205 205 205 205 205 205 205 205  Pass 1 Pass 2 Pass k Phase 2 Phase 3 Size 1 Size 2 Size 3 205 205 Size k+1  Fig. 4. Process of candidate generation Pruning Step Some candidates in NC sizek can be pruned earlier before counting. By definition, if a data sequence ds  n-contains a negative sequence ns  ds  pcontain  ns.mp In other word, if the support of ns.mp is less than min_sup  ns cannot be frequent in DB All the frequent maximum positive subsequences of the candidate negative sequences are the positive sequential patterns in DB All these positive sequential patterns had been discovered in Phase 1 and can be used to prune a candidate negative sequences ns by checking the support of ns.mp Additionally, we can exploit the properties of negative sequences to reduce the number of candidates. For example, a data sequence ds c\not n-cover   a b ds cannot n-cover any candidate sequence with leading subsequence a b the first element of ds is \(a b\is called the n-prefix of ns sizej In contrast ds could not n-cover  a c ds could n-cover a c d a e\difference between  b\<\(a c\ the last element. If the last element of the n-prefix is positive, we can use it to prune the candidate negative sequence. Similarly if the last element of the n-suffix is positive, we can use it to prune the candidate negative sequence. Thus ds   c n-cover e a c ds cannot n-cover a negative sequence ns sizen  e\222 1 e\222 2 205e\222 n-2 e\222 n-1 e n 222>, where e\222 n-2 e n-1  a n c\ther. The <\205\(e a c the n-suffix of ns sizen   3.2. Support Counting  PNSP adopts a hash-tree structure like GSP for storing candidates to reduce the number of candidates that need to be checked for each data sequence Originally, the hash-tree in GSP is designed to store candidates of the same length in the leaves. The leaf which a candidate should be placed in is the leaf reached by a consecutive ha shing on the items of the candidate. Nonetheless PNSP generates candidates of different lengths in each pa ss. Therefore, we modify the hashing procedure slightly to store the same prefixed candidates. If there are candidates of n  different lengths, we building n hash-trees Candidates would be placed in the same leaf if their leading items, starting from the first item, were hashed to the same node. The next item is used for hashing when an interior node, instead of a leaf node, is reached. The candidates requi red for checking against a data sequence are located in leaves reached by applying the hashing procedure on each item of the data sequence. The support of the candidate is increased by one if it is n-contained in the data sequence  3.3. Improvement by n-cover Checking  Checking whether a data sequence ds  n-cover a negative sequence ns is improved as follows. A candidate negative sequence ns  e\222 sizek  1 e\222 205e 2 k 222  where e i 222 is a negative itemset, both e i-1 222 and e i+1 222 are positive. Let d j  p-contain  e i-1 222 Checking e i 222 can be done in two steps. Step 1, we find the occurrence position of e i+1 222 from d j+2 to d t If no such position can be found ds does not n-cover ns Step 2, we check whether ds  p-contain  e i 222 from d j+1 to d n If no such e i 222  can be found, then e i+2 222 is checked. If d i  p-contains e i 222 we go backward to find an e i-1 222 from d i to d t Finally Step 1 and Step 2 are app lied recursively so that e i 222 can be checked  4. Experimental Results  Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to assess the performance of the PNSP algorithm implemented by using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. All experiments were performed on an AMD 2800+ PC with 1GB memory, running the Windows XP. The datasets in the experiment, DB1 of C10.T2.5.S4.I1.25 N10K.D100K and DB2 of C8.T8.S4.I4.N1K.D10K were generated by the well-known method in   for the details of the param e ters Fig. 5 shows that the total execution times of mining DB1 using two different miss_freqs for various min_sups The results of min_sup 3% and 2% were similar because only few patterns satisfied miss_freq  When min_sup was less than 1%, a large number of negative sequential patterns appeared so that the execution times were increased as min_sup decreased When miss_freq was increased from 97 % to 97.5 the number of negative itemsets increased from 7 to 23. The number of candidates grows exponentially as

the number of negative itemsets multiplies quickly The reason in that candidate sizen negative sequences are composed of m negative itemsets. The number of these itemsets approximately equals to number of sizek positive patterns multiply by the number of size n-k   negative itemsets. For instance, if the number of positive itemsets is 23 and the number of negative itemsets is 7, the number of candidates of NPN type equals 343 \(7 23 7\If the number of negative itemsets rises to 23, the number becomes 12161 23 23 23 ecution time increases exponentially Fig. 6 presents the total execution times of mining DB2 using different min_sups When min_sup was decreased or miss_freq was increased, a large number of negative sequential patterns were discovered so that the execution times were increased            C10-T2.5-S4-I2.5, |DB|=100K, N=10K 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 16000 18000 20000 0.8 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 Minimum support T o t a l execu ti on ti me  sec  miss_freq 97.5 miss_freq 97  Fig.  5.

We improve the usefulness of the patterns by introducing three constraints. The proposed  PNSP algorithm extends the GSP algorithm and discovers sequential patterns having multiple negative itemsets PSNP utilizes the properties of negative sequences to speed up the discovery of negative sequential patterns. Additionally, the proposed ncontain technique may efficiently check whether a data sequence contains negative sequences having multiple negative itemsets. The devised pruning technique is effective for reducing a large number of negative candidate patterns. The experimental results show that PNSP may discover negative sequential patterns for practical applications  7.

The media in the collection is analyzed by a variety of algorithms to generate metadata of different types. We use metadata based on camera capture information, low-level image processing semantic image understanding, facial processing and event clustering to gather a large set of diverse metadata. The media and associated metadata are represented as a transaction database, and frequent itemset mining is employed to detect frequently occurring groups of images that share several meta             Figure 7. An example of temporal recurring groups detected data in common. A confidence and interest measure relevant to the consumer domain is used to determine the quality of the frequent itemsets, and create a  list of the top "themes" within the collection. Since a variety of metadata types are included for every media in the collection, we are able to capture a broad variety of recurring themes without a priori knowledge of the themes in a given collection. Because the system also discovers frequent patterns that the user may be unaware of, the system seems to display intelligentŽ behavior by providing unexpected groupings that could not have been extracted by merely searching We also detect calendar-related recurring themes in multiyear collections. We define collections in terms of events, and represent them in an appropriate two-dimensional temporal space. We use density-based clustering followed by filtering to reduce the number of false matches in a group. Our approach detects personal special dates such as birthdays and anniversaries, seasonal activities and holidays celebrated. Since both the calendar-based groups and feature-based thematic groups detected are strictly data-driven \(with no a priori assumptions about a users collection\ they are customized to the type of content in specific users collections Further work in this area includes a user study to evaluate user reaction to these automatically generated narratives from their collection. Some of the user studies will focus on using the output of our method for slideshow-based reliving of a collection. We also plan to gather more collections with people and location metadata. Another direction of exploration is in improving the performance of scene, material and object classifiers by incorporating contextual information from seemingly unrelated metadata, as suggested by the frequent itemsets detected by our system. Also, further improvement of the precision of detecting recurrent themes can be obtained by incorporating the discrimination power of different features into the confidence score to avoid making groups based on generic features R EFERENCES  1  N.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
