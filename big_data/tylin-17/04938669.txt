An Improved Multiple Minimum Support Based Approach to Mine Rare Association Rules R Uday Kiran and P Krishna Reddy 
227 In this paper we have proposed an improved approach to extract rare association rules Rare association rules are the association rules containing rare items Rare items are less frequent items For extracting rare itemsets the single minimum support minsup based approaches like Apriori approach suffer from 223rare item problem\224 dilemma At high minsup value rare itemsets are missed and at low minsup value the number of frequent itemsets explodes To extract rare itemsets an effort has been made in the literature in which minsup of each item is 036xed equal to the percentage of its support Even though this approach improves the performance over single minsup based approaches 
it still suffers from 223rare item problem\224 dilemma If minsup for the item is 036xed by setting the percentage value high the rare itemsets are missed as the minsup for the rare items becomes close to their support and if minsup for the item is 036xed by setting the percentage value low the number of frequent itemsets explodes In this paper we propose an improved approach in which minsup is 036xed for each item based on the notion of 223support difference\224 The proposed approach assigns appropriate minsup values for frequent as well as rare items based on their item supports and reduces both 223rule missing\224 and 223rule explosion\224 problems Experimental results on both synthetic and real world datasets show that the proposed approach improves performance over existing approaches by minimizing the explosion of number of frequent itemsets involving frequent items and without missing the frequent itemsets involving rare items

The rare cases are more dif\336cult to detect and generalize from because they contain fewer data Realizing the importance of rare knowledge patterns pertaining to rare events research efforts are going on to investigate improved approaches to extract rare knowledge patterns like rare association rules and rare class identi\336cation In this paper we are investigating an improved approach to extract rare association rules Association rule mining is a popular knowledge pattern and has been extensively studied  8 The basic terminology about association rules is as follows Let I

that the items in the set

are frequently purchased items while the items in the set bed pillow are infrequently or rarely purchased items Even though bed pillow contains rare items it is interesting as it may generate more revenue in this case The popular approaches like Apriori discover association rules based on frequent itemsets which are extracted by 336xing the same or single minimum support for all items For extracting rare itemsets the single minimum support minsup based approaches suffer from 322rare item problem\323 dilemma  At high 
itemsets explode as huge number of frequent itemsets satisfy the minsup criteria In the literature efforts are being made to propose improved approaches to mine rare associations 11 12 13 In instead of 336xing single minsup v alue for all items the minsup value is calculated for each item based on the percentage of its support and frequent itemsets are extracted if an itemset satis\336ed the lowest minsup value of the items in it The support of an item is the ratio of frequency of an item by transaction dataset size In items are cate gorized into frequent and rare items Frequent itemsets involving only frequent items are extracted using single minsup approaches and frequent itemsets involving rare items are extracted using

missed as the support of the rare items is less than the given minsup In order to 336nd frequent itemsets involving rare items the minsup value should be 336xed at low value As a result the number of

data and to 336nd all Negative-Binomial frequent itemsets The approach proposed in e xtracts the association rules by considering only infrequent items i.e items having support less than minsup Among the existing approaches the percentage-based approach improves the performance over single minsup based approaches However it has been observed that it still suffers from both 322rule missing\323 and 322rule explosion\323 problems If minsup for the item is 336xed by setting the percentage value high the rare itemsets are missed as the minsup for the rare items becomes close to their support and if minsup for the item is 336xed by setting the percentage value low the number of frequent itemsets explodes The drawbacks of the other approaches are mentioned in the related work section In this paper we propose an improved approach by using the notion of 322support difference\323 SD in calculating minsup value for each item Through the notion of SD a constant difference is ensured between the item support and the corresponding minsup value for each item So by using the notion of SD the proposed approach successfully extracts the frequent itemsets involving rare items and limits the explosion of frequent itemsets involving frequent items The proposed approach also extracts frequent itemsets involving both frequent and rare items Experimental results on synthetic and real-world dataset show that the proposed approach discovers frequent itemsets involving rare items in an ef\336cient manner as compared to the existing approaches The paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we discuss the related work In Section 3 we explain the proposed approach and algorithm In Section 4 experiment results are presented The last section contains conclusions and future work II R ELATED W ORK In

for 336nding frequent itemsets These approaches use single minsup value for all data items to extract frequent itemsets Here we explain the 322rare item problem\323 dilemma faced by single minsup based approaches by considering Apriori approach The Apriori algorithm employs an iterative level-wise search for generating frequent itemsets An itemset is a set of items A candidate k-itemset refers to an itemset having 324k\325 number of items and frequent k-itemset refers to subset of candidate k-itemsets whose support is greater than or equal to userspeci\336ed 1 3 5 9  Mining of rare associations association rules involving rare items with single minsup approaches may cause 322rare item problem\323 dilemma The 322rare item problem\323 is as follows if and and  1 is generated ii is

than or equal to itemsets represented in bold is generated if an itemset support is greater than or equal to In Example 2 frequent itemsets pillow bed involving rare items is missed In order to extract frequent itemset pillow bed are interesting The other frequent 2-itemset is uninteresting because items To improve the performance of extracting frequent itemsets involving rare items an approach known as Multiple Support Apriori MSApriori has been proposed in In this approach each item is assigned with a minsup value known as 322Minimum Item Support\323 MIS and frequent itemsets are generated if an itemset satis\336es the lowest MIS value among the respective items The MIS value is assigned to each item 


Example 4 Example 5  I the MIS is the number of transactions in a transaction dataset and LS corresponds to user-speci\336ed least support value In this method as the MIS values for the items are derived based on the percentage of their supports frequent items are assigned with higher MIS values and rare items are assigned with relatively lower MIS values For an itemset containing only frequent items to be a frequent itemset it has to satisfy relatively higher minsup than the itemset containing frequent and rare items or only rare items So the MSApriori approach improves the performance over single minsup based approaches by addressing the 322rare item problem\323 The working of MSApriori is illustrated in Example 4 is  f with itself From C    002 minsup j j j j j j j j j L Consider four items Bread Beer Pillow and Bed having supports 44 36 10 and 5 1 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 2 LS i i 002 S i i i N 002 002 002  0.75 and LS=20 Here the notations 324S\325 and 324mis\325 indicates the support percentage and minimum item support percentage values respectively It was observed that MSApriori still suffers from the 322rare item problem\323 dilemma if items support vary widely The reason is as follows for a user-speci\336ed proportion    MIS is calculated by using the Equation 1 From C Fig 1 Working of Apriori Algorithm at minsup=40 Here the notation 324S\325 indicates the support percentage Fig 2 Working of Apriori Algorithm at minsup=20 Here the notation 324S\325 indicates the support percentage equal to a percentage of its support For every item Fig 3 Working of MSApriori algorithm with refers to support of an item equal to f   002S MIS       t theL i i i i LS else    The working of MSApriori for the transaction dataset shown in Table I is depicted in Figure 3 by considering C 1 is set very low fails to get generated in MSApriori since candidate itemset if\002S   and is a user-speci\336ed proportional value which can be varied between 0 to 1  represents frequency of 0.75 and LS=20 After calculating C is generated with the items whose support is greater than or equal to their respective MIS From L is generated by joining L bread jam bat ball  Note that the uninteresting frequent 2itemset  is calculated as per Equation 1 where bread ball which had been generated using Apriori algorithm when bread ball value as we move from frequent items to relatively rare items the difference between the support of an item and its MIS is not constant rather decreases As a result MSApriori suffers from the following problems 1 If  is generated if an itemset satis\336es the lowest MIS value of the items in it The generated L pillow bed do not satisfy the low MIS value 40 among the items in the itemset is set high it can be observed that MIS for rare items will be relatively more close almost equivalent to their supports as compared with frequent items As a result itemsets containing rare items fail to satisfy the support of lowest MIS rare item in that itemset So frequent itemsets involving rare items are missed 


C Other approaches A Basic Idea minsup mRsup value is set to low which is equal to 0.3 When Example 6 SD 212 212 004 is uninteresting because knowing the fact that 20 of the customers bought the two items together is useless The reason is the items 324bread\325 and 324ball\325 are frequently purchased items in a supermarket For this itemset to be useful it should have satis\336ed higher minimum support i.e 32 In the literature another approach known as Relative Support Apriori Algorithm RSAA has been proposed for discovering frequent itemsets involving both frequent and rare items In discovering frequent itemsets RSAA uses three userspeci\336ed measures 336rst support j j j s 003 j j j j      support difference SD when SD SD 1 002 002 002 002 s s s s s S i support difference LS  Ho we v er  this approach f ails to discover associations between frequent and rare items In this paper we have proposed an improved approach by using the notion of to specify the minimum supports to items Support difference SD refers to the acceptable deviation of an item from its frequency or support so that an itemset involving that item can be considered as a frequent itemset For each item 324i 2  respectively With  s   s   MIS  n n      013 013 212  s i i S i  is as follows 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 1 2 Pillow Bed 3 LS otherwise Rsup Rsup In this approach we use the notion of 002   0.9 and LS=1 the MIS values for Bread Beer Pillow and Bed comes to approximately 40 32 9 and 4.5 respectively Note that our interest is to extract rare itemsets which contain the item 322Bed\323 It can be observed that for the rare item like 322Bed\323 the difference between its support and MIS is relatively less 5 4.5  0.5 as compared with relatively frequent item like Bread 44 40  4 Hence as the itemset length increases more items are combined the itemsets containing item 322Bed\323 fail to satisfy the support equivalent to support of the item 322Bed\323 So frequent itemsets involving 322Bed\323 are missed 2 To facilitate participation of rare items MIS for the rare items have to be less than their support values It can be achieved by setting low value However this may cause frequent items to set very low MIS values With low MIS values for frequent items the items will be associating with one another in all possible ways thereby generating a huge number of frequent itemsets 0.3 and LS=1 the MIS\(Bread which contains the rare item 322bed\323 is generated However it can be observed that due to low bread ball also becomes frequent The itemset  Items having support greater than or equal to are considered frequent items and the items having support less than An approach is proposed in by utilizing the kno wledge of the process for generating transaction data by applying a stochastic mixture model known as negative binomial NB distribution This model along with a user-speci\336ed precision threshold 336nds local frequency thresholds for groups of itemsets based on which algorithm 336nds all NB-frequent itemsets in a dataset This model considers highly skewed data skewed towards right with the underlying assumption of Poisson processes and Gamma mixing distribution This model can effectively be implemented in the datasets like general web logs etc which are exponentially distributed However this approach is not effective on other datasets like general super market datasets which are generally not exponentially distributed The reason is frequent items will distort the mean and the variance and thus will lead to a model which grossly overestimates the probability of seeing items with high frequencies If we remove items of high frequencies as suggested in the approach we may miss some interesting frequent itemsets pertaining to frequent items An approach has been suggested to mine the association rules by considering only infrequent items i.e items having support less than 325 calculation of minsup known as minimum item support MIS\(i where S\(i 325 and LS refer to the user-speci\336ed least support Using SD MIS for the items range from 12 MIS\(pillow and MIS\(Bed For the rare item 324Bed\325 the difference between its support and MIS is 5 1.5  3.5 is relatively higher than the previous value As a result frequent itemset like bread ball  second support and greater than or equal to  The proposed approach is different from MSApriori as it follows a different method to assign minsup for each items It also differs from RSAA approach as it requires only two measures instead of three measures used in RSAA The approaches proposed in and deal with frequent itemsets in v olving only rare items whereas the proposed approach extracts frequent itemsets involving both frequent and rare items III P ROPOSED APPROACH Continuing from Example 5 to facilitate participation of rare items like 324Bed\325 13 MIS\(Beer value the uninteresting 2-itemset  and relative support are considered as rare items If an itemset contains only frequent items it

issue in this algorithm is providing values to these parameters for the given dataset  refers to support of item 324  To prevent MIS values of the items in reaching 0 or lower we use concept of least

V C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have proposed an improved approach to extract frequent itemsets involving rare items to discover rare association rules In the proposed approach the minimum support for each item is calculated using the notion of 322support difference\323 The proposed approach dynamically assigns appropriate minimum support to each item so that frequent itemsets involving rare items can be extracted in a more ef\336cient manner as compared to the existing approaches Most important the proposed approach ensures that the difference between the support of an item and the corresponding minimum support remains constant for all items including rare items As a result it ef\336ciently reduces the explosion of frequent itemsets involving frequent items without affecting the extraction of frequent itemsets involving rare items We have evaluated the performance of the proposed approach by conducting experimental results on both synthetic and real world datasets The results show that as compared to existing approaches the proposed approach prunes frequent itemsets involving frequent items in a more ef\336cient manner and without missing the frequent itemsets involving rare items As a part of future work we are planning to investigate the following 200 200 The existing approaches extract frequent itemsets involving rare items by assigning minimum support to each item and employing an iterative process to discover frequent itemsets We are going to investigate how popular non-iterative approaches like frequent-pattern growth FPgrowth approaches can be extended to assign minimum support to each item to extract frequent itemsets involving rare items A CKNOWLEDGEMENT This work is supported by 322Nokia\323 Findland and 322Media Lab Asia\323 India The authors are thankful to the anonymous referees for their useful comments R EFERENCES  Melli G Osmar  R Z and Kitts B 322Introduction to the Special Issue on Successful Real-World Data Mining Applications.\323 SIGKDD Explorations Volume 8 Issue 1 2006  Agra w al R Imielinski T  and Sw ami A 322Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases.\323 SIGMOD 1993 pp 207-216  Agra w al R and Srikanth R 322F ast algorithms for mining association rules.\323 VLDB 1994  Xu R 322Surv e y of Clustering Algorithms 323 IEEE T ransactions on Neural Networks Volume 16 Number 3 May 2005  W eiss S and K ulik o wski C A 322Computer Systems that Learn Classi\336cation and Prediction Methods from Statistics Neural Nets Machine Learning and Expert Systems.\323 Morgan Kaufmann 1991  W eiss G M 322Mining W ith Rarity A Unifying Frame w ork 323 SIGKDD Explorations 2004 Vol 6 Issue 1 pp 7 19  J ia wei H Jian P  Y iwen Y  and Run ying M 322Mining Frequent Patterns without Candidate Generation A Frequent-Pattern Tree Approach*.\323 DMKD 2004 pp 53-87  Rajanish D and Amb uj M 322F ast Frequent P attern Mining in RealTime.\323 CSI 2005 pp 156 167  Mannila H 322Methods and Problems in Data Mining 323 ICDT  1997  Liu B Hsu W  and Ma Y  322Mining Association Rules with Multiple Minimum Supports.\323 SIGKDD Explorations 1999  Y un H Ha D Hw ang B and Ryu K H 322Mining association rules on signi\336cant rare data using relative support.\323 The Journal of Systems and Software 67 2003 pp 181-191  Hahsler  M 322 A Model-Based Frequenc y Constraint for Mining Associations from Transaction Data.\323 DMKD Springer Science and Business Media 2006 pp 137-166  Zhou L and Y au S 322 Association Rule and Quantitati v e Association Rule Mining among Infrequent Items.\323 MDM 2007 pp 156-167  Hipp J Guntzer  U Nakhaeizadeh G 322 Algorithms for Association Rule Mining A General Survey and Comparision.\323 SIGKDD 2000 Volume 2 Issue 1 pp 50-64.\325  Lee W  Stolfo S and Mok K W  322Mining audit data to b uild intrusion detection models.\323 SIGKDD 1998  T an P  and K umar  V  322Interestingness Measures for Association Patterns  A Perspective\323 SIGKDD 2002  Ross S M 322Introductory Statistics\323 Second Edition Mor g an kaufmann publishers 2005 In this paper we have investigated how to improve the performance of extracting frequent itemsets involving rare items After extracting frequent itemsets association rules are discovered by 336xing the same minimum con\336dence value for all the rules As a part of future work we are going to investigate appropriate methodology for assigning con\336dence values in a dynamic manner to generate rare association rules in an ef\336cient manner 


on the number of lters the total cost is dominated by the candidate ltering cost which explains the latter increase Among all of the tested cases the total cost is the smallest when f is 3  conﬁrming our derivation in Section IV-D C Effect of Data Skewness We conduct experiments to evaluate the effect of data skewness on the performance of netFilter Figure 7\(a and b show the results under different 003 values data skewness with n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We adopt the optimal setting for netFilter obtained from similar experiments as in the above two subsections the lter size is set to 100 and the number of lters is set to 3 and 5 under n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We include the communication cost incurred by the naive approach for comparison For readability the y-axis is on log scale From these gures we can see that the cost incurred by netFilter is much smaller than that incurred by the naive approach For instance with n as 10 6 thecost incurred by netFilter is only 2  5 of that incurred by the naive approach In addition the cost incurred by both netFilter and the naive approach decreases with the data skewness For netFilter this is explained by the improved ltering performance under very skewed data For the naive approach as the data skewness increases the average number of distinct items that a peer propagates along the hierarchy is reduced resulting in reduced communication cost 1000 10000 100000 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness 001  netFilter  naive  1000 10000 100000 1e+06 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness

Figure 8 shows the results with 002 set to 0  1  0  01 and 0  001  Again we adopt the optimal setting for netFilter the size of lter and number of lters are set to 10 6 under 002  0.1 100 5 under 002  0.01 and 1000 2 under 002 0  001  From this gure we can see when the threshold ratio incr eases the communication cost decreases This is as expected since larger threshold implies less number of items satisﬁes the threshold condition VI C ONCLUSION The need of identifying frequent items IFI appears in a variety of P2P applications In this study we investigate the problem of IFI in unstructured P2P

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
