Research on Algorithm for Mining Fre quent Closed Itemsets over Data Stream Wang yan,Lai sheng,Wang xiuxia,Tong geming School of Computer Science and Communication Lanzhou  University of Technology Lanzhou, China wangyan@lut.cn   Abstract This paper presents a new efficient algorithm for mining frequent closed itemsets in sliding windows over data streams. It divides the sliding window into several basic windows. The basic window of a sliding window was served as an updating unit in this algorit hm. And all potential frequent closed itemsets of every basic window were mined by compareing the support and relationship of inclusion between itemsets. Those itemsets were stored in a new data structure And the frequent closed itemsets in a sliding window could be rapidly found based on the new data structure. The experimental result shows the feasibility and effectiveness of the algorithm Keywords - data stream, frequent itemsets, frequent closed itemsets, sliding window I  I NTRODUCTION  With the development of information globalization, the amount of information is exponential  growth. Appeared large amounts of information with the carrying form of data stream 1 For instance, phone record data stream in the field of communication, data stream of clients click on the web data packet stream in the ne twork monitoring, detectable data stream among various sensor network, stock data stream in the area of finance and other transaction data stream in the retail trade etc However, these data or their general information can only be restored in order and read once or limited times. How to process these data stream quickly within restricted spa ce to obtain useful information has significance for our resear ch. In recent years, frequent itemsets as an important content of data stream mining research gets the worldwide st udy. However, in the situation of smaller minimum support threshold or dense dataset, it makes clients difficulty understand  mining result well and find  valuable information quickly. In 1999, Pasquier put forward a new perception frequent closed itemsets 2 which sustains the support of subset and whose number is far less than frequent itemsets. In that case, if we just mine  frequent closed itemsets in data stream, it can save a lot of memory and improve efficiency, especi ally for some applications which have long patterns, strong patterns or lower support threshold. The algorithm of mining frequent closed itemsets has become a research focus Many effective algorithms have been proposed Pasquier proposed A-close algorithm 2 is the first algorithm for mining frequent closed itemsets. The key of this method is to create generating subset. Once all subset is found, it can make sure their closure and get all frequent closed itemsets by scanning database one time. Although the algorithm shrinks detection space and improves efficiency problems of high CPU-spending in pattern match and I/Ospending in scanning database aren’t still resovled. Then J.Han proposed CLOSET 3 and CLOSET 4 algorithm which inherited FP-Tree data structure of FP-Growth 5  algorithm. With most algorithms based on FP-tree the same CLOSET algorithm is divided into two steps: Firstly, scan database and create FP-tree Secondly, mine FP-tree and improve the mining efficiency through the technology of item merging and subset pruning. However, this algorithm still has its limitations: It requires mining process to use recursion to build a large number of conditions of FP-Tree that would store it into memory until the end of recursion and then restart to count the support and sort for each item So, this is a operation that n eed a lot of time and space increase the difficulty to achieve. The key of Moment algorithm 6 is a data structure called CET\(Closed Enumeration Tree\ich is maintained in memory. This algorithm divides nodes into four styles: Infrequent node, Unpromising node, Intermediate node and Closed node. This algorithm has different treatment with these types. It uses a precise algorithm model, but needs to maintain and update frequently the information, so it will affect its efficiency In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm for mining frequent closed itemsets over data stream based on sliding window model: DSMCFI. This algorithm uses a new storage structure DSMCFI-Tr ee to store all the critical frequent closed itemsets in sliding window, and real-time updates and maintains this structure with the sliding window continuous sliding. Finally it can mine out all frequent closed itemsets in sliding window II  D ESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEMS AND RELATED DEFINITIONS 7-9  Let an set of m distinct items      2 1 m I I I I 000\026 000 an itemset is a subset of I The data stream DS is composed of constantly arrived and dynamic growth transactions denoted as      3 2 1 000\026 T T T DS 000 where the transaction 000\013 000\014 000\026  3  2  1 000 i T i is composed of the items of I i.e I T i 000  Definition 1 \(Sliding Window The data stream DS divided into several segments, each segment correspondence a

certain number of subsequence of the data stream, such a data segment is called a basic window, denoted as BW The sliding window SW is composed of a certain number of continuous basic windows, denoted as k BW BW BW    2 1 000\026  where k is a fixed value With the arrival of new data, the basic window of sliding window as an updating unit was continuously update. When a new basic window 1 000\016 k BW came into, the outdated basic window 1 BW must be deleted, the sliding window will be updated once. Therefore, the data in the sliding window is changing and updating constantly Let an itemset X is a non-empty subset of I i.e I X 000 An itemset with k items is called a k-itemset. The frequency of an itemset X denoted as 000\013 000\014 X freq is the number of transactions in window \(sliding window or basic window\ that contain X The support of an itemset X  denoted as 000\013\000\014 X sup is the ratio of 000\013\000\014 X freq and the total number transactions in window, i.e 000\013\000\014 000\013 000\014 W X freq X 000 sup  Definition 2  \(Frequent Iitemset Given minimum support threshold s and allowable error 000H the itemset X is called a Frequent Iitemset \(FI 000\013\000\014 s X 000 sup the itemset X is called a critical frequent itemset if 000\013\000\014 s X 000d 000\037 sup 000H the itemset X is called a infrequent itemset if 000\013\000\014 000H 000d X sup  Definition 3  Frequent Closed Itemset Let an itemset X  and I X 000  X is called a Frequent Closed Itemset\(CFI\f X is an F I and there be  exists no FI Y that Y X 000 and 000\013\000\014 000\013 000\014 X Y sup sup 000  According to the definition of frequent closed itemsets there is the following property Property 1 Any frequent itemset X if there be exists a superset Y and 000\013\000\014 000\013 000\014 X Y sup sup 000z then the frequent itemset X must be not frequent closed itemset; In the contrary, it must be frequent closed itemset Property 2 The frequent itemsets sorted to the dictionary order, if 1 000\016 i FI is not the superset of that i FI i.e 1 000\016 000 i i FI FI  then 000\013\000\014 1 000 000\016 n FI n i is also not a superset of i FI  III  T HE D ESCRIPTION OF A LGORITHM  The DSMCFI algorithm us ed the sliding window processing model. When the first basic window come into the sliding window, the algorithm generated a critical frequent 1-itemset sort tabl e f-list which frequency is descending order and real-time update f-list when new basic window entered the sliding window. Then the critical frequent itemsets of window sorted to the dictionary order  in accordance with the f-list, and mined critical frequent closed itemsets by comparing the itemsets inclusion relationship and the support   The algorithm used DSMCFI-Tree structure to store the critical frequent closed itemsets in sliding window. When a new basic window came into the sliding window, the algorithm reconstruct the DSMCFITree according to the updated f-list. In the reconstruction process, delete outdated information of basic window, and the critical frequent closed itemsets in each basic window rearrange by f-list, and then in sert those into DSMCFI-Tree This make that the items with higher frequency appear in the closer position from the root. So more pattern can share the same prefix, and increase th e efficiency of compression The algorithm is divided into 5 steps  1\Update the f-list 2\ pruning of DSMCFI-Tree; \(3\ Reconstruct the DSMCFI-Tree; \(4\ine the critical frequent closed itemsets in new basic window and insert into DSMCFITree; \(5\he output of frequent closed itemsets A  The Structure of DSMCFI-Tree In this paper, we used DSMCFI-Tree, a new compression storage structure to store critical frequent closed itemsets of sliding window. It consisted of the root node\(denoted as null\prefix subtree of critical frequent closed itemsets and BW-list which record the information of basic window. The node of DSMCFI-Tree structure is divided into two types 1 The End Node The type node is the last node of a critical frequent closed itemsets in a branch. Domain of the type node is denoded as \(item, f, f i link i item represents item-name of the node; f represents  the frequency of this node in this branch; f i  represents the frequency of the critical frequent closed itemsets in the ith basic window link i represents that point to another the end node of critical frequent closed itemsets in the same basic window BW i   2 The Intermediate Node The type node is not the end node of any critical frequent closed itemsets in a branch Such node is composed of th e two domains, denoded as item, f\e item represents the item-name of this node; f represents that the frequency of the node in this branch BW-list is composed of BW i link that point to the end node of the last critical freque nt closed itemsets in each basic window We called the tree that meet the characteristics to DSMCFI-Tree. The DSMCFI-Tr ee structure is shown in Fig.1. This picture shows the information of a sliding window that contains three basic windows. Included in basic window critical frequent closed itemsets were: BW 1  cbda:2\\(cb:3\BW 2 da:2\ and BW 3 bd:2 ca:3\}. In the branch cbda the nodes b’, ‘d’, ‘a  are the end node. The node b is the end node of the critical frequent closed itemsets {cb} in basic window BW 1 The node d is the end node of the critical frequent closed itemsets {cbd} in basic window BW 2 The node a is a end null b:7 c:10 a:3 d:2 b:2 a:2 d:2 d:4 a:2 BW 1 link BW 2 link BW 3 link item f b 2 f 3 item f d 2 2 link tid BW-list null b:7 c:10 a:3 d:2 b:2 a:2 d:2 d:4 a:2 BW 1 link BW 2 link BW 3 link BW 1 link BW 2 link BW 3 link item f b 2 item f b 2 f 3 item f d 2 2 link tid f 3 item f d 2 item f d 2 2 link tid BW-list  Figure1.

node of the critical frequent closed itemsets {cbda} in basic window BW 1 The node c is the intermediate node in the branch cbda. Therefore, the end node and intermediate node are considered  in a branch rather than in DSMCFI-Tree structure. Because {cbda}, {cb} are the first and second critical frequent closed itemsets of the basic window BW 1  so the b.link of the end node b which comes from {cb point to the end node a of {cbda}, and the BW 1 link of BW-list points to the end node b of the last critical frequent closed itemsets in basic window BW 1  B  Realizing the Algorithm DSMCFI The sliding window SW contains k continuous basic windows BW i where 1 000 i 000 k. In this paper, we used f-list structure as in Procedure 1: Fast pruning of DSMCFI-Tree When the sliding window has include the k basic windows, due to the arrival of a new basic window, we must delete the information of outdated basic window BW 1  Because we designed the BW-list we just find and delete all critical frequent closed itemsets in the basic window BW 1  from the BW 1 link of BW-list. In the sliding window as shown in Fig.1, when a new basic window BW 4 arrived deleted the outdated basic window BW 1 From the BW 1 link of BW-list, find the end node b of the last critical frequent closed itemsets {cb} in the basic window BW 1 then let BW 1 link=b.link 1 Let BW 1 link points to the end node a  of another critical frequent closed itemsets {cbda} in BW 1  The frequency f of all nodes of {cb  subtracted b.f 1 and deleted the nodes which f=0. Repeat the above process until all the critical frequent closed itemsets in BW 1 deleted. Fig.2 shows the DSMCFI-Tree structur e which deleted all critical frequent closed itemsets of the basic window BW 1 in Fig.1 The specific Procedure is as follows Delete \(DSMCFI-Tree,1,k Input: DSMCFI-Tree store all critical frequent closed itemsets of the k basic windows Output: Delete the DSMCFI-Tree after BW 1   1  if\(DSMCFI-Tree is not empty 2  find the end node e of the last critical frequent closed itemsets fp in BW 1 by BW-list 3  if\(e.link 1 000 null 4  BW 1 link=e.link 1  5  for each e i 015 fp do begin 6  e i f= e i f-e.f 1  7  if\(e i f=0 8  delete e i  9  e= BW 1 link 10  else {for each e i 015 fp do begin 11  e i f= e i f-e.f 1  12  if\(e i f=0 13  delete e i  14  for\(i=2;i<k;i 15  BW i link = BW i+1 link 16  BW k link=null 17  return DSMCFI-Tree null b:2 c:5 a:3 d:2 b:2 a:2 d:2 d:2 BW 1 link BW 2 link BW 3 link BW-list null b:2 c:5 a:3 d:2 b:2 a:2 d:2 d:2 BW 1 link BW 2 link BW 3 link BW 1 link BW 2 link BW 3 link BW-list  Figure2.

Fig.3 shows the updated f-list when the BW 4 bac:2\ \(abd:2\rrived The DSMCFI-Tree which is shown in Fig.2 is reconstruct Firstly, we create a new empty DSMCFI-Tree; and then find the end node a of the last critical frequent closed itemsets da} in the basic window BW 1 by the BW 1 link of BW-link and let BW 1 link=a.link 1 make BW 1 link points to another the end node d of critical frequent closed itemsets {cbd removed the {da}, and rearranged {da} to {ad} in accordance with the updat ed f-list, then inserted it into the new DSMCFI-Tree. And then found another critical frequent closed itemsets {cbd} in BW 1 by BW 1 link removed {cbd}, rearranged {cbd} to {bcd} by the updated f-list , and inserted it into the new DSMCFI-Tree as the second critical frequent closed itemsets of BW 1 and c.link 1  of the end node c of {bdc} point to the end node d of ad}.

Therefore, we only need mine the critical frequent closed itemset from critical frequent itemset of each basic window. It can ensure that mine all frequent closed itemsets of sliding window.

DSMCFI algorithm memory consumption From the Fig.5 and Fig.6, we can conclude when the support is fixed, the runtime and memory consumption gradually tend to be stable, but the upward trend was evident in the first 4 basic windows.    Since then  they won’t be increased with the coming of ba sic window. So the algorithm can be used for data stream environment. In this experiment the sliding window is composed of 4 basic windows. In the first 4 basic windows, when each basic window arrived, the number of critical frequent closed itemset is increased in the sliding window. So the number of critical frequent closed itemsets in DSCFI-Tree is also arised. Accordingly, the runtime and the memory consumption will increase during the reconstruct  DSMCFI-Tree. When the number of basic sliding window in sliding window will not change, the runtime and the memory consumption tend to be stable  V  C ONCLUSION  According to the feature of data stream, in this paper, we proposed a new algorithm DSMCFI for mining closed frequent itemsets in data stream which can quickly mine frequent closed itemsets in sliding window. The algorithm used DSMCFI-Tree to dynamica lly record the change of frequent closed itemsets in sliding window. It also can the incrementally update. We can quickly find all frequent closed itemsets in the sliding window with DSMCFI-Tree A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This paper is partially supported by scientific research projects of Gansu Education Department \(No.0803-07 china R EFERENCES     Kyriakos KI.

V C ONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we have proposed an improved approach to extract frequent itemsets involving rare items to discover rare association rules In the proposed approach the minimum support for each item is calculated using the notion of 322support difference\323 The proposed approach dynamically assigns appropriate minimum support to each item so that frequent itemsets involving rare items can be extracted in a more ef\336cient manner as compared to the existing approaches Most important the proposed approach ensures that the difference between the support of an item and the corresponding minimum support remains constant for all items including rare items As a result it ef\336ciently reduces the explosion of frequent itemsets involving frequent items without affecting the extraction of frequent itemsets involving rare items We have evaluated the performance of the proposed approach by conducting experimental results on both synthetic and real world datasets The results show that as compared to existing approaches the proposed approach prunes frequent itemsets involving frequent items in a more ef\336cient manner and without missing the frequent itemsets involving rare items As a part of future work we are planning to investigate the following 200 200 The existing approaches extract frequent itemsets involving rare items by assigning minimum support to each item and employing an iterative process to discover frequent itemsets We are going to investigate how popular non-iterative approaches like frequent-pattern growth FPgrowth approaches can be extended to assign minimum support to each item to extract frequent itemsets involving rare items A CKNOWLEDGEMENT This work is supported by 322Nokia\323 Findland and 322Media Lab Asia\323 India The authors are thankful to the anonymous referees for their useful comments R EFERENCES  Melli G Osmar  R Z and Kitts B 322Introduction to the Special Issue on Successful Real-World Data Mining Applications.\323 SIGKDD Explorations Volume 8 Issue 1 2006  Agra w al R Imielinski T  and Sw ami A 322Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases.\323 SIGMOD 1993 pp 207-216  Agra w al R and Srikanth R 322F ast algorithms for mining association rules.\323 VLDB 1994  Xu R 322Surv e y of Clustering Algorithms 323 IEEE T ransactions on Neural Networks Volume 16 Number 3 May 2005  W eiss S and K ulik o wski C A 322Computer Systems that Learn Classi\336cation and Prediction Methods from Statistics Neural Nets Machine Learning and Expert Systems.\323 Morgan Kaufmann 1991  W eiss G M 322Mining W ith Rarity A Unifying Frame w ork 323 SIGKDD Explorations 2004 Vol 6 Issue 1 pp 7 19  J ia wei H Jian P  Y iwen Y  and Run ying M 322Mining Frequent Patterns without Candidate Generation A Frequent-Pattern Tree Approach*.\323 DMKD 2004 pp 53-87  Rajanish D and Amb uj M 322F ast Frequent P attern Mining in RealTime.\323 CSI 2005 pp 156 167  Mannila H 322Methods and Problems in Data Mining 323 ICDT  1997  Liu B Hsu W  and Ma Y  322Mining Association Rules with Multiple Minimum Supports.\323 SIGKDD Explorations 1999  Y un H Ha D Hw ang B and Ryu K H 322Mining association rules on signi\336cant rare data using relative support.\323 The Journal of Systems and Software 67 2003 pp 181-191  Hahsler  M 322 A Model-Based Frequenc y Constraint for Mining Associations from Transaction Data.\323 DMKD Springer Science and Business Media 2006 pp 137-166  Zhou L and Y au S 322 Association Rule and Quantitati v e Association Rule Mining among Infrequent Items.\323 MDM 2007 pp 156-167  Hipp J Guntzer  U Nakhaeizadeh G 322 Algorithms for Association Rule Mining A General Survey and Comparision.\323 SIGKDD 2000 Volume 2 Issue 1 pp 50-64.\325  Lee W  Stolfo S and Mok K W  322Mining audit data to b uild intrusion detection models.\323 SIGKDD 1998  T an P  and K umar  V  322Interestingness Measures for Association Patterns  A Perspective\323 SIGKDD 2002  Ross S M 322Introductory Statistics\323 Second Edition Mor g an kaufmann publishers 2005 In this paper we have investigated how to improve the performance of extracting frequent itemsets involving rare items After extracting frequent itemsets association rules are discovered by 336xing the same minimum con\336dence value for all the rules As a part of future work we are going to investigate appropriate methodology for assigning con\336dence values in a dynamic manner to generate rare association rules in an ef\336cient manner 


on the number of lters the total cost is dominated by the candidate ltering cost which explains the latter increase Among all of the tested cases the total cost is the smallest when f is 3  conÞrming our derivation in Section IV-D C Effect of Data Skewness We conduct experiments to evaluate the effect of data skewness on the performance of netFilter Figure 7\(a and b show the results under different 003 values data skewness with n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We adopt the optimal setting for netFilter obtained from similar experiments as in the above two subsections the lter size is set to 100 and the number of lters is set to 3 and 5 under n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We include the communication cost incurred by the naive approach for comparison For readability the y-axis is on log scale From these gures we can see that the cost incurred by netFilter is much smaller than that incurred by the naive approach For instance with n as 10 6 thecost incurred by netFilter is only 2  5 of that incurred by the naive approach In addition the cost incurred by both netFilter and the naive approach decreases with the data skewness For netFilter this is explained by the improved ltering performance under very skewed data For the naive approach as the data skewness increases the average number of distinct items that a peer propagates along the hierarchy is reduced resulting in reduced communication cost 1000 10000 100000 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness 001  netFilter  naive  1000 10000 100000 1e+06 0 1 2 3 4 5 communication cost \(bytes data skewness

Figure 8 shows the results with 002 set to 0  1  0  01 and 0  001  Again we adopt the optimal setting for netFilter the size of lter and number of lters are set to 10 6 under 002  0.1 100 5 under 002  0.01 and 1000 2 under 002 0  001  From this gure we can see when the threshold ratio incr eases the communication cost decreases This is as expected since larger threshold implies less number of items satisÞes the threshold condition VI C ONCLUSION The need of identifying frequent items IFI appears in a variety of P2P applications In this study we investigate the problem of IFI in unstructured P2P

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con“gurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con“gure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef“ciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/˜manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
