A New Data Layout For Set Intersection on GPUs Rasmus Resen Amossen and Rasmus Pagh IT University of Copenhagen Denmark Email  resen,pagh  itu.dk Abstract Set intersection is the core in a variety of problems e.g frequent itemset mining and sparse boolean matrix multiplication It is well-known that large speed gains can for some computational problems be obtained by using a graphics processing unit GPU as a massively parallel computing device However GPUs require highly regular control ow and memory access patterns and for this reason previous GPU methods for intersecting sets have used a simple bitmap representation This representation requires excessive space on sparse data sets In this paper we present a novel data layout B AT M AP  that is particularly well suited for parallel processing and is compact even for sparse data Frequent itemset mining is one of the most important 
applications of set intersection As a case-study on the potential of B AT M AP s we focus on frequent pair mining  which is a core special case of frequent itemset mining The main nding is that our method is able to achieve speedups over both Apriori and FP-growth when the number of distinct items is large and the density of the problem instance is above 1 Previous implementations of frequent itemset mining on GPU have not been able to show speedups over the best single-threaded implementations Keywords Set intersection Frequent itemset mining Sparse boolean matrix multiplication Data layout GPU I I NTRODUCTION Graphics processing units GPUs are currently the technology that gives the largest computing power per dollar measured in oating-point operations per second Developing algorithms for GPU computation is challenging since the architecture imposes many requirements on the way algorithms work if the potential is to be fully utilized In particular programs need to be structured in identical 
threads with as little conditional code as possible i.e having regular control ow such that all threads can run the same instruction at the same time Also the memory access pattern of threads that execute together needs to be highly regular to approach the theoretical bandwidth of the GPU memory For computation intensive tasks the availability of hundreds of processing units has resulted in large speedups compared to CPU computation see e.g the survey Even for data intensive tasks such as sorting advantage over CPU computation has been demonstrated see e.g 15  Many computational problems depend on being able to perform set intersection efﬁciently For example  in boolean matrix multiplication of two matrices M and M   we want to nd all pairs  i j  for which  k  M i,k 
M  k,j  0  or equivalently for A i   j  M i,j  0  and B j   i  M  i,j  0   the pairs  i j  for which A i  B j     in a database context we might ask for a join-project of two tables i.e a join of two tables followed by a 
duplicate eliminating projection that projects away the join attribute This is equivalent to sparse boolean matrix multiplication and thus dependent on ef cient set intersection as well  frequent itemset mining asks given a set of transactions T 1 T m  where T i   1 n   to report all sets S   1 n  having support at least s in the transactions The support of S is deﬁned as the number of transactions that have S as a subset The special case where itemsets are limited to size two where only item 
pairs are found is also the core problem when larger itemsets are allowed and frequent itemset mining in general therefore reduces to efﬁcient set intersection  all conjuctive queries can be thought of as set intersections given a dataset D  and two pre-processed subsets of data f g  D   0  1   D   the conjuctive query  d  D  f  d   g  d   is exactly equivalent to an intersection 
In this paper we consider the general problem of intersecting sets However we use frequent itemset mining as a case study throughout the text as it is one of the most studied problems that can be solved by reduction to multiple set intersections We furthermore focus on itemsets of size two frequent pair mining since this special case already has many applications such as nding binary associations and is highly challenging when there are many frequent items At the end of the paper we outline how our approach could be generalized to deal with larger itemsets Set representations in frequent itemset mining There are two principal ways of representing a set of transactions In the standard horizontal format the transactions are stored one by one possibly sorted whereas the vertical format stores for each item i  the set S i of indices of transactions that contain i  This set is sometimes referred to as the tidlist 
of i  Observe that nding the support of  i j  is simply a matter of computing  S i  S j   If S i and S j are stored in sorted order it is an easy task to do this in time O   S i    S j    If the number of distinct items n is large we see that it is easy to parallelize the computation of all support counts simply distribute the intersections among the processors such that

each processor is responsible for support counts involving a small number of items For some data sets especially sparse ones it may be faster to use a horizontal layout and maintain a data structure that counts the occurrences of all pairs Then the time spent on a pair  i j  is proportional to the support of  i j  rather than to the sum of support of  i  and  j   However this approach may use excessive space when there are many pairs of frequent items In parallel and distributed settings the high space usage translates into either using an expensive shared memory or a phase where the support counts from different parts of the transactions are combined In either case the communication among processes becomes a bottleneck as the number of frequent items grows A This paper Theoretical contribution We present a new data format for sets B AT M AP  that is especially well-suited for parallel and pipelined computation It is instructive to compare our format to bitmaps  which have previously been used to store the sets S i  using one bit per transaction T o compute the support of  i j  one needs to perform the bit-wise AND of the bitmaps encoding S i and S j  and count the number of 1s This task parallelizes very well as the bitmaps can be split into any desired number of pieces to be processed individually and there is a low communication overhead in combining the counts It is also very friendly to modern pipelined processor architectures since no conditional code is needed avoiding the branch mispredictions that have haunted previous frequent itemset mining algorithms using vertical data formats and set intersections Finally  since data can be accessed sequentially bitmaps make optimal use of cache and prefetching The B AT M AP maintains these advantages while being more space-efﬁcient on sparse sets The space usage is in fact within a small factor of the information theoretical minimum for representing sets of a given size which is the largest imaginable compression That is if S i and S j are represented using batmaps B i and B j we can compute the size of S i  S j using a word-by-word comparison of B i and B j  In contrast to normal compressed representations of sparse bitmaps the steps of this computation are completely xed and parallelize immediately The name B AT M AP indicates the similarity to the functionality of a bitmap and suggests that this is something that Bruce Wayne might use to mine associations between criminals and crimes We should mention a limitation of batmaps compared to bitmaps the result of combining two batmaps is not a batmap so it cannot directly support the intersection of more than two sets Towards the end of the paper we outline possible ways of dealing with this limitation Experiments In Section IV we investigate the performance characteristics of our algorithm on GPU and CPU implementations of Apriori and FP-gro wth 14 for varying density and number of distinct items We nd that our algorithm scales well in the number of distinct items in terms of both computation time and memory usage In addition the algorithm performs well for dense instances The throughput of batmap intersection on GPU is found to be about 5 times larger than when running the algorithm on the 8 CPU cores on our system We also perform experiments comparing batmaps on GPU with merging of sorted lists a standard CPU-based algorithm for computing intersection size B Previous work 1 Set intersection The algorithm for intersecting two sorted lists is folklore In the literature it has been extended in two main directions The rst is adaptive intersection procedures that use fewer comparisons when there are compact witnesses for the intersection see e.g In the w orst case and in the average case these algorithms provide no speedup over the classical algorithm Second for dense sets there has been considerable work on compressed representations usually referred to as compressed bitmaps  The density of a set is its size divided by the size of the universe from which its elements come e.g in the case of frequent itemset mining the density of S i is  S i  m  Previous work on high-performance compressed bitmap formats include Boncz BBC 16 and W AH 27 These methods all require data to be decoded sequentially and provide no easy parallelization Bille et al present a compressed bitmap format that is nearly optimal wrt the amount of data read to compute set operations However this is mainly a theoretical result that is not likely to perform well in a GPU setting Our new vertical data layout can be viewed as a kind of compressed bitmap with special properties 2 Frequent itemset mining To ease the exposition we will assume that we have preprocessed the data set to remove items with support below the threshold we are interested in All existing frequent itemset methods do this in one way or another so the interesting comparison is for the case where there are only frequent items GPU computation The previous work most closely related to ours is that of Fang et al The y use in the PBI-GPU algorithm a bitmap to store a vertical representation of the data set This means that the representation of a data set of m transactions with n distinct items requires mn bits of space For a sparse data set with a total of mb items where b  n  this can be much more than the log  mn mb   mb log n/b  bits needed to represent the data Experiments in on hardw are si milar to what we use show that their GPU/bitmap is more than 1 order of magnitude faster than a tuned implementation of the Apriori algorithm in some cases where the data set is dense density 49 For a sparse data set density 0.6 there is basically no speedup So both from a space usage and a computation

time perspective this method does not work well for sparse data sets Based on the experimental results on the synthetic dataset T40I10D100K reported in we can estimate the speed of the underlying set intersections to be around 40 Gbit per second In the case of T40I10D100K which has a density of 4 this means that they can in 1 second intersect sets of total size around 1  6  10 9  Sets with lower density take proportionally longer per item and sets with larger density take proportionally less time We also note that did not present e xperiments sho wing that a GPU implementation can be faster than FPgrowth in f act in all three e xperiments reported FPgrowth was considerably faster CPU computation A lot of work has been devoted to parallel and distributed implementations of frequent pattern mining The survey of Zaki describes the state-of-theart as of 1999 More recent work has focused on multicore architectures of modern commodity hardware trying to optimize cache performance and minimize the overhead of access to shared data 18 Ho we v er  GPU parallelism involves many constraints on the structure of the code and memory access pattern that is not addressed in these works In particular our method exploits the massive SIMD parallelism that is available on GPUs and we nd it conceivable that the set representation we describe could lead to other advances in parallel and distributed computation II B AT M APS Let S i denote the set of transactions containing item i  We wish to preprocess the sets S i   1 m  such that we can quickly compute the intersection sizes  S i  S j  for all item pairs  i j   A standard solution to this problem is to store the sets as sorted lists which allows an intersection to be computed in time O   S i    S j   by simple merging However the control ow for this intersection procedure is unpredictable which makes it work poorly on modern architectures in particular GPUs since they require highly structured control ow to perform well The initial idea is to rely on hashing rather than comparisons If we organize the sets in hash tables say using linear probing or perfect hashing it is indeed fast to determine the common elements of two sets S i  S j as we simply look up all elements from S i in S j  Using perfect hashing perhaps with vectorization t he control o w becomes determini stic and predictable However the memory access pattern of hash table lookups remains random and highly irregular Our new approach starts with an old idea from parallel and distributed data structures 24 26 applied in a no v el way The idea is to store sets redundantly to enable more efﬁcient parallel/distributed operations More speciﬁcally we consider the case where an element x can only be stored in the memory locations given by 2 d  1 random hash functions applied to x  By storing an element in d out of the 2 d  1 possible locations we get that for any two sets Figure 1 Computing the common elements in two batmaps is done using pairwise comparisons For the sake of the illustration we have drawn each batmap as an array For batmaps of the same size we simply need to compare elements at the same position top For batmaps of different sizes each entry in the smaller batmap needs to be compared to several entries in the larger batmap bottom x z y z x y y xz Figure 2 Example of a 2-of-3 assignment for the set S   x y z   Each element has one possible position in each of the three hash tables Two of these where the element is underlined are used to store the element both containing x there is at least one position that contains x in both representations This means that it sufﬁces to do a data independent element-by-element comparison which parallelizes very well see top part of Figure 1 Our adaptation We will consider d 2 and store each element x  S i in two of three hash tables For the time being we will simply think of these hash tables as a 3 r array A  i  section III describes the speciﬁc layout we use In each hash table t   1  2  3  there is exactly one position  t h  i  t  x  where x may be stored given by the hash function h  i  t  There is a probability that the arrangement of values in the hash tables as illustrated in Figure 2 is not possible We discuss this probability in Section II-B and for the sake of the discussion we temporarily assume that the arrangement is always possible It will be important that all sets are stored according to the same hash functions h 1  h 2  h 3  with range scaled according to the size of the set That is given hash functions h 1  h 2  h 3  we let h  i  t  x  h t  x  mod r i  where r i  O   S i   is a power of two to be speciﬁed later Since we choose ranges that are powers of 2 observe that for r i r j we have h  i  t  x  h  j  t  x  mod r i  This means that if x  S j is stored in 1 p 1  and 2 p 2  it sufﬁces to check positions 1 p 1 mod r i  and 2 p 2 mod r i  to determine if x  S i  Below we explain how this principle can be used to efﬁciently count the number of items in S i  S j  We will return to the issue of constructing the representation later Suppose that x  S i  S j  Then because we have stored x redundantly in the hash tables there exists at least one t for which A  i  t  h  i  t  x   A  j  t  h  j  t  x   For

x 0 x 1 x 0 x 1 x 1 x 0 Figure 3 The three possible 2-of-3 assignments with respect to a single element x  Along with each occurrence is the bit that tells whether this occurence is before or after the other occurrence in the circular order of rows When counting the common elements in two data structures we use this information to only count the last occurrence in case the data structures store an item x in the same two positions This is accomplished by a logical OR of the associated bits now we assume that r i  r j  r  which means that h  i  t  h  j  t for all t  Now by making all equality checks of the form  A  i  t  p   A  j  t  p   where t   1  2  3  and p   0 r  1   we can identify each element in S i  S j  These comparisons illustrated in Figure 1 parallelize very well However to count the number of elements in the intersection an additional trick is needed We can impose a cyclic order to the three hash tables such that h 1 is followed by h 2  h 2 is followed by h 3  and h 3 is followed by h 1  Then for an occurrence of x in a hash table it makes sense to ask whether the other occurrence of x is in the hash table is before or after it will be in exactly one of these We use a single bit per position p in the hash tables to store this information denoted b  i  t  p   Consider a pair of items  i j   and a position  t p  in their batmaps assumed to be of the same size In order to only count exactly once a transaction x where both items appears we use the condition  A  i  t  p  A  j  t  p    b  i  t  p   b  j  t  p  to determine if the elements in position p are overlapping and should be counted See Figure 3 for an illustration It is easy to check that in both the case where an element x is stored in the same two hash tables in both batmaps and the case where there is only one overlapping occurrence x is counted exactly once We will see later that there will be positions p in each of A  i  t that contain no element from S i  in these positions we simply set A  i  t  p   and b  j  t  p  0 to ensure that no counting is done Here  is a NULL value that is not in any set S i  For the general case since r i divides r j  each position in A  i  corresponds to r j r i positions in A  j  as explained above That is we can again count the number of elements in S i  S j by comparing each position in A  j  with a position in A  i  see Figure 1 Compression Since our method is based on hashing we can use a compression scheme that stores each item relative to the set of items with the same hash value see section III-A for details This gives a signiﬁcant space saving for dense sets in our implementation each hash table entry uses just 8 bits including b  i  t  p   whenever the density of a set is above 2  8  A Data structure construction We employ an insertion procedure that generalizes cuckoo hashing which places elements in 1 of 2 possible positions The idea is to push elements around until an element is placed in a vacant position with content   An insertion of x starts by putting x in A 1  kicking out any element that might reside in A 1  h 1  x   making it nestless  In case there is a nestless key it is inserted in A 2 in the same fashion and so on using the circular order 1  2  3  1  2  3   If the number of element moves exceeds a threshold MaxLoop the procedure returns the element that is currently nestless our analysis below shows that this is a small probability event The pseudo code is as follows where 0 is used to denote the swapping of two variable values function INSERT    loop MaxLoop times  0 A 1  h 1    if    then return   0 A 2  h 2    if    then return   0 A 3  h 3    if    then return  end loop return  end Since we need two occurrences of each element x  the insert procedure is called twice for each element In case one of these insertions fails we delete any occurrences of x and re-insert the nestless element returned unless it happens to be identical to x  In the Analysis section below we bound the probability of insertions to fail While this probability is low for a single set failed insertions are likely to occur when handling many sets We describe how we handle failed insertions in Section III-C B Analysis Suppose we have a data structure for a set S  with hash functions of range r  We now consider what might happen when we insert an element x 1 using the insert procedure Possibly a single copy of x 1 has already been inserted in the hash table All other elements exist in exactly two copies When moving an element it may happen that it is moved to the location of the other copy of that element In this case the other copy is then moved to the third location which must contain a different element We consider the transcript of the insertion which is the sequence of values of the variable

from the INSERT  function after each element move upon insertion of x 1  We rst look at the possibility that each copy of an element appears only once in this sequence i.e that each element appears at most twice Then each preﬁx of the transcript has the form x d 1 1 x d 2 2 x d k k  where x 1 x k are distinct and d 1 d k   1  2  number of copies that we move Each such sequence appears with probability r 1  k  since we have a hash collision between x i and x i 1 for i 1 k  1  and each such collision happens independently with probability at most 1 r  Taking the union bound over all choices for x 2 x k and d 1 d k we get an upper bound on the probability that a transcript preﬁx of length k occurs 2 k n k  1 r 1  k 2\(2 n/r  k  1  The next case to consider is when the transcript involves the same copy of an item more than once a loop  Then it is not hard to realize that the insert procedure will move a preﬁx of the elements in the transcript back to their original positions and eventually have   x 1 again Then x 1 is pushed to a new table and we again have two cases to consider 1 The transcript does not again return to an element copy that appeared previously Consider a preﬁx of the transcript of length k   Then at least one of the two substrings of the transcript of length k  1 k   3 2 that start with x 1 will have no repeated element copies We can bound the probability of such a transcript in the same way as above 2 k n k  1 r 1  k  2\(2 n/r  k  1 3 2\(2 n/r  k   3  2  2 The transcript returns once again to a previously visited element copy a second loop Let k denote the number of distinct elements encountered The number of transcripts starting with x 1 is then at most 2 k k 2 n k  1  where the k 2 factor is an upper bound on the number of ways the two loops can be formed There are k 1 independent hash collisions for such a transcript so each has probability r  k  1  and by a union bound we see that this is an unlikely event when r 4 2    n  2 k k 2 n k  1 r  k  1 2 n/r  k k 2   nr   Notice that the insertion may fail only in the last case Using the assumption that r 4 2    n we see that this happens for some k with probability at most n  k 1 2 n/r  k k 2   nr  3  nr   1 n  k 1 k 2 1    2  k  O   3 nr   1   h 1 h 2 h 3 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 1 h 2 h 3  Figure 4 Organization of the three hash functions for B 0 top and B i bottom where  B 0  3 r 0  Each h t above represents r 0 batmap elements covered by that hash function Here we have bounded the sum by computing the integral wrt k from 0 to 5  When the insertion succeeds we see that the probability that it goes on for k  steps or more is bounded by 2\(2 n/r  k   3  2  Thus the expected number of steps is bounded by   k  1 2\(2 n/r  k   3  2 3   k  1 1    2  k   3+2  O 1     Thus by choosing   0 as a constant the expected time for performing all insertions is O  n   III I MPLEMENTATION The implementation is split into two parts code for execution at the GPU and the preand postprocessing on the host system CPU A Layout of data structures Our actual implementation differs a bit from the abstract description in Section II We compress the data so that only 8 bits are used per batmap element while still being able to handle densities larger than 2  8  Deﬁne three permutations  t   1 m    1 m  for t   1  2  3   let as earlier r i denote the domain size of the hash functions for batmap B i  and deﬁne the hash functions h  i  t by h  i  t  x   B 0    t  x  mod r i r 0    t  x  mod r 0  t  1 r 0  The batmap layout induced by these hash functions is illustrated in Figure 4 An important observation is now that instead of storing element x at position h  i  t  x  we could just as well store  t  x  at that position—the result of the element-wise comparisons between two batmaps would be the same Next by deﬁnition of h  i  t the position of  t  x  the stored representation of x  in a batmap uniquely identiﬁes the least signiﬁcant bits in  t  x   so explicitly storing these can be considered superﬂuous Therefore instead of storing x we will only store the 7 most signiﬁcant bits of  t  x   That is  t  x  can now be deduced from the position and the 7 bits stored in that position Furthermore we use

1 additional bit per batmap element to store the indicator bit b  i  t  p  described in Section II and organize the bits so the indicator bit is the most signiﬁcant of the 8 bits This compression gives us 4 elements per 32-bit integer To get an idea of the efﬁciency of this compression scheme assume that we have to shift s bits to the right in order to move the 7 most signiﬁcant bits down to the least signiﬁcant bits Then log m  1  s 3 7  and consequently 2 s 4  m  1  128  Also as each element’s position in a batmap should uniquely identify the least signiﬁcant s bits of h  i  t all hash domains must be at least of size r i 4 2 s for this compression to work If we compare to the uncompressed case with hash domain sizes of 2  2  log  S i     2  S i   we only obtain an actual compression space reduction when the input is sufﬁciently dense i.e where the set size is satisfying 2  S i  4 2 s  or equivalently  S i  4  m  1  256  In the GPU the actual comparisons are done in chunks of 32-bit integers 4 batmap elements at a time in a way that completely avoids conditional statements let x and y denote two 32-bit integers and for convenience let the 7 least signiﬁcant bits in each 8-bit block be referred to as the element bits as they refer to a batmap element If 6 denotes a logical XOR and     16  means hexadecimal notation then p  x 6 y    80808080  16    01010101  16 gives a 0 not 1 in the indicator bits iff the corresponding element bits of x and y are equal To negate these bits and only count a match if one of the corresponding indicator bits is set deﬁne p   p 6  ffffffff  16    x  y    80808080  16   We then account for  p  7 7   p  7 15   p  7 23   p  7 31  7 matches among the 2 4 elements represented by x and y  Here 7 denotes the shift operator as usual B Our adaption of the GPU execution model The execution model in GPUs and OpenCL can roughly be outlined as follows a kernel is a set of instructions to be evalutated on a set of cores in a multiprocessor and a thread running such a kernel is in OpenCL referred to as a work item  These work items can be organized in a one two or three dimensional grid of size W 1 W 2 W 3  also referred to as a work group  and each running kernel instance can retrieve its coordinate  local index  in this grid Also we deﬁne the global data size as a multiplum of the work group size G 1 W 1 G 2 W 2 G 3 W 3  When executing the kernel work groups are generated by iterating over the global size i.e a total of G 1 G 2 G 3 work groups are formed As with the local index each kernel instance can retrieve its work groups current global coordinate  global index  in this iteration process As an example consider a kernel that processes a two-dimensional 3200 3200 pixels image in chunks of 16 16 tiles This would correspond to a work group size of 16 16 threads a global data size of 3200 3200  and consequently 200  200  4000 work group positions in the global data OpenCL operates with multiple memory spaces but here we will only refer to two of these the most plentiful memory space global memory is the only memory space accessible from the host device the CPU and it has the largest latency among all the memory spaces The low-latency shared memory resides closer to each compute unit it is relatively small e.g around 16 kb and is shared among all the threads in a work group One of the most important considerations when implementing efﬁcient algorithms for execution at GPUs is coalescing global memory accesses and we achieve this by following best practice as described in In short global memory acc ess by threads of a half warp 16 threads are coalesced by the device in as few as one transaction when certain access requirements are met e.g if the 16 threads access a 64 bytes aligned segment corresponding to 16 32-bit integers We adapt the GPU execution model to the ideas described in Section II and III-A in the following way a list containing all n batmaps is transferred once to the device and we then deﬁne the global size to be n n  and the work groups to be of size 16 16  Consequently a total of n 2 batmap comparisons will be made in chunks of size 16 The thread with local index  l i l j  and global index  g i g j  will now handle the comparisson of batmap B 16 g i  l i and B 16 g j  l j in turns of 16 integers holding 64 batmap elements each of the 256 threads in the work group rst copies two single items from the input which resides in global memory into two small 16 16 integer arrays in shared memory Each row in these small arrays correspond to a 16 integer wide slice of batmap B 16 g i to B 16 g i 15  and B 16 g j to B 16 g j 15  respectively Because of coalescing this copying is very efﬁcient Second after synchronising the threads with a memory barrier  the 16-item wide batmap slices are now compared as described above and the process is repeated with another copying from global to shared memory This continues until all slices of the relevant batmaps have been compared C Preand post processing As the batmap comparisons are performed in the GPU in quantums of 2 times 16 consecutive batmaps the computation time of each such 16-block will be determined by the longest of these batmaps Therefore as a rst step we sort the batmaps by increasing width corresponding to sorting the sets S i by size resulting in a strongly reduced computation time for the subresults for narrow batmaps That is after sorting we have  B i  3  B j  for i<j  Many graphics devices have a few-second hard limit on the execution time when the device is also used to support the display Therefore we break the GPU calculation into smaller parts of size k k where k  in our experiments

typically had a value of 2048 Let Z p,q be a matrix holding the subresults for batmaps B pk to B pk  k  1 and B qk to B qk  k  1  The division into smaller sub problems now has the convenient side effect that we due to symmetry only need to compute Z p,q for p 3 q  thereby cutting almost half of the GPU computation time from n 2 to around  n 2   Failed insertions As there is a positive probability that some of the cuckoo insertions will fail due to collisions with previously inserted elements we need to handle these failed insertions separately Let F b be the set of items i for which insertion of value b in batmap B i failed and let A b denote all items in input associated with b  For all transactions b  we construct the pairs min a c   max a c  for which a  F b and c  A b  and store each pair in a set M p,q where  p q   1 min a c  k 2  1 max a c  k 2   Whenever a subresult Z p,q is returned from GPU we extend it with the pairs found in M p,q before reporting the number of pairs found For p  q  only the upper triangle of Z p,q is reported because of symmetry IV E XPERIMENTS Hardware setup All experiments were run on a MacPro with two Intel Xeon 5462 2.8 GHz 4-core CPUs and 6 GB RAM bus speed 1.6 GHz running Mac OS X 10.6 The machine had a GeForce GTX 285 graphics card with 1 GB RAM and 30 1.4 GHz cores having 8 computation units each We observe that the two Xeon chips combined and the GPU have a similar complexity with a total of 1.6 and 1.4 billion transistors respectively 1  However the price of the 2 CPUs is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the GPU the factor is around 5 based on Intel’s initial price for Xeon 5462 but this ratio has likely decreased somewhat A speciﬁed indicator of the maximal energy consumption TDP is 2 80 W for the Xeon CPUs and 204 W for the GPU so the energy consumption at full utilization is likely to be similar A Frequent pair mining In this section we report on experiments on frequent pair mining Readers who are primarily interested in the raw performance of set intersections may skip ahead to the paragraph Throughput computation  We have implemented frequent pair mining with batmaps in Python using the PyOpenCL interface to OpenCL Even though it is would be possible to parallelize individual set intersection computations we have chosen to focus on the case where the number of items is large such that it sufﬁces to run the different intersections in parallel The output of our algorithm is the support of every pair of items We will compare our algorithm with Apriori 5  and FP-gro wth 7 14]—both implemented by Christian Borgelt Some experiments on Eclat were also 1 Manufacturer’s speciﬁcation 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 Distinct items in thousands 0 2 4 6 8 Memory usage in GB   GPU  Apriori  FP-growth Figure 5 Memory usage for varying number of distinct items n  while holding the instance size at a constant 10 million items with an item density of 5 Apriori scales poorly with n  performed but it was signiﬁcantly slower than the other three implementations and has therefore been left out of the graphs Even though other implementations have been reported to be faster in some cases e.g 25 we found that the implementations available in the FIMI repository did not compile with recent versions of gcc  Thus we have settled for Borgelt’s implementations that are generally regarded as state-of-the-art as witnessed by a total of 35 citations in 2008-2010 Each test run had a hard limit of 1800 CPU seconds before it was cancelled The rst set of experiments illustrate the behavior of the three algorithms when keeping the instance size constant and varying either the number of distinct items or the item density An instance was generated by for each transaction including each of the n distinct items with probability p  and continue adding transactions until the desired total instance size was reached Figure 5 depicts the memory usage for the three algorithms for varying number of distinct items n  The space usage of the GPU implementation comes from the preprocessing which is done on the CPU We did not attempt to optimize the space usage of our preprocessing procedure so it is likely that signiﬁcant savings could be obtained by a space-aware implementation From the plot we se that while both FP-growth and the GPU implementation scale well with n  Apriori has quadratic memory usage and exceeds the 6 GB RAM for less than 64,000 items Figure 6 compares the pure pair generation times for varying number of distinct items but keeping the data size xed This is the part of all three methods that has super-linear complexity so focusing on this allows us to see the asymptotic behavior more clearly Not surprisingly n  64  000 is an upper bound on what can be run with Apriori within the time limit due to memory trashing As expected FP-growth exhibits linear growth in time usage

second This is 13–26 times slower than the processing speed on the GPU To compare against a parallel implementation we did 8 simultaneous runs using 8 cores which took 15.66 seconds Since the time did not grow noticeably we conclude that the computation does not yet have a memory bottleneck The number of set elements processed per second using 8 cores is 1  71  10 9  or 29–57 of the throughput of the GPU batmap computed above This means that performance is noticeably poorer on the CPUs than on the far less expensive GPU V C ONCLUSION We have shown that a GPU allows set intersection and frequent pair mining that extends to much larger number of items than previous algorithms Further we believe that our approach may be pushed further with careful tuning as we are still far from using the full memory bandwidth of the GPU Our techniques may open up for new applications of e.g association mining where there are tens of thousands of variables e.g genetic data One problem we leave open is to achieve similar results for intersections of more than two sets There are two ways in which our work could possibly be extended one is to use a generalization of batmaps that store items in d out of d 1 places This would ensure that itemsets of size up to d would have at least one position witnessing their intersection Another is to use batmaps to count for each item in S i 1  how many times this item appears in S i 2 S i 3   At the end one would need to sum up the counts for the two occurrences of each item to determine if the item appeared in all sets A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  We would like to thank Anna Pagh for taking part in showing theoretical results on our generalization of the cuckoo hashing insertion procedure and Kumar Lav for his participation in initial experiments with the method described in this paper Also thanks to the anonymous reviewers for numerous useful suggestions This work was supported in part by a grant from the Danish National Research Foundation for the project Scalable Query Evaluation in Relational Database Systems R EFERENCES  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases VLDB 94  pages 487–499 Morgan Kaufmann Publishers 1994  R R Amossen and R Pagh Faster join-projects and sparse matrix multiplications In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory ICDT  pages 121–126 ACM 2009  P Bille A Pagh and R Pagh Fast evaluation of unionintersection expressions In Proceedings of International Symposium on Algorithms And Computation ISAAC  volume 4835 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science  pages 739–750 Springer 2007  P A Boncz M Zukowski and N Nes MonetDB/X100 Hyper-pipelining query execution In Proceedings of Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research CIDR  pages 225–237 2005  C Borgelt Efﬁcient implementations of apriori and eclat In Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  volume 90 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings  CEUR-WS.org 2003  C Borgelt Recursion pruning for the apriori algorithm In Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  volume 126 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings  CEUR-WS.org 2004  C Borgelt An implementation of the fp-growth algorithm In Proceedings of the 1st international workshop on open source data mining OSDM  pages 1–5 ACM 2005  Computer language benchmark game http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all   E D Demaine A L  opez-Ortiz and J I Munro Adaptive set intersections unions and differences In Proceedings of Symposium on Discrete Algorithms SODA  pages 743–752 2000  M Dietzfelbinger and F M auf der Heide Simple efﬁcient shared memory simulations In Proceedings of the 5th Annual ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  pages 110–119 SIGACT and SIGARCH June 30–July 2 1993 Extended abstract  W Fang M Lu X Xiao B He and Q Luo Frequent itemset mining on graphics processors In Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware DaMoN  pages 34–42 ACM 2009  A Ghoting G Buehrer S Parthasarathy D Kim A D Nguyen Y.-K Chen and P Dubey Cache-conscious frequent pattern mining on a modern processor In VLDB  pages 577 588 ACM 2005  N K Govindaraju J Gray R Kumar and D Manocha GPUTerasort high performance graphics co-processor sorting for large database management In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 325–336 ACM 2006  J Han J Pei Y Yin and R Mao Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation A frequent-pattern tree approach Data Min Knowl Discov  8\(1 2004  B He K Yang R Fang M Lu N Govindaraju Q Luo and P Sander Relational joins on graphics processors In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data  pages 511–524 ACM 2008

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a conìgurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to conìgure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whatês not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efìciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/òmanjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
