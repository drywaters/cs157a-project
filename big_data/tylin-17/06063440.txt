Reducing the database on 
C  or incorporating it into an algorithm for mining frequent itemsets such as Charm-L, Eclat\ and resolving the problem are very time consuming, especially when C is often changed. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for mining them as follows. Firstly, it is necessary to mine only one time from database the class L G A containing the closed itemsets together their generators. After that, when C is changed, the class of all frequent closed itemsets and their generators on C is determined quickly from L G A  
by our algorithm MINE_CG_CONS We obtain the algorithm MINE_FS_CONS to mine and classify efficiently all frequent itemsets with constraint from that class. Theoretical results and the experiments proved the efficiency of our approach Closed itemsets, frequent itemsets, constraint, generators eliminable itemsets I   I NTRODUCTION  Currently, Internet makes the real changes in the ways human thinks and does. People access to Internet to get useful information from it. Normally, the data of websites for users is obtained and is saved in the tables \(or databases The number of attributes \(items\ is often enormous However, for a while, they only take care of a set of attributes \(called the constraint\. To show immediately to the 
users the knowledge mined from them such as the frequent itemsets or association rules is very important. In [3, 5, 8, 9 13, 14  s o m e a u t h o r s r e s e a r c h e d o n m i ni ng f r e que nt  i t e m s e t s  and association rules from the standpoint of the users interaction with the system They studied mining frequent itemsets with many different kinds of constraints Nguyen et al.

Some categories of constraints such as anti- monotone, monotone, and succinct have been integrated into the mining process In   1 3   P e i  et al. proposed the concept of convertible constraints and considered pushing them into the mining progress of the FPgrowth algorithm.

In [5 C o n g a n d  L i u pr op os e d  a n  technique based on the concept of tree boundary to utilize previous mining results for reducing the mining time. They considered tightening and relaxing constraints such as increasing and decreasing supports This paper concentrates on solving the problem of to find frequent itemsets contained in a subset C of the set of all items from a given database \(called the problem of mining frequent itemsets with constraint C  A simple approach is to 
reduce the database on C and after that to mine them by an algorithm used widely such as Apriori   Eclat 2   Charm-L 18   F P gr ow t h  8   e t c  T h i s a p pr o a c h  i s n o t  efficient because the constraints are often changed. A different one is to filter the output of those algorithms in a post-processing step to determine frequent itemsets with constraint. It is also not efficient because their outputs are usually enormous. In [14 S r i k an t e t  al s h o w ed th at w e  should incorporate C into the mining process. They modified the apriori candidate generation procedure to only count candidates that contain selected items. However, there are still many candidates generated. Furthermore, when 
C is changed, users must run the algorithm. It is very time consuming. In [8 H a n e t  a l   a l s o s u gg e s t e d i n c o r p o r a t i n g  C  into the mining FP-Tree. However, they did not propose the algorithm to do it. We also incorporate constraint C into Charm-L and Eclat \(well-known algorithms for mining frequent closed itemsets and all frequent itemsets\ to mine frequent itemsets with constraint. This approach will be compared to our approach Recently, we [15, 16 s h o w ed th e s t r u c t u r e o f ea c h cla s s  of equivalent frequent itemsets having the same closure based on the generators and eliminable subsets of that closure. Based on it, we approach to the problem of mining frequent itemsets with constraint as follows. Firstly, it is 
necessary to mine only one time from the database the class LG A containing the closed itemsets and their generators After that, when C is changed, the class FLG C of frequent closed itemsets and their generators is determined quickly from LG A Using a unique representation of frequent itemset we derive completely, directly, non-repeatedly from FLG C  all frequent itemsets with constraint  The mining script is shown as follows 1  To mine only one time the class LG A

2  User selects the constraint C and the minimum support threshold s 2.1  to determine quickly the class s A FLG of the frequent closed itemsets \(and their generators\ith respect to s from LG A in the first mining time; otherwise, from max s A FLG was saved before\, where s max is maximum such that s max 002 s 2.2  from s A FLG our algorithm MINE_CG_CONS based on the propositions 2 and 3\ is used to exploit directly the class FLG C  2.3  from FLG C the class FS C of all frequent itemsets with constraint C is mined quickly by our algorithm MINE_FS_CONS \(using theorem 4 3  Return the step 2        Figure 1  Mining frequent itemsets with constraint The method is suitable when C is usually changed Indeed, the size of the class of all frequent closed itemsets and their generators is much smaller than the one of all frequent itemsets, especially on the dense databases. With the small values of minimum support thresold, this class can be still mined and saved in main memory by Charm-L and MinimalGenerators [18  Th e  r e s p o n s e o f th e s y s t em  in ear l y  times is often slow because the size of LG A is big. After the first period, the classes of 1 s A FLG  2 s A FLG  n s A FLG are saved in the system \(the values of s j j=1, .., n are distributed regularly on [0 0 \002 s 1 s 2 s n 002 1\. Thus, we only need to select the frequent closed itemsets and generators that those supports exceed threshold s directly on max s A FLG  where s max max {s j s j 002 s, j=1, .., n}. For the threshold s given by user, the corresponding threshold s max is usually closed to it. Therefore, the time to exploit s A FLG is often small. Using  some simple operators on the itemsets in s A FLG  we can mine directly the class FLG C  of the frequent closed itemsets and generators restricted on C  The class FS C is partitioned into the disjoint equivalence classes Each class contains frequent itemsets on C that have the same closure. So, they can be mined concurrently by parallel algorithms. A unique representation of frequent itemsets based on frequent closed itemset \(represented to that class and its generators is indicated to derive directly, nonrepeatedly all frequent itemsets on C from FLG C  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls some primitive concepts and results. This section also proposes a unique representation of itemsets. The main results are in section 3. In it, we obtain the algorithm for determining quickly all frequent closed itemsets and their generators with constraint C The efficient algorithm to mine all frequent itemsets from them is also figured out. Sections 4 and 5 contain the experimental results and conclusions II  P RIMITIVE CONCEPTS AND RESULTS  A  Primitive concepts Given set O contained records or transactions of a database T and A contained attributes or items related to each of transaction o 002 O and R is a binary relation in O x A  Consider two operators: \003:2 O 0042 A 005:2 A 0042 O determined as  003  004  O  002  003  A  003\(O\ = {a 004 A o, a 004  R  005 o 004 O 005 O 006 O  004\(A\ = {o 004 O o, a 004  R  005 a 004 A 005 A 006 A  Defining closure operator h in 2 A 4 y   h = \003 o  004 we  say that  h\(A\is the closure of itemset A 005 A If A = h\(A\, A is called closed itemset The class of all closed itemsets is denoted as CS The support of itemset A is defined as the probability of the ocurrence of a transaction containing A on O  s\(A 007 A O  Denoted that s 0 is minimum support, s 0  002 1 O 1  i f s A  006 s 0 then A is called frequent itemset   Let FS  FCS be the classes of all frequent itemsets and all frequent closed itemsets For two non-empty itemsets G, A 004\006 G 005 A 005 A G is called a generator of A [11 ff  h\(G\h\(A and  005  003\010 G 011 G 012 h\(G 011 h\(G Let G A\e the class of all generators of A Let LG A and FLG A  1 be the classes of all closed itemsets together their generators on A and all elements in LG A that are frequent with respect to s 0 In 2 A an itemset R is called eliminable in S [15, 16 i f f  R 007 S and 003 S 003 S\\R\ Let N S denote the class of all eliminable itemsets in S N S N S 004 we have [1   N S\ {A: A 006 S\\G, G 004  G S TABLE I  DATABASE 1 Trans ID Items 1  aceg 2 acfh 3 adfh 4 bceg  Example 1 Let us consider database 1 in Table I, with minimum support s 0 used in all next examples of this paper. From the definitions of \003 and \005, we have: \003\({1, 4 ceg, \005\(ceg\ = {1, 4} and then, h\(ceg\=ceg. So ceg is a frequent closed itemset with the support 003 ceg O    1 For briefly, we write s A FLG simply A FLG  C s  T LG A  FLG A  FLG C  FS C

This itemset contains two generators e, g because h\(e\h\(g\=h\(ceg\=ceg B  Structure of Itemsets In this part, the class of all itemsets is partitioned into the disjoint equivalence classes. The elements of an equivalence class have the same closure and can be derived from that closure and its generators. Thus, we only need to mine the class \(with the small size\ of frequent closed itemsets \(and generators\. When it is necessary, we can derive to users the frequent itemsets in a class that they are interested in Definition 1 1  Equivalence relation h over the class of all itemsets 2 A   010 A, B 002  2 A  A h B 013 h\(A\ = h\(B Theorem 1 15 A partition of 2 A  Relation   h  partitions 2 A  into the disjoint equivalence classes. Each class contains itemsets that have the same closure. The equivalence class containing A is denoted as [A   2 A  A A 004 011 CS and FS  AFCS A 004 011  Based on this partition, we can exploit independently each equivalence class. The elements in a class have the same support so we only compute and save it once Theorem 2 1  Representation of itemset For every itemset A such that 004\006 A 002 CS  X 004 A  013  014 G 0 004 G A 014 X 004 N A\X = G 0 X 2  Denoted N S, G\ := {A: A 006 S\\G, G 004 G S it is obvious that N S   SG G\(S 004 002 N G For G 1 G 2  002  G S\, G 1 006 G 2 the intersection of N S, G 1 nd N S, G 2 can be not empty. The above representation of a itemset in a class can be not unique because the representation of an eliminable itemset is not unique Example 2 Let us consider equivalence class [X  w h e r e X=aceg G X\ = {ae, ag  We have  N X, ae\ {cg, c, g N X, ag\={ce, c, e N X, ae 012 N X, ag\ = {c 006  004 and N X N X, ae 013 N X, ag\= {cg, c, g, e, ce}. Then from theorem 2, [X   a e, a e g  a ec, a ecg a g a g c  in  which, aeg can be represented by two ways: aeg = ae+g ag+e C  Unique Representation of Itemset by Generator and Eliminable Itemset The process of deriving of all itemsets of an equivalence class using theorem 2 can make the duplication because the representation of an itemset is not unique.  Theorem 3 shows a unique representation of itemset, in other words, based on it  all itemsets in the same class can be derived nonrepeatedly \(as a result, quickly\, completely   2 The symbol + is denoted as the union of two disjoint sets 010 X 002 CS let us call i U i X\(X XX 002  002 G X U,i X U X i  X_=X\\X U IS X\= {X=X i X i X  X i 002 G X\, X  005 X_ X i 005 X U,i i=1 or \(i>1: X k 014 X i X i  010 k: 1 015 k<i Theorem 3 \(Unique representation of itemset by generator and eliminable itemset We have a  X  IS X b  All itemsets of IS X\re derived non-repeatedly Proof  a  006  If X 002 X a s s u m e t h a t i  i s t h e  m i ni m u m  i n de x such that X i 002 G X\ X i 005 X\\X i and X = X i X i Let X i  X i 012 X U X  X i X U then X i 005 X U,i X  X\\X U 005 X_ and X = X i X i X  Assume that there exists the index k such that 1 015 k<i, X k 002 G X\ X k 007 X i X i then X=X k X k  where X k X k X  and X k X i X i X k 005 X\\X k X  005 X\\X k  Thus, X k 005 X\\X k it is absurd  015  If X 002 IS X\, there exists X i 002 G X\ X  005 X_ 005 X\\X i  X i 005 X U,i 005 X\\X i X=X i X i X  Let X= X i X  002 N X then X=X i X, thus X 002 X t h e o r e m 2   b\ Assume that there exists i, k such that i>k 016 1 and X i X i X  i  017 X k X k X  k where: X i X k 002 G X\ X  i  X  k 005 X_; X i 005 X U,i X k 005 X U,k Since X k 012 X  i  004 so X k 007 X i X i the equality do not occur because X i and X k are two different generators of X\. It contradicts to the selection of index i 007 Example 3 Let us consider class [X w h e r e X  a ceg  G X X 1 ae, X 2 ag}, we have: X U aeg, X U,1 g, X U,2 e, X_=c By theorem 3, itemset X=aceg 002 IS X\s generated uniquely as follows: X=X 1 X 1 X  where X 1 g 005 X U,1  X  c 005 X_. By theorem 2, X has two duplicate representations: X=ae+cg=ag+ce. If the condition i>1 X k 014 X i X i  010 k: 1 015 k<iŽ is absent, then duplicate X is generated once again: X=X 2 X 2 X  where X 2 e 005 X U,2  and X 1 007 X 2 X 2 Similarly, all itemsets of [X   IS X ae, aeg, aegc, aec, ag, agc} are derived non-repeatedly From theorem 3, the algorithm GEN_ITEMSETS is obtained \(see Fig. 2\to generate non-repeatedly all itemsets in each equivalence class X  X 004 CS  III  M INING FREQUENT ITEMSETS WITH CONSTRAINT  As the discussion in introduction, to mine frequent itemsets on C with minimum support threshold s 0 firstly without the general, we need to determine the class FLG A  of all frequent \(with respect to s 0 closed itemsets and their generators from LG A After that, it is quickly to mine the class FLG C  of all frequent closed itemsets and generators restricted on C from FLG A That bases on some relations between closed itemsets and generators of FLG C and the  corresponding ones of FLG A Finally, the partition of the

In this experiment to compare with our approach in mining frequent itemsets with constraint from LG A we incorporate C into the CharmL and Eclat \(well-known algorithms for mining frequent itemsets\. This is done easily by choosing only frequent items that are in C to work in the next steps of those algorithms. Those new versions are called C Charm, and C Eclat The items of the constraints are selected from the set A F  of all frequent \(corresponding to the minimum support MS items of A with the ratios of ¼, ½ and ¾. We have the constraints with the sizes of l 1  A F l 2  A F and l 3  A F For each l i  C is constructed from two subsets C   C 1  C 2 In the reality, the constraints that users are interested in usually contain the high-support items. Thus we will sort all items by th e order of their supports. To determine a constraint C with the size l i firstly, we construct the first subset C 1 of C containing [p*l i  t e m s  randomly selected from the set of high-support items in A F  where p 002 0  t h e r e m a i n e d p a r t  C 2 of C contains  [\(1p i   r a n d o m ly s e lec t e d ite ms f r o m  A F  C 1 For experiments at here, we set p = 0.5 and consider two constraints for each l i  We will do two comparisons. Firstly, in Table VI, we compare the average time for mining frequent closed itemsets and their generators with constraint C by our algorithm MINE_CG_CONS  shown in column T C O   to  the one by C CharmGen column T C C upon P, M, Co, and Ch C CharmGen is the combination of C Charm \(for mining frequent closed itemsets with constraint\ and MinimalGenerators [19  f o r d e t e r m i n i ng t he i r g e ne ra t o rs    The reduction in the mining time is shown in column RT C O  RT C O T C C T C O With the different minimum support thresholds, we see that it is drastic, ranging from a factor of 60 to 316 times! That reduction plays an important role in mining quickly association rule with constraints because, as the discussion on [15, 6 a l l  a sso c i a t i o n  r u l e s c a n b e m i n e d  quickly from frequent closed itemsets and their generators TABLE VI  M INING FREQUENT CLOSED ITEMSETS AND GENERATORS WITH CONSTRAINT   M INE _ CG _ CONS VS CCHARMGEN   DB MS T C C T C O RT C O  Co 75 1.07 0.005 213  65 1.29 0.013 99  55 3.49 0.026 134 Ch 65 1.21 0.011 115  55 6.08 0.055 111  50 10.93 0.111 98 P 80 1.50 0.010 145  70 13.74 0.115 120  65 39.22 0.243 161 M 15 0.16 0.003 60  5 0.84 0.003 316  1 4.80 0.018 264  In the second, the time for mining all frequent closed itemsets restricted on C by our algorithm MINE_FS_CONS  is compared to the one by C Eclat We did experiments on on three databases \(that have many items\o, P, M. The reduction in the mining time by our approach is drastic. It ranges from a factor of 14 to 1063 times and is shown in Fig 5               Figure 5  The reduction in mining time all frequent itemsets with constraint MINE_FS_CONS vs C Eclat  For database P, the reductions are small because the average size of transactions is small compared with the number of all items. Then, practically \(users are usually interested in high-support items\, we should consider the constraints containing many high-support items. Indeed, the bigger of the number of high-support items \(corresponding with the big values of p\ are, the bigger reductions become Table VII showed that. In addition, the output of our algorithm MINE_FS_CONS is classified into disjoint classes. All frequent itemsets with constraint in a class have

different 003 values data skewness with n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We adopt the optimal setting for netFilter obtained from similar experiments as in the above two subsections the lter size is set to 100 and the number of lters is set to 3 and 5 under n as 10 5 and 10 6  respectively We include the communication cost incurred by the naive approach for comparison For readability the y-axis is on log scale From these gures we can see that the cost incurred by netFilter is much smaller than that incurred by the naive approach For instance with n as 10 6 thecost incurred by netFilter is only 2  5 of that incurred by the naive approach In addition the cost incurred by both netFilter and the naive approach decreases with the data skewness For netFilter this is explained by the improved ltering performance under very skewed data For the naive approach as the data skewness increases the average number of distinct items that a peer propagates along the hierarchy is reduced resulting in

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con“gurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con“gure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef“ciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/˜manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
