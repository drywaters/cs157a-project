A Mediator Exploiting Appr oach for Mining Indirect As sociations from Web Data Streams  Wen-Yang Lin 1 and Yi-Ching Chen 2  Dept. of Computer Science and Information Engineering National University of Kaohsiung Kaohsiung, Taiwan e-mail 1 wylin@nuk.edu.tw 2 fast.eric@gmail.com   Abstract Recently, the concept of indirect associations, a new type of infrequent patterns that indirectly connect two rarely co-occurred items via a frequent itemset called “mediator”, has been shown its power in capturing interesting information over web usage data. Most contemporary indirect association mining algorithms are developed for static dataset. Our previous work has proposed an algorithm, MIA-LM, tailored 
to streaming data. In this paper, we propose a new efficient algorithm, namely EMIA-LM, for mining indirect associations over web data streams. EMIA-LM employs a mediatorexploiting search strategy, which reduce the search space as well as computation cost for generating indirect associations Besides, EMIA-LM adopts a compact data structure alleviating unnecessary data transforming processes and consuming far less memory storage. Preliminary experiments conducted on real Web streaming datasets show that EMIALM is superior to the leading HI-mine* algorithm for static data and MIA-LM both in computation speed and memory consumption Keywords-data stream; indirect association; infrequent pattern; landmark model; mediator 
I   I NTRODUCTION  In the past decade, Web usage mining has emerged as an important research field [11  w h ich aim s at  dis c ov erin g  useful patterns from online Web traffic data collected at the Web servers. For example, one can perform association analysis on the web click log to discover typical user’s navigational pages for accessing the websites, which information would be useful for web restructuring, target marketing, and banner placement, etc. Such association patterns, however, favor only frequently accessing data and so will filter out some rare but informative patterns. For example, as pointed out in p a t t er ns i nvol vi ng a n t i correlated set of pages may represent the distinct navigational behavior of different groups of users. In this 
regard, Tan et al 12  pr opo s e d t h e co ncep t o f i n d i r e ct association rules as an alternative technique for capturing rarely occurred informative patterns and later in [13  demonstrated its power in discovering interesting patterns from web usage data The concept of indirect association is to indirectly connect two rarely co-occurred items via a frequent itemset called “mediator”, and if appropriately utilized it can help to identify real interesting “infrequent itempairs”. Let I denote the set of all items. A formal definition of indirect associations is described below Definition 1 An indirect association  x  y  M means that an itempair x  
y is indirectly associated via a mediator M   M    I if it satisfies the following three conditions 1  Itempair support condition sup  x  y  s  2  Mediator support condition  sup  x   M   f and sup  y   M   f  3  Mediator dependence condition  dep  x  M   d  and dep  y  M   d  where s 
 f and d are itempair support threshold  mediator support threshold and mediator dependence threshold  respectively dep  R  S a measure of the dependence between itemsets R and S The well-known dependence function IS measure  IS  R  S  P  R  S sqrt P  R    P  S is used in this paper For example, we know that Coca-cola and Pepsi are competitive products. It is very likely that there is an indirect association that consumers who buy a kind of cookie tend to 
buy either Coca-cola or Pepsi but not both. Thus we have an indirect association Coca-cola, Pepsi | cookie  Since then, the technique of indirect association has been applied successively to different applications, including online recommendation, text mining, bioinformatics, etc. [5  A n d m o r e ef f i ci en t ap p r o a ch es th an th e or ig in al in di re ct  association mining algorithm proposed by Tan et al   called INDIRECT, have been proposed in the literature including HI-mine [14   H I m i n e   1 5    a nd M G Gro w t h 3  These methods, all developed to cope with static dataset, are inept to be used for analyzing dynamic stream of data continuous rapid flow of vast data in a timely and endless fashion. Indeed, lots of applications and information systems 
used in our daily life generate streaming data. Examples include traffic network events, Web usage log telecommunication record, financial and retail chain transactions, etc Unlike traditional static data sources, streaming data is fast changing and unbounded in amount. That is, data usually accumulates faster than it can be analyzed, and it is nearly impossible to store a stream entirely in a persistent storage General requirements for effective mining algorithms [4   including single-pass of scanning over data set, real-time execution, and low memory consumption

In [2 e pr opo sed a n i n d i r e c t a s s o c i a t i o n m i ni ng  algorithm MIA-LM \(Mining Indirect Association over a Landmark Model\ tailored for streaming data with landmark window model. That is, part of the input data stream that starts from a specified timestamp \(landmark point\ to the current timestamp is under concern [8  M I A L M f o ll o w s th e  basic tactics of INDIRECT, first discovering the set of frequent itemsets and then generating from which the set of all indirect associations. Although MIA-LM meets the single-pass scanning criterion for being an effective stream mining algorithm, exhibits high accuracy of the discovered patterns and significantly outperforms INDIRECT, the item suffix tree like structure it uses consumes more memory space In this paper, we propose a new efficient algorithm namely EMIA-LM \(more Efficient MIA-LM\or mining indirect associations over web data streams. Instead of adhering to the paradigm used by INDIRECT and MIA-LM EMIA-LM adopts a mediator-exploiting search strategy discovering all mediators for each frequent item in the first stage, i.e., those satisfy conditions 2 and 3 in Definition 1 and then generate from which the set of qualified indirect associations. The advantages of this approach over the frequent-itemset-based strategy are: \(1\It reduces the search space from the larger domain of frequent itemsets to a smaller one comprised of mediators; \(2\ It avoids the more time-consuming process for generating indirect associations from frequent itemsets. Besides, our EMIA-LM adopts a similar but more efficient data structure than that used by HImine*, alleviating unnecessary data transforming processes and consuming far less memory storage than MIA-LM Preliminary experiments conducted on real Web streaming datasets show that EMIA-LM is superior to HI-mine* and MIA-LM both in computation speed and memory consumption, with an order of magnitude of speedup for relatively small mediator support thresholds The remainder of this paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2, we describe some research work related to this study. Then we present the design of our mediatororiented indirect association mining algorithm EMIA-LM in Section 3. Empirical evaluations of our EMIA-LM algorithm over real world datasets are demonstrated in Section 4 Finally, we conclude with a summary of our results and directions for future research II  R ELATED W ORK  Existing researches on indirect association mining can be divided into two categories, either focusing on proposing more efficient mining algorithms [3, 14, 15 r e x t e ndi ng t h e definition of indirect association for different applications [3 5   Wan and An [14  pr opo sed a n app r oa c h  c a l l e d H I m i n e   for improving the efficiency of the INDIRECT algorithm Rather than generating all frequent itemsets, HI-mine focuses on finding all itempairs first, and then pursues the mediator of each itempair. The HI-mine algorithm adopts a compact data structure based on the concept of dynamic transaction projection of frequent item, eliminating the need for doing any join operation for candidate generation. Later, Wan and An [1  pr opo sed  a n e nha nc em e n t o f t h e H I m i n e a l gor i t hm   HI-mine*, which adopts a more compact data structure call Super Compact Transaction Database  STDB on which some optimization strategies are introduced, including only one database scanning, direct frequent item projecting, and dynamic infrequent item pruning Chen et al. [3 als o  p r o p o s e d an in dir e c t as s o c i at ion  mining approach that was similar to HI-mine, namely MGGrowth. The differences between them are that the directed graph and bitmap are used in MG-Growth for constructing the indirect itempair set \(IIS\. The corresponding mediator graphs are then generated for deriving indirect associations As to extending the definition of indirect association Kazienko et al applied indirect association on web pages recommendation system [5, 7  C h en  et al 3 opo sed a n  approach for mining indirect association of items by adding time feature of goods. Since each item has its lifespan, the relationships of new coming items can thus easily be discovered III  T HE P ROPOSED A LGORITHM  A  Stream Window Model Since data stream is a continuous and unlimited incoming data along with time, different window models are used for collecting data for further analyzing. Suppose that we have a data stream DS  t 1  t 2  t i where t i denotes the data arrived at time i A window W represents the sequence of data arrived from time i to j denoted as W  i  j   t i t i 1    t j In the literature, there are three different window models for data stream mining, i.e., landmark window, time-fading window, and sliding window models [1, 16  E ach m odel h a s  its limitation and applicability; the users have to decide which type is most matching her needs for choice. In this paper, we consider the landmark window model, which stores all incoming data from a specific time point to the present time B  Data Structures Our proposed approach, EMIA-LM, adopts the data compression concept used in HI-mine* but using more efficient way to achieve the same purpose. The data structures used in the EMIA-LM algorithm include \(shown in Figure 1   CTT The CTT Compact Transactions Table\ is used for merging identical transactions and combining analogical transactions. It has four parts: firstly, the left part that contains the same set of items secondly, the right part that contains the list of all different items with their count values, thirdly, the counting sum of all item’s count value which contains in right part, and last, the index as an unique value for identification   HT Hash Table\: It is used to store the hashed value of the left part of the transaction and links as pointers to the related row in the CTT    Item-list It is used for keeping all items, the block ids each item appears, its frequency and link to the corresponding row in CTT

The data structures used in the EMIA algorithm  C  Algorithm Description The algorithm requires four user-specified parameters including s  f  d and  As with MIA-LM, EMIA-LM divides data stream into blocks and performs data pruning after processing each block. It first divides DS into blocks that are denoted as B 1  B 2  B n Each block B i  consists of a set of transactions represented as B i   t 1  t 2  t k where k  is set to 1  as suggested by [9 Mor e o v er t h e  t o t a l  number of transactions N seen so far in the transaction data stream DS is defined as N  B 1  B 2  B l  l    n Below we define two terms, the mediator support set  MSS and indirect itempair set  IIS  Definition 2 The mediator support set MSS of an item x  is defined as MSS  x  M  M    I    sup  M     f    sup  M    x     f    dep  M  x     d  Definition 3 The indirect itempair set IIS of a given data stream DS is defined as IIS  DS  x, y  x  y    I    sup  x     f    sup  y     f    sup  x  y     s  Our EMIA-LM has three phases  compact transactions table construction  MSSs and IIS  construction and indirect association generation 1  Compact transactions table construction phase The  compact transactions table construction phase consists of two stages, compact table construction and pruning. It repeats these two stages until user query request is received  The CompactTableConstruction procedure is responsible to convert the input block of transactions into a compact data stored in the CCT table. Each transaction is split to two parts left and right the right corresponds to the last element of the transaction and left stores the other elements, i.e., a transaction t  x 1  x 2  x m is divided into left  x 1  x 2  x m 1 and right  x m Next, we search in CTT to see if there is any transaction with the same left part as t To speed up the searching process, we adopt the hash technique and store the index pointing to the corresponding row in CTT in the HT table, with key storing the left part of t and link storing the index. In this way, we insert the left part and right part of t into CCT if the searching result is negative; otherwise, we update the corresponding count field in CCT which denotes the number of transactions having the same left part, and the count of the item stored in the right field. In the same time each item in transaction t along with the index in CCT is also inserted into the Item-list if it is a new observed item or its count is updated, otherwise The PruningItems procedure is for pruning items whose counts are less than a specific condition item i count   currentblockid  item i blockid 1\. If the count of an item i  is less than this threshold, implying item i  will have low probability to appear in subsequent blocks, and should be considered as infrequent item i In this case item i is pruned to save the memory space 2  Compact transactions table construction phase The core phase MSS s and IIS construction is responsible for generating candidate MSS s and IIS by using a divide-andconquer strategy. Specifically, our approach is a mediatorcentric searching process, which follows the prefix setenumeration framework a m ple, as s u m e  the Item-list contains {A, B, C, D} frequent items. We first generate A as a candidate mediator, forming subsets of CTT  containing any left or right fields that A appears. Then inspect all other items in Item-list to see if each of them, can be combined with A. For example, for item B, we check if sup A, B   f and dep A, B  d If so, we add A into the mediator set of B, i.e MSS B\The above process continues in the order of AB, AC, AD, then ABC, ABD and back to B, BC, BC, etc 3  Indirect association generation phase In this phase we first use each candidate IIS in IIS-list to find mediators For each IIS  a 1  a 2 in the IIS-list we only have to check if they have the same mediators in MMS  a 1 d MSS  a 2  Then for each common mediator M in MMS  a 1  012  MSS  a 2  we obtain an indirect association a 1  a 2  M  IV  E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS  In this section, experiments on two web datasets, BMSPOS and BMS-Web View-2 [6 w e re m a de t o s h ow t h e  effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed EMIA-LM algorithm. The BMS-POS dataset contains several years of point-of-sale data from a large electronics retailer. And each item represents a category, rather than an individual product The BMS-WebView-2 dataset contain several months of click stream data from an e-commerce web site. Each transaction in these datasets is a web session consisting of all the product detail pages viewed in that session. In the following, all experiments were implemented in C# and conducted on HP ProLiant DL380 G6 with Intel Xeon E5530 2.40GHz and 6GB RAM We compare EMIA-LM with other two algorithms, our previously proposed MIA-LM algorithm and the leading algorithm HI-mine* developed for mining static dataset The execution time comparison is shown in Figure 2 EMIA-LM is far more superior to HI-mine* and MIA-LM Indeed, EMIA-LM outperforms the other two algorithms with an order of magnitude of speedup. MIA-LM is inferior to HI-mine*. The reason is that MIA-LM spends a lot of computations to build the initial IS-tree especially on the real datasets that are composed of thousands of items The results of memory usage comparison are depicted in Figure 3. Since the two datasets are composed of thousands of items, the data structure ISFI-forest used by the MIA-LM algorithm requires very large amount of memory to store all item-suffix of each transaction, especially for dataset BMS

POS. EMIA-LM and HI-mine* consume approximately the same amount of memory V  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we have proposed a new algorithm EMIALM for mining indirect associations from web data streams Our EMIA-LM algorithm adopts a mediator-oriented discovery strategy and a simpler but more efficient compact data structure for indirect association generation   Experimental results on real world datasets have shown that EMIA-LM is significantly faster than the frequent-itemset oriented approach MIA-LM and the leading algorithm HImine* with comparable or less memory usage. In the future we will continue to improve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, seeking more effective way for reducing the memory usage. We will also extend the proposed algorithm to accommodate other types of stream window models [1 16   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work is partially supported by National Science Council of Taiwan under grant No. NSC97-2221-E-390-016MY2 R EFERENCES  1  C.

second This is 13Ð26 times slower than the processing speed on the GPU To compare against a parallel implementation we did 8 simultaneous runs using 8 cores which took 15.66 seconds Since the time did not grow noticeably we conclude that the computation does not yet have a memory bottleneck The number of set elements processed per second using 8 cores is 1  71  10 9  or 29Ð57 of the throughput of the GPU batmap computed above This means that performance is noticeably poorer on the CPUs than on the far less expensive GPU V C ONCLUSION We have shown that a GPU allows set intersection and frequent pair mining that extends to much larger number of items than previous algorithms Further we believe that our approach may be pushed further with careful tuning as we are still far from using the full memory bandwidth of the GPU Our techniques may open up for new applications of e.g association mining where there are tens of thousands of variables e.g genetic data One problem we leave open is to achieve similar results for intersections of more than two sets There are two ways in which our work could possibly be extended one is to use a generalization of batmaps that store items in d out of d 1 places This would ensure that itemsets of size up to d would have at least one position witnessing their intersection Another is to use batmaps to count for each item in S i 1  how many times this item appears in S i 2 S i 3   At the end one would need to sum up the counts for the two occurrences of each item to determine if the item appeared in all sets A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  We would like to thank Anna Pagh for taking part in showing theoretical results on our generalization of the cuckoo hashing insertion procedure and Kumar Lav for his participation in initial experiments with the method described in this paper Also thanks to the anonymous reviewers for numerous useful suggestions This work was supported in part by a grant from the Danish National Research Foundation for the project Scalable Query Evaluation in Relational Database Systems R EFERENCES  R Agrawal and R Srikant Fast algorithms for mining association rules In Proceedings of 20th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases VLDB 94  pages 487Ð499 Morgan Kaufmann Publishers 1994  R R Amossen and R Pagh Faster join-projects and sparse matrix multiplications In Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Database Theory ICDT  pages 121Ð126 ACM 2009  P Bille A Pagh and R Pagh Fast evaluation of unionintersection expressions In Proceedings of International Symposium on Algorithms And Computation ISAAC  volume 4835 of Lecture Notes in Computer Science  pages 739Ð750 Springer 2007  P A Boncz M Zukowski and N Nes MonetDB/X100 Hyper-pipelining query execution In Proceedings of Conference on Innovative Data Systems Research CIDR  pages 225Ð237 2005  C Borgelt EfÞcient implementations of apriori and eclat In Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  volume 90 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings  CEUR-WS.org 2003  C Borgelt Recursion pruning for the apriori algorithm In Proceedings of the IEEE ICDM Workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations  volume 126 of CEUR Workshop Proceedings  CEUR-WS.org 2004  C Borgelt An implementation of the fp-growth algorithm In Proceedings of the 1st international workshop on open source data mining OSDM  pages 1Ð5 ACM 2005  Computer language benchmark game http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=all   E D Demaine A L  opez-Ortiz and J I Munro Adaptive set intersections unions and differences In Proceedings of Symposium on Discrete Algorithms SODA  pages 743Ð752 2000  M Dietzfelbinger and F M auf der Heide Simple efÞcient shared memory simulations In Proceedings of the 5th Annual ACM Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  pages 110Ð119 SIGACT and SIGARCH June 30ÐJuly 2 1993 Extended abstract  W Fang M Lu X Xiao B He and Q Luo Frequent itemset mining on graphics processors In Proceedings of the Fifth International Workshop on Data Management on New Hardware DaMoN  pages 34Ð42 ACM 2009  A Ghoting G Buehrer S Parthasarathy D Kim A D Nguyen Y.-K Chen and P Dubey Cache-conscious frequent pattern mining on a modern processor In VLDB  pages 577 588 ACM 2005  N K Govindaraju J Gray R Kumar and D Manocha GPUTerasort high performance graphics co-processor sorting for large database management In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data  pages 325Ð336 ACM 2006  J Han J Pei Y Yin and R Mao Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation A frequent-pattern tree approach Data Min Knowl Discov  8\(1 2004  B He K Yang R Fang M Lu N Govindaraju Q Luo and P Sander Relational joins on graphics processors In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of data  pages 511Ð524 ACM 2008

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con“gurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con“gure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef“ciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/˜manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 © 2005 IEEE

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
