provenance We consider a multihop scenario where a set of source nodes obse rve an event and disseminate their observations as an informati on item through a multihop path to the command center Nodes are assumed to embed their provenance details on the informatio n content Received provenance may not be complete at the command center due to attackers dropping provenance or the unavailability of provenance We design ProNet a tool whic h is at the command center that acts on the received information item to determine the information trust node-level trust a nd sequence-level trust ProNet contains three steps In the  rst step it reconstructs the complete provenance details of rec eived information from the available provenance In the second st ep it employs a data classication scheme to classify the data int o a good and bad pool In the third step it employs pattern mining on the reconstructed provenance of bad data pools to determine the frequently appearing node and node sequence This frequent appearance will quantify the trust level of no des and node sequence Now an information quality/trust level o f newly received information can be determined based on the occurrences of these node/sequence patterns on the provena nce data We provide a detailed analysis on false positive and fa lse negatives I I NTRODUCTION In multihop information sharing networks it is often necessary to perform trust analysis on the nodes and also the information received to derive a wise decision out of the received information Cryptography security services suc h as authentication and admission control alone cannot provide complete solutions for a trust analysis Nodes can misbehav e and may provide unreliable observations/results after pas sing through the initial cryptography check Though they are authenticated nodes the poor results may be due to single or combination of various factors such as misbehavior faulty sensors and environmental factors In these circumstances  trust management augmented with cryptography can provide a viable solution One way to assess trust is by using the histo ry of the information origin widely known as provenance In th is paper we assume provenance as node ID location and time of observation In ad-hoc networks to be particular tactical networks if informers attach their provenance details on the informati on they provide later they can query the command center and get rewarded accordingly based on the importance of the information they have provided 1  I n a d d i t i o n  t h e r e c e i v er can have more condence on the received information if the provenance information is available Hence provenance has become important entity in the modern day information sharing networks It helps both the information providers and also t he receiver Complete provenance means the full identicatio n details of a node that generated it and also processed the information With complete provenance one can say without any ambiguity what nodes participated in the information gathering and processing Often the literature on provenan cebased trust assessment assumes whatever node processes the information will embed its provenance on the information 2   3   H o w e v e r  i n a d y n a m i c o p e n n e t w o r k s o f t e n t h e f u l l provenance collection is complex and provenance may not be complete and accurate 4  T h i s i s b a s i c a l l y d u e t o   Attackers When the information passes through a multihop chain some attackers may drop the previous nodes provenance details to claim the origin of information as their own to get monetary reward if any Attackers may refuse to attach their own provenance so that they can get away from the malicious node detection while at the same time create considerable damage in the decision making Sometimes users may drop part of the large provenance data to avoid network congestion  Unavailability and unwillingness In some cases provenance details will not be simply available Possibly due to malfunctioning of the provenance information provider on the node In some cases users are not willing to provide complete provenance for various condentiality reasons users may intentionally hide their part of the provenance  Loss of provenance In some cases provenance data may be lost Therefore instead of full ID the received provenance may have partial ID In this paper we propose a strategy to assess the trustworthi ness of the information based on available provenance We do not back query the users for additional information as it can lead to condentiality violations We just work on the recei ved information We assume a mutli-hop network where every node observes the event and disseminates the information through the nodes until it reaches the command center node The command center applies the proposed algorithm on the received information and determines the trust level of node s and also the received information based on the available provenance details The objective of this work is to identif y a single node or pattern of less trustworthy nodes in the provenance chain and declare that particular information a s a member of a bad set We generate a rule to evaluate the trust of the information based on the history of appearance of one or sequence of nodes in either the good or bad data pools Our proposed ProNet tool contains three steps In the rst step t he complete provenance from the available limited provenance details is reconstructed In the second step the informatio n set is classied into two pools based on a classication techniq ue In the nal step pattern mining is applied to identify the sequence of nodes appearing on the bad information pool This will help to identify the trustworthiness of future rec eived information Uniqueness of the proposed approach

1 We provide an approach to evaluate the trustworthiness even when the complete provenance is unavailable We provide a balance between the false positive analysis and the granularity of the provenance available 2 Instead of just the node-level trust we also concentrate on sequence-level trust analysis Sometimes the node individually may be good but the association of node sequence with other nodes may be malicious or less trustworthy We identity those patterns 3 We work at the information level application layer rather than the packet level network layer and provide detailed performance analysis II R ELATED WORK An agent-based approach to manage the trustworthiness of information in a dynamic information sharing environment is presented in 5  H e r e a p r o v e n a n c e g r a p h o f a d e r i v e d information is used for the trust assessments Information trust assessment based on path and information similarity i s proposed in 6  T h e i d e a i s t h a t w h e n t h e i n f o r m a t i o n i t e m is received from totally disjoint paths and the information contents are similar then it is highly likely that the infor mation is trustworthy and also nodes which processed the information are trustworthy A data provenance trust model which estimates the level of trustworthiness of both information and information providers is presented in 7  F o u r a s p e c t s t h a t affect the trustworthiness of the data have been taken into a ccount to build such a trust model which are a data similari ty b path similarity c data conict and d data deduction  However this model is vulnerable to collusion attacks 2  Majority rule based technique to detect the malicious collu ding parties is proposed in 2   8   O u r a p p r o a c h c o n s i d e r a b l y differs from all of the above in the sense that we handle incomplete provenance III F UNDAMENTAL FRAMEWORK A System model We assume a single command center which is an information processing unit and set of nodes deployed for event monitoring Every node which is close to the event makes observations about the event and sends the observation as information item to the command center through multiple intermediate nodes as shown in Fig 1 Information either passes through the intermediate nodes without change or get processed and passed on The processing can be either fusion or aggregation Here we consider information in the form of information items Each information item has one or multiple owners Each information item consists of information metadata and an information payload as shown in Fig 2 The metadata contains the provenance of the information ite m provided by the user For instance in Fig 1 the information i is outcome of actions of node D  and node A and also the combinatorial interactive trust of node A and D  The provenance in turn includes the information item's creatio n time owner location history as well as the provenance of t he all other intermediate nodes which performed operations on the information item The receiver collects all the informa tion Before we proceed further let us make the following formal denitions DEFINITION 1 Trustworthiness of Information Items Trust The trustworthiness of an information item i  denoted as T  i   is the probability of i being true DEFINITION 2 Trust of Nodes The trust of a node N  is the probability that N sends correct information A\r B\r C\r E\r F\r D\r G\r H\r A\r A\r B\r C\r F\r E\r A\r D\r C\r F\r G\r Information i\r Information j\r Information k\r B\r C\r Receiver\r Command center\r Source\r

of\r node A\r Fig 2 Information packet DEFINITION 3 Provenance The provenance of the information contains two factors the ownership of an information and the log of the tasks applied on the information by authorized entities The three most basic entities of a provenance graph are Agents Processes and Artifacts In a multi-hop sensor or tactical network we can call these enti ties as Node ID Actions Attributes  We consider the two most basic types of action to pass or to process as the Root Action Attributes contains time of operation and location of node B Attack model We assume that every node should sign the metadata with its private key when it attaches the metadata When another node receives the information it can read the metadata and nd out which node has sent the information from the node ID which is in the metadata Now the other node can verify the integrity of the metadata by verifying the signature using t he corresponding public key of the previous node Here the node cannot alter the metadata of the previous node because if it alters the metadata it has to sign the metadata with its priva te key Hence integrity of the provenance can be ensured In addition the nodes can never forge or fake provenance Due t o the cryptography if any other nodes change the provenance in an unauthorized way or if any nodes provide a fake ID within their own provenance it can be detected by the recipient After considering this we list the following attack models   The attacker can drop completely the metadata of all the previous users or some selective previous users as shown in Fig 3 For instance the node last in the provenance chain can completely drop all the provenance information in the chain and can place its own metadata to claim the full credits for the source of information  The attacker can refuse to attach its own provenance after performing operations on the information payload So that the attackers can get away from detection at the same time it can cause damage in the decision making

graph with N nodes To reduce the computational cost we exploit the fact that the tree-branch set of a particular nod e is a subset of the tree-branch of its parent node The computatio nal complexity here is N  K  L 2 where N is the number of nodes in the network K is maximum number of adjacency and L is the depth of the graph We illustrate the path construction process using Fig 4 a In the original graph Fig 4 a we replace the source with the node s and the destination with node d We replace all out going edges with the incoming edges and vice versa and construct the bottom-up graph as shown in Fig 4 b Then we construct the adjacency matrix as shown in Table I by readin g the bottom up graph Here in the Table I the index in the rst column corresponds to a parent node and rest of the index corresponds to nodes reached by direct outgoing edges from a parent node This table will be used as input in the algorithm given in Fig 5 The output of this algorithm are the all available paths fr om the source to the destination as shown in Fig 6 Destination node d is picked up as the rst node in algorithm given in Fig  5 One of the adjacency nodes of the destination in the bottom up graph will be picked up next and then the process will continue until a source node is found Once the source node is found again the one level immediate parent will be picked up and one of the left out adjacency node will be explored until source node is reached This way going backward and forward will eventually provide us all possible paths Now the outgoing edges replaced with incoming edges will give al l possible paths as given in Fig 6 Here in Fig 6 the number s x on particular edge denotes that particular node is reached after running Algorithm for x steps Now the nal all possible paths will be obtained by converting all incoming edges in Fi g 6 to outgoing edges Now the complete provenance of all the possible paths are given in Table II TABLE II A LL POSSIBLE PATHS FROM SOURCE TO DESTINATION Path Nodes 1 s 1 4 d 2 s 1 2 4 d 3 s 2 4 d       However if we don't know the node topology then we can use the proling based approach as explained below 2 Provenance reconstruction based on proling approach PA In this model we store the provenance of a node over time We assume in the initial stage during the deployment every node behaves well and attaches the true provenance values There is no attack or provenance drops in the initial stage In addition there is no provenance loss and also the users are fully cooperating in embedding their provenance details Hence the provenance is fully available in the lear ning phase We then prole all the possible paths and create a prole by storing the provenance information We call it as prole database  We keep on improving the prole database over the time Now after the learning period the network nodes will start to behave their own way and there could be provenance drops The missing provenance details in the received information can be determined by comparing the received information metadata against the provenance chai ns of the prole database as explained in the following section  3 String search to narrow down the full provenance chain From Section IV-A1 and Section IV-A2 we can determine all complete possible provenance chains The question is using the incomplete provenance available in the received informati on metadata how to narrow down one candidate provenance out of all possible paths For this we do exhaustive string matching in the complete provenance pattern using Algorith m 1 We dene two main decision factors that will help us to identify the complete provenance chain  Total length of common subsequences  Order of common subsequences We rst start to look for the available incomplete provenanc e pattern among the set of complete provenance chain sets   n   constructed using either PA or PC methods From this set we are able to narrow down to subset   1  n   of complete provenance chain that contains the available incompl ete provenance pattern From this subset we again narrow down to subset   2  n   that has the available incomplete provenance in the same particular sequence Now we classify all the node s in the   2  n   as possible candidate for the full provenance This procedure is explained in Algorithm 1 where the sequenc e X    is compared against the all possible path set A     Though Algorithm 1 Algorithm to nd the provenance sequence 1 N  size  X     M  size  A     C  0 2 for all i such that 0  i  N do 3 for all j such that n  j  M do 4 if X  i    A  j  then 5 C   6 n  i 7 end if 8 end for 9 end for 10 if C  N then 11 Add A i n t o c a n d i d a t e s e t 12 end if 0 this approach may generate several possible paths our trus t assignment in Section IV-C itself based on accumulating several instance reports and then applying frequent sequen ce mining the nal trust assignment will be optimal and reduce the false alarms After the provenance reconstruction the next step is to classify the information based on the payload as follows B Information classications Path difference and information similarity-based approac hes are used to classify the information into bad and good pools 6   8   E a c h i n f o r m a t i o n i t e m w i l l b e a s s i g n e d a n i n f o r m a t ion similarity factor  ISF I  and a path difference  P DF

by the product of these two factors A positive ISF I  P DF I means there is more support in the collection so that we can put the information item into the good pool and a negative ISF I  P DF I means there are more conicts so we put it into the bad pool The idea is if the two information items are similar and coming from entirely dissimilar paths then ther e is a high probability that these two information items belon g to good pool C Pattern mining Once the information is classied into the two different pools we apply frequency pattern mining into the divided information-sets to determine the frequently appearing no des and node sequences Since there can be many nodes observing an event and many nodes in the pools checking all the possible combinations i n each information pool can be tedious The algorithm also wil l not scale well if we search the entire pool for all possible combinations Therefore we propose to exploit the apriori property to narrow down the search space to enhance the scalability of the algorithm 10   1 1   T h e m a i n i d e a o f t h e algorithm is as follows At the rst step we estimate the probability of occurrence of each individual feature By fe ature we mean the appearance of single node or nodes pattern in a given pool If a feature occurs lower than a predened threshold    number of times we remove that feature from further consideration as it has very limited discriminativ e power and is statistically insignicant After that rst st ep we retain features that have high support Let us assume that the set is S 1  At the next step we rst generate the set of the candidate features by taking the Cartesian produc t S 1 XS 1 where  X  represents the Cartesian product S 1 XS 1 represents all possible combinations of features occurrin g as pair This Cartesian product is an algorithmic way to determ ine frequently appearing node pairs in the pool Next we estima te the probability of each item in S 1 XS 1 and remove the items that has support lower than  and generate a set S 2  Next we generate the candidate patterns of length 3 as S 2 XS 1  We continue this process until we nd all the combination of features or get the empty set This way we can nd out the single node or pattern of nodes which are frequently appearing in the bad data pool We name these nodes/patterns as bad signatures We repeat this exercise for the good data pool and nd out the frequentl y appearing patterns in the good data pool Now we can generate a rule based on this frequent appearance In the future recei ved messages if we see these frequently appearing bad/good nod e or node patterns we can classify those data as bad/good data  We constantly keep update this data set and change the rule dynamically If a particular node or node patterns appearin g in both bad and good pool frequently then those nodes or node patterns will be assigned with unknown trust score 0  5  Trust calculation The received information can be classied as trustworthy or untrustworthy as follows  If all the node and node patterns in the newly received information provenance found frequently appearing in the good pool earlier then that particular information will be assigned high trust score 1   In the newly received information provenance at least one node/node patterns was earlier found appearing only in the bad pool then that particular information will be assigned with low trust score 0   If some of the nodes trust score is unknown and rest of the node/node sequence trust is high and if that particular information has high ISF I  P DF I then it will be assigned high trust If it has low ISF I  P DF I then it will be assigned the score of 0    0 0.05 0.1 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 False alarm rate Detection rate ROC with \(5/8 ROC with \(6/8 ROC with \(7/8 Fig 7 ROC performance of path construction approach Now these knowledge will be used to further ne tune the information classications of Section IV-B V R ESULTS AND A NALYSIS We have conducted extensive simulations We assume 100 nodes distributed uniformly random over the space of 1000  1000 and centralized command center For PC method using the network topology we construct all possible paths and record them in the command center Now we determined the source to destination shortest path and in the path we have dropped 1  2  3 node's provenance information We have compared the received incomplete provenance against each path in the record that has been stored previously and determine the path which is closely matching as per Algorith m 1 That particular path will be picked up as candidate path The receiver operative characteristics ROC performance of the PC method is shown in Fig 7 In ROC plot detection means correctly identifying the provenance and false alarm means wrongly identifying other nodes as rightly missing provenance For the PA method we select a random source and a xed command center destination and determine a path between them and record the path the intermediate nodes We repeat this 100 times and store all these paths in the record database and use it as a prole model Now in the new path we intentionally drop 1  2 and 3 number of node's provenance in the chain and try to look for the missing pattern in the prole We determine the detection rate and false positive rate this way and plot the ROC plot as shown in Fig 8 The ROC performance with the PC method is much better than the PA method It is because in PA method there are chances that we miss to prole some of the paths In addition the training overhead in proling based approach is high We get reasonably good results only after storing 100 paths In addition we can see that both methods generate more false alarms This is because there are chances that we pick up more than one path as candidate paths However the detection rate is mostly high To measure the trust level of nodes we assume a node pattern of length 2 is malicious with trust factor 0  2  That means 80 of the time the information which contains the particular node pattern is untrustworth y We determine the trust of the information which contains thi s particular node pattern in the chain However that particul ar node/node pattern is completely dropped in the provenance chain of the information Our provenance reconstruction wa s able to capture the missing provenance and also the trust of t his particular information The threshold value    in the pattern mining is chosen as 2 of the total information collection size We have plotted ROC performance of PC and PA methods in Fig 9 Here we compare the information against the

information is untrustworthy  trust score 0  however it has high ISF I with respect to the ground truth then we assume it is a false alarm The false negative performance of our approach with PC method

We have provided an analysis to give a balance between available provenance and the accuracy in th e trust establishment The analysis shows that one can get goo d performance even when part of provenance chain is missing Performance with the complete topological information is better than that of the proling based approach Provenance based trust analysis is relatively new area and there are sev eral practical questions remain to be answered The provenance overhead analysis is an issue to be addressed In some cases the provenance could be many orders larger than the size of th e information product For example in some cases provenance may include pictures or video to support a report Distribut ion of this provenance via a multi-hop network to the pertinent authorities in a timely manner can be a challenge In additio n storage and timely retrieval of provenance add additional complexity We hope that the near future research in this direction may answer some of the questions Limitations  This approach has a few limitations In the case of proling based approach the initial training phase i s crucial A larger training phase would result in better perf ormance Our proposed trust method is more conservative and achieves better detection rates At the same time it generat es false alarms The false alarm rate increases when the amount of available provenance information decreases A CKNOWLEDGMENT This research was sponsored by the Army Research Laboratory and was accomplished under Cooperative Agreement Number W911NF-09-2-0053 The views and conclusions

     compare the performance of our CloStream with Moment and NewMoment on this dataset. From Fig. 3\(a CloStream runs faster than Moment and NewMoment over 100 times when min_sup is less than 0.03% and 0.06 respectively. Particularly, when min_sup is less than 0.03 Moment runs out of memory, since it not only captures lots of non-closed nodes in CET-Tree but also maintains all frequent closed itemsets in CET-Tree and hash table. Although NewMoment is able to run when min_sup is less than 0.05%, it requires more than 2.5 hours Fig. 3\(b\hows the average execution times for the three algorithms over 100 consecutive windows on dataset BMSWeb-View-1 under different minimum supports. From Fig 3\(b\ significantly outperforms NewMoment and runs faster than Moment when min_sup is less than 0.04%. Although NewMoment uses less memory space than Moment, it requires a long execution time Particularly, when min_sup 0.05%, the total execution time of NewMoment for sliding 100 consecutive windows is over 100 1,000\ only takes about \(0.1 100\under the same threshold a\Times for loading the first window b\mes for sliding 100 consecutive windows Figure 3  Execution times on the real-world dataset BMS-Web-View-1 for the three algorithms Figure 4  Scalability for the four algorithms under various sliding window sizes Fig. 4 shows the execution times of the four algorithms for loading the first window under different sliding window sizes on dataset T5I4. In this experiment, the size of sliding window is increased from 100K to 500K and the minimum supports for Moment and NewMoment are set to 0.005%. From Fig 4 we can see that CloStream outperforms the other three algorithms and has a good scalability for large dataset V  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm CloStream to discover frequent closed itemsets over stream sliding windows We use Cid List and the SET function to find the closed itemsets which have the common items with the added or deleted transaction. Different from the previous approaches which need to take a lot of time to search from a tree structure CloStream only needs to do the intersections on the closed itemsets which return from the SET function and the added or deleted transaction without searching from our proposed structures. Besides, all the frequent closed itemsets can be obtained online based on any user-specified thresholds. The experimental results also show that our CloStream algorithm outperforms the three famous algorithms CFI-Stream, Moment and NewMoment on both synthetic datasets and real-world dataset R EFERENCES  1  R.

For the spatial partitioning we use the Military Grid Reference System MGRS Thus w ay  we represent an y location on the surface of the Earth at multiple granularities ranging from 1 002 1 m 2 to 100 002 100 km 2  by an alphanumeric value For temporal partitioning we use the typical temporal hierarchies from data warehousing hour day week month We drop cells with very low activity speci\002cally cells where the most popular term occurs in fewer than 5 messages at the 002nest granularity hour We will shortly describe how we 002x the spatio-temporal hierarchy in AFIA based on the considered workload We perform three sets of experiments The 002rst measures the space and accuracy of the proposed algorithms and compares them with two baselines The second evaluates the throughput memory consumption and number of checkpoints when varying the targeted k parameter The third evaluates the query processing performance when varying the size of the spatio-temporal query range We also show the number of checkpoints created during a time period B Data and Queries We collected all geo-tagged messages from the public Twitter FireHose during May 2013 The dataset contains 110,426,053 tweets yielding an average rate of circa 41 tweet per second Figure 9 provides insight into the workload and helps choose an appropriate spatio-temporal hierarchy Figure 9a shows the total number of cells that receive at least one tweet Thus the graph shows the expected number of active summaries at the given granularities For example every hour the number of 0.1 002 0.1 km 2  1 002 1 km 2  10 002 10 km 2  and 100 002 100 km 2 spatial grid cells that receive at least one tweet is circa 0.5M 200K 40K and 10K respectively i.e the 223Hour\224 curve in the 002gure Figure 9b considers the cells at the 0.1 km 002 0.1 km 002 1 hour granularity The y-axis depicts the number of such cells subject to different loads the number of terms t processed This shows that the number of 223interesting\224 cells with at least 100 terms is quite low barely reaching 100 Therefore we 002x the 002nest temporal granularity at an hour Figure 9c considers the cells at the 100 km 002 100 km 002 1 week granularity The 002gure shows that thousands of such cells have summaries that receive more than 1 thousand terms We 002x k at 25 and generate 2 query sets each consisting of 100 queries Each query in the 002rst set has a temporal extent with a length chosen at random among 1 hour 1 day and 1 week and it has a randomly selected spatial region The spatial granularity of the coarsest cell that is contained in the spatial query region is the query's spatial granularity and the query region is enlarged to cover all the cells at that granularity that it intersects with In visual terms this procedure corresponds to 223snapping\224 the spatial query region to the coarser granularity The underlying rationale for adopting this procedure is that 002ner-granularity cells do not contribute with term counts at the same magnitude as do cells at the granularity of the coarsest fully covered cell Since any rectangle can be created from a number of merged squares we limit the experiments to squares Each cell contains 10 002 10 cells at the next 002ner granularity Thus the largest number of cells any query square can cover is 18 002 18  324 As a result we employ queries that may cover up to 1,800 002 1,800 km 2  While the 002rst query set focuses on variation in the spatial range the second focuses on temporal variation Each of the 100 queries has a spatial region chosen at random from one of the spatial granularities The query resulting in most temporal summary merges is the query that spans from the 002rst hour after midnight on the 002rst day in May until the hour before midnight on the last day of May This query covers 2 002 23 hours 3  5 days and 3 weeks which amounts to 57 temporal summaries To avoid empty results we do not consider regions that only cover empty cells Note that we do not perform compaction on the last active temporal granularities to better re\003ect the real-life scenario where a stream is constantly keeping these summaries active To simplify the experiments the initCounters parameter which determines the initial number of counters is set to the same value as targeted k  C Baselines We consider two baselines for comparison and validation of our proposal SS In each active spatio-temporal summary we aggregate the most frequent items using the SpaceSaving algorithm Active summaries maintain a 002xed number  m  of items and their counts while archived summaries are compacted by keeping only the counters for the k most frequent terms Choosing a value for m represents a trade-off between storage size and result accuracy HT In each active spatio-temporal summary we maintain a full list of terms using a hash table Once the summary becomes inactive and is archived its time granularity passes the list is sorted and cleaned up by discarding all but the counters for the targeted topk terms This approach maintains the exact topk items at all spatio-temporal granularities and serves to measure the accuracy of the other approaches However since HT has excessive storage requirements we do not expect it to scale under the considered workloads D The Space Versus Accuracy Trade-Off In the 002rst set of experiments we evaluate the accuracy of our approach by comparing it with the baselines Since HT maintains the exact counts at all granularities its storage requirements are too high for large scale experiments Similarly SS maintains a 002xed number m of counters at all granularities and m cannot be set too high for large scale experiments Thus we consider only tweets occurring in the spatial region with the 11S grid zone designator a region in the US of size ca 900 002 550 km 2  We use the local machine We consider variants of SS where m is set to 50 100 and 200 In AFIA we set targeted k to 50 The 002rst week four days in May is used for warm-up and only the accuracies of the subsequent summaries are evaluated We perform topk queries on all summaries at each spatio-temporal granularity We compare the topk most frequent terms in each summary produced by AFIA and SS and compare with the corresponding topk items produced by HT We set k  20  156 


a Total number of active cells b Terms per hour per 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 cell c Terms per week per 100 002 100 km 2 cell Fig 9 Twitter Workload Intensity at Different Spatio-Temporal Granularities The results are shown in Figure 10 We measure the fraction of correct topk for varying spatial granularities and we report separate graph for each temporal granularity The coarser spatio-temporal summaries are subject to higher loads and more diverse terms At the 002nest granularity 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 in Figure 10a all approaches produce quite accurate results However as the spatial or temporal granularity gets coarser the accuracy of SS deteriorates Increasing m does not solve the problem but just postpones it On the other hand AFIA is virtually as accurate as HT at all spatial and temporal granularities Its Aggressive Increment procedure is effective in making it adapt its number of counters as needed to capture the most frequent items very accurately Due to checkpointing when several summaries have to be merged few topk terms are missed and we did not observe accuracies below 0.99 0.98 and 0.97 for hours days and weeks respectively Figure 11 reports the average number of counters maintained per summary in the same experiment Note the logscaled y-axis The 002gure con\002rms the impracticality of using HT in large scale scenarios SS maintains a 002xed number of counters The 002gure shows how AFIA adapts At hours and days Figures 11a\22611b AFIA follows SS  m  100  implying that on average 100 counters is enough to achieve the desired accuracy At weeks Figures 11c the adaptivity of AFIA is even clearer for 002ner cells it uses much fewer counters than for coarser cells This experiment shows how AFIA achieves the best of two worlds accuracy is at the level of HT which is 100 accurate while the space requirements are at the level of SS with a small number of counters Having demonstrated the accuracy of our approach we proceed to large scale performance experiments on the HMC machine E Varying targeted k In this experiment we vary targeted k and consider two cases where the 002nest spatial granularity is 0.1 002 0.1 km 2 and 1 002 1 km 2  For each case we also maintain all the coarser granularities Figure 12 shows the results AFIA always has a throughput of more than 13,000 items per second Figure 12a As expected the throughput increases as either targeted k decreases or the 002nest granularity becomes more coarse Figure 12b shows how the memory consumption increases with increasing targeted k  This is because increasing numbers of counters have to be maintained to guarantee correctness when there are more terms The memory consumption increases slowly at 002rst due to fewer checkpoints occurring Figure 12c Thus for small values of targeted k  much of the space consumption is due to checkpoints As expected more memory is required for maintaining 002ner granularities The results show that a single HMC machine can maintain between 2 and 3 months of data meaning that it takes 4 to 6 machines to support a full year At current costs 1  this is feasible for larger companies Note that the measured memory consumption represents the entire Java heap memory used by the application The actual aggregates not shown require much less When targeted k is set to a low value the number of required counters will most often also be low With only a few counters any small change in activity of a cell may impact the targeted k counters resulting in a checkpoint Therefore we see that the number of checkpoints decreases with targeted k  Having a high number of counters makes a cell more robust to changes in activity and any small changes can be captured without checkpoints The number of checkpoints increases as expected when a 002ner granularity is maintained F Varying Q:R and Q:T We 002x targeted k at 100 and vary the spatial and temporal extents of the queries We employ the two query sets and measure the average runtime Figures 13a and 13b show the results Retrieving a summary requires one or more constant time lookups in Algorithm 3 Line 3 depending on the spatial or temporal granularity of the query and it may also require the merging of checkpointed summaries Because 002ner granularity cells generally receive fewer items than coarser granularity cells the runtime is lower at 002ner granularities Fewer merges are required because more cells are empty The results show that this applies to both the spatial and the temporal granularities When the spatial extent increases more lookups are performed resulting in an expected higher runtime With more coarse temporal granularities more merges are performed increasing the runtime further The runtime is not made worse  1 The price for a Spot Instance in June 2013 was USD 0.343 per hour 157

Fig 14 Checkpoints Over Time V C ONCLUSIONS We present a new framework for the processing of spatiotemporally constrained topk most popular terms queries on streaming spatio-temporally tagged text content such as microblog posts The framework's index extends existing techniques for counting frequent items in summaries to allow the summaries to grow and shrink dynamically to adapt to changes in the incoming data Query processing works by merging relevant summaries To provide guarantees about the query results a new merging algorithm is proposed that supports spatio-temporal query regions Experimental studies with an implementation of the framework offers insight into the accuracy scalability and performance of the processing of incoming data and queries and they demonstrate that the framework is capable of offering very accurate query results at high performance at scale A CKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was supported in part by the MADALGO research center and in part by the

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
