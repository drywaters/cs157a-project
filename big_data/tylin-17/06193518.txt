Abstract 
227Detecting network traf\036c anomalies is crucial for network operators as it helps to identify security incidents and to monitor the availability of networked services Although anomaly detection has received signi\036cant attention in the literature the automatic classi\036cation of network anomalies still remains an open problem In this paper we introduce a novel scheme and build a system to detect and classify anomalies that is based on an elegant combination of frequent item-set mining with decision tree learning Our approach has two key features 1 
003 effectiveness 
simplicity 
 an operator can easily comprehend how our detector and classi\036er operates We evaluate our scheme using traf\036c traces from two real networks namely from the European-wide backbone network of G 264 EANT and from a regional peering link in Spain In both cases we achieve an overall classi\036cation accuracy greater than 98 and a false-positive rate of approximately only 1 In addition we show that it is possible to train our classi\036er with data from one network and use it to effectively classify anomalies in a different network Finally we have built a corresponding anomaly 
 it has a very low false-positive rate and 2 
detection and classi\036cation system and have deployed it as part of an operational platform where it is successfully used to monitor two 10Gb/s peering links between the Catalan and the Spanish national research and education networks NREN 
I I NTRODUCTION During the last years the presence of cyber attacks has grown dramatically throughout the Internet Consequently  the detection of anomalies on network traf\336c data has been studied extensively Despite signi\336cant research efforts anomaly detection systems have not been yet widely adopted

by network operators mainly because 1 they generate a large number of false positives 2 they use complex detection techniques that are often incomprehensible i.e a 322black box\323 to network operator and 3 they require learning a labeled 322ground truth\323 dataset from the target network In addition to anomaly detection anomaly classi\336cation i.e automatically identifying the type of a detected anomaly has been marginally studied in the past Most anomaly detection systems e.g  dif ferentiate between normal and anomalous traf\336c but they usually cannot distinguish different anomaly types Moreover analyzing the root cause of network anomalies is a matter of increasing importance Once an anomaly has been 337agged network operators need to diagnose 
the type of the anomaly in order to act accordingly and take the appropriate mitigation measures Presently operators typically need to invest many work-hours to manually inspect and classify detected anomalies which is an extremely complex slow and expensive process In this paper we introduce a scheme that automatically detects and classi\336es anomalies in high-speed networks using traf\336c 337ow data e.g NetFlow Our scheme combines simple and effective techniques from two worlds data mining and machine learning First we use frequent item-set mining FIM to 336nd a set of 
frequent item-sets 
FIs A frequent item-set is a large set of 337ows that have one or more 337ow features 
in common For example an attack such as a 
Network Scan 
will produce many 337ows with the same source IP address and destination port number which after applying FIM will give rise to one frequent item-set with two items the scanner IP address and the scanned port number Second our scheme builds a decision tree to classify frequent item-sets as anomalous or benign and to determine their speci\336c type in case they are anomalous A key novelty of our approach is that we classify FIs based on a set of FI features Intuitively we decompose observed traf\336c into distinct groups FIs of related traf\336c 337ows which enables us to classify each FI with high 
UDP scan SYN Scan ACK Scan 
 etc A main advantage of our scheme is that it is conceptually simple and therefore easy to understand and con\336gure by a network operator Our scheme can be used as a stand-alone anomaly detector and classi\336er 
accuracy The decision tree classi\336es the type of an anomaly along a two-level hierarchy a main class e.g

et al et al A Frequent Item-set Mining et al   mak e use of parallel coordinate plots to 336nd unique patterns of attacks that are easy to recognize visually by a human expert In contrast we propose a technique that can automatically classify network anomalies without requiring later manual inspection  Applying FIM to network traf\336c allows us to discover groups of many 337ows sharing a certain combination of features e.g IPs or/and ports The extraction of item-sets allows us to represent traf\336c in a compact form which more clearly re\337ects the characteristic 50 minimum support or it can be combined with anomaly extraction in which case it only performs anomaly classi\336cation We have thoroughly evaluated our scheme with real traces and manually veri\336ed the detected anomalies An exhaustive analysis using data from the European-wide backbone network of G 253 EANT showed that our scheme has very high accuracy approximately 98 Finally we have built a corresponding anomaly detection and classi\336cation system have deployed it in a regional academic network and have further con\336rmed its effectiveness by reporting similar accuracy and low false positive rates approximately 1 when monitoring the two 10 Gb/s links that connect the Catalan and the Spanish NREN RedIris The decision trees used by our system were trained with labeled data from the G 253 EANT network and were found to be accurate when applied to classify anomalies in the regional academic network This is particularly promising as it shows that it is possible to learn a traf\336c model in one network and use it effectively in a different network The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section II brie\337y reviews the related work Section III presents our anomaly detection and classi\336cation scheme Section IV describes our evaluation in two network environments Finally Section V concludes our paper II R ELATED W ORK Several works have proposed various anomaly detection techniques for a survey of results refer to Among these a number of network traf\336c anomaly detection methods use wavelets  Principal Component Analysis PCA 3  or Kalman 336lters 5 to distinguish between normal and anomalous traf\336c but do not provide information about the type of detected anomalies The problem of anomaly extraction has been recently treated in the literature 9 Among the e xisting proposals the most relevant to our work uses a frequent item-set mining FIM algorithm to identify the 337ows related to an anomaly from a given hint e.g an involved IP address provided by an external anomaly detector Our system uses a FIM algorithm FPmax not only to e xtract those 337o ws associated to an anomaly but also to 1 detect anomalies if we do not have an external detector at our disposal and to 2 classify anomalies To the best of our knowledge only few works have addressed the problem of anomaly classi\336cation Lakhina  cluster the output of a PCA-based anomaly detector to identify anomalies with similar behavior Human intervention is necessary to 336nd out the correspondence between each reported cluster and the high-level anomaly that it is describing Tellenbach  classify changes to generalized entrop y metrics of traf\336c feature distributions to identify the type of detected anomalies They demonstrate that this approach can classify with accuracy of around 85 synthetic anomalies Most related to our approach Choi Fig 1 System Overview III A NOMALY D ETECTION AND C LASSIFICATION A fundamental idea of our approach is that the entity that is classi\336ed as either normal or anomalous is a frequent item-set In contrast previous approaches to network traf\336c anomaly detection typically classify a time interval based on aggregate metrics derived from the traf\336c observed during this time interval We also split time into intervals e.g 5-minute intervals then for each time interval we 336nd the corresponding frequent item-sets and 336nally we classify frequent item-sets We argue that it is much easier to classify a frequent itemset as normal or anomalous than to classify the entire traf\336c observed during a time interval since a frequent item-set conveniently groups 337ows related to anomalies We describe how we exploit FIM in Section III-A Figure 1 shows an overview of our anomaly detection and classi\336cation scheme The of\337ine information 337ow in the bottom of the 336gure creates a decision tree starting from a semi-manually derived ground truth of normal anomalous or unknown frequent item-sets The ground truth as we discuss in detail further on can be derived using the traf\336c inspection techniques developed in and/or by le v eraging information from external anomaly detectors The normal anomalous and unknown frequent item-sets are fed to a learning algorithm which produces a simple decision tree that is used for detecting anomalies and for classifying the type of a detected anomaly On top of Figure 1 we illustrate the online information 337ow Given a set of traf\336c 337ows observed e.g with NetFlow during a time interval we 336rst apply FIM to extract frequent itemsets then for each frequent item-set we compute a number of traf\336c features and 336nally we use the decision tree to classify frequent item-sets based on their features We describe our anomaly classi\336cation approach based on supervised learning in Section III-B Frequent item-set mining FIM is a well-known data mining technique that focuses on 336nding items that occur frequently together in a certain dataset A set of items will be considered frequent if they appear together at least as many times as a given threshold which is called

mining on is the well known 5tuple 337ow source/destination IP addresses source/destination ports and protocol The selection of these items makes our scheme compatible with NetFlow which is widely deployed in operational environments Table I shows three example item-sets one per row Each of these item-sets summarizes a group of 337ows Each 336eld can have a speci\336c value or a wild card which means that there is no restriction for that 336eld For example the second itemset summarizes all 337ows coming from one speci\336c IP address that is scanning multiple destination IP addresses on port 80 using different source ports while the 336rst item-set resembles a distributed attack to a speci\336c destination IP address and port The learning method we present in Section III-B automatically identi\336es the correct anomaly class of an item-set In our example it would classify the 336rst item-set as a ms 0 0 0 increases the number of anomalous item-sets this comes at a price the total

In the example of Table I maximal item-set mining would suppress the third item-set We selected the FPmax algorithm as a miner  which according to 16 is one of the best performing methods for 336nding maximal item-sets Nonetheless note that our system is not tied to FPmax and any other frequent item-set miner could be used instead We specify the In order to classify the item-sets extracted by FPmax we use a machine learning ML technique According to the C4.5 algorithm  is one of the methods that of fers the best trade-off between execution time and accuracy in traf\336c classi\336cation We selected its evolution the C5.0 algorithm 51      In general FIM algorithms report all frequent item-sets above the given  Figure 2 shows how the number of frequent item-sets changes with the  002 002 maximal item-set mining  the amount of reported frequent item-sets is always far higher than the number of anomalous item-sets Our classi\336er distinguishes between normal and anomalous item-sets As we describe in Section III-B we create a ground truth of normal anomalous and unknown item-sets and learn their characteristics This way our classi\336er can automatically 336lter out those item-sets that correspond to normal traf\336c and reduce the number of item-sets reported Compared to the anomaly extraction technique of which applies FIM on a pre-\336ltered set of 337ows based on meta-data from an external anomaly detector to extract and summarize anomalous 337ows our approach is substantially different First we also detect anomalies by classifying FIs using a very simple classi\336er Second we additionally classify detected anomalies Our scheme can be used as stand-alone anomaly detector and classi\336er or in combination with the anomaly extraction technique of to classify anomalies In Section IV we evaluate our system using real traces from two different networks and we show that it obtains high accuracy both with and without an external detector Selecting the correct

is f requent then all its subsets less concrete item-sets i.e subset item-sets that have more wild cards are also frequent In the example of Table I this means that if the second item-set is frequent then the third item-set must be frequent as well item-set 3 is a subset of item-set 2 Because there may exist many such frequent subset item-sets the output of a standard FIM algorithm can be overwhelming In order to avoid the exponential growth in the output we use in terms of 337ows although as we will describe in Section III-B we also have a separate data structure to deal with attacks that result in a large number of packets but in a small number of 337ows e.g single axis the number of frequent item-sets we have manually identi\336ed as anomalous We observe how these two variables

selected feature The gain ratio is de\336ned as follows and TABLE II Frequent item-set classi\336cation features In order to apply ML for anomaly classi\336cation we 336rst need a ground truth of pre-classi\336ed anomalies Secondly we have to decide what features will be used to perform the classi\336cation Finally we need to de\336ne a list of anomaly types The C5.0 algorithm uses a labeled data-set to create a model that predicts the class of an item-set It selects one feature at each step to split the training dataset accordingly The importance of a particular feature is given by the metric which is the entropy Establishing a ground truth is one of the most critical phases of any machine learning process because the entire classi\336cation process relies on its accuracy We have used a set of anomalies detected in the G 253 EANT backbone network These anomalies were 336rst detected by three commercial anomaly detectors and then manually validated by the security experts of G 253 EANT An important aspect of our classi\336cation is that the decision tree needs to distinguish between legitimate and anomalous item-sets Consequently we extended the ground truth as described in Section IV with item-sets corresponding to normal traf\336c For each item-set we use the 13 features shown in Table II that can be trivially derived from NetFlow data For the source and destination IP addresses we use a boolean that states if an IP address is part of a frequent item-set The source and destination port features take values between 1 and 65535 If a port is not de\336ned a special value is used to indicate that it is not a number NaN Similarly the protocol feature takes a speci\336c protocol value or the NaN value The features are important to collect information about the bandwidth usage and to capture the used packet sizes e.g packets of minimal length are commonly used in attacks such as  The scanner probes multiple hosts e.g a whole subnet to 336nd systems running a

tree for performance reasons since the until an anomalous item-set was found In few cases which we discarded the reached almost zero without identifying an anomalous item-set After this process we ended up with 760 anomalous item-sets which we used as ground truth To classify an item-set as normal or anomalous we manually examined a sample of the 337ows of an item-set e.g the 336rst 20 using the methodology shown in  W e classi\336ed an item-set as anomalous if its 337ows had suspicious feature values e.g destination port 22 and regular patterns pointing to an automated process like a bot that generated them For example one such regular pattern is the observation of a very large number of 337ows with a speci\336c packet size combination of TCP 337ags source addresses and 337ow interarrival time interval In order to differentiate between malicious and legitimate traf\336c we added normal item-sets to the training set To 336nd normal item-sets we applied FPmax on random samples of 30-minute intervals for the same 14day period during which the anomalies were found We then manually inspected the 337ows of approximately 300 new itemsets and classi\336ed them as

mining with decision tree learning Using real data from two different networks we showed that our solution has a very high classi\336cation accuracy i.e above 98 and a low false positive rate i.e approximately 1 In addition with our proposal it is easy for network operators to understand and reason about detected anomalies Based on our scheme we have implemented an anomaly detection and classi\336cation system and deployed it in a production network where it successfully monitors two 10 Gb/s links Moreover a particularly promising feature of our classi\336er is that it has been trained using traf\336c traces from the European backbone network of G 253 EANT and has been used successfully to detect and classify anomalies in a substantially different regional network A

one to submit a textual query a description logic DL sentence or SQL-like query and the use of a reasoner to get an appropriate answers The following list contains potentially useful queries  subClass or superClass of a given class type  subProperty or superProperty of a given property type  what type of class all or direct superclasses a given instance is  whether two given instances or two types are the same or different  what is the value of a speci\036ed property of a instance  all the instances of a class  all the properties of a given instance The above queries can improve the access to large hierarchically structured document collections in order to support such as knowledge-repository exploration or cross-repository exploration V A PPLICATIONS Retrieval models involve indexing processes representation for documents and queries matching operations between them and criteria of similarity to extract results This section describes two models that exploit ontologies of records to search on collections The 036rst is keyword-based while the second uses the semantic features of ontologies for exploration A Keyword-based retrieval model Web search engines generally are keyword-based search They choose documents according to Boolean combinations of term matching conditions and similarity measures  T his section describes a keyword-based model that retrieves clusters of records from XML ontologies Here records are treated as documents queries as speci\036cations of clusters of documents and ontologies as the structures that store documents of collections Ontologies of records can be regarded as trees that cluster metadata documents so that each k level cluster is described by a k term label For each cluster each of its documents contains the k terms of its label The Boolean model the VSM model or latent semantic indexing can be adapted to search on ontologies However they would produce lists of non-related documents Thus we have developed a model that searches for relevant clusters through matching operations between queries and cluster labels XML ontologies are used for this purpose since the model only requires the labels of each cluster In the proposed model natural language queries are converted to keyword-based queries Query keywords are extracted after a stopword elimination process The stopword list used is formed by intersecting the stopword lists of CACM and Time collections 7  Keywords are case-insensitive 7 The collection of Communitcations of the ACM CACM and the Time collection are available at http  ir.dcs.gla.ac.uk/resources/test c ollections June 16th 2008 Algorithm V-A describes the search process on the ontology of a collection It comprises two main stages selection of potential clusters and application of a similarity function This algorithm uses the following de\036nitions  Length of a query  The number of query keywords  Potential cluster  A cluster for which a similarity measure between query keywords and the cluster label is equal or greater than a threshold  Potential collection  The set of potential clusters  Similar record  An element of a potential cluster Also Algorithm V-A uses the following conventions  A query q of m terms is represented as a tuple q  q 1 q 2  q m  where m is the length of q  Query terms are connected with AND operators  An ontology of records is brie\037y represented as a tuple O\(t,d,c,r where t is the number of nodes at the 036rst level it corresponds with the number of frequent 1-itemsets d is the number of levels c is the number of clusters and r is the total number of records The root cluster has level 0  C\(l indicates that l is the label of a cluster C  S\(q,l denotes a similarity function between a query q and a cluster label l   card\(X represents the cardinality of a set X  that is the number of elements of X Algorithm V-A Algorithm V-A input q q 1 q 2   q m  query of length m  O\(t,d,c,r ontology of records output P  potential collection begin 1 determine the set C of c potential clusters such as 005 q i  q i 006 c\(l  0 007 i 007 m  2 for each c 006 C do 3 add the label l to the list of labels L c 4 for each label l 006 L c do 5 apply S\(q,l 6 order L c in a descendent way according to S\(Q,l 7 form a sublist L r by selecting the 036rst n labels from L c  where n is the maximum number of potential clusters 8 for each label l r 006 L r 9 retrieve the similar records of each cluster c  l r  to form P 10 if card\(C  n  P  P 010 P  where P is the set of relevant documents according to the Boolean model applied to q and the root cluster of O\(t,d,c,r end  Function 9 measures the similarity between the label l of the cluster c and a query q q 1 q 2   q m   S  q l  005 q i w  q i   0 007 i 007 m 9

where q i represents a query keyword and w q i  is the average of the weights of q i in the feature vectors of cluster c  Algorithm V-A makes retrieval faster because it applies the similarity function S\(q,l only to cluster labels instead of all records of an ontology Intuitively labels with more terms represent more speci\036c topics than labels of ancestor clusters A retrieving task using multiple collections requires the management of multiple ontologies For this purpose the 036rst 036ve steps of Algorithm V-A are implemented per collection in such a way that Lc contains the labels of all potential clusters Steps 6 7 8 and 9 are implemented without any modi\036cation Step 10 requires to generate the union of root clusters of the participating ontologies This task eliminates duplicate documents The representation of the potential collection P in the web interface shows a tree of clusters that enables the retrieval of groups of similar documents The tree has links that allow users to access metadata documents B Ontology-based exploration model This section describes an exploration model that uses the semantic features of ontologies of records At this point it is assumed that an ontology of records of a collection has been constructed and mapped in XML RDF and OWL languages The input to the ontology-based exploration model is a structured query which is generated from a form-based interface where the user selects an implementation of the ontology and enters queries about the path of the elements of the ontology such as classes relationships or property values The query is executed against the chosen implementation to obtain a result which is formed by instance tuples that satisfy the query The result is encoded in XML to form a response XML ontologies can be queried with XML query languages or parsers We use XPath  to allo w u sers to address parts of ontologies through the hierarchical structure of their elements In this implementation ontologies of records are regarded as sets of nodes and attributes RDF and OWL implementations have enough expressive power to represent the semantics of the real world information in machine-accessible ways The former has formal syntax formal semantics and XML Schema datatypes while the latter is the standard recommended by the W3C for Semantic Web At the time of this writing there is no standardization of query languages for RDF and OWL We have used Jena 8  a tool with some degree of support for OWL and RDF to search on these mappings where queries express conditions involving domain ontology instances document properties or classi\036cation values The keyword-based retrieval model and the ontology-based exploration model are similarity-based retrieval tasks 8 Jena A Semantic Web Framework for Java http://jena.sourceforge.net June 16th 2008 VI C ONCLUSIONS This work presented OntOAIr an ontology learning method to construct lightweight ontologies from multiple document collections The method is based on four main tasks harvesting representation clustering and formalization The harvesting task obtains the documents from the collections The representation task constructs a vectorial representation for each harvested document The clustering task applies an exclusive hierarchical algorithm to the vectors in order to produce a tree of clusters The implementation task transforms the tree of clusters into a lightweight ontology The construction of ontologies requires minimal human intervention We used the FIHC algorithm proposed by as the exclusive hierarchical clustering algorithm for which and we proposed an adaptation Experimental evaluations have shown that the FIHC algorithm is as at least as good as UPGMA algorithm and bisecting k-means algorithm The ontologies constructed by the OntOAIr method constitute a data model able to provide an unambiguous and shared terminology that human and software agents can both understand and use Ontologies are also an information retrieval model on their own because they support indexing and retrieval The indexing process is based on two tasks 1 the selection of informative elements of each record and 2 the organization of the records in data structures that enable the search The retrieval process has been implemented through the keyword-based retrieval model and the ontology-based exploration model These models assume that a record that does not match any term in the query is not relevant An algorithm to establish similarity between queries and groups of records has been developed for the keyword-based retrieval model We have conducted some small scale experimentation and as a result we have demonstrated that the effectiveness of the keyword-based retrieval model is similar to that of the vector spaces model Further experimentation and larger document sets are needed to test and improve our method The OntOAIr method can be used to support manual construction of ontologies to cluster the responses of search engines or as a basis to support reasoning in Semantic Web contexts As future work we propose three tasks for the maintenance of these ontologies 1 the inclusion of a set of records in a previously constructed ontology without compromising the accuracy of the clustering or the effectiveness of the retrieval 2 the management of versioning which should help to keep track of their evolution and 3 the incorporation of inference mechanisms that search through the ontologies and deduce results in an organized manner in order to complete missing information Inference can be used for implicit query expansion or to automatically maintain the consistency

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresby PCA, number of records by FP-Growth By experiments, found the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
