Vertical Fragmentation of Data warehouses using the FP-Max Algorithm  M. Bouakkaz,  Y. Ouinten, B. Ziani LIM, Computer sciences department University of Laghouat Laghouat, Algeria m.bouakkaz,ouinteny,bziani}@mail.lagh-univ.dz    Abstract  Vertical partitioning is a technique used to reduce disk access, when executing a given set of queries, by minimizing the access to irrelevant instance variables. In this paper we use the FPMax data mining algorithm, for extracting frequent item set attributes. The frequently accessed instance variables are, then grouped as vertical class fragments. We study the application of this approach to sets of queries on large databases and data warehouses. We used two benchmarks with various minimum support levels and we compare our results with the results of the approach using the Apriori data mining technique. The partitioning solution obtained produces an improvement of 14% for large data bases and 19% for data warehouse compared to a solution without partitioning  Keywords- database; data warehouse; vertical partitioning; frequent item set; data mining  I  I NTRODUCTION  Vertical partitioning \(or fragmentation\ is a design technique for reducing the number of disk accesses needed to execute a query by minimizing the number of irrelevant instance variables accessed. This can be achieved by using a data mining technique for extracting frequent item sets of attributes which are then grouped in vertical class fragments The complexity of large database models makes the problem of vertical partitioning in large DBs very challenging. Gorla and Betty  have used the Apriori algorithm tra ct frequently used attributes to obtain vertical partitioning schemas. We chose in our work to use the FP-Max algorithm as it produces less frequent item sets, in general, since it focuses on the maximal ones only. To compare the two approaches, we used standard database workload on large database and on data warehouses. We will start by a brief overview of related work to vertical database partitioning, in general, and to the use of data mining in vertical partitioning in particular II  R ELATED WORK  Vertical partitioning is the process that divides a relation into sub-relations containing subsets of the original attributes The preliminary ideas of vertical class partitioning for large DBs were developed in  11 1 3 14 f o r Dat a  Warehouse Design, in  d f o r Ob j ect Orien t e d  Database design, in Most of the vertical fragmentation algorithms start with the construction of an attribute affinity matrix, from the attribute usage matrix, in which the element i  j resents the total number of accesses of transactions referencing both attributes i  and j An iterative binary partitioning method has been used in  h ich i s bas ed on clus te rin g t h e attributes firs t, an d t h en  applying empirical objective functions or mathematical cost functions to perform the fragmentation Cornell and Yu in [5 p l o it an o p tim a l b i n a r y p artitio n i n g  algorithm to achieve vertical partitioning, which is iteratively applied to obtain more partitions.

They argue that the system performance can be optimized by reducing the number of accesses to relevant data for a query.

The approach was tested with large databases in [18 an d w ill b e  tested in this paper with both a large database and a data warehouse A  Extracting frequent Item sets frequent itemsets are the combinations of attributes that have a support greater than a predefined minimum support This frequent itemsets can be discovered by using the FP-Max algorithm [1  T h e suppo rt  o f ca nd i d a t e r e p r e s e n t s t h e frequency of queries that contain the candidate set.

VI  D ISCUSSION  The cost reduction obtained for different values of the threshold for ADULT database and TPC-H data warehouse are plotted, respectively, in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The results we obtained show that the approach based on the FP-MAX algorithm yields better performances then that based on the APRIORI algorithm in all almost all cases.  As we can see in Figures 1 and 2 the best reduction in the cost is obtained for a threshold   of   40% in for both  datasets.  The FPMAX-VP approach yields better cost reductions than APRIORI-VP because these latter produces more fragments.  Hence, at workload execution, queries must access many fragments which increases reconstruction costs VII  C ONCLUSION  We have presented, in this paper, an approach that handles the vertical fragmentation problem using the FP-max algorithm for extracting frequent itemsets which are then used to generate partitioning schemas. Implementation results have shown that our approach FPMAX-VP produces good performance in terms of the number of disk accesses as compared with APRIORIVP. The approach exposed in this paper can be extended in several directions. It can be extended to the case of other physical design techniques, such as mixed fragmentation. On the other hand, the selection of the best partitioning schema depends on the cost function used. Other cost functions incorporating more parameters can be explored. Finally, our aim is to compare different approaches using the same cost model to evaluate the generated partitioning schema, and then integrate these approaches in one tool that will enable administrators in their management task of large datasets R EFERENCES  1  Agrawal, R., & Srikant, R. \(1994\ Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

The performance curves are very similar to those in Fig 2 for the supplementary sensor case. The only performance difference is the separation between the Bar-Shalom-Campo and the Speyer rules, caused by the inclusion of the cross covariance 12 V  IV  R EPEATED T RACK F USION W ITHOUT F EEDBACK  Let us consider the cases where the track fusion, either between the local two sensor systems, or by the fusion center is repeated. Let 12 FF FN tt t    either to each other, or the fusion center We will examine two different modes of information flows: \(i\ fusion without feedback, and \(ii repeated track fusion with feedback. This section will describe the former, while the latter will be described in the next section The fusion rules described in the previous section will or will not be modified for the repeated fusion as follows Bar-Shalom-Campo, Speyer and CI Rules Since these rules do not use the a priori information, under the repeated track fusion, they use only the most recent state estimates. In that sense, these rules can be said to be memoryless rules  Tracklet Fusion Rule The tracklet fusion defined in the previous section for the one-time fusion can be applied to the repeated fusion cases as an almost memoryless rule, using the most recent local state estimates, and the a priori information When we use the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, since the velocity process is a priori a stationary stochastic process even when the track fusion is repeated many times, the use of the a priori information makes a certain difference from the Speyer rule. We call this form of application of the tracklet rule the common prior form  Decorrelation Method Another form of extension of the tracklet rule for the repeated fusion can be written as  1111 11 22 1111 12 210 210 210 Fk Fk Fk Fk k k k k Fk Fk k k Vx Vx V V VVVV  where 210 Fk x is the fused state estimate at the k th fusion time Fk t with the estimation error covariance matrix 210 Fk V  Fk x is the extrapolation of the fused state estimate 1 210 Fk x  We call this form of the tracklet fusion rule the decorrelation form The ik  the two sensors simultaneously send the local state estimates 210 ik x 1 2 i 212\212\212\212 212 212\212\212 r 212\212\212 212\212\212 r obtained by the decorrelation is sometimes called the pseudo-measurement or the equivalent measurements  T h i s decorrel a t i on method is used as a basic mechanism for isolating the approximately conditionally independent information in the form of the pair   ik ik V r 212\212  This fusion rule is also called the information filter in  and the channel filter in [24 T h e d ec o rrelatio n f o rm o f t h e tracklet filter, \(7\d \(8\e one-step or  limited memory method.

However, as we have accumulate the local state estimates the MV estimate, as defined in this way, may require a large number of cross covariance matrices among local state estimates at many past fusion times. To avoid such an increase of requirements, we may limit the number of past local estimates in eqn. \(9\ make the MV rule a limited memory rule Numerical Example Fig. 5 shows the comparison of the performance by various fusion rules for a repeated fusion without feedback case. We have chosen a complementary sensor case described in the previous section. The same Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model is used.

  a\MS Position Erro r   b\MS Velocity Error Fig. 5: Performance Comparison: Repeated Fusion without Feedback as a Function of Normalized Process Noise Intensity Level  In these figures, the two MV rules are shown: one using only the most recent local state estimates, labeled as MV 1 and the other using the most recent two local state estimates for each sensor, labeled as MV 2. Because of the orthogonal symmetry of the sensor measurement error covariance matrices \(of complementary sensors\, as discussed in the previous section, both the Shannon and the Chen-ArambelMehra rules yield the equal scalar weights 1  2 007  and labeled as CI rule, which becomes the same as the Speyer rule The tracklet rule is in its decorrelation form The positional estimation performance of various fusion rules generally shows the same trends with two peaks. The reversal of the performance in the positional and velocity estimation in the ranking of the Bar-Shalom-Campo and the tracklet rules remain the same. However, when the normalized white noise intensity level 2    v qt n\013 is small, effects of using or not using the a priori information are clearly reflected in the figures as the difference between the two groups; a group consisting of the tracklet and the MV 2 rules, and the remaining ones V  R EPEATED F USION WITH F EEDBACK  It is rather natural to feedback fused state estimates to the local sensor processing nodes, so that they can process data with improved accuracy. Certainly, we can expect to improve the gating and the false alarm \(clutter\ection performance in that way. With proper feedback, the overall system stability may be improved as well, provided that the information being exchanged is unbiased. However, one potential problem of the feedback approach is: When the two local state estimates are fused, either at a fusion node, or at each local node, depending on any particular track fusion rule, the estimation error covariance of the fused state estimate may or may not be accurate. Both pessimistic and optimistic departure from the 223true\224 estimation error may deteriorate the performance of the local sensor tracking ability, when it is propagated back to the local data processing node. The study presented in this section is to explore such effects The adjustments for fusion rules to this situation will be summarized as follows Bar-Shalom-Campo, Speyer, and CI Rules Since these rules do not use the a priori information, the rules themselves are unchanged. However, although the fused estimation error covariance matrix that the Bar-Shalom-Campo rule produces is honest or consistent meaning that it is exact both the Speyer and the CI rules provide estimation error covariance that is not honest. The one from the former tends to be optimistic, and the one from the latter pessimistic Minimum Variance  MV  Tracklet Rules Since the entire information, as far as the state estimates exchanged among the estimation nodes are concerned, is shared within the entire system, it is no longer necessary to extend the length of the memory of the past state estimates. Both MV and tracklet rules require only one-step-before fused estimate as the a priori information. Therefore, the MV rule uses only the most recent local state estimates as the best affine estimator while the tracklet rule can use its one-step-memory form rather than the decorrelation form that becomes equivalent Numerical Example The same example using the complementary sensors and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model is used. Fig. 6 shows the comparison of the same set of fusion rules that are shown in Fig. 5. The overall trends among various fusion rules largely remain the same. As in Fig. 5, the deterioration from the centralized-tracking performance remains small, i.e., within 5%, over a very large range of the normalized process noise intensity  a\MS Position Erro r   b\MS Velocity Error Fig. 6: Performance Comparison: Repeated Fusion with Feedback: Function of Normalized Process Noise Intensity Level  2001 


 However, we observe two departures from Fig. 5: \(i Because the Speyer and the CI rules use different calculations for the resultant fused estimate error covariance, we observe some differences in their performance; in a high maneuver rate area for the positional estimation, and in a low maneuver rate area for the velocity estimation. \(ii\ the Bar-ShalomCampo and the Speyer rules exhibit slight divergent trends in the positional estimation performance in a high maneuver rate area. Again the rules that do not use the a priori information i.e., the Bar-Shalom-Campo, the Speyer, and the CI rules, do not show the convergence when the target model approaches its deterministic form VI  T RACK A SSOCIATION M ETRICS  The track association is generally a prerequisite for the track fusion in any distributed tracking system. In many cases however, the association is rather obvious, and therefore, the target state estimation in a distributed sensor environment, i.e the track fusion problems, becomes the major problem. On the other hand, when the target density becomes higher, the track association problem may become a much more important problem than the track fusion problem. In this section, we treat the situations where the distributed tracking can be viewed as a two-stage problem, i.e., the track association followed by the track fusion  Fig. 7: Tracks from Two Complementary Sensors  As a typical example, we use the complementary sensor case, used for the last two sections to examine the track fusion performance for the repeated track fusion. We consider situations where, with enough local observations, each sensor can establish tracks rather easily, but when local tracks from the two sensors are to be fused together, some serious association ambiguity may occur, as illustrated in Fig. 7  In order to simulate multiple targets situations, the set of targets are modeled by a system of independent, identically distributed \(i.i.d.\inear-Gaussian stochastic processes, i.e n  independent replications of the model described in Section II The number of targets n is generally unknown, and hence should be modeled as a random variable. However, for the study shown in this section, it will be treated as a constant assuming that there is no missed target by any of the two sensors, and no false track. This assumption may be justified in many distributed tracking situations, where the local sensor and data processing have enough capability to observe all the relevant targets, and to weed out all the false tracks As mentioned before, the idea of distributed tracking was developed shortly after the target tracking itself started to be discussed in terms of a modern estimation theory, i.e., the filtering theory. For the early works, we can cite the SingerKanyuck pu bl i s h e d i n 1971, an d t h e s e m i n a l 1981  paper by Y aak ov BarShal o m T h os e pa pers pr opos e  t h e  track association metric, used in the track-to-track association probability evaluation by  1 1   n i Pa C ia j 212\212\212 212 212 212\212 11 where x and V are the mean and the variance matrix of the a priori density function p and 12 210 ij x is the fused state estimate under the hypotheses that the two tracks originate from the same target  Extended State Metric The Chong-Mori-Chang metric provides an exact form for the track association for deterministic cases. To extend this optimality to nondeterministic cases, we can expand the target states to include all the states at local sensor observation times. We call the resultant metric the extended state metric Numerical Example Fig. 8 shows the comparison of the track association performance, measured by the probability for each track being associated with the track that shares the same 2002 212 of the track association likelihood in \(10\ the track association metric The following track association metrics are considered Bar-Shalom and Singer-Kanyuck Metrics The Bar-Shalom metric is defined as 1 1 2 12 12 2 12  210\210   T i j ij ij ij VV V V Li j x x 212   017 10 where  P a is the a posteriori probability of track-to-track association hypothesis represented by a permutation a on the set {1  n  C is the normalizing constant, and    ij  1 in  1 jn  is the track association likelihood between the ith track from sensor 1, and the j th track from sensor 2. We call the half-negative logarithm   1/2\ln   L ij ij 212 212 212 212 By A x  we mean the norm on Euclidean spaces defined by a positive definite matrix A as T A xxAx  ith the local state estimates 1 210 i x and 2 210 j x of the ith track from sensor 1, and the j th track from sensor 2, associated with self estimation error covariance matrices 1 i V and 2 j V respectively, and with the cross covariance matrix 12 ij V The Singer-Kanyuck metric ignores 12 ij V so that we have 1 12 2 12  210\210   ij ij VV Li j x x 212  212  Chong-Mori-Chang Metric This metric is derived as the linear-Gaussian form of a general track association likelihood 12 210\210          ij ij p xp x px dx  where 210 ik p is the posterior target state distribution by the k th track from the ith sensor and p is the common a priori state distribution density.

Unlike the track fusion performance, there is no exact analytic evaluation method, and hence, we use the Monte Carlo method, assuming one-time fusion after 10 local measurements, 100 independent targets 100 n  d 1000 samples for each point in the figure  a\s Function of Normalized Process Noise Intensit y b\s Function of Normalized Initial Position Uncertaint y Fig. 8: Track Association Performance Compariso n It is very natural to see that the extended state metric outperforms any other metric, because of the extent of the use of the target state history. Among other metrics, the BarShalom metric shows its advantage gained by its use of the cross covariance over the other metric VII  C ONCLUSION  We have reviewed various track fusion methods and track association metrics that have been proposed in a rather long history of distributed tracking development, dated back to the pioneering work d t h e t w o s e m i n a l  w o r k s 9,10] on t h e  subject. Using simple but realistic models, we compared performance of various track fusion rules and track association metrics. As for the track fusion performance, the performance deterioration by using any distributed tracking method is found very small, supporting the use of distributed architecture over the centralized one. The exception is the performance by the maximum likelihood method using the likelihood function in the strict Bayesian sense, showing the right choice of the likelihood concept chosen by the Bar-Shalom-Campo rule Other small variations by various track fusion rules reveal their characteristics clearly related to their derivations Throughout the track association metric comparison, as well as track fusion rule comparison, the use of the cross covariance information, emphasized in y s h o w ed  its advantage R EFERENCES  1  S.

mining on existing test-cases of a system to suggest highly relevant feature locations uniquely related to features Similar to existing dynamic analysis based feature location techniques, FLMiner makes use of scenarios. However, it has the following improvements over the existing techniques: \(a\t doesn't require users to create scenarios users can simply tag existing test-cases with the features they execute; \(b\ it doesn't require a distinct scenario for each feature, test-cases can execute multiple features and a feature can be executed in multiple test-cases; \(c\ it doesn't require users to perform cleanup on the execution-traces of scenarios due to feature dependencies FLMiner provides users guidance on the quality of the suggested feature locations and whether the results can be improved if more labeled test-cases are provided for a feature. Furthermore, it provides an end-to-end automated process to locate features from the execution of test-cases automatically to outputting feature location suggestions On fuzzy inputs, where a scenario can execute multiple features and a feature might be executed by multiple scenarios, our technique yields results, on average, within 83 97% of the results provided by a well-known successful technique [17 on b as e cas e in pu ts  a  dis tin c t s cen a r i o f o r  each feature Based on experiments on three case studies labeled test-cases yield the results described above, where there are  features. Furthermore, more labeled examples yield better results As future work, FLMiner can be complemented with static analysis to yield better results, as in [6, 17, 18   It c a n  also be improved to work for non-functional features Currently, we evaluate FLMiner against [1 b y  c o m b inin g execution traces of scenarios for each feature. As future work, we plan to evaluate it on the whole test-suite of each case study. As part of this experiment, we also plan to evaluate how fast it converges and stops for asking for more labeled test-cases. Finally, we plan to evaluate the interaction of developers and FLMiner to assess the usefulness of FLMinerês guidance on labeling test-cases as input VII A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was supported in part by NSF Grants CNS0932403 and 0729029, as well as a generous donation of phones by Qualcomm VIII R EFERENCES  1

differential dependencies  DD s in real applications like violation detection in this paper we study the problem of determining the distance thresholds for metric distance constraints from data Instead of manually specifying requirements of various statistical measures we conduct the determination in a parameter-free style i.e to compute an expected utility of the distance threshold pattern and return the results with the maximum expected utility Several advanced pruning algorithms are then developed in order to efìciently nd the desired distance thresholds Finally the experimental evaluation on three real data sets demonstrates the performance of our proposed methods In particular we evaluate the effectiveness of returned results in the violation detection application and show that the pruning techniques can achieve lower time cost A CKNOWLEDGMENTS The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No 611411 National Grand Fundamental

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
