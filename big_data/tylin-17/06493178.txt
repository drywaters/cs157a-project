The recent explosive growth in data collection made the current rule mining algorithms restricted and insufficient to analyze excessively large transaction sets 
because they suffer from many problems when mining massive transaction datasets. Some of the major problems are: \(1 required multiple database scan, \(2\massive computational power requirement \(3\ huge memory requirement , and \(4 lake of parallelism \(5\ss of interactive nature for different support value \([1-2   In t h i s  pa pe r a n  ap pr oa ch of I n vert e d  matrix, the new representation of transactional database is used and distributed it amongst parallel nodes. Frequent item from the inverted matrix is assigned to parallel nodes. In parallel implementation, a Co-Occurrence Frequent Item 
COFI\gning frequent item is generated by the parallel nodes. Mining process is accomplished by all nodes which generate all frequent items in which the assigned items are participated. Here, less communication is required amongst the master node all parallel node to generate all frequent itemsets. Two techniques have been used for assignment of frequent item to the parallel nodes, viz.  \(1 Alternate Loop Splitting \(ALS\nd \(2\lock Loop Splitting BLS\.  We have Implemented sequential as well as parallel algorithms for frequent set mining and compared its performance on mushroom [9  dat a b a s e h avi ng a p pr ox i m at e l y  
10000 transactions, 120 different items and 23 average transaction sizes. It has been found that alternate loop splitting achieves better time complexity as compared to block loop splitting. Also both the parallel techniques are found to be better than sequential algorithm Keywords- parallel data mining frequent itemset; inverted matrix; COFI tree I   I NTRODUCTION  In recent days various data mining techniques have been evolved. Frequent pattern mining is one of the important techniques used in many data mining tasks, such as association rules, correlations, causality, sequential patterns 
episodes, clusters, sequences, multi-dimensional patterns max-patterns etc. Identifying a frequent pattern is considered as one of the most important tasks and it has been focused by many practitioners/researchers since last decade. Many solutions are available that uses sequential or parallel techniques, but they are suffering from the various bottlenecks like unbalanced load distribution, high communication overheads, lacking of synchronization with parallel nodes and most important high I/O overhead for scanning the dataset multiple times. Thus, It is important and interesting research problem to mine efficient and an effective frequent pattern In this paper, a comparison of one sequential algorithm and two parallel algorithms, namely, alternate loop splitting 
and block loop splitting, which are based on inverted matrix and COFI-Tree, has been made II  P ROBLEM S TATEMENT  Frequent pattern mining is a sub-problem of mining association rules. Formal definition of frequent pattern mining can be stated as follows Let set of Items I  it 1  it 2  it 3  it n Where n is the dimensionality of the problem. Let, the task-relevant data is DB, a set of transactions database where each transaction Ts contains a set of items which is subset of I  i.e Ts   
 I A transaction Ts is said to contain R a set of items in I if R    Ts An itemset R is said to be frequent, if its support \(i.e ratio of transactions in D that contain R to the total number of transactions in D reater than or equal to a given minimum support threshold. The frequent itemset R is called a frequent k itemset, if it contains k items. A 1itemset is also called a frequent item \([4 0  Much of the present research work has been focused to mine the frequent patterns

In this algorithm, mining process is accomplished within three steps described as follows in three subsections A  Construction of Inverted Matrix Layout The transaction database is scanned twice and generates a new transaction layout called inverted matrix layout. It is combination of horizontal and vertical transaction layout, so 


  Node-1    m 2 1 Master Node Node-2 Node-m Lable ë1í indicates assignment of items 1, m+1, and so on Lable ë2í indicates assignment of item 2, m+2 and so on Lable ëmí indicated assignment of item m, m+m and so on Lable ë*í indicates node send the frequent itemset after mining all itemís COFI tree, assign to that node   it gets the benefits of both the layouts. The horizontal transaction layout combines all items together in one transaction, and vertical transaction layout relates all transaction that share the same item together B  Constructing a COFI-Tree In this step, from the inverted matrix layout, the CoOccurrence Frequent Item \(COFI\ tree is constructed which is relatively small tree for each frequent item. Important characteristic of COFI tree is that, the items which participate in constructing COFI-tree for given item I are more frequent or as frequent as I In other words, the COFItree for item I, all frequent items which are more frequent than I and share transaction with I participate in building a tree C  Mining  a COFI-Tree In this step, each COFI-tree of all items has been mined independent of each other. Here, for each COFI-tree of item I mine the k-itemset frequent patterns in which the item I  participates IV  P ARALLEL I MPLEMENTATION OF F REQUENT P ATTERN M INING  Various parallel algorithms have been developed, but they are suffering from various problems like improper dynamic load balancing, high communication cost, multiple scan of transactional database by all the parallel nodes improper data distribution etc. \([5-8  In  t h i s pa pe r   t w o parallel techniques based on the inverted matrix approach have been implemented and compared with each other These parallel techniques are also compared with the sequential technique In parallel implementation, the inverted matrix is replicated to all parallel nodes by the master node. So, all nodes are having the full transactional database. Then each node creates the COFI tree for the item which is assigned to them by the master node and mines it. After mining all the COFI trees by parallel node, frequent itemsets are sent to master node. At the end, master node having all the frequent itemsets mined by all the parallel nodes. Let n be number frequent item and m is the number of parallel nodes assuming m  n Here, the assignment of items to the parallel nodes accomplished by two parallel techniques namely, alternate loop splitting and block loop splitting are described as follows A  Alternate Loop Splitti ng\(ALS\ Technique In inverted matrix, items are stored in ascending order of their support value. So, the item which is most frequent is stored at the highest index position. In this technique, all n frequent items from the inverted matrix are evenly assigned to m nodes, one by one, i.e. least frequent item is assigned to node 1, next least frequent item is assigned to node 2 and so on up to m nodes. After that m 1 th item is assigned to node 1 and so on until all items are distributed amongst all m nodes. The implementation architecture of this technique is shown in Fig 1. and the algorithm for Alternate Loop Splitting technique is shown in Fig. 2  Figure 1  Implementation architecture of ALS Technique                   Figure 2  Implementation architecture of ALS Technique B  Block Loop Splitting BLS\ Technique In this technique, from all n frequent items from the inverted matrix, first n  m items are assigned to node 1, next n  m items are assigned to node 2 and so on. This process is continued until last n  m items are assigned to node m In other words, after ordering the frequent items by their support in inverted matrix, starting from the least frequent item, each processor successively receives n  m block of items from master node. So in this case processor 1 builds the COFI-tree for first n  m frequent items \(i.e. 0 to n  m 1 processor 2 build the COFI-tree for second n  m frequent items \(i.e n  m to \(2 n  m 1\ and so on. The   implementation architecture of this technique is shown in Fig. 3 and the algorithm for the Block Loop Splitting technique is shown in Fig.4  Algorithm: Alternate Loop Splitting Input: Transactional Database Output: Frequent itemsets 1  Create inverted matrix layout by scanning transaction database twice at master node 2  Replicate inverted matrix to every m nodes 3  Distribute n frequent items amongst m nodes assuming m  n and mine as following 3.1  Assign least frequent item from Inverted Matrix to Node 1, next least frequent item to node 2 and so on up to m nodes.

The parallel implementation of the presented algorithms is carried out using JAVA RMI. The parallel implantation was tested on a cluster of six 1.66 GHz Pentium processor having 512 MB RAM on 100 mbps LAN. The result was derived by executing the particular technique for different support value on different number of nodes varying from 1 to 6 nodes. The overall procedure was repeated multiple times and average results are presented from multiple runs. Some results are based on the maximum or minimum time taken by process amongst multiple processes executing on parallel nodes some results are based on the average time of the execution and some results are based on the time difference between maximum and minimum time taken by the parallel processes. Following observations can be made from the experimental results obtained   Parallel techniques give better performance as compared to the sequential technique \(see Fig. 5   Generally, it is apparent from  inverted matrix that there can be more possibility that the COFI tree for the less frequent item may have more depth than the COFI tree for the more frequent item. COFI tree is not generated for the item which is most frequent The COFI tree for the second most frequent item having at most depth one. Theoretically, there is high possibility that COFI tree for the less frequent item requires more time to mine compared to the COFI tree for the more frequent item. Again, in ALS frequent items are evenly distributed, one-by-one from least frequent to most frequent, while in BLS frequent items are distributed in blocks, i.e. block of most frequent items are assigned to first node and block of least frequent items are assigned to the last node. So, in ALS load is evenly distributed, where-in BLS the load is not evenly distributed. It has been observed that, ALS balances the load amongst the parallel nodes better than the BLS \(Fig. 5 and Fig 6\. In Fig. 5, we have shown the load balancing between ALS and BLS by comparing the minimum time take by the processes and maximum time take by the processes with different support values, and in Fig. 6, we have shown the load balancing by comparing the time difference between maximum time taken by the processes and minimum time taken by the processes with different support values   It has been found that the alternate loop splitting technique is efficient in terms of execution time than the block loop splitting technique\(see Fig. 7   Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show that, in both the techniques as number of processing nodes increases, the processing time decreases, for a given support value R EFERENCES  1  M.

In the proposed method, research proposals are firstly coded and compacted, and then frequent itemsets are constructed. Finally, a new clustering algorithm is developed to cluster research proposals. In terms of evaluation criteria, the empirical results revealed that among Matrix with different length and support degrees the proposed method with Matrix \(2, 40 outperforms others.

degree, the performance increases first, and then decreases. Furthermore, compared with OTMM, our proposed method can get better performance. So, it indicates that the proposed frequent itemset method can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the research proposal grouping process, and the proposed method can be used as a potential alternative to cluster research proposals In addition, this study also has some research questions for future studies. Firstly, to validate our proposed method, some additional experiments can be done using different dataset from other disciplines, and different number of research proposals in one discipline. Second, when research proposals are grouped, expert evaluation can be carried out to find proper match between reviewers and proposal groups and then reviewer assignment can also be considered Thirdly, when dealing with the proposal grouping problem, the document struct ure characters of research proposals may also be considered, such as title abstract and references, to improve the grouping quality Finally, the proposed methodology can also be applied to other research fields, especially to text clustering problem The authors would like to thank the minitrack chair and the anonymous reviewers for their valuable comments and suggestions which have helped immensely in improving the quality of the paper.

VIII C ONCLUSIONS In this paper we tackled the problem of pattern explosion when mining frequent episodes in an event sequence In such a setting much of the output is redundant as many episodes have the same frequency as some other more speciìc episodes We therefore output only closed episodes for which this is not the case Further redundancy is found in the fact that some episodes can be represented in more than one way We solve this problem by restricting ourselves to strict transitively closed episodes Deìning frequency-closed episodes created new problems as unlike in some other settings a non-closed frequent episode can have more than one closure To solve this we deìned instance-closed episodes and showed that the instance-closure of any given episode is unique We further proved that every f closed episode must also be i closed Based on this we developed an algorithm that efìciently identiìes i closed episodes as well as f closed episodes in a post-processing step Experiments have conìrmed that the reduction in output is considerable and essential for large episodes where we reduced the output by several orders of magnitude Moreover thanks to introducing i closed episodes we can now produce output for thresholds at which nding all frequent episodes is infeasible A CKNOWLEDGMENTS Nikolaj Tatti is funded by a FWO postdoctoral mandate R EFERENCES  H

default values. Clearly, MPFCI-BFS spends much more time than MPFCI does under the same parameters. In particular when min_sup is smaller, the growth rate of running time of MPFCI-BFS is much faster than that of MPFCI. This is because MPFCI-BFS lacks of effective pruning as superset/subset pruning. Fig. 12\(b\hows the running time of two algorithms while pfct varies from 0.1 to 0.9 and other parameters are default values. The running time of MPFCIBFS has slow growth with the decrease of pfct and is more than the running time of MPFCI. This is because that MPFCIBFS also includes Chernoff-Hoeffding bound-based pruning and such pruning mainly reduces the influence of the pfct to running time. So, the change of running time of MPFCI-BFS under pfct varying is smaller than the change under min_sup varying. We also tested other parameters; all results show that MPFCI is more efficient than MPFCI-BFS. This is because that Superset pruning and Subset pruning are effective pruning methods and MPFCI-BFS has to traverse much more search space. Due to space limit, we did n t show these results in here  a\ min_sup varying                                    \(b\pfct varying Fig. 12 Running time of MPFCI and MPFCI-BFS w.r.t different parameters VI  C ONCLUSIONS  In this paper, we propose a new problem of mining probabilistic threshold-based frequent closed itemsets in an uncertain transaction database We prove that even a subproblem of this problem, computing the frequent closed probability of an itemset, is #P-Hard. Due to the computational complexity of this problem, an effective and efficient depth-first search-based mining algorithm has been designed in order to obtain all probabilistic frequent closed itemsets. Moreover, several probabilistic pruning techniques are also designed to reduce se arch space and to avoid many complicated computations. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the mining algorithm A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The work described in this paper was partially supported by Hong Kong RGC GRF Project No. 611411; National Grand Fundamental Research 973 Program of China under Grant 2012CB316200 R EFERENCES  1  C.

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
