in the above system call sequences example Through the super-sequence patterns we can predict what are the possible patterns if the system allows l system calls for a session where l>k  The SS-FPM problem is related to the longest path problem in graphs which is known to be NP-hard W e rst transform the given sequential dataset into a sequence graph  and then represent it in a matrix Searching the most frequent super-sequence becomes the problem to search the longest path In our problem however we are interested in nding all the k hop paths   k 1 length super-sequence frequent patterns that have a larger weight than a given threshold Note that k hop longest path is the same as  k 1 length super-sequence frequent pattern SS-FP In response to solving this new form of the longest path problem we propose a heuristic method that uses Dynamic Programming techniques to gradually compute k hop paths from the initial one-step sequence matrix and the  k  1 hop paths computed in previous iteration As we discuss later in detail the overall worst-case complexity of the proposed heuristic will be O  kn 4   However in practice since the sequence graphs are sparse we will see in Section V that the running time is reasonable based on the experiments on the web log dataset The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows In Section II we give related work in frequent pattern mining area We formally de“ne super-sequence frequent pattern mining SS-FPM problem and give the graph model in Section III In Section IV we present our proposed heuristic method using dynamic programming for solving the SS-FPM problem We then evaluate the performance of our solution through experiments on actual web log dataset in Section V Finally we conclude this paper and point out some issues for future research in Section VI II R ELATED W ORK Frequent Pattern Mining FPM plays an important role in data mining research area It deals with extracting patterns from large databases representing complex relationships among various entities After the Apriori algorithm was rst proposed many new algorithms and improvements were introduced For example researchers have tried to improve Apriori using various techniques including hashing technique partitioning technique sampling approach 11 dynamic itemset counting incremental mining 13 parallel and distributed mining 14 13 and so on 15 People ha v e also developed new algorithms for the FPM problem such as FP-growth which uses FP-tree to store the itemset association information and Eclat which uses an Equi valence CLASS Transformation method Moreover researchers have been studying various other types of FPM problem including multilevel and multidimensional association rules mining closed frequent pattern mining 19 colossal pattern mining sequential pattern mining 21 graphs trees and lattices mining Our work is mostly related to sequential mining where the frequent itemsets mining is extended with the consideration of ordered items Speci“cally sequential mining tries to nd the set of frequent subsequences in a given sequential dataset One of the rst solutions to this problem was AprioriAll which extends the similar techniques in Apriori to nd frequent patterns in transactions of the customers It generates candidate sequences by measuring the support of them in passing over the database Some of the well-known sequential mining algorithms are Apriori-based GSP Generalized Sequential Patterns P attern-gro wth based FreeSpan 23 and Pre“xSpan V ertical format-based SP ADE 25 and Constraint-based SPIRIT All o f the abo v e w orks mainly focus on the sub-sequence mining which is to nd the common part of all the sequences in a dataset In our problem we are looking for a general structure the super-sequence The most frequent super-sequence is the one with the largest total support of each consecutive length two sequence in it Although part of the most frequent super-sequence may be the most frequent sub-sequence this is not necessary The longest path problem is known to be NP-hard Accordingly authors have proposed various approximation algorithms or developed exact algorithms for speci“c classes of graphs Karger et al proposed an approximation method for the longest path in a graph using greedy algorithm Murat et al proposed probabilistic longest path problem And there are other solutions on speci“c type of graphs For example researchers proposed longest path problems on interval graphs on co-comparability graphs 30 on ptolemaic graphs and so on Most of these studies tries to nd the longest path starting from a source without any constraints In our case however we are interested in any k hop longest path whose weight is greater than a threshold III F ORMAL D EFINITION AND G RAPH M ODEL In this section we introduce the notation used in this paper and formally de“ne SS-FPM problem We assume that a sequential dataset denoted by S   S 1 S 2   S N  is given where S i   w 1 w 2   w l i  is a sequence of ordered elements or events e.g sequences of web pages in Table I Let W   w 1 w 2   w n  be the complete set of all elements or events i.e W   N i 1 S i  Let p   w 1 w 2   w k  be a super-sequence pattern with path length of  k  1  Note that p is not a set but an array which means we consider the order of the elements occurring in the pattern In contrast to sub-sequence patterns super-sequence patterns may contain different parts of multiple sequences in the sequential dataset For example the supersequence pattern ABCD identi“ed from the dataset in Table I contains parts from most of the sequences in the table Let support  w x w y  be the total number of occurrences of the sequence w x w y in S  Similarly we can de“ne the support 53 


for a pattern p as follows support  p  k  1  i 1 support  w i w i 1  We say p is k length frequent if support  p  is greater than a given threshold   We can now formally de“ne SS-FPM problem as follows De“nition 1 Given a sequential dataset S  a sequence length k  and a threshold   the Super-Sequence Frequent Pattern Mining SS-FPM problem is to nd the set P   p 1 p 2  p r   where each pattern p j   w 1 w 2   w k  satis“es the following condition support  p j  k  1  i 1 support  w i w i 1   SS-FPM problem is actually related to the longest path problem in a graph So we transform a given sequential dataset S into a sequence graph which can be de“ned as follows De“nition 2 A Sequence Graph is a directed weighted graph G  V E   where V   w 1 w 2  w n  and E   e 1 e 2   e m   Each edge e i connects w a and w b iff there is a consecutive sequence w a w b in any sequence in S  The weight of edge e i is set to support  w a w b   which is the total number of occurrences of consecutive sequence w a w b in all sequences in S  According to this de“nition we can easily construct the sequence graph for a given sequential dataset For example the sequence graph for the sequential dataset in Table I would be as shown in Fig 1 We use the adjacency matrix which 1                  A B C D E 1 1 3 3 2 Fig 1 The sequence graph for the sequential dataset in Table I we call the initial one-step sequence matrix to represent the sequence graph Since there are n elements in the set of all sequences the sequence matrix would be n  n  For example the sequence matrix for the above graph would be as in Fig 2 M 1        ABCDE A 03000 B 00102 C 00030 D 00000 E 01010       Fig 2 The sequence matrix for the sequence graph in Fig 1 The sequence matrix denoted by M 1 can directly be computed from the given sequential dataset S  For this we rst set M 1  w i  w j  to 0 for every w i w j  We then go through each sequence S i and add one to M 1  w x  w y  for each w x w y in S i  The reason for using the notation M 1 is to indicate that M 1  w i  w j  actually represents the support of 1-hop path 2length sequence from w i to w j  In the rest of the paper we will continue to generalize this notation as M k to store the supports of the k hop longest path   k 1 length most frequent super-sequence Note that M k  w i  w j  will show the support of the k hop longest path starting with w i w j  not the path from w i to w j  The actual k hop paths will be stored in a hash table as we discuss later in detail In this paper we are looking for simple paths e.g sequential patterns without duplications The dataset may have duplicates such as the rst entry in table I But when we search for a frequent super-sequences we do not consider loops since the path may not be able to get out of the loop So the frequent super-sequences got from the sequence graph is a directed acyclic graph\(DAG IV P ROPOSED S OLUTION FOR S UPER S EQUENCE F REQUENT P ATTERN M INING To determine the  k 1 length most frequent supersequence patterns we actually try to compute all the k hop longest paths whose total weights are greater than a given threshold For this we mainly use Dynamic Programming to gradually compute the matrix M k from M 1 and M k  1 Aswe discussed in last section M 1  i  j  is the support of the 1-hop longest path direct link from node i to node j  On the other hand for k 1  M k  i  j  is the support of the k hop longest path starting with sequence ij rather then being the weight of a path from i to j  Along with M k  we maintain a hash table H k that stores k hop longest paths   k 1 length frequent supersequences starting with ij  So the keys in H k are  ij  for all the non-zero elements in M k while the values are the k hop longest paths starting with the corresponding ij  Here there can be multiple paths starting with the sequence ij that have the same weights In this paper we only consider the situation that links on the sequence graph all have different numbers of weights since in large real world dataset e.g web log dataset the numbers of visitings are large and have a large probability that they are different More general cases can be extended easily based on our solution We will rst illustrate the details of the proposed calculation method through an example We then give its pseudo code and computational complexity Let us now consider the sequence graph in Fig 1 and illustrate the process of getting k hop longest paths  k 1  length frequent super-sequence patterns when k is 3 So we need to gradually calculate M 3 and H 3  First let us generate H 1  This can easily be done by using the non-zero elements from the original one-step sequence matrix M 1  Resulting keys and 1-hop paths in H 1 will be as shown below 54 


H 1  012              015 key  value  AB   AB   BC   BC   BE   BE   CD   CD   ED   ED                 We then compute M 2 by using M 1 twice as follows For each i and j  we rst search the largest value in row j of M 1 and identify its column index as maxC  We then simply compute M 2  i  j  by taking the summation of M 1  i  j  and M 1  j  maxC  If M 1  i  j  is 0 we keep it 0 in M 2  i  j   Also if the maximum in row j of M 1 is 0 we again set M 2  i  j  to 0 The reasons behind the these two checks can be explained as follows When M 1  i  j  is zero there is no visits on page j after page i  Thus there is no need to calculate the supersequence path starting with ij in the sequence Similarly when the largest value on row j is zero there is either no outlet in the  k  1 sequence matrix for page j or they could generate a circle if we keep adding pages in the path Thus we set the corresponding M k  i  j  to zero In summary if either one of these conditions is true then we cannot nd a k hop path starting with ij  thus we set M k  i  j  to 0 Accordingly the resulting M 2 will be as shown in Fig 3 M 2        ABCDE A 05000 B 00403 C 00000 D 00000 E 02000       Fig 3 The 2-sequence matrix from the sessions in Table I While computing M 2  we can generate the corresponding hash table H 2 and make sure that the paths in hash table will not have loops After computing M 2  i  j   we check if is is 0 or not If it is not 0 then we copy the value of the key  jmaxC  in H 1 to  ij  s value in H 1 after the rst element For example the new value in H 2 for key  AB  will be  ABE   This is obtained by copying  BE  to  AB  after A since M 1  B  E  has the largest value on row B  Accordingly the resulting H 2 will be as follows H 2  012          015 key  value AB   ABE   BC   BCD   BE   BED   EB   EBC             This shows that 3-length super-sequence patterns are ABC BCD BED and EBC with the supports of 5 4 3 and 2 respectively Note that we did not choose EBE as a 2-hop path since it has a loop We keep track of the paths and check if there is a loop when a path is extended with a the new node If so we ignore that node and consider the next node Finally let us compute M 3 by using M 1 and M 2 as follows For each i and j  we rst search the largest value in row j of M 2 and identify its column index as maxC  We then simply compute M 3  i  j  by taking the summation of M 1  i  j  and M 2  j  maxC   Accordingly the resulting M 3 will be as shown in Fig 4 M 3        ABCDE A 07000 B 00000 C 00000 D 00000 E 05000       Fig 4 The 3-sequence matrix from the sessions in Table I For H 3  since M 2  B  C  has the largest value on row B  we copy the value of  BC   BCD  to the value of  AB   ABE   starting from the second element Consequently we obtain  ABCD  and save it in H 3 with the key value of  AB   Using the same process we also obtain  EBCD   As a result H 3 will be as follows H 3  012  015 key  value AB   ABCD   EB   EBCD     In summary we computed ABE as the 2-hop longest path 3-length most frequent sequence by combining 1-hop longest paths AB and BE from M 1 in Fig 1 Since AB has the support of 3 and BE has the support of 2 the support of ABE will be 5 Continuing this way we determined ABCD as the 3-hop longest path 4-length most frequent super-sequence with the support of 7 We can now present the above steps in a pseudo code form as shown in Fig 5 As we mentioned at the beginning of this section our solution can nd the most frequent super-sequence with length k starting from ij only when the weight on each link is different from each other When there are the same weights links our solution will miss some super-sequences e.g if there are 2 most frequent super-sequences starting from ij  we will only get one of them This can also mislead the most frequent length k 1 super-sequence To get a better solution we need another hash table to store all the possible paths that can give a most frequent super-sequence and this would be a good extension for our future work Let us now consider the computational complexity of the heuristic algorithm in Fig 5 In essence it computes the n  n matrix M k by performing the above mentioned operations on two n  n matrices namely M 1 and M k  1  The actual paths are stored in a hash table H k by extending the paths in H k  1 while making sure that there will be no loops in them To compute each element M k  i  j   the heuristic algorithm nds the maximum in row j of M k  1  which costs O  n   and checks if the new path starting with ij would have a loop which costs O  k   If there is a loop the heuristic algorithm ignores that path and nds another maximum until it nds a path without 55 


Heuristic Algorithm Computing k hop Longest Path Input  M 1  M k  1  and H k  1 Output  M k and H k for 1  i  n do for 1  j  n do if M 1  i  j   0 then Find maxC such that M k  1  j  maxC   M k  1  j  l  for 1  l  n while there is a loop in the new path do M k  1  j  maxC 0  Find maxC such that M k  1  j  maxC   M k  1  j  l  for 1  l  n end while if M k  1  j  maxC   0 then M k  i  j  M 1  i  j  M k  1  j  maxC   update hash table H k else M k  i  j 0 end if end if end for end for Fig 5 The pseudo code of the heuristic algorithm proposed for SS-FPM a loop In the worst case the heuristic algorithm may end up checking all the elements in row j  which costs O  n   So for each element ij  the heuristic algorithm would perform O  n  n  k  operations resulting in overall complexity of O  n 4  kn 3   Since we are interested in simple paths k will be less than n and thus the worst-case complexity of the heuristic algorithm for a given k will be O  n 4   However since our overall solution gradually computes M k by calling the heuristic algorithm k times the overall worst-case complexity of our solution will be O  kn 4   However in practice since the sequence graphs are sparse and the matrix M k storing the weights of the longest k hop paths gets more and more zero elements as the k increases we would not need to nd maximum or search for loops in paths for every elements in the matrix This results in reasonable average case complexity as we demonstrate through experiments in the next section V E XPERIMENTS AND RESULTS In our experiments we have two parts In the rst part we analyze the actual running time of computing the matrix M k in search of the  k 1 longest super-sequence In the second part we use the actual web log dataset called BMS-WebView1 1 to nd some interesting facts by analyzing supper-sequence patterns in that dataset BMS-WebView-1 contains several months of clicking stream data from an E-commerce website As discussed in Section I the web log data is transformed into a set of sequences Each sequence is a session showing a 1 BMS-WebView-1 has been used as datasets in KDDCup 2000 competition and can be downloaded from The Data Mining Forum http://forum.aidirectory.com sequence of web pages visited by a user The details on web log pre-processing are out of the scope of this paper and the details can be found 33 34 In BMS-W ebV ie w-1 there are 59602 sessions and 497 web pages in it For simplicity we give each web page an ID starting from 0 to 496 A Running Time Analysis To analyze the running time under different number of nodes in the sequence graph we generated random dataset similar to web log dataset BMS-WebView-1 with ten thousand sessions and by changing the number of web pages from 50 to 200 The length of the super-sequences that are going to be searched ranges from 3 to 7 since the smallest pattern has two pages and the initial sequence matrix shows any length 2 supersequence weight The steps for generating the random dataset is as shown below  Randomly pick a number iter between 3-7  Repeat iter times to randomly pick a number between 0 to size  size is the session size which is set to 50 100 150 and 200 in different experiment groups This gives a sequence in the session  Repeat last step for 10,000 times and we get a ten thousand session dataset with size web pages All of the experiments are run on 2.26 GHz Intel Core processor with 4GB memory Fig 6 shows the actual running Fig 6 Running time for searching longest super-sequence on randomly generated web log data From Fig 6 we can see that the actual running time grows more like a quadratic function of the number of nodes rather than quartic function as in the worst-case complexity This is a good indication that the proposed heuristic algorithm would be practical for modest size datsets However we still need to improve its performance for very large datasets as we plan to do in our future work B Super-sequence pattern analysis Before analyzing the super-sequence patterns in the actual web log dataset we would like to show that our heuristic algorithm gives almost the same longest path that a bruteforce algorithm can nd Due to the exponential complexity of a brute-force algorithm we try a small number of nodes web pages and randomly generated 10000 sessions Each session 56 


can have less than 10 pages By using brute force means that if we are looking for length k super-sequence in the dataset we to generate all the permutations of a k pages out of the 10 pages that is also why we only have 10 pages since large number of pages can be time consuming to do permutations In Fig 7 we compare the average weight of the longest superFig 7 The total weight of the super-sequence found using brute force and our algorithm sequences that we found using our algorithm to the ones found using brute force method We did ve groups of experiments with super-sequence lengths from 3 to 7 We use letter A and B to for our Algorithm and Brute force respectively We can see that our algorithm give almost the correct longest supersequences with minor offset We will now use our heuristic algorithm on the actual web log dataset to nd some interesting facts In Fig 8 we show the number of sequences paths that we found with visiting numbers total weight from 2000 to 5000 and the sequence length  k  varies from 5 to 10 Similarly Fig 9 shows the number of sequences that have visiting numbers from 5000 to 8000 and the sequence length goes from 12 to 20 Both Fig 8 Number of paths found for different lengths\(5-10 with different visiting numbers gures con“rms that as expected our algorithm nds more paths under the same visiting numbers as the sequence length increases This is due to the fact that the total weight of a path increases as the sequence length increases Also from Fig 9 Number of paths found for different lengths\(12-20 with different visiting numbers comparing the two gures we can see that there are a lot of paths e.g close to 30000 when path length is relatively long and visiting threshold is relatively small Instead of such commonly appearing many paths it would be useful to focus on the small number of paths having a relatively large weight number of visiting For example in this data set one should closely analyze the 6-length paths with visiting numbers larger than 2200 or the 10-length paths with visiting numbers larger than 4000 For example let us consider such distinguished paths to investigate if there is any weakest link which has signi“cantly small number of visitings compared to other links in a frequent super-sequence pattern If there are any such links web designers can delete or regroup them To identify such links we calculated the deviations of the distinguished paths with length 3 4 and 5 From Table II III and IV we can see that the number of paths signi“cantly decreases as the visiting threshold increases Accordingly we pick the visiting numbers of 1000 1500 and 2000 to get 30 21 and 26 distinguished paths respectively TABLE II T HE NUMBER OF PATHS WITH LENGTH 3  number of total visitings number of paths found  900 394  1000 30  1100 10  1200 7  1300 2  1400 0 Fig 10 shows the ordered standard deviation for the 30 paths found in Table II We can see that there are 4 paths with deviation less than 200 and 7 paths with standard deviation larger than 600 The rest of the paths have standard deviation between 200 and 600 After checking the path that has the smallest standard deviation we found that the path has the web page sequence  164  0  1   The visitings for page 0 after visiting page 164 is 590 and then visitings to page 1 is 621 The largest deviation exists in path  265  281  277   where 57

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of features”by PCA”, number of records” by FP-Growth By experiments, found “the values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growth”, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
