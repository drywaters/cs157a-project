Abstract 
In this paper we focus on the problem of result integrity veri田ation for outsourcing of frequent itemset mining 
We design ef田ient cryptographic approaches that verify whether the returned frequent itemset mining results are correct and complete with deterministic guarantee The key of our solution is that the service provider constructs cryptographic proofs of the mining results Both correctness and completeness of the mining results are measured against the proofs We optimize the veri田ation by minimizing the number of proofs Our empirical study demonstrates the ef田iency and effectiveness of the veri田ation approaches

I I NTRODUCTION The increasing ability to generate vast quantities of data presents technical challenges for ef田ient data mining Out 
sourcing data mining computations to a third-party service provider server offers a cost-effective option especially for data owners clients of limited resources This introduces the data-mining-as-a-service  
 paradigm Cloud computing provides a natural solution for the paradigm Although the paradigm is advantageous to achieve sophisticated analysis on large volumes of data in a cost effective way it raises a few security issues One of the main security concerns is that the server may return incorrect data mining results due to many possible reasons e.g software bugs and malicious insiders 7 After all a serv er has the

nancial incentive to improve its revenue by returning cheaper and thus incorrect result while charging for more 16 Given the fact that many data mining applications e.g fraud detection and business intelligence are so critical it is important to provide ef田ient and practical methods to enable computationally-weak clients to verify the of data mining computations that are outsourced to a potentially untrusted service provider In this paper we focus on frequent itemset mining a popular and important data mining problem Our goal is to verify whether the server returned correct and complete set of frequent itemsets By we 
mean that all itemsets returned by the server are frequent By

Prior Work 
 we mean that no frequent itemset is missing in the returned result  de渡ed the notation of VC that allows a computationally limited client to be able to verify the correctness of the result of expensive computations outsourced to a computationally powerful server Existing VC protocols can verify high degree polynomial functions  boolean functions 16 and set operations 15 These VC protocols assume the same computation is executed on many different inputs so that the cost of the expensive onetime setup phase can be amortized over all instances This 
is not ideal for the 
paradigm Some protocols e.g  consider functions that are encoded as a Boolean circuit and use fully homomorphic encryption which only can handle simple operations such as addition multiplications and XOR operations The existing work on result veri田ation of SQL query evaluation over the outsourced databases e.g  17 cannot be applied to the paradigm due to the fundamental difference between SQL query evaluation and data mining applications 5 proposed ef cient integrity veri田ation approaches for outsourced frequent itemset mining However both of them only can provide probabilistic

Contributions 
In this paper we aim at designing veri田ation techniques that can provide guarantee for both correctness and completeness of outsourced frequent itemset mining The key idea of our solution is to require the server to construct of its mining results Both correctness and completeness of the mining results are measured against the proofs with 100 certainty Our contributions include the following 1 we adapt the veri田ation protocol of primitive set intersection operation to our problem and show how to construct cryptographic proofs that can verify the exact support of itemsets 2 we optimize the 
veri田ation algorithm by reducing the number of proofs for both correctness and completeness veri田ation and show that a small number of proofs is suf田ient to verify the correctness and completeness of a large set of frequent itemsets 3 we extend our veri田ation approaches for the outsourced frequent itemset mining to maximal frequent itemset mining and 4 we complement our analytical results with extensive experiments evaluating the performance of our veri田ation algorithm Our experimental results show that our veri田ation approach can achieve both correctness and completeness deterministic guarantees with a small number of short proofs that can be constructed fast

After the server receives and from the client the server runs frequent itemset mining on and discovers a set of frequent itemsets Before the server sends its result to the client it constructs for result integrity veri田ation In particular for each itemset and each itemset  the server constructs a proof that can be used to verify the exact support of The proof of the itemset   resp is used for the correctness completeness resp veri田ation For each itemset  let be its proof the client launches the following steps for veri田ation 1 it runs the set intersection veri田ation protocol on to verify is contained in a set of transactions  2 it computes the support of as  Then the correctness is to verify whether the support of any is no less than  while the completeness veri田ation is to verify whether the support of any itemset is less than  The complexity of the basic veri田ation approach can be prohibitively expensive due to the fact that the total number of correctness and completeness proofs is the same as the size of the search space of frequent itemsets This will introduce considerable amounts of overhead at both the client and the server sides V V ERIFICATION O PTIMIZATION In this section we discuss how to reduce the number of proofs for veri田ation The optimization is based on the concept of   and   In particular given a set of frequent itemsets by the server is a subset of such that for each itemset  there does not exist any itemset such that  while is a set of itemsets that do not appear in such that for each itemset  there does not exist any itemset such that  To prepare for correctness completeness resp veri田ation the server constructs a cryptographic proof for each   resp itemset The itemsets should include all infrequent 1-itemsets To further reduce the number of proofs the server only needs to construct the proofs of those itemsets that are of length greater than one and only contain frequent 1-itemsets After the proof construction is nished the server sends the proofs together with to the client The client uses the server尽 proofs to verify that each itemset is frequent by running the set intersection veri田ation protocol Though simple only sending proofs of itemsets to the client raises two new issues The rst issue is to verify that the server has computed the proof of all itemsets of  To do this for each itemset  the client veri兎s whether there exists a itemset satis兎s that  If it does not the client concludes that the server misses the proof of at least one itemset Another issue is that the client needs to ensure that all itemsets are honestly constructed from  not from the correct mining results of  This can be achieved by verifying 1 for each itemset  whether there exists an itemset such that  and 2 for each itemset  whether there exists a itemset satis兎s that  First the client veri兎s the correctness and completeness of returned itemsets by constructing from  assuming she has veri兎d that is correct and complete Next the client uses the proof of itemsets to prove the completeness of returned frequent itemsets Based on their relationships with the returned frequent itemsets  we categorize the missing frequent itemsets into four types In particular given a frequent itemset that is not returned by the server it belongs to one of the following four types 1 for each itemset  2 there exists a frequent itemset such that 3 there exists a frequent itemset such that  and 4 there is no frequent itemset such that or  However there exists a frequent itemset such that Next,we describe how to verify these four types of missing frequent itemsets respectively It is easy to infer that any type-1 missing itemset must only contain frequent 1itemsets that do not appear in  Therefore the client simply checks whether there is any frequent 1-itemsets of that is not included in  If there is the client concludes that there must exist at least one type-1 missing frequent itemset The complexity of veri田ation is  Proof-based veri田ation is not needed The frequent 1-itemsets are collected when the client constructs the inverted index The client veri兎s whether for each itemset all subsets of its corresponding itemset are included in  In this case as long as is frequent veri兎d by correctness veri田ation this veri田ation procedure does not need to use any proof We show that if there is any type-3/4 frequent itemset missing the itemsets of include at least one frequent itemset Therefore the client veri兎s whether there exists any type-3/4 missing frequent itemsets by verifying the infrequentness of each itemset via its proof If there exists any itemset whose proof cannot show that it is infrequent there exists at least one type-3/4 missing itemset The complexity of veri田ation is  where  We can prove that the optimized veri田ation approach provides the same security guarantee as our basic approach The details of proof are omitted due to limited space The total complexity of proof construction is  where  is the number of unique items of  and

As will become clear later both of these enhancements allow load on a link to be expressed as a continuous function which in turn simpli兎s our worst-case analysis Neither enhancement alters the worst-case input signi田antly First during an epoch at most one item occurrence per input stream can have non-integral weight Second any input with real-valued item frequencies can be transformed into an input with nearly integral frequencies that yields identical results by multiplying each frequency by a large number and dividing all answers produced by the same number For notational ease we transform the problem of setting  2  l  1 to that of setting  2   l  1  where for all 2  i  l  2   i   i   i 1 and  l  1   l  1  It is required that  i  0 for all 2  i  l  1  and that  l  1 i 2  i   1   i denotes the precision margin at level i  i.e the difference between the error tolerances at level i and level i 1  Let the vector     2   3   l  1  Let I denote the contents of all input streams S 1 S m during a single epoch Let I denote the set of all possible instances of I  Given an input I  a communication hierarchy T de渡ed by degree d and number of levels l  and a setting of the precision gradient   let w represent the maximum load on any link in the communication hierarchy w  I T    max k  links     load  k   Worst-case load W is de渡ed as W  T    max I I  w  I T    Given a communication hierarchy T  the objective is to set  such that the worst-case load W  T   is minimized We rst show that it is suf田ient to consider a speci田 subset of all instances of the general problem for worstcase analysis Then we nd precision gradient values  values that cause the worst-case load under any of these instances to be minimal There exists a subset I wc of the set of all input instances I such that for all instances I I蟹 wc  there exists an instance I  I wc such that for any T    w  I   T    w  I T    Hence I wc denotes the set of worst-case inputs  Instance I is a member of I wc if and only if it satis兎s each of the following three properties P1 For any two input streams S i and S j  there is no item occurrence common to both S i and S j  P2  For any input stream S i  all items occurring in S i occur with equal frequency P3  For any two input streams S i and S j  both the number of item occurrences and the number of distinct items in S i and S j are equal Lemma 4 For xed T and   given any input instance I  it is possible to nd an input instance I  I wc such that w  I   T    w  I T    Proof Our proof of Lemma 4 is rather involved and is provided in  From Lemma 4 we know it is suf田ient to consider the set I wc for worst-case communication load Hence we can rewrite our expression for W  T   as W  T    max I I wc  w  I T    Property P3 of I wc implies that the total number of item occurrences at any leaf node is the same Let n denote this number   S i   n for all 1  i  m  Let tc  j  denote the total number of item occurrences arriving on streams monitored by at the leaf nodes of a subtree rooted at a node at level j  It is easy to see that tc  j  d  l  1  j   n  where l is the number of levels in the communication hierarchy and d is the fanout of all non-leaf nodes The next lemma shows that worst-case inputs induce a high degree of symmetry on the resulting synopses Lemma 5 For any input instance I I wc  the following two properties hold for the d j   j  1 synopses relayed by the d j levelj nodes to their parents 1 No item is present in more than one synopsis 2 The estimated frequency counts corresponding to any two items even if present in two different synopses have the same value Proof See  Due to the high degree of symmetry formalized in Lemma 5 the count for each item is eliminated due to being decremented and falling below zero at the same level of the communication hierarchy Let us call this level x  If all counts are dropped at the leaf level then x  l  1  If all counts are retained through the entire process and are sent to the root node R level 0  then x 0  Otherwise all counts are dropped at some intermediate level 1  x  l  2  The most heavily loaded link\(s are the ones leading to level x  To see why consider that no data is transmitted on subsequent links and previous links have lower load since data is spread more thinly in any communication hierarchy T  the number of links between levels decreases monotonically as data moves from leaves to the root When synopses are combined at nodes of level i using Algorithm 1 the frequency count estimate of each item is decremented by the quantity tc  i    i let Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 ｩ 2005 IEEE 


 1   1   l  1 i 2  i  Hence the true frequency count of any item occurring on some input stream must be C  l  1 j  x 1  tc  j    j    where  is a small quantity 3  The number of items present in each input stream is thus n  C 4  Since synopses for d l  1  x input streams are transmitted through a node at level x  the load on the most heavily loaded link\(s is L  x  d l  2  x  n C  Clearly the maximum value of L  x  is achieved when   0  The expression for L  x  can be simpli兎d to L  x  1  l  1 j  x 1  j  d x  j 1  Now our expression for the worst-case load on any link can be reduced to W  T    max x 0  1 l  2  L  x   We desire to minimize W  T   subject to the constraints  2   l  1  0 and  l  1 j 2  j   1 It is easy to show that this minimum is achieved when L 0  L 1    L  l  2  Solving for  2   l  1  we obtain  i   1  d  1  l  2   d  1 d  2  i  l  2 and  l  1   1  d  l  2   d  1 d  Translating to error tolerances we set  i   1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d for all 2  i  l  1  This setting of  2  l  1 minimizes worst-case communication load on any link We term this strategy MinMaxLoad WC Under this strategy the maximum possible load on any link is L wc   l  2   d  1 d d   1 counts per epoch Lastly we note that MinMaxLoad WC remains the optimal precision gradient even if nodes of the same level can have different  values Informally since with worst-case inputs all incoming streams have identical characteristics maximum link load cannot be improved by using non-uniform  values for nodes at a given level we omit a formal proof for brevity 2.1.4 Good Precision Gradients for Non-Worst-Case Inputs Real data is unlikely to exhibit worst-case characteristics Consequently strategies that are optimal in the worst case may not always perform well in practice In terms of minimizing the maximum communication load on any link the worst-case inputs are ones in which the set of items occurring on each input stream are disjoint When this situation arises a gradual precision gradient is best to use as shown in Section 2.1.3 Using a gradual precision gradient some of the pruning of frequency 3 Recall that we allow the frequency of an item to be a real number 4 More precisely each stream contains  n C  items of weight 1 each and one item of weight  n C  n C   Note that each input stream contains at most one item with weight less than 1 as stipulated earlier counts is delayed until a better estimate of the overall distribution is available closer to the root thereby enabling more effective pruning In the opposite extreme when all input streams contain identical distributions of item occurrences there is no bene鍍 to delaying pruning and performing maximal pruning at the leaf nodes as in strategy SS2 is most effective at minimizing communication In fact it is easy to show that SS2 is the optimal strategy for minimizing the maximum load on any link when all input streams are comprised of identical distributions we omit a formal proof Note however that SS2 still incurs a high space requirement on the root node R since it sets  1    We posit that most real-world data falls somewhere between these two extremes To determine where exactly a data set lies with regard to the two extremes we estimate the commonality between input streams S 1 S m by inspecting an epoch worth of data from each stream We compute a commonality parameter   0  1 as   1 m   m i 1 G i L i  where G i and L i are de渡ed over stream S i as follows The quantity G i is de渡ed as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i and also at least   S  times in S  S 1  S 2  S m  where  S  denotes the number of item occurrences in S during the epoch of measurement The quantity L i is de渡ed as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i  Hence commonality parameter  measures the fraction of items frequent enough in one input stream to be included in a leaf-level synopsis by strategy SS 2 that are also at least as frequent globally in the union of all input streams A natural hybrid strategy is to use a linear combination of MinMaxLoad WC and SS2 weighted by   The strategy is as follows set  i 1       1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d        for 2  i   l  2  and  l  1 1       1  d  l  2   d  1 d         We term this hybrid strategy MinMaxLoad NWC for non-worstcase Commonality parameter  1 implies that locally frequent items are also globally frequent and SS2 modi兎d to use  1   is a good choice Conversely  0 indicates that MinMaxLoad WC is a good choice For 0  1  a weighted mixture of the two strategies is best 2.1.5 Summary The precision gradient strategies we have introduced are summarized in Table 3 Sample precision gradients are illustrated in Figure 3 3 Experimental

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a con堵urable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to con堵ure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and what尽 not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries ef田iently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/藁anjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00 ｩ 2005 IEEE
