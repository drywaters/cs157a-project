1  Abstract Data mining place viral aspect in many of the applications like market ñbasket analysis, fraud detection etc In data mining association rule mining and frequent pattern mining, both are key feature of market-basket analysis. In a given large amount of transnational database where each record consists of items purchased by customer at store. One of the basic market basket analysis algorithm is an Apriori, which generate all candidates item-set frequent pattern. In this research paper we describe the improved candidate 1-itemsets generation and candidate 2-itemsets generation from traditional technique. This algorithm utilizes the dynamic programming approach to facilitate fast candidate itemset generation and searching. We have compared results with previous approach that optimize the database scans and eliminate duplicate candidate itemset generation. This technique helps research scholar Index Terms Association Rule Mining, Data Mining, Data Structure, Dynamic Programming, Frequent itemsets I  I NTRODUCTION ATA mining is defines like extraction of knowledge from very large database size. Data mining also called as Knowledge Discovery in Databases \(KDD\ [1  N o w  a d a y  many of the organization collect sales data. This data is saving in form of transaction, so each transaction represent purchase items from the store. In such database each record represent transaction and attribute represent item purchase by customers Take an example of super market. In that, each transaction is collected and after getting large amount of data. They apply market basket analysis and find out the pattern. The discovered patterns are set of items that are most frequent in database.  Like ì60 percent of people who buy bread also buy the butterî. Decision making person use this detail for identify the customer buying habits Assoc iation rule mining is help in finding relationship among the set of items in all transactions Apriori algorithm used for discovering association rules between items in market-basket data [2   Assoc iation rule mining require two predefined values, those values are minimum confidence and minimum support. This mining process is divide into two sub process. First one for finding those items which occurrences in database ex ceed the minimum threshold or minimum support count. This is call frequent items set or  large items set. And second one for generating of rules from frequent items set with condition is that it satisfies the minimum confidence Dynamic programing is one of the techniques to design an efficient algorithm [3  Th is te c h n i q u e s t o r e th e p r e v io u s  solutions, so whenever it reappear, it can be directly access from those pre calculated values without creating more overhead. Many problems solve in optimal way by dynamic programing approach. i.e., Matrix Chain Multiplications Longest Common Sequence and Binary Search trees Important feature is that memorization. The word memorization, itís not spelled, comes from memo means recording of solutions 1  Apriori Algorithm Let D be the market-basket database, where each row contains T Transactions. Transactions tagged with unique identifier T id Now let I be the item set {I 1 I 2 I 3 I n If an item set contain k-item then it called K-itemset, and if all subset of K-itemset satisfies the minimum support count then itís called L k frequent itemset or large itemset. This algorithm need to perform two basic steps are \(a\ Join, selfjoin with previous frequent L k-1 itemset and create new candidate C k+1 itemset. \(b\ Prune, filter from the current candidate itemset whose subset is not frequent in previous step. Below step explain the working of Apriori algorithm  1  Assume that minimum support count and minimum confidence are given as min-sup and min-conf respectively 2  Scan the entire database and find out candidate 1itemset C 1 along with occurrence count. That is number of times each item appeared in database 3  From C 1 eliminate those items which count is not satisfying min_sup threshold. Remaining 1-items in C 1 which called L 1  4  L 1  L 1 and create new C 2 again scan the database and calculate number of times candidate 2-itemset appeared in database 5  Apply the pruning in C 2 and we get the L 2  6  As this way iteratively step 2 to 5 is carried out until the C K is null An Efficient way to Find Frequent Pattern with Dynamic Programming Approach Dharmesh Bhalodiya K.

II  PREVIOUS WORK  Numerous algorithms have been discussed for association rule mining [2   4   5   6   7   8  an d 9   Th e as s o c iatio n  rule generation was first introduced in [2 th at w a s c alle d  AIS. AIS generate all possible candidate itemsets and association rule, at each database scan candidate itemset find out. From the previous scan, calculated large itemset was further extended in next scan. The traditional AIS technique was improved in [4  th is te c h n i q u e g e n e r ate s c a n d id ate  itemsets in separate step. It uses only the large itemset to proceed further, by self-join. Calcu lated itemset is join with itself and forwarded to next step, this step eliminate those itemset whose subset is not the part of previous frequent candidate itemset The Dynamic Itemset Counting algorithm [5 d y n amic ally  generate candidate itemset as the algorithm proceed, it count varying length of itemsets. As this way it requires less number of the database scans compare to Apriori The Hash Base 8 u s e s s p e c ial d ata s t r u c t u r e an d  minimizes number of candidate itemset by collection of approximate count in previous result. The partitioning algorith r e q u i r e o n ly tw o d atab as e s c an th e te c h n i q u e  behind that was partition the whole database into chunks having same size, so that chunks can easily reside in memory. First pass scan calculate the local large candidate itemset from local chunk. And, in Second pass it calculates globally large itemset. It may possible that locally generated candidate itemset are not potentially large itemset. And also one more scan will be require if locally generated itemset was not fit into the memory III  P ROPOSED A LGORITHM  We have utilized the Dynamic Programming approach and special data structure to improve the performance of frequent candidate 1-itemset and 2-itemset in traditional Apriori As par the working principle of Dynamic Programming, Optimal solution in such way that it eliminate the redundancy work, and save the previous records in proper and efficient storage space. In traditional Apriori  algorithm, we have applied Dynamic Programming approach to find frequent or large candidate 1-itemset and candidate 2-itemset. This approach require only database scan for both frequent candidate 1-itemset and 2-itemset. This is the key feature to improve the performance. In contrast Apriori need separate scan for each frequent itemsets. Next section shows the results and claimed that to generation of large candidate 2-itemset in this technique is more efficient For example suppose we have transactional database that contains certain transactions carried out in super market store. Where each transaction assign with some unique identifier T id Items parches by the customers are store in transaction. Fig 1 demonstrates the transactional database Consider the item set I = {I 1 I 2 I 3 I 4 I 5 Fig 1 shows the market-basket transactional database with six transaction T and five unique item I 1  Algorithm Input   Number of transactions T n and Number of unique items I n in database D  Minimum support count \(min_sup Outpu t  Frequent candidate 1-itemset and 2-itemset   Fig. 1 Transactional database  Procedure  OccurrenceCount Item_array  w ill h o ld lis t o f ite m ap p e ar e d in c u r r e n t  transaction.

And second one FrequentCount check weather that count is frequent or not. And finally gives frequent 2-itemset. Layout of Count_Table in shown in Fig 2. That represent two dimensional array is rotated 45 degree to right side. In Count_Table i  j varies from 1 to total number of items present in database \(I n  First transaction contain three pair of two item, those pair are {I 1 I 2 I 1 I 5 and {I 2 I 5 Each item set contains two values for example {I 1 I 5 where first value represent i  index and second value represent j index in table. In Fig 2 at the apex of the triangle, Count_Table  o l d t h e  v a l u e  2î, which indicates the occurrence of itemset {I 1 I 5 in all transactions. Last row in table represent the occurrence counts of candidate 1-itemset in transactions, where both 


3 index i=j e same in table First transaction contain three items, those three items are directly represent as 2-itemset like {{I 1 I 2 I 1 I 5 I 2  I 5 Each item set contains two values for example {I 1 I 5  where first value represent i th index and second value represent j th index in Count_Table    Fig 2: Count_Table layout  Count_Table is filled in procedure OccurrenceCount  through  Step no.1 to 4. This function scans the database and enlists the items at step no. 2. Step no 4 occurrence count of two items at calculated from the item_array. That count is incremented by 1 in Count_Table at appropriate positions Once OccurrenceCount is executed we get the 2-itemset count FrequentCount prune infrequent itemset. Step no. 5 check weather 1-itemset is frequent or not. If it is then proceed for 2-itemset. If not then directly proceed for next itemset. As par given rule, if any subset of candidate kitemset is not frequent then it is not frequent [4   candidate_vector is a one dimensional array, holds the frequent candidate 2-itemset in step no. 8    Fig.3 \(a\ candidate 1-itemset \(b\ frequent candidate 1-itemset  In Apriori candidate 1-itemset count is given in Fig 3a. If given minimum support count \(min_sup\s 2 then item I3 is directly removed. The reaming, frequent candidate 1-itemset is listed in Fig 3b with their occurrence count. Now this itemset is used in generation of candidate 2-itemset Possible 2-itemset candidate are listed in given Fig 4a as per the Apriori algorithm. Candidate 2-itemset {I 3 I 4 and I 3 I 5 are directly remove before searching of frequent candidate. Because subset I 3 is not frequent. As per given min_sup this technique filter the infrequent candidate 2itemset, are given in Fig 4b Traditional Apriori need K database scan S, where K is itemset length and S denote as scan. In our case it 2 scan for each itemset count. In candidate generation by self-joining L k-1 itemset, so it take n 2 steps, where n is number of item. Candidate pruning step eliminate the infrequent itemset, its take C k T n where T n is total number of transaction in database    Fig.4 \(a\ candidate 2-itemset \(b\ frequent candidate 2-itemset  The traditional Apriori algorithm performs two important functions \(a\oin and \(b\une. Join function generate, from previously known frequent itemset, by self-joining candidate This function creates some computational overhead. Their approach to find frequent candidate set in top down manner i.e., first generates all possible candidate rather then worry about it will be frequent or not. And search for that generated candidate itemset count is satisfying support count or not. The proposed approach overcomes with these computational overhead. This approach works in bottom up manner, i.e., first calculate the occurrence count from the database. Then it checks weather itemset is frequent or not This technique gives frequent 2-itemset without generating candidate. In other word no need to perform n 2 teps And also with reduction of one database scan S. Effectively utilization of right data structure improve the overall performance Count_Table is highly optimized and efficient such that we can easily traverse through entire table and also it is reusable. One can re-generate frequent candidate at support count without scanning database again IV   E XPERIMENTS A ND R ESULTS  We have used IntelÆ Core ô 2 Duo, 2GB memory with 2.19 GHz system for experimental work. Our database contains 1500 different transactions and 250 items Experiment work of traditional Apriori and proposed Apriory, we refers as AprioriDP, focus on frequent candidate 1-itemset and 2-itemset. Only this part of algorithm covered in our analysis Fig 5 represent bar chart of time requirement of individual algorithms. X-axis draw horizontally with the interval of 50 items. And Y-axis draw vertically with time. In following discussion we refer traditional algorithm as Apriory and proposed algorithm as AprioriDP \(Apriori with Dynamic Programing\ First we take constant Minimum support count 


min_sup\with different items. In second constant item size with different min_sup. All results are ten times performed in our laboratory then taking mean values of that and shown in below figures   Fig 5 Apriori and AprioriDP Execution time with 2% min_sup   Take first bar from the Fig 5, 25 different items in 1500 transaction, shows two values 0.122s and 0.026s require in Apriori and AprioriDP respectively. These two values doesnít make much difference, but when we look ahead in graph. i.e., at items size 50 and 75, we get 0.393s and 0.758s require in Apriori where in AprioriDP requires only 0.030s and 0.037s respectively. And the last bar where in traditional approach requires 7.668s but in proposed algorithm it take only 0.074s. If we add more number of item then also we get large different. At starting point both executed in near about time. But when we re ach at 250 ite ms, it shows AprioriDP is 100 time faster th an Apriori   Fig 6 Apriori and AprioriDP Execution time with 250 items  Now we analyze with different support count varies from 0.25 to 1 %. These small values give maximum candidate itemsets. Fig 6 shows that when we decrease the support count Apriori is also slightly decrease. In contrast AprioriDP behave similarly. There is also small differences we getting in AprioriDP. But those are in milliseconds. From 0.50% to 0.75% support count Apriori decrease to 1.6 seconds. In other word we get difference of 1.6 seconds. And in AprioriDP that difference come to 0.008 second. As same way we take difference from 0.75% to 1% support count, that is 1.5s and 0.001s in Apriori and ArioriDP respectively Improvement in AprioriDP comes from two major factors First one is reduce one database scan S, and another is eliminating complete n 2 steps for candidate generation Above experimen tal work focus only time complicity but at the efficiency point of view it may require space complicity also. So memory consumption by these two algorithms is given by heap value. In our experiment, we commit that memory required by Apriori 6.207 MB and propose approach is 2.801MB. These heap counts is calculated by profiling in Netbeans tool Proposed AprioriDP is motivated from Dynamic Programming approach and by reduction of one database scan. We directly map 2-itemset in Count_Table. In this approach it clearly examine that it has advantage over Apriori. This experimental results for calculating large candidate 2-itemset but if one may interests in only in 1itemset then it again boost improvement in performance V  C ONCLUSIONS  We have proposed changes in Apriori algorithm with use of efficient data structure & dynamic programming methodology. The effective improvement in proposed change by reducing one database scan and to utilize memory space to store candidate 1-itemset and 2-itemset occurrence count in special dataset which can be used in further process to save time. Proposed algorithm with dynamic programming AprioriDP require least time to compute. We presented comparative analysis of traditional approach Apriori nd dynamic approach with reference to CPU overhead with time requirement to complete the task, finally observed the proposed algorithm required very less time than Apriori  algorithm VI  F UTURE W ORK  Still we focus on calculating large candidate 1-itemset and 2-itemset. We can discover more frequent candidate itemset like 3-itemset, 4-itemset, up to K-itemset with Dynamic Programming approach. Mapping of more than 2-itemset candidate may be possible with transaction ID. This possibility helps us to find out reaming frequent itemset VII  A CKNOWLEDGEMENT  We are very thankful to Amit M.

latency encountered could be reduced by a signi\002cant margin It also demonstrates an increase in the cache-hit percentage which indicates that data items are being acquired before they are requested In addition the pre-fetchers accuracy is increased according to the client access frequency since with the increase in the number of requests the patterns could be observed more clearly V C ONCLUSIONS AND F URTHER W ORK This paper presents a model that extrapolates the users data access requests by using a semantic linking over the data source to provide them with a better performance system regardless of network variations code details and data access patterns The proposed model is also bandwidth-adaptive in the sense that it adapts to varying bandwidths and varies its caching capacity correspondingly It is found to be successful in prefetching the data search items from the data cloud with good accuracy and relatively little overhead Moreover this model can also be used over a data source that contains dynamically changing data items by using the concept of merely comparing the update time of the content with that of the one in the cache Currently we are investigating the use of various types of server-side statistics to promote or demote semantic links that will adapt to the overall access behavior of the web-application clients In addition we are considering possible adjustments that are to be made to the current algorithm when the data source contents are rapidly changing We aim to 002nd the costs that are to be incurred in such situations and then try to reduce them by using a hybrid version of this technique R EFERENCES  ABI Research 223W idgets and the apps dilemma for smartphones netbooks media tablets and connected mobile devices,\224 2010  A v ailable http://www abiresearch.com/research/1003385  IBM de v eloperW orks 223IB M surv e y IT professionals predict mobile and cloud technologies will dominate enterprise computing by 2015,\224 Oct 2010 A v ailable http://www03.ibm.com/press/us/en pressrelease/32674.wss  H Zhuge R Jia and J Liu 223Semantic link netw ork b uilder and intelligent browser  Research articles,\224 Concurrency and Computation Practice and Experience  vol 16 pp 1453\2261476 2004 doi:10.1002/cpe.v16:14  Coda Research 223W i-\002 enabled mobile phone handsets in the US 2010-2015,\224 2010 A v ailable http://www codaresearch.co.uk wi\002cellular/abstract.pdf  ComScore Research 223Understand mobile trends and consumer behavior,\224 2010 A v ailable http://www comscore.com Products Services/Product Index/MobiLens  A Besta vros 223Using speculation to reduce serv er load and ser vice time on the WWW,\224 in Proc of ICIKM  1995 pp 403\226410 doi:10.1145/221270.221653  D Albrecht I Zuk erman and A Nicholson 223Pre-sending documents on the WWW A comparative study,\224 in Proc of IJCAI  vol 2 1999 pp 1274\2261279  M Deshpande and G Karypis 223Selecti v e Mark o v models for predicting web page accesses,\224 ACM Trans Internet Technol  vol 4 no 2 pp 163\226184 May 2004 doi:10.1145/990301.990304  E P  Markatos and C E Chronaki 223 A top-10 approach to prefetching the web,\224 in Proc of INET  1998  J Hine C W ills A Martel and J Sommers 223Combining client knowledge and resource dependencies for improved world wide web performance,\224 in Proc of INET  1998  C W u and M Bauer  223I mpro ving web serv er performance with predictive caching,\224 in Proc of ICOMP  Las Vegas NV 2004 pp 145\226149  S Gupta A Joshi J Santiago and A P atw ardhan 223Query distrib ution estimation and predictive caching in mobile ad hoc networks,\224 in Proc of MobiDE  2008 pp 24\22630 doi:10.1145/1626536.1626542  L Y in and G Cao 223Supporting cooperati v e caching in ad hoc netw orks 224 IEEE Trans Mobile Comput  vol 5 no 1 pp 77\22689 Jan 2006 doi:10.1109/TMC.2006.15  Amazon.com Inc 223Documentation of the elastic load balancing over Amazon EC2,\224 2009 A v ailable http://a ws.amazon.com elasticloadbalancing

 X  C ONCLUSION   This paper suggests solution of the three still open problems First, how you can find the actual value of the missing values? By develop of Random forest data mining algorithm Second, solve the problem of taken intelligent analysis of small size of dataset \(i.e, insuffizent size of dataset\y propose new method for generation data called GPDCM Third, how you can get accurate and comprehensible rule base? These done by three stages: first stage, using PCA to reduction dimensional of database. Second stage, FP-Growth data mining algorithm using to generating association rules from the components of PCA of database. Third stage classification that association rules by TreeNet algorithm As result, proposed methodology provides fast, Accurate and comprehensible classification rules. Also, it can use to compression dataset in two dimensions \(number of featuresîby PCAî, number of recordsî by FP-Growth By experiments, found ìthe values of correlation matrix among the predicators \(components of PCA\ are 95 equivalent the rules result from FP-growthî, therefore, we can use correlation matrix as alternative tool in generation association rules R EFERENCES     Breiman, Leo., "Random Forests".
