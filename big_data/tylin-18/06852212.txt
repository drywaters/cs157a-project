 
Sequential pattern mining \(SPM\, which usually reveals previously unknown, implicit and potentially interesting information from temporary database, is an important method for mining frequent subsequence patterns in many domains, such as Stocks and markets, web service, Medical treatment, DNA sequences and gene structures, and etc. A typical example of sequential pattern is like that of a customer who has bought a computer will return in a large probability to buy a scanner and a microphone Mining sequential patterns has a history of being studied in academics and applied in industrial application \(Chen

 set of all status items, and  set of all events in the temporal database subjected to the following constraints 1 representing \(1 is a user-specified minimum support threshold A FSI can be explained as a status itemset that appears frequently in the status-set based temporal database with a support greater than or equal to a user-specified minimal support threshold, i.e Similarly, there are also two important properties for FSIs that are straightforward ot frequent, any of its parent-set e.g Status-set Sequence   under certain conditions status items 1 2 3 p 1  2  m  1 2  2 follows 1  1 2 number of 1 2  1 2 nfidence of 1 2 means 1 2  1  There are a large number of temporal data in the field of status monitoring and fault predicting, such as the inspection of aircraft schedule and the inspection of automobile schedule. A typical status-set based temporal dataset can be explained by the example in Table 1. There are status items which need to be monitored in a sequence database, and each status item may have several integer values indicating different status of the equipment monitored, for example, three status values like, 0-normal 1-intermediate status, and 2-failure. Table1 shows that a total of There may be interesting sequential patterns hidden in the temporal database that has recorded all the status changes of equipment with respect to multiple inspecting items. The sequential patterns have great significance for the early discovery of impending abnormal status or functional failure. Traditional statistical methods are difficult to be applied to solve such problems, including the traditional SPM algorithms that mine sequential patterns based on event-ID, which can be viewed as special case of single status-event in our problem. We refer the problem of status-set based sequential pattern mining as status-set sequential pattern mining \(SSPM\uential pattern mining for failure prediction in a temporal database proposed in this paper can be well applied for discovering temporal sequential patterns, and has important application significance for finding meaningful status-set sequential patterns from large amount of temporal status monitoring data The following notations shown in Table 2 are used to formulate SSPM model Table2. Notations for formulating SSPM model also frequent occurred in the temporal status database sequence is a set of ordered status itemset in the form of Confidence of SS: The confidence of a SS e.g 1 2 k  where k represents a FSI and 1 2 k can be calculated by 1 2 3 k D|\327100%, representing how frequency 1 2 k can be calculated by 1 2 3 k  1 2 3 PROBLEM DESCRIPTION PROBLEM DESCRIPTION  2 I Definition 2 Definition 3 is 1 or 2, and \(3\or all c  number of events in D  user-specified minimum coverage rate   in  user-specified minimum factor set rate is frequent, any of its sub-set, e.g the status of k=2,3,\203,p}, representing the probability of occurrence of   times \(events\ of inspections have been conducted and accordingly the items\220 status has been recorded Table1  I 2014 26th Chinese Control and Decision Conference CCDC times of inspections based on  number of status itemset 2\or all Support of SS: The support of a SS, e.g h the occurrence of Property 1 Property 2 j Status Item-set \(SI\ A status itemset     X If user-specified minimum support user-specified minimum confidence  is 0  203 Frequent Status Itemset: \(FSI\: A FSI can be expressed as  SS X X s min_sup min_conf min_hold   X If is defined as a sub-itemset of Definition 1 Definition 4 Definition 5 min_fs m p p m e e e I i i X X X D X  X X X X D d min_cov u X I X i i j X X D D X X X X X X X 216 X X k S X s S S X c X X S  D D X 203 203 203 203 203 X X 216 S S c s 1 0 \203 1 0 1 \203 0 0 2 \203 1 1 0 \203 1 depicts the event from multiple status indexes instead of a single event-ID. Therefore, new conceptions related to SSPM have been redefined and new indexes are introduced to describe the patterns. Apriori-like algorithms are also developed to discover the SSPM with high computational efficiency and numeric examples are provided to demonstrate the process of SSPM for failure prediction The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we describe the characteristics and applications of the temporal sequence database. In Section 3, we propose some new definitions related to SSPM, such as strong status-set sequential pattern, coverage rate and factor set. The Apriori-like algorithms for discovering frequent status-set SSP, Strong SSP, and factor set of some important status itemsets are detailed in Section 4. In Section 5, we demonstrate the detailed SSPM process through a numeric example of using the Apriori-like algorithms.

For each In this study, we investigate the problem of SSPM, Strong SP mining and discovery of FS in the temporal status-set sequence database for the early discovery of impending abnormal status and equipment failure. Compared to the traditional SPM based on event-ID, which can be viewed as special case of single status-event in our problem, the serials of SSPM in this paper are proposed systematically based on serials of Apriori algorithms. Additional thresholds such as n the temporal database and s s s s are defined for mining different types of sequential patterns like strong status-set sequential patterns, and finding the factor set of some important status itemset by which we can early monitor the potential abnormal status and take measures to make it return to normal. Numeric example is performed to test the Apriori algorithms against a benchmark problem set. The results show that the algorithms are effective approach for solving SSPM problem, capable of discovering many types of status-set sequential patterns with user-interested coverage rate and hold rate, thus laying a foundation for future studies on this problem represents strong status-set sequential patterns        h  sp Number of Number of and FS in 1 L L min_cov SSP SSP Serials then REFERENCES 2 is also a 2 satisfies Rate 2 in different types with different thresholds e major factor set.Table7 shows the major factor set of status itemset 5318 Chen Y L, Huang TCK, A novel knowledge discovering model for mining fuzzy multi-level sequential patterns in sequence databases J a ta  K now le dg e E n g i ne e r ing  66 3  3 493 6 7   20 08   d s sp sp sp sp sp Agrawal R, Srikant R, Mining sequential patterns Proc eed in gs of  the Eleventh International Conference, pp: 3-14, 1995 4   FS FS FS and Kazienko, Przemystaw, Data Warehousing and Knowledge Discovery [M p r i ng e r Be r l in H e ide l be r g 20 08   7 2014 26th Chinese Control and Decision Conference CCDC     is a member of FS   X i 2 i 2 i i i i  i i i i  6 and the coverage rate of 1  2  3  4  5  1  2  3  4  5  1  2  3  4  5  1  2  3  4  5  1 2 ith different threshods 3 2 n 1 1  1 2  1  1 2  1  1 2  1  1 2  1  1 2  2 n 1 2  1 2 2  2 1  1 2 1  2 1  220 220 220 i i i i i 220 i i I   h Rules S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S S L X X 2 X 2 X 2 i i S   L i i i i i i i i i i i i X n advance to predict and inspect the status of itemsets associated with the occurred abnormal status-itemset for reducing the times of unnecessary equipment fault shutdown, and consequently ensuring the production schedule, as a result to save large amount of maintenance support costs.

First, we can discover different types of SSP by different rules for different requirements and occasions Second, we find that the number of SSPs changes sharply with the increase of different thresholds by intuitive comparisons in Table6.

This is because we cannot consider whole data and must identify when a data becomes obsolete or invalid As the old information of a data stream may be no longer useful or possibly invalid at present.  In order to support various requirements of mining data stream, the mining window or the interesting recent range of a data stream needs not to be defined static but must be flexible. Based on this range, a data mining method can be able to identify when a transactions becomes stale or needs to be disregarded  In this paper, we have investigated the problem of mining frequent itemset over data stream using flexible size sliding window model and proposed a new algorithm for this problem. The size of sliding window is adaptively adjusted based on the amount of observed concept change in the underlying properties of incoming data stream. The size of window enlarges or increase when there is no significant amount of change observed. While the window size reduced or decrease when there is considerable amount of concept change or significant change in set of frequent itemsets occurs Based on the value of given by user, the size of window is being controlled. After every pane insertion the set of frequent itemsets are updated and value of concept change is calculated. If the value exceeds the given minimum change threshold the window gets smaller by deleting all the obsolete information before a point defined called checkmark  Experimental results shows that our algorithm tracks the concept change efficiently while mining data stream and is more adaptive to recent frequent itemsets than fixed size sliding window models or time fading window models. For the future work, we are trying to enhance the performance by using fuzzy sets for minimum change threshold value so that the values like low, medium, high and very high instead of certain value between ranges of 0 to 1 R EFERENCES  1                    H.
