AN IMPROVED ALGORITHM FOR MINING FREQUENT WEIGHTED ITEMSETS  Abstract  Mining frequent weighted itemsets \(FWIs\ from weighted items transaction databases \(WITDs\ has taken the interest of many researchers and there have been several works related to mining FWIs in recent years. Beside, in real world applications, sparse weighted items transaction databases SWITDs\e very popular. For example, in the super market there are many items, but in the transaction there is only a small number of items. This paper proposes an interval word segment IWS\ucture to store and process tidsets for enhancing effectiveness of mining FWIs from SWITDs. With this structure intersection operations of tidsets between two itemsets are performed blazingly fast. Experimental results obtained on a 
number of spare databases show that IWS outperforms the existing methods Keywords.

ARM is used to identify relationships among items in transaction databases. Therefore, to mine association rules, it is necessary to mine frequent itemsets FIs\ the first step. Then association rules will be generated from these FIs. Thus, mining FIs is interesting and has taken much attention in recent years [7T h ey are div i ded into  three main groups 1  Candidate generation methods: These methods use a levelwise approach for mining FIs which scan databases many 
times. First, they generate frequent 1-itemsets then used them to generate candidate 2-itemsets, and so on until no more candidates can be generated. Apriori s an ex e m pl e  2  Methods that adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy: These methods compress the database into a tree structure and mine FIs from this tree by using a divide-and-conquer strategy. FPGrowth d FP G ro w t h  3 are ex em plar al g o rithm s   3  Methods that use a hybrid approach: These methods use vertical data format to compress the database and mine frequent itemsets by using a divide-and-conquer strategy   dex B itTableFI [6 d DBVF I 7 are  some examples The first approach has fairly large processing time because of scanning database many times. The runtime of the second 
approach requires much time to travel of FP-tree to build FIs The third approach is the Eclat algorithm [9 a sed o n IT t ree  it needs to scan databases once for building tidsets of items Therefore  the runtime is sharply reduced and this is the good method. However, the main disadvantage of Eclat algorithm is the usage of much memory to store tidsets resulting in certain difficulties in calculating the intersection of tidsets between two itemsets, particularly for a big database with the number of transactions up to millions. Some reseachers have proposed solutions to improve Eclat. Zaki & Gouda in 2005 proposed dEclat algorithm w h ic h us es t h e Di f f s ets co n cept ins t e ad  of tidset.

However, WITDs commonly used in real-world applications, have attributes weight \(profit or benefits\f each item in a transaction. For example, an order of goods in a supermarket, each goods has its profits, etc. Thus, mining 
FWIs and weighted association rule mining \(WARM\rom WITDs has high practical applications and attracted much research attentions recently [7In this paper, we propose an improved method for using DBV, called IWS, for fast mining FWIs from SWITDs. Some concepts, definitions, theorems and corollary are proposed Based on them, we present a novel method for storing and processing tidset of itemset for fast mining FWIs using IWSTree. This method shows the effective for mining FWIs from SWITDs through experiments The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents background and reviews some related works. Section 3 presents the data structure of IWS. Some concepts definitions and the algorithm for computing the intersection between two IWSs are also presented in this Section. The 
usage of IWS in the mining FWIs from a weighted transaction database is presented in Section 4. Section 5 shows the results of applying IWS to some experimental databases. Section 6 gives the conclusions and suggestions for future work II  BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK  A  Mining FWIs from WITDs A weighted items transaction database D s composed of tuples T  I  W where T    t 1  t 2 205 t m is a set of Nguyen Duy Ham Department of Math & Informatics  University of People\222s Security  Hochiminh City, Vietnam

Beside this approach saved memory to store tidset more than previous methods B  Some improvement for storing the tidset of itemset Zaki & Goud pro pos ed an ef f i c i en t  m e t h od t o  replace tidsets by diffset which only keeps track of differences between two tids of a candidate pattern from its generating frequent patterns. Diffsets drastically cut down \(by orders of magnitude\e size of memory required storing intermediate results. However, diffset is only effective with dense databases, but not on sparse databases. The reason is that diffset takes the offset on tidset while the number of items on transactions \(the number of elements on tidset\is less than the total number of transactions in the database  Dong os ed th e us e of B itT able  to store tidsets Tidset of items in Table 1 by BitTable  as description in Table  2 Item A appear in transactions ID 1,3,4,5}, thus BitTable of item A is  10111000 2  2 7 2 5 2 4 2 3 182 in decimal system\n which the bit position {1,3,4,5} from left to right have value 1, else have value 0. Similarly with B  C  D  E  The calculation of intersection between two tidsets is implemented by using AND bitwise operation with two corresponding bytes on two BitTable of tidsets. This is an advantage of BitTable  because bitwise operator is fast BitTable  with 16 bytes is presented in Table 3 Table 3 An example of BitTable Byte index 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Byte value 0 0 0 0 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 1 0 0 In this BitTable, there are 11 bytes which its value equal 0 0-byte\pecially on sparse databases the number of 0-byte is very large. Therefore, its potentially waste large amount of memory and lead to consume more time. This is a disadvantage of BitTable Table 4 DBV from BitTable in Table 4 Byte inde x 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Byte value 6 9 0 0 0 0 0 1 5 1 DBV 5\(6, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 1 Vo et al in trodu ced th e concept of DBV, which is a solution improving significantly BitTable  in performing time and memory. The authors proposed to remove all 0-bytes at the start and end of each bytelist \(no transaction is recorded in 0-bytes Using DBV structure, the bytelist of items is compacted considerably. However, DBV just only cuts 0-bytes at both the start and end of each tidset, while 0-bytes at the \223middle\224 of each bytelist are not removed. For example DBV in Table 4 there are 5 0-bytes. The disadvantage is that it consumes more memory for storing 0-byte leading to spending more time for determining intersection among two tidsets III  REPRESENTATION OF INTERVAL-WORD SEGMENT A.

IWS-Tree data structure A data structure, called IWS-Tree, is used to mine FWIs from WITDs. Each node on IWS-Tree includes three components, namely X  IWS  X d ws  X here  X is an itemset  IWS  X  is the IWS of X ws  X  is the ws of X To connect nodes X and Y to create a new node X Y  X  and Y must have the same length and the prefix, with length  X  1 items, and ws  X  Y   minws where minws is set by users B. A method for fast computing the ws from IWS structure A raising problem for mining FWIs on WITDs is the ws  calculation of each itemset according to formula \(2\hus, it is necessary to determine the tidset of the itemset. This is equal to determining the index set of 1-bits in an IWS. In order to solve this problem, we define a MAP array including 65.535 elements \(Table  6\ in which each element is a connected list to record index of 1-bits from left to right \(the first bit has index 1\n each Word of the set {1, \205, 65535 Based on the index of segments in IWS, we mapped to the index set of 1-bits in the segment in bitlist The algorithm of calculating ws is expressed as in Fig  2  Algorithm 2 Compute ws Algorithm  Input  IW S  X  Output  ws of itemset X  Method name  COMPUTE_W S    1  2 3 4  5 6  7 COMPUTE_W S  IWS  X  tidset  X

Mining FWIs from a WITDs using IWS-Tree Based on WIT-FWI algorithm w e replace th e m e t h od of storing tidset by IWS and using IWS-Tree data structure We propose an algorithm for mining FWIs from WITDs namely IWS-FWI. The itemsets on an IWS-Tree are FWIs which satisfy the minws threshold The IWS_Tree have many layers. The first layer includes an equivalence class with 1-itemset which satisfies the minws  denoted by P he k layer includes many equivalence classes which are k itemsets. Each equivalence class is formed by combination of the parent node k 1\ layer\with each other node in the same layer which is after the parent node. The itemsets in an IWS-Tree are thus FWIs that satisfy the minws  The recursively algorithm for creating a IWS-Tree is expressed in Fig  3 Example 9 Consider the database D represented in Tables 1 with minws 0.4. Table  7 shows the IWS of the 1-itemsets belonging to the database D in example 1 Table 7 IWS of items from D  in example 1 Item Tidse t BitTable IWS ws A 1, 3, 4, 5 10111000 2  1\(184  0.72 B 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 11111100 2  1\(252  1.00 C 2 4, 5, 6 01011100 2  1\(92  0.60 D 1, 3, 5, 6 10101100 2  1\(172  0.78 E 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 11111000 2  1\(248  0.81 In this example, each IWS of items has only 1 segment We compute ws of all 1-itemsets.

Two databases RETAIL, MBS-POS are obtained from http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data and three databases Sales_Fact_1997, Sales_Fact_1997_1998 and Salas_Fact_Sync are from Foodmart2000 in SQL2000. Table 8 shows the characteristics of the experimental databases. All the experiments were performed on a personal computer with an Intel Haswell Core i5 1.4-Ghz CPU and 4 GB of RAM running Microsoft Windows 8.1.

The performances of three approaches on these databases are quite different. For example, consider RETAIL database \(Fig. 6 & 11\with minws 0.1%, the mining time of IWS is 27.69 \(s\hile that of Diffset is 64.141 \(s\d DBV is 135.576 \(s\ides, the memory usage of IWS is 24.002 MB\ while that of Diffset 48.479 \(MB\d DBV is 160.687 MB Sparse databases have a small number of items on transactions. Many 0_Word on a tidset are removed by IWS Thus n 1 and m 1 in INTERSEC function and k in WS  function are small; the total runtime is thus small. IWS is effective in both memory and processing time VI  CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper has proposed an effective approach in order to reduce the memory usage for storing tidset information while mining FWIs from SWITDs. Firstly, we use the IWS concept to remove all \2230\224 Words. The IWS concept reduces the runtime and the memory usage. The experiments conducted on five databases show that our approach outperforms existing approaches in terms of memory usage and runtime. Especially when the minws threshold is small, IWS is very effective  In the future, we will further study on the problem of mining FWIs on WITDs with large databases and hierarchical databases. Besides, we will apply this method to mine frequent weighted closed itemsets and maximal frequent weighted itemsets REFERENCES 1  Agrawal, R., Mannila, H., Srikant, R., Toivonen, H., Inkeri V.
