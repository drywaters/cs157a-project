Deep-Space Ka-band Link Design Continuity and Completeness  Shervin Shambayati Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology 4800 Oak Grove Dr Pasadena CA 91109 E-mail Shervin.Shambayati@jpl.nasa.gov Abstract The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter MRO Kaband Demonstration has been inde\002nitely postponed and its objectives must now be met through other means One of these objectives is the evaluation of the continuity and completeness performance of the deep-space Ka-band link for different link design criteria To meet this objective the data from the Water Vapor Radiometers WVR and the Advanced Water Vapor Radiometers AWVR at the three Deep Space 
Network DSN communication complexes were used Along with these data MRO's DSN antenna allocation schedule Earth-MRO geometry and telecom parameters from MRO were utilized to emulate the Ka-band link performance over a ten-month period One pass per week per complex was selected for a total of 129 passes 43 passes per complex For each pass at most two data rates were chosen such that the expected data return relative to the monthly atmospheric noise temperature distribution for the given complex would be maximized subject to different minimum availability requirements MARs The performance of the link was measured in terms of data return data loss effective data rate link availability number of good periods number of bad periods good and bad period duration statistics number of passes 
with outages and link stability As expected as the MAR was increased the link availability and link stability increased However even with a MAR of 99 16 passes suffered outages due to weather effects The data return remained relatively the same for MARs between 10 and 80 but it declined rapidly as the MAR approached 99 These results indicate that a simple margin policy cannot guarantee data completeness and retransmissions must be used Given that some form of retransmission has to be used with Ka-band it is also recommended that the link be designed with approximately 80 MAR so that the data loss could be reduced substantially without incurring a signi\002cant penalty in data return T ABLE OF C

10 B IOGRAPHY  11 1 I NTRODUCTION Because of limited 50 MHz spectrum allocation at 8.41GHz X-band for deep-space missions downlink operations future high-rate deep-space missions will be using the 500MHz spectrum allocation at 32-GHz Ka-band for their downlink Since Ka-band is much more susceptible to adverse weather events than X-band a different operations concept was needed This operations concept based on maximizing the expected data return during a pass was to have been demonstrated with Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter MRO during its primary science phase PSP F or this purpose 
MRO carried a complete Ka-band telecommunications suite During MRO cruise phase the functionality of this suite was fully veri\002ed and some limited Ka-band performance data were obtained  Ho we v er  on May 24 2006 during aer obraking in Mars orbit MRO's primary Ka-band chain failed Although a backup was available on January 24 2007 it was decided to suspend MRO Ka-band operational demonstration inde\002nitely because of possible risk to the mission Since no Ka-band tracking was performed during the PSP the demonstration could not take place Therefore attempts were made to meet the objectives of the demonstration through other means The main objective of the demonstration was to evaluate the performance of the deep-space Ka-band link designed according to Ka-band operations concept in terms of its data re 
turn completeness and continuity Lacking Ka-band telemetry from deep-space missions it was decided to use the atmospheric noise temperature measurements from Water Vapor Radiometers WVRs and Advanced Water Vapor Radiometers AWVRs at the three Deep Space Network DSN communication complexes at Goldstone California near Canberra Australia and near Madrid Spain In this approach passes were selected from MRO's DSN schedule and EarthMRO geometry and the parameters for MRO Ka-band communications capabilities were used to design the link The WVR/AWVR data were used along with models for the gain and system noise temperature SNT of DSN Ka-band capa1 


ble antennas to emulate the performance of the designed Ka-band link Using this approach 43 passes per complex for a total 129 passes were selected over a ten-month period from April 1 2006 through January 30 2007 and the performance of the link over these passes was calculated individually on a per complex basis and in the aggregate The performance measures include statistics on the duration and the number of good and bad periods data return and data loss link availability effective data rate number of passes with outages and link 223stability This paper is a report on the results of these calculations Based on these results almost regardless of the margin carried on the Ka-band link the link will suffer outages due to weather and therefore a retransmission mechanism must be used to insure completeness of the data In addition different complexes seem to have different outage characteristics and the nature of outages at each complex should be studied further The paper is organized as follows In Section 2 MRO Kaband link capabilities are discussed Section 3 details the methodology used in this paper Section 4 describes the metrics used for evaluating the link performance The results are discussed in Section 5 In Section 6 conclusions are reached and caveats are discussed 2 MRO K A BAND C APABILITIES For the purpose of this study MRO Ka-band capabilities were selected to design the link and to emulate the link performance MRO carries a 35-W RF Ka-band Traveling-Wave Tube Ampli\002er TWTA transmitting over a 3-m parabolic antenna producing an equivalent isotropic radiated power EIRP of 101.3 dBm Because the output symbol rate the combined encoded bit rate and the parity bit rate is limited to 6 megasymbols per second Msps and the turbo decoding speed on the ground is limited to 1.5 megabits per second Mbps different codes are used with different data rates For science rates up to 1.5 Mbps including headers but not parity bits turbo codes are used For data rates from 1.5 Mbps to 2.61 Mbps the standard NASA 7 1/2 code concatenated with Reed-Solomon 255,223 code with interleaving depth 5 referred to as 223concatenated coding\224 is used Concatenated coding is also used for the engineering rate of 27.8 Kbps For data rates greater than 2.61 Mbps Reed-Solomon-only coding is used Table 1 shows the information data rates actual data without headers and the associated codes that are used in this study Note that in cases where multiple coding types could be used for the same information data rate the most powerful code the code with the lowest required information bit signal-to-noise ratio  E b N 0  for the required frame error rate is selected 3 M ETHODOLOGY The methodology used in this paper is illustrated through an example For this example we have selected the pass on day 200 year 2006 2006-200 at DSS-26 First the distance information is used to calculate the required gain-to-system-temperature ratio G/T for every data rate Fig 1 Table 1  MRO Data Rates and Associated Channel Codes Information Data Rate bps Channel Code 27846.76 Concatenated Coding 331397.95 8920 1/6 Turbo Code 497096.92 8920 1/6 Turbo Code 662795.89 8920 1/6 Turbo Code 745645.38 8920 1/2 Turbo Code 994193.84 8920 1/3 Turbo Code 1325591.78 8920 1/3 Turbo Code 1491290.75 8920 1/2 Turbo Code 1740422.20 Concatenated Coding 2610633.31 Concatenated Coding 2871696.64 Reed-Solomon-Only 3480844.41 Reed-Solomon-Only 5221266.61 Reed-Solomon-Only 40\r 45\r 50\r 55\r 60\r 65\r 70\r 10000\r 100000\r 1000000\r 10000000\r Information Data Rate (bps Required G/T (dB Figure 1  Required G/T for Different Data Rates Day 2006200 After the minimum availability requirement MAR is selected the G/T pro\002le associated for that MAR is calculated for the pass black curve in Fig 2 for 90 MAR using zenith atmospheric noise temperature statistics and equations for the 34-m beam waveguide antennas system noise temperatures and gains along with the ele v ation pro\002le for the pass Using the G/T pro\002le at most two data rates are selected such that the expected data return over the pass is maximized subject to the minimum availability requirement in the manner outlined in The required G/T for the selected data rates 2

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
