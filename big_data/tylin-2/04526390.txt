 1 A new research aircraft  The National Science Foundation has acquired a Gulfstream V aircraft for atmospheric research This high performance aircraft is operated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research NCAR lorado. It provides the nation with a powerful new tool for environmental studi  h i s ai rcraft i s capable of flight to altitudes of grea ter that 50 k ft and ranges of over 7000 miles while ca rrying payloads of 2500 kg. It will allow inves

 This aircraft operates most efficiently at high altitude flying above most of the weather and the utility of the aircraft will be greatly extended equipping it with remote sensing instruments to probe the air column beneath the aircraft   2  H IGH S PECTRAL R ESOLUTION L IDAR P RINCIPLES   The University of Wisconsin-Madison has 
received a contract to construct a High Spectral Resolution Lidar \(HSRL for deployment on the NSF / NCAR Gulfstream. HSRL provides robustly calibrated measurement that can not be acquired with convention aerosol lidars Conventional aerosol lidar s are unable to reliably correct the profiles for atmospheric attenuation This occurs because the lidar equation for backscattered power, P is proportional to the    


  2 product of the backscatter cross section, b a and the two-way attenuation as shown in equation 1  P ~ b a exp\( -2   1  where  is the optical depth between the lidar and the target volume.  As a result, it is impossible to separate changes in backs catter cross section from changes in the two-way attenuation without making assumptions about the relationship between b a and  Unfortunately, the relationship between b a and  is highly variable  The HSRL avoids this problem by dividing the lidar return into two separate profiles; one containing photons scattered from molecules in the atmosphere and the other containing photons scattered from particulates such as aerosols, cloud droplets and ice crystals This separation is achieved using the Doppler broadening that occurs due to the Maxwellian thermal motion of the molecules. The lidar transmits a very narrow spectral line \(bandwidth < 100 MHz molecular component is Doppler broadened to approximately 3 GHz by the molecular motion while the photons backscattered from the much heavier, slower moving, aerosol and cloud particles return with a negligible increase in spectral width. The HSRL receiver separates the Doppler broadened molecular return using an iodine vapor absorption cell. The wavelength of the transmitting laser is tuned and locked to the center of an iodine abso rption line. The received signal is divided into two parts by a beam splitter The first is directed directly to a detector that responds equally to both the molecular and particulate photons. The second part of the signal is directed through the i odine adsorption cell. The iodine adsorption line, wh ich has a bandwidth of 1.8 GHz, strongly attenuates the photons returning  at the transmitted frequency. This removes the particulate scattering while allowing the wings of the Doppler broadened molecular scattering to pass to the detector. Using independent knowledge of the atmospheric temperature profile and the measured spectral band pass of the iodine filt er it is then possible to compute the total number of molecular photons in the received o lecular signal can be computed fr om Rayleigh scattering theory and an independently measured temperature profile, the molecular signal can then be used as a known calib ration target that is available at each point in the lidar return. A comparison of the observe d molecular return to the computed clear air mo lecular return allows direct calculation of th e atmospheric extinction profile and the ratio of the particulate return to molecular return provides an absolutely calibrated profile of the particulate backscatter cr oss section The HSRL also measures the depolarization of the lidar return. Thus, the HSRL provides calibrated profiles of backscatter cr oss section, optical depth and depolarization. A more detailed description of HSRL principles can be found in reference [3  3  HSRL  D ATA E XAMPLES   When the data from the combined aerosolmolecular channel of the HSRL is used without the molecular channel the system operates as a conventional backscatter aerosol lidar  Figure 2 –Conventional b ackscatter lidar data  The combined channel only altitude-time plot of data acquired on 11-Feb-07 with the Arctic HSRL is presented in figure 2. This shows the attenuation problem faced when interpreting conventional lidar data. Notice the shadowing of upper layer clouds by lo w altitude clouds. In particular, notice the shadow of the 1.8 km altitude cloud at 6:00 UT cast on the 5 km cloud layer. Figure 3 shows th e same data displayed using the HSRL’s intrinsic attenuation correction 


  3 In this case, the shadows only occur when the molecular signal is completely attenuated. At all other points the measured backscatter is unaffected by lower cloud elements   Figure 3—Attenuation corrected measurements of the backscatter cross section  The HSRL also measures depolarization. The HSRL can be used to distinguish water and ice clouds because spherical pa rticles such as cloud droplets do not cause de polarization while nonspherical particles, such as ice crystals, produce strong depolarization Notice the strongly scattering layers at alti tudes of 1.8 km and 3.5 km in figure 3 show very low depolarization \(less than 1%\his indicates that they are comprised of water droplets   Figure 4—Circular depolar ization measured for the case presented in figure 2 and 3  In contrast the cloud layers above 5km show high depolarization indicated that they are comprised of ice crystals  Figure 5 shows a profile of optical depth vs altitude derived from the data shown in figure 3 Profiles of this type ca n not be derived from conventional aerosol lida r data with out invoking assumption about the nature of the scattering particles  Figure 5—Optical depth profile, 11-Feb-07 5:45 5:55 UT     3  D ESIGN F EATURES OF THE A IRBORNE HSRL  The airborne HSRL design is based on the system we constructed for long term operation in the Arctic  Both systems are designed to operate as Internet appliances, and are capable of autonomous operation and self calibration. Both systems are eye safe for direct viewing of the output beam Eye safety operation is enabled by use of a micropulse design where low energy laser pulses are transmitted at a high repetition rate and where the transmitted beam is expanded over a large aperture. In order to maintain high signal to noise ratios while using low en ergy laser pulses in the presence of background sky light the lidar must operate with a very sma ll angular field-of-view 


  4 45 microradian small spectral bandpass\( 8 GHz  Table 1--HSRL specifications   Aperture:                       40 cm Angular field-of-view   45 microradian Average power              400 mW Pulse repetition rate      6 kHz Wavelength                   532 nm Laser bandwidth            <100 MHz Detectors                        Perkin-Elmer SPCM’s Geiger Mode APD’s QE ~50 Sky noise bandwidth      ~ 8 GHz Iodine filter ba ndwidth   1.8 GHz Range resolution           7.5 m   These allow the lidar to operate with very high signal to noise ratios even in the presence of brightly lit clouds. Sky noise suppression is so complete that it is difficult to tell the difference between daytime and night time data.  The need to both expand the laser beam to a large aperture and to maintain system alignment at a 45 microradian field-of-view dictates th e need for a transceiver design where the laser beam is transmitted through the receiving telescope. Both the Arctic HSRL and the new airborne system use an afocal beam expander for the transceiver  NCAR plans to install windows in both the floor and ceiling of the Gulfstream aircraft  Figure 6—An afocal beam expander expands the transmitted beam from 2 cm to 40 cm. It is used both for the transmitter and receiver. A ¼-wave plate converts the linearly polarized laser beam to circular polarization. On return it converts the polarized part of the received beam to the orthogonal linear polarizati on so that the thin-film polarizer can direct the beam to the receiver. The cross-beam polarized pickoff is used to measure depolarization   The HSRL must be configured to operate in either zenith or nadir pointing directions. To accomplish this,  the telescope shown in figure 6 is modified with a 45-degree turning mirror in front of the primary mirror. This directs the 2 cm collimated beam along the axis of a bearing which allows the telescope to be manually rotated from downlooking to up-looking.  This can be accomplished in flight as the aircraft changes altitude.  The telescope is aimed 4 o Off of vertical to reduce specular reflection from oriented ice crystals   Figure 7—Lidar position in aircraft  Airborne operation of the telescope imposes stringent requirements on thermal stability and structural strength. Prior to takeoff the aircraft will be at ambient temperature and the aircraft may be operated at locations ranging from wind swept arctic bases to sun baked tropical airfields Shortly after takeoff cabi n temperature will be warmed or cooled from ambient to normal room temperature. The telescope must maintain near diffraction limited performance in the presence of these large temperature ch anges. In addition, the structure must have the strength to withstand FAA mandated standards for crash loadings. The optical design of the lidar was accomplished using an end-to-end Zemax mode l of the optics. This was used to determine mechanical tolerances throughout the system. Based on this model we selected a Dall-Kirkham telescope design with a center hub-mounted f-2 mirror constructed of Zerodur for the primary mirror. The back of the primary was thinned towards the edges in a single-arch design to re duce weight. Our optical 


  5 model showed that the primary to secondary separation distance was cr itical and must be maintained to within 10 microns  The telescope mechanical structure was designed using finite element an alysis \(figure 8 design uses graphite-epoxy construction to provide thermal stability, light weight and high strength. The truss is co mposed of graphite-epoxy tubes. Structural panels are built up with graphiteepoxy skins over fire resistant foam cores while the filets and the central hubs are machined from G10 fiberglass. Finite element analysis was used to tune the vibrational re sponse of the structure to eliminate resonances at frequencies which might be excited by aircraft noise    Figure 8—The HSRL telescope   Figure 9 shows a picture of the completed telescope along with images of a single-mode fiber source a distance of 60 m. The images were obtained using a 100X mi croscope objective and show how the image change s with defocus. This artificial star test was one of the tests used to verify that the telescope meets the HSRL optical requirements    Figure 9—Artificial star te st of telescope using a single mode fiber source a distance of 60 m  We are currently designing a testing regime consisting of static load tests coupled with finite element analysis to prove the crash worthiness of the telescope structure  Figure 10 shows the transmitter section of the HSRL optical bench on th e left and the receiver section on the right   Figure 10—HSRL optical bench As of this writing, we ha ve installed and aligned the receiver optics and just received delivery of the laser transmitter. This will enable us to complete the system assembly and initial ground based testing prior to the conference     A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS

The trend of shaft order 1, 2 and 3 are similar to the trend observed in figure 9.  This suggests that the failure model is not a function of component type \(bearing vs. shaft\, but location.  Figure 10 displays the RUL and the predicted RUL using this model.  It is likely that the accuracy is limited to the reso lution of measuring cyclic strain.  Currently, there is no parametric data to measure current load on the generator  Figure 10 RUL and Prognostics Hours Remaining for Bearing 6  D ISCUSSION  In the short term, it is unlikely that any HUMS algorithm will be able to quantify physical damage based on a vibration based sensor.  This in of itself will limit the ability for maintenance credits to be applied to HUMS equipped aircraft.  However, this does not limited the reduction in aircraft operating cost that could be achieve by using MD information into reduce unscheduled maintenance and reduce the logistics foot print required to operate a fleet of aircraft.  As demonstrated, techniques for prognostics could be available for operators use Prognostics techniques based on probabilistic m   such as Hi dden Sem i M arkov M odel s based repai r  activity on the cumulative proba bilities that the component will last n units of time.  This is a difficult concept to articulate and hard to make maintenance decisions on.  The technique presented here could simplify the decision process of maintainers by giving a rough estimate of the time remaining until a maintenance action is taken.  This is a policy decision and does not impact safety of flight Certainly this methodology requires additional work Additional area of work could be 1  For a class of components, is the material constant D the same between components 2  Does the application of a geometric correction factor improve performance 3  Are there better measures of cyclic strain that torque 4  The Kalman filter is used for filtering, are other methodologies, such as particle filter, more appropriate

 11  Impact \226 Strauss\222s Derivative of Moore The impact of such a simple statement is at the same time beautiful and difficult to realize.  What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.  It can be easily seen that in terms of memory technology for space, the selection is limited \226 especially so when it comes to non-volatile radiation hardened devices Part II 6  H IGH C APACITY S OLID S TATE R ECORDER  The impetus of this paper was the assignment to predict mass, power, volume, and cost for multi-terabit data recorders of the capacities shown in Table 3 with deliveries occurring in the year given [2   Table 3 - Data Recorder Capacity Requirements YEAR DATA CAPACITY 2010 2.88 Tb 2020 30 Tb 2030 130 Tb  This part of the paper presents a design of a 130 Tb NonVolatile data recorder which could be built for delivery in the year 2030, based on the information presented in Part I In developing the SSR design, technology selection was limited to the two technologies examined in detail in Part I Flash and NROM\nd a technology freeze date of 36 months in advance of delivery was assumed  SSR \226 Flash & NROM Based designs Table 4 - ITRS predicted device capacity \(Gb for three technologies Year 2015 2018 2021 2025 Technology CRAM 0.032 0.064 0.064 0.128 NROM 4 8 16 32 Flash 64 128 256 512  In this particular case, the year 2025 is selected as the freeze date and appropriate device capacity is used.

 12  200  NROM: approx 4060 devices 200  Flash: approx 256 devices By examination, it can be easily seen that developing a high capacity data recorder as pr oposed using CRAM technology is impractical Error Detection and Correction Codes  All technologies are subject to lo ss of information, be they the loss of a single bit or the loss of an entire chip, the inclusion of Error Detection and Correction is an appropriate action by any system designer Just by using EDAC, there is an associated bit-penalty ranging from a few percentile to over 25 per cent   The exact selection of most-appropriat e Error Correction codes is highly dependent upon error phenomena not only for each  rt ain aspects of the exact part being considered as well as the environment to be encountered [2  25  F o r t h e reco rde r  de scri be d bel o w a Reed-Solomon code was selected.

The recorder features cross-coupled SpaceWire interfaces as well as redundancy down to the memory plane Cross-coupled controllers w ith shared memory ensure operation without the need to re-build memory allocation tables should a fault occur Recorder Summary  Using conservative packaging techniques, two recorder designs were developed: one using Flash memory and the other using NROM.  A summary of their characteristics is provided in the tables below.  A more detailed discussion of design and implementation follows Board Design  Figure 19 - One side of 8Tb Memory Slice using NROM Technology The NROM-based solution is presented as Figure 19.  In the figure, nearly two hundred 2-Gbit NROM devices are installed on each face of the 9U card.  \(The whitespace is preserved in this example for passive components and design margin.\e time of this writing, the availability of chip-stacked NROM devices was uncertain and omitted from the trade space Design of a Flash-based memory card would be of similar ilk.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous
