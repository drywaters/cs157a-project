atmospheric measurements from independent radiometers yielded an excellent data set with which to test all aspects of the GeoSTAR calibration This paper presents a preliminary look at these data and presents an algorithm to remove the aliased background from the synthesized image TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION 1 2 TEST CONFIGURATION  2 3 IMAGE SYNTHESIS WITH ALIAS REMOVAL 3 4 TEST RESULTS 4 5 CONCLUSION 5 ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 6 REFERENCES  6 BIOGRAPHY  6 1 INTRODUCTION GeoSTAR is a 
synthetic aperture radiometer concept which would for the first time provide high resolution microwave images of the earth from geostationary earth orbit GEO in bands from 50 to 183 GHz The idea is to deploy a Y-array of correlation interferometers and to use aperture synthesis to achieve high resolution continuous hemispheric earth coverage without requiring an otherwise prohibitively large reflector or scanning mechanism These measurements would provide atmospheric temperature humidity and precipitation soundings on a continual basis filling in large temporal and spatial gaps of current polar-orbiting 
microwave sounders These data would capture rapidly evolving weather phenomenon such as hurricanes and tropical storms which are otherwise inadequately sampled in the tropics by polar orbiters The continuity of GEO microwave observations would also have high value for measuring tropospheric winds profiles using water vapor 1 1 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00 
C 2008 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper  1421 Version 3 Updated 2008:1:3 tracking algorithms similar to current cloud tracking techniques In early 2006 a small 24-element 50-55GHz ground-based demonstration instrument was completed to validate the measurement concept Figure 1 
shows the array and Figure 2 explains the how the array geometry samples a larger synthetic aperture plane sometimes referred to by astronomers as the U-V plane In this array the crosscorrelations between elements from different arms yields the set of visibility measurements each of which measures a unique spatial harmonic within the field of view FOV When properly calibrated these measurements are transformed by Fourier Series into a brightness temperature image of the earth 1 The demonstrator instrument of Figure 1 has provided technical proof that a 
practical system can meet calibration and performance requirements Interferometric test data from the antenna range as well as from solar transit observations provided precise validation of our system at the 0.500 precision level-which meets mission requirements by analysis Yet these analysis did not provide any well calibrated test images and there remained a desire to provide a more compelling demonstration in a relevant environment In particular the image synthesis involves a critical de-aliasing step which needs to be demonstrated The design of GeoSTAR is based on the GEO 
view of the earth-which is of a 17 degree diameter disk against a cold and well modeled cosmic background This geometry determines the array spacing and antenna diameter which are both about 3.5 wavelengths The elemental antenna pattern of our system is approximately Gaussian with a half-power beamwidth of 17 degrees which matches the earth as well as possible Yet inherent to this design only about half of this antenna pattern energy falls within the earth disk The remaining half views the cosmic background surrounding the earth and these regions 
re-appear as aliases within the central image as determined by the element spacings These must be modeled and removed during image synthesis In space the cosmic background is readily modeled For a ground based demonstration the problem is somewhat more difficult The far-field of the demonstrator instrument is over 200 meters which would require a target of some 50 meters diameter to represent the earth view from GEO In the Summer of 2006 we found a suitable solution by re-focusing GeoSTAR to operate in the near field 2 This permitted 1

observing the target disk In Figure 4 we see the round shape of the target on top of the support post and we see the two heated targets the 2x2 target to the upper left of center and the 4x4 target below center This image is very close to our expectations There are pronounced ripples within the disk which are predictable effects of synthetic sidelobes and the limb contrast which will be eliminated with further image processing There are also aliases of the support post below the target which appear in the left and right edges of the hexagonal image area Note that aliasing follows three axes such that any object which moves past one edge of the hexagonal FOV immediately reappears at the opposing edge As the object moves further away the aliased image tends to fade in magnitude with the antenna pattern The support post happens to be centered below the two diagonal axes which places the alias along the left and right vertical margins of the hexagon The alias is strongest at the top of these margins and fades with the antenna pattern as it descends further down these margins 5 CONCLUSION A first order model and calibration of GeoSTAR has been demonstrated which shows relative accuracies within the simulated earth disk which are on the order of 1 Kelvin and absolute errors which are on the order of 5 Kelvin This is really quite a good result considering the simplified model which has been applied thus far The remaining errors are well explained by 1 antenna pattern gain anomalies within the array which were measured previously on the antenna range at the 22 level 2 near-field errors at the 500 level due to offsets of antenna elements in the array 3 noise temperature calibration errors on the order of 2 due to poorly characterized thermal sensitivities and uncertainties of the thermal and humidity control 4 phase errors related to the non-ideal geometry of the array and thermal and humidity instabilities of the noise diode distribution Figure 5 plots some sample temperatures which have been extracted from three regions within the synthesized image and plotted as a time series as the two heated targets were cycled in temperature The dashed traces in Figure 5 are the thermistor temperatures within the targets The three regions represent the 2x2 4x4 and ambient areas of the target A spatial average of the thermistors and of the pixels apply in all cases These results show that the target was indeed quite accurately measured by GeoSTAR The largest errors of some 5 K in the early part of this example is common to all three temperature zones and this can be traced to difficulties that we encountered estimating the mean antenna brightness which has since been corrected Figure 6 plots double-differences between the heatedminus-ambient thermistor temperatures and the heatedminus-ambient GeoSTAR measurements of Figure 5 These indicate how well GeoSTAR resolved the contrast between the heated and ambient zones of the target in a manner which is insensitive to the large mean temperature errors that we encountered The 2x2 target plots show a series of 5 K spikes which can be traced to a time lag in the thermistor measurements of the absorber material The 2x2 target used a thicker absorber foam which was more difficult to heat or cool rapidly with the circulated air so the thermistor temperatures within the foam tended to lag behind the microwave temperature This effect is also evident in the expanded plot of Figure 5 Apart from these transients we see that the steady state readings are in good agreement at the 1 K level-which is a very good result when we consider all of the errors which have not yet been corrected GeoSTAR  thermistor dashed temperatures black=ambient red=2x2 green=4x4 350L  I 214 21.6 218 22 222 UT days of June 2006 224 22.6 GeoSTAR  thermistor dashed temperatures black=ambient red=2x2 green=4x4 335 r 9 315 F 1----22.26 22 28 22.3 22.32 22.34 22.36 22.38 UT days of June 2006 Figure 5GeoSTAR solid traces and thermistor dashed traces temperatures of the ambient black 2x2 red and 4x4 green zones of the target 5 y 310

Both groups were satisfied with the time it took to complete the first two topics. However both expressed concern about the time it took to complete the last two searchers Table 4 section 4 presents the searcher perception of accuracy and reliability of the results.  All undergraduates felt that they have found the answer to all questions, whereas about 12.5% of the graduates had some reservation for the last two questions When asked if the answer found was correct graduate students had reservations on all four questions that ranged from 5.9% for smoke to 25% for aspirin.  A quarter of the undergraduates expressed reservation only for the last two questions The undergraduates in their majority felt that the websites where they found the answers were reliable for the first two questions.  However they were more conservative for the depression and aspirin questions.  The graduate students again expressed more reservation across the board  4  Conclusions  Searching the web in gene d f o r consumer health information in particular is a challenging process [11, 13, 14  This study investigated how undergraduate and graduate students search the web for consumer health information.  The 32 participants were asked to find answers to four health related topics: flu, smoke, depression, and aspirin. As the result show the majority of the subjects chose a search engine to start their search.  The length of search time was a good indicator of the difficulty of the topic.  Similarly the longer it took the higher the number of web pages visited to find an answer The opinions of undergraduate and graduate students differ in many areas, especially relating to the mechanics of searching.  The graduate students expressed more reservation with respect to the search process and their satisfaction with the results.  Undergraduates thought that planning and searching was rather easy An examination of the queries used by the subjects shows that many had problems in formulating queries  Acknowledgements I would like to thank Phuong-Uy Ashley Lam, Tom Rhoades, and Lorie Vik for their assistance at different stages of this research project 5  References 1.
