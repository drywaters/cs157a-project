to discriminate moving targets from clutter when observed from an air-borne/space-borne multichannel phased array radar Numerous variants of this filtering technique have been developed and are often compared to some baseline performance with respect to output signal to interference plus noise ratio or minimum mean square error Under clairvoyant conditions these metrics have a direct relation to probability of detection However under 
non-clairvoyant conditions such as with recorded data probability of detection is not measured directly and secondary metrics such as signal to interference plus noise ratio and minimum mean square error are used to measure performance This paper attempts to show a case where using a metric such as minimum mean square error can indicate erroneous favorable performance 12 TABLE OF

Processing STAP to address the problem depicted in Figure 1 They also showed a proportional relationship between output SINR and Probability of Detection Pd hence maximizing output SINR maximizes Pd of a target Equally maximizing the output SINR minimizes the output Minimum Mean Square Error MMSE 9 That is the error between the filtered target return and the desired target return The caveat to this observation is that the assumed interference statistics are Wide Sense Stationary Gaussian WSSG and that the covariance matrix of the interference is known Reed et al 4 considered the case where the interference covariance matrix is unknown and needs to be estimated from secondary data It is further assumed that this training data follows the same statistics as the sample of data being interrogated for the presence of a target the data is Independent and Identically Distributed IID This method is known as Sample Matrix Inversion SMI A loss of less than 3dB in SINR is expected if at least 2  DOF number of secondary training samples are used Here DOF stands for Degree of Freedom and is equal to the number of spatial channels times the number of pulses transmitted For a large system such as a space system employing potentially hundreds of spatial subarrays each connected to a receiver and recording device and transmitting several hundred pulses the DOF can be quite large This is a tremendous requirement on the needed number of secondary samples and the assumption that they be IID A flurry of activity in the STAP area was spawned in the early 1990's where attention was paid to the actual implementation of STAP techniques Some notable but by no means complete references examples can be found in 5 6 7 8 Two general areas of research since the early 90's focused on the impact of real world data effects and reduced DOF methods The former issue explores the impacts of environmental conditions such as dense target environments non-IID training data clutter discretes and non-homogeneous training data The later area addressed the issue of being able to adaptively support large DOF systems with limited training data and limited computational horsepower As new STAP techniques have emerged the goal has always been to maximize Pd of a target which according to 3 is directly proportional to maximizing filter output SINR and minimizing MMSE However as mentioned previously the condition of training data being WSSG IID and in infinite supply or the interference plus noise covariance matrix is known is typically not met when implementing STAP methods on real systems with recorded data Under these conditions performance metrics such as SINR and MMSE deteriorate 3  This paper addresses the issue of the appropriateness of using filter output MMSE using least squares 19 as a metric for measuring the performance of STAP techniques under various conditions of processor rank and sample support assuming only one data set is available as would be with a real ISR sensor Section 2 will layout the necessary mathematical background leading to metric definitions In Section 3 reduced rank processors are defined which are used in later performance comparisons In Section 4 results using a notional radar example are presented indicating the issues of using MMSE as a performance metric Concluding remarks will be made in Section 5 2 STAP FOUNDATION In this section a foundation of processing and nomenclature for STAP is given with the purpose of furthering the discussion of performance metrics As mentioned previously one area of interest especially in data starved scenarios is the area of reduced rank signal processing These methods attempt to perform the optimum compression of the interference sub-space while preserving the target return with limited computation and sample support In this section a Generalized Sidelobe Canceller GSC is described which forms the basis for the reduced rank processing methods to be discussed in Section 3 More on the GSC and its application to reduced rank processing can be found in 9 and 10 however will be summarized here General Parameters The following notation will be utilized in this paper K equi-spaced receive elements/sub-apertures J number of transmit pulses xE CKJxl,complex received data vector n E CKJXl complex noise vector s 1e C jxl target spatial-temporal steering vector sd c KJX desired look direction spatialtemporal steering vector Let the received data vector from a single range ring or time sample be defined as x ast n 1 where a is some complex target amplitude The vector x is in Vandermond form where the N channel returns from each transmitted pulse are stacked upon each other in column vector format 2

 Table 6. Enhancing the quality of  e-recruiting  Frequency   52 Enhance responsiveness and reliability to recruiters requests 42 Improve applicant search functions 37 Provide more services 32 Keep applicants profiles up-to-date 26 Don t overload recruiting websites with irrelevant information 21 Improve navigation, make registrations easier and faster 17 Automatic daily updates of job ads on erecruiting sites when corporate pages are updated 13 Offer different possibilities on how to index job ads 9 Improve workflow/ integration with external eHRM systems  5. Conclusions  In this study, we interviewed 73 recruiters and content-analyzed a large data set of e-mail communications between recruiters and service personnel of an e-recruiting portal for university graduates \(throughout 2007\pecifically, we analyzed recruiters perceptions of improvements and limitations in the quality of the staffing process since beginning to use e-recruiting services. We further explored the most frequent requests emailed by recruiters to an external e-recruiting service. Finally we revealed characteristics of high service quality in e-recruiting services and how the service quality can be enhanced Recruiters frequently note that they receive more applications, reach more applicants, and have better possibilities for e-marketing initiatives such as employer branding since beginning to use erecruiting services. However, they found that actual behavior, appearance and communication skills of the candidates cannot be observed via online recruitment Recruiters most frequent kinds of emails include information inquiries about the recruiting portal regular \(re\ such as publishing jobs online or suggesting candidates; e-marketing orders; change cancellation or confirmation mails; technical, servicerelated and billing questions An e-recruiting portals e-service quality has been clearly associated with its ability to attract many visitors to the website; page impressions; high number of clicks on published job ads and company logos; the number of incoming applications; number of up-to-date profiles; successful placements within a certain timeframe; the size and growth rate of the applicant pool, if available; and the quality of cooperation with other media channels so as to reach many potential applicants.  This e-service quality criterion has been labeled statistics Also range of services selection i.e. does the site provide only basic functions such as job publishing or also supplementary services such as search, full placement, employer branding, skill tests\ has been related with high e-service quality. Finally, recruiters suggested ways as to how e-service quality can be enhanced. Of foremost importance is the need to enhance the responsiveness and reliability of the service personnel s and the applicants answers to recruiters requests. Other e-service quality enhancements include: improve applicant search functions; provide more services; keep applicants  profiles up-to-date, don t overload site with irrelevant information, improve website navigation, provide automatic daily updates of job ads, offer different possibilities on how to index jobs and improve workflow/integration with external eHRM systems  6.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
