reflecting and radiating surfaces Remote sensing techniques allow taking images of the earth surface in various wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum EMS One of the major characteristics of a remotely sensed image is the wavelength region it represents in the EMS Some of the images represent reflected solar radiation in the visible and the near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum others are the measurements of the energy emitted by the earth surface itself i.e in the thermal infrared 
wavelength region The energy measured in the microwave region is the measure of relative return from the earth's surface where the energy is transmitted from the vehicle itself This is known as active remote sensing since the energy source is provided by the remote sensing platform Whereas the systems where the remote sensing measurements depend upon the external energy source such as sun are referred to as passive remote sensing systems The orbital plane of the Earth Observation satellite is commonly required to maintain a 
fixed angle\(e.g 300 with respect to the mean Sun direction to ensure adequate illumination conditions for image data collection The following sections discuss the orbit perturbations forces designing the orbit of remote sensing satellite and taking a case study to verify paper approach 2 ORBIT PERTURBATIONS The orbital elements provide an excellent reference for describing orbits however there are other forces acting on a satellite that perturb it away from the nominal orbit These perturbations or variations in the orbital elements can 
be classified based on how they affect the Keplerian elements Secular variations represent a linear variation in the element short-period variations are periodic in the element with a period less than the orbital period and long-period variations are those with a period greater than the orbital period Because secular variations have long-term effects on orbit prediction the orbital elements affected continue to increase or decrease they will be discussed here for Earthorbiting satellites Precise orbit determination requires that the 
periodic variations be included as well Third-Body Perturbations The gravitational forces of the Sun and the Moon cause periodic variations in all of the orbital elements but only the longitude of the ascending node argument of perigee and mean anomaly experience secular variations These secular variations arise from a gyroscopic precession of the orbit about the ecliptic pole The secular variation in mean 1 1-4244-1488-1/08/$25.00

anomaly is much smaller than the mean motion and has little effect on the orbit however the secular variations in longitude of the ascending node and argument of perigee are important especially for high-altitude orbits For nearly circular orbits the equations for the secular rates of change resulting from the Sun and Moon are Longitude of the ascending node Qmoon 0.00338cos\(i 1 Qsun  0.001 54 cos\(i  n 2 Argument of perigee COmoon 0.00169\(45 sin i 3 tSun  0.00077\(4 5 sin2 i 7 2.06474 x1 O4a 2 cos i 1 e 2  J2 75nJ2 RE a 4 5 sin2 i 1 e2  6 7 1.03237x1014a 2 4-5sin2 i 1-e2 2 where n is the mean motion in degrees/day J2 has the value 0.00108263 RE is the Earth's equatorial radius a is the semi-major axis in kilometers i is the inclination e is the eccentricity and Q and t are in degrees/day For satellites Perturbations from Atmospheric Drag Drag is the resistance offered by a gas or liquid to a body moving through it A spacecraft is subjected to drag forces when moving through a planet's atmosphere This drag is greatest during launch and reentry however even a space vehicle in low Earth orbit experiences some drag as it moves through the Earth's thin upper atmosphere In time the action of drag on a space vehicle will cause it to spiral back into the atmosphere eventually to disintegrate or bum up If a space vehicle comes within 120 to 160 km of the Earth's surface atmospheric drag will bring it down in a few days with final disintegration occurring at an altitude of about 80 km Above approximately 600 km on the other hand drag is so weak that orbits usually last more than 10 years beyond a satellite's operational lifetime The deterioration of a spacecraft's orbit due to drag is called decay The drag force FD on a body acts in the opposite direction of the velocity vector and is given by the equation FD  CDPv2A 8 where CD is the drag coefficient p9 is the air density v is the body's velocity and A is the area of the body normal to the flow For circular orbits we can approximate the changes in semimajor axis period and velocity per revolution using the following equations Aarev 2 m 6;T2CDApa2 Alrev T mv A V  7,DAoaV rev m 9 10 11 where CD is the drag coefficient P is the air density a is the semi-major axis P is the orbit period and A m and V are 2 n in GEO and below the J2 perturbations dominate for satellites above GEO the Sun and Moon perturbations dominate The orbital plane Earth Observation satellite is commonly required to maintain of a fixed angle\(e.g 300 with respect t the mean Sun direction to ensure adequate illumination conditions for image data collection Considering the secular motion of the ascending node a Sun-Synchronous orbit may be obtained by adjusting the inclination i in such a way that  0 2  OC Sun  0 98564 7240 IDay Molniya orbits are designed so that the perturbations in argument of perigee are zero This conditions occurs when the term 4-5sin 2i is equal to zero or that is when the inclination is either 63.4 or 116.6 degrees 4 where i is the orbit inclination n is the number of orbit revolutions per day and 2 and a are in degrees per day These equations are only approximate they neglect the variation caused by the changing orientation of the orbital plane with respect to both the Moon's orbital plane and the ecliptic plane Perturbations due to Non-spherical Earth When developing the two-body equations of motion we assumed the Earth was a spherically symmetrical homogeneous mass In fact the Earth is neither homogeneous nor spherical The most dominant features are a bulge at the equator a slight pear shape and flattening at the poles For a potential function of the Earth we can find a satellite's acceleration by taking the gradient of the potential function The most widely used form of the geopotential function depends on latitude and geopotential coefficients Jn called the zonal coefficients The potential generated by the non-spherical Earth causes periodic variations in all the orbital elements The dominant effects however are secular variations in longitude of the ascending node and argument of perigee because of the Earth's oblateness represented by the J2 term in the geopotential expansion The rates of change of Q and m due to J2 are J 1 5nJ2 RE I a cosi  e2 2 5

 11  Impact \226 Strauss\222s Derivative of Moore The impact of such a simple statement is at the same time beautiful and difficult to realize.  What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.  It can be easily seen that in terms of memory technology for space, the selection is limited \226 especially so when it comes to non-volatile radiation hardened devices Part II 6  H IGH C APACITY S OLID S TATE R ECORDER  The impetus of this paper was the assignment to predict mass, power, volume, and cost for multi-terabit data recorders of the capacities shown in Table 3 with deliveries occurring in the year given [2   Table 3 - Data Recorder Capacity Requirements YEAR DATA CAPACITY 2010 2.88 Tb 2020 30 Tb 2030 130 Tb  This part of the paper presents a design of a 130 Tb NonVolatile data recorder which could be built for delivery in the year 2030, based on the information presented in Part I In developing the SSR design, technology selection was limited to the two technologies examined in detail in Part I Flash and NROM\nd a technology freeze date of 36 months in advance of delivery was assumed  SSR \226 Flash & NROM Based designs Table 4 - ITRS predicted device capacity \(Gb for three technologies Year 2015 2018 2021 2025 Technology CRAM 0.032 0.064 0.064 0.128 NROM 4 8 16 32 Flash 64 128 256 512  In this particular case, the year 2025 is selected as the freeze date and appropriate device capacity is used.  The ITRS is predicting that by the year 20 25, CRAM-based devices will have a capacity of 128 Mbit per die; NROM will have 32 Gb per die.

 12  200  NROM: approx 4060 devices 200  Flash: approx 256 devices By examination, it can be easily seen that developing a high capacity data recorder as pr oposed using CRAM technology is impractical Error Detection and Correction Codes  All technologies are subject to lo ss of information, be they the loss of a single bit or the loss of an entire chip, the inclusion of Error Detection and Correction is an appropriate action by any system designer Just by using EDAC, there is an associated bit-penalty ranging from a few percentile to over 25 per cent   The exact selection of most-appropriat e Error Correction codes is highly dependent upon error phenomena not only for each  rt ain aspects of the exact part being considered as well as the environment to be encountered [2  25  F o r t h e reco rde r  de scri be d bel o w a Reed-Solomon code was selected.

The recorder features cross-coupled SpaceWire interfaces as well as redundancy down to the memory plane Cross-coupled controllers w ith shared memory ensure operation without the need to re-build memory allocation tables should a fault occur Recorder Summary  Using conservative packaging techniques, two recorder designs were developed: one using Flash memory and the other using NROM.  A summary of their characteristics is provided in the tables below.  A more detailed discussion of design and implementation follows Board Design  Figure 19 - One side of 8Tb Memory Slice using NROM Technology The NROM-based solution is presented as Figure 19.  In the figure, nearly two hundred 2-Gbit NROM devices are installed on each face of the 9U card.  \(The whitespace is preserved in this example for passive components and design margin.\e time of this writing, the availability of chip-stacked NROM devices was uncertain and omitted from the trade space Design of a Flash-based memory card would be of similar ilk.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous
