data systems in order to facilitate rapid retrieval of relevant information for flight controllers on console and in their off-console duties Traditional data mining techniques to identify document similarity rely upon brute-force O\(n2 cosine similarity of vectors representing text contained in the documents--an expensive and time-consuming operation that becomes unfeasible on large data sets such as those in use by the Shuttle and Station programs at NASA This paper 
details a technique developed as part of this activity to identify documents similar to documents relevant and of interest to the user by leveraging the prior search results to produce a weighted graph of document relationships based upon search terms This paper details the algorithms used the user interface prototypes developed to evaluate the usefulness of similarity to the browsing activities of users and the evaluation of the 
accuracy of this technique as compared with traditional data mining techniques TABLE OF CONTENTS 1 INTRODUCTION  1 2 BACKGROUND  2 3 APPROACH  3 4 ANALYSIS AND CONCERNS  4 5 CONCLUSION  5 6 REFERENCES  5 1 INTRODUCTION Search-Driven data analysis method proposed in this paper relies on search results produced by user specific queries i.e its user driven Both naive 
and sophisticated user demands for a simple search result that one can understand and should address the means of one's search The systems available in the market perform data-analysis based on predefined classifications or ad-hock classification based on datasets the results may or may not be relevant to users demand The approach in this paper is a different perspective of data-analysis using not predefined rules of classifications but from user defined 
classification rules 2 BACKGROUND The more the data is structured the better the applications that can be built on top of it with the advancement in XML databases many such applications are addressing the needs of performing data-analysis at middle-tire level as a realtime data analyzer or a standalone application service The approach in this paper depends on 2NETMARK extensible DataBase XDB a schema-less approach to save and 
index all kinds of textual data semi-structured full-structured and un-structured The advantage with NETMARK is it converts even the semi-structured data into a meaningful structured format the sequence diagram in Figure-2.0 shows the process NETMARK saves the meta-data associated with the document information as the context of the data The search results produced by NETMARK are in well structured XML format Some of the data-sets that ISS MOD search for are PVCS and Flight 
Controller procedure documents PVCS documents are in well structured HTML format the procedure documents are semi-structured documents in Word or PDF format 7 BIOGRAPHY 6 1 U.S Government work not protected by U.S copyright based on work supported by NASA under awards NCC2-1426 and NNA07BB97C 1 IEEEAC Paper 1090 Version 8 Updated 2007:12:17 2A patent pending database technology from NASA Ames Research Center 1

 Cost is 0 n significantly less then statistical and traditional text-mining algorithms  With proper algorithms the relationship weights among documents can be adjusted for dynamic data changes in the document The concerns associated with this approach are  Only a few searches will not produce useful similarity metrics because calculation of similarity among documents is directly proportional to the number of search criteria definitions  Naive users will pollute similarity metrics  The dynamic changing documents may significantly impact the process of data-analysis algorithm because all the relationship with the document will have to change  Need to validate method compare algorithmically qualitatively with other techniques 5 CONCLUSION The approach can be very useful for search related problems as the approach can be leveraged to work on any XML database with standard query languages like XQuery or any other query language as long as the result sets produced are well structured A prototype is been built based on this approach using Netmark as the XML database NET framework to build data-analysis algorithms and AJAX Asynchronous JavaScript XML as a presentation layer for visualizing the weighted graph The prototype is been tested on International Space Station ISS related data sets Further developments include evaluating the approach against traditional text-mining approaches integrate standard visualization techniques with data-analysis metrics design an optimal algorithm to address the need for dynamic changing data 3 Rie Kubota Ando Latent Semantic Space Iterative Scaling Improves Precision of Interdocument Similarity Measurement Annual AMC Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval Athens Greece Pages 216223 Publication Year-2000 ISBN:58113-226-3 4 Maluf A David Bell David Ashish Naveen Semi-structured Data Management in the Enterprise A Nimble High-Throughput and Scalable Approach 9th International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium 2005 5 Ming-Syan Chen  Jiawei Han  Philip S Yu Data Mining An Overview from a Database Perspective IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering v.8 n.6 p.866-883 December 1996 6 Maluf David A and Tran Peter B NETMARK A Schemal-Less Extension for Relational Databases for Managing Semi-Structured Data Dynamically Foundation of Intelligent Systems Ning Zhong Zbigniew Ras Shusaku Tsumoto Einoshin Suzuki Eds Springer  ISBN 3-54020256-0 2003 7 Maluf David A  Implementing Articulation Rules for Object Request Brokers as an Extension to Production Systems  IEEE Knowledge and Data Engineering Exchange Workshop Newport Beach California pp 36-44 1997 8 Maluf A David et Al Knowledge Mining Application in a IVHM Testbed IEEE Aerospace Conference Montana 2006 6 REFERENCES 1 D Maluf P Tran NETMARK A Schema-Less Extension for Relational Databases for Managing Semi-structured Data Dynamically ISMIS 2003 2 Maluf David A and Tran Peter B An Extensible Schema-less Database Framework for Managing High-Throughput Semi-Structured Documents IASTED Conference on Computer Science  Technology CST Cancun Mexico Conference Proceedings 2003 5
