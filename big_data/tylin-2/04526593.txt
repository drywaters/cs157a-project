we consider a distributed solution While xed position single sensor tracking of a single target is considered straigh tforward multiple sensors on the different platforms with over lapping coverage is complex because duplicate tracking dat a is generated for the same targets Redundant information ge nerates network messages that in turn overload the network performance and may result in trafc congestion on limited avionic bandwidth wireless links that prevents time critic al data from reaching its destination In our approach we iden tify similar tracking data to be distributed and send only on e copy of the message In order to identify redundant data we use a clustering al 
gorithm to evaluate the large volumes of sensor information  Distributed multiple target tracking MTT combines track observations from different sensors to identify the same ta rget Massive computation and communication is required for distributed real time MTT In this paper the K-means cluste ring algorithm is used to aggregate redundant tracks Softwa re simulations using Matlab and emulation tests using Emulab show signicant improvement of the information quality by using clustering An MTT system was prototyped with FPGA hardware to cluster high volumes of data with low latency in real time at the network layer T ABLE OF

signicant increases in processing presents optimal band width usage challenges limits key access to network management parameters and adds latency due to large queues buffering network packets Our novel research evaluates us ing clustering to reduce or eliminate these problems Traditional information theory was evaluated to help map th e track observations to queuing decisions for more efcient bandwidth allocation In our approach the goal is to identify similar tracking data to be distributed and send only on e copy of the message Shannon 10 d i s c u s s e d  G E O M E T RICAL REPRESENTATION OF MESSAGES to represent messages in multiple dimensions more efciently Eliminat ing message redundancy can happen by simply recognizing different information in the same message that is not necessary for recreation of the information being transferred S hannon proposes improved mapping of higher levels to lower levels of communication for more efcient transfers Intel ligent reconstruction by the source and receiver can provid e the improved mapping by eliminating messages or information normally sent In the case of distributed tracks the fu sion algorithms are insensitive to a certain amount of variation in distance known as tracking error 1  M e a n a n d v a r i a n c e o f the tracking error are used for calculating the dispersion m atrix variance and covariances of x,y positions of members for a group of track observations MTT uses variations of the dispersion matrix to identify the associated tracks estim ate the position of target We evaluate the impact of improvements to the lower level queuing using higher level geometri c methods similar to the example provided by Shannon 10  We evaluated changes relative to the true track path or shape generated relative to the track constructed from the data se nt over bandwidth limited links The challenge is to provide th e information required for accurate tracking while selectiv ely eliminating redundant or unnecessary information to match the bandwidth capacity available Our solution adds intell igence between the source and receiver to make difcult real time decisions at the network level to increase the value of information and improve network quality of service QoS Messages differing by only a slight variation of measurement to a limited extent represent nearly the same information and offer an opportunity to eliminate redundant information This may also reduce the number of dimensions in the current message space Track observations which are considered equivalent by the destinations receivers of tr ack observations can be grouped together and treated as one point or a reduced set of key observations Equivalency is evaluated by assessing the relative closeness of the observ ation to the projected centroid We propose that this grouping method requires fewer messages to specify one of these equivalence classes dened as we cluster the track observations rather than sending sequential non-prioritized obse rvations For example we use a two-dimensional space to indicate the value of this method by comparing normal tail drop network queuing with clustering Simulated targets a re controlled and y in a square pattern of known dimension to simplify assessing any perturbation observed The deviati on in target tracking shape represented by the series of obser vations are quantied relative to area differences of the sha pe We compare the known area generated by the simulation target ying in a square to the area constructed based on the limited observations sent Our clustering approach for distributed fusion uses both sp acial and temporal methods to evaluate equivalence We adjust clustering thresholds to prioritize the information s ent to other nodes Distance methods such as Manhattan or Euclidean distance compare the distance from the centroid to the observations If all observations are evenly spaced on a circle around the centroid they can be regarded as equivalent and theoretically can be reduced to a one-dimensional space or point We extend this specic example representing points track observations within the circle as key messag es to be sent at higher priority The radius of this circle is de ned by the clustering threshold We preserve state by storing ea ch target's most recent track observation sent for centroid pr ojection The spacial method described above clusters based on distance We rst project the centroid using information shown in Figure 2 and the following equation Centroid  stored  X Y  timeinc    currentvelocity  2 Second the distance from the observation to the projected centroid is calculated Third if the distance is less than t he clustering threshold the observation is sent Currently t he clustering threshold is set based on empirical data however dynamic methods are planned for future implementations Temporal methods simply evaluate velocity to prioritize th e observations and then select the correct update rates The three priority levels are high e.g missiles traveling at M ach 2 or higher medium e.g aircraft traveling between Mach an d Mach 2 and low e.g trucks ships traveling below Mach 1 We plan to use an adaptive weighting factor that will be adjusted relative to the proximity target turn radius a nd threat level represented by the target Based on experience  the update rates for the high priority is set at 6 hertz mediu m priority is set to 4 hertz and low priority is set to 2 hertz Our temporal algorithm compares the relative system time associated with last observations sent to decide whether th e current observation should be sent The update rate is varied based on the priority level of the target The observation won't be sent unless the update rate set for the target ha s been exceeded even if the observation is below the clusteri ng threshold close to the centroid Currently the spacial an d temporal algorithms operate independently but are sequentially dependent as indicated We evaluated a severely constrained bursty link with a small tail drop queue traditional network QoS contrasted with a zero length queue clustering to assess effectiveness Qu

implementation of this clustering algorithm will not suffe r the same speed limitations of software Hardware maps the clustering algorithm onto an FPGA that allows for signicant parallelism The results of the packet loss at the gateway no de are presented in Figure 11 The number of packets that are unable to be clustered varies from 27,000 to 209,000 packets  Figure 9 illustrates the amount of trafc in and out of the gat eway node The average packet size received at the gateway is 217 bytes Each node generates 9,090 packets In the 75 node example 9090 x 75  681,750 packets are destined for the GW node The GW was only able to receive 434,995 packets and the others were dropped due to an overloaded CPU The total trafc received at the GW was 217  434,995  94,393,915 bytes or approximately 94 Mbytes Figure 6 depicts the amount of trafc generated in the network as the number of nodes increased from 10 to 75 From this gure the JXTA P2P Multicast protocol is the most expensive implementation to distribute trafc to all nodes U sing either IP Multicast or Ethernet Broadcast is signicant ly less expensive From these results the IP Multicast protocol was selected as the protocol to deploy in the software and hardware clustering applications These simulations help ed to demonstrate the problems of deploying the JXTA P2P at the Gateway Cluster Node This protocol would create additional CPU and network load to further degrade the performance of the clustering From Figure 6 the overhead associated with sending the same information using JXTA Multicast required 17 times the total bandwidth This overhead comes from the additional complexity of pushing multicast state information encapsulated with each message using overlays to the application layer Thus it is possible to predict 138,087,788  17  2,347,492,396 bytes or approximately 2.3 Gigabytes of trafc destined for the gateway node if P2P multicast is chosen as the distribution method The GW node would be able to process signicantly less if conventional hardware is used Testing conrms that even a 3 Ghz CPU could not keep up with receiving and clustering of the smaller multicast packets which necessitates the use of FPGA or ASIC technology 7 H ARDWARE A RCHITECTURE Advanced SA requires the use of high speed networks with increased bandwidth to implement centralized track fusion to improve

modules Track Cluster Time Compare and Update In addition to these modules control modules were needed to load and run the hardware clustering system Figure 13 shows the architectu re of the track clustering system Time Stamp As the track data enters the system it is provided with a time stamp The time compare module uses the 32-bit time stamp to determine if the track should dropped or sent based on the 8 


Update Control Processor Track Cluster Accept Time Compare Time Stamp Report Figure 13  Hardware Track Clustering Block Diagram dened update rates set by the time threshold Track Cluster A set of smaller modules comprise the track cluster function  The rst module calculates the distance and is designed in a modular fashion so that it can be replaced with diverse metrics implemented in hardware The Manhattan distance calculation is replicated in parallel to evaluate multiple dis tances simultaneously The second component is the cluster table The cluster table maintains a list of current clusters/tracks locally on the F PGA chip The centroids of the clusters represent the projected position of the track for prioritization This projected posi tion determines if an incoming track matches a cluster The calculated parallel distances are passed to the accept module t o make the critical decision to forward the data Accept The accept module compares all parallel distances to a clust er threshold If the distance is less than the cluster threshol d the module will assign the incoming track to the specied cluste r The module will not assign the incoming track if the distance s are greater than the cluster threshold If this occurs the s ystem currently decides the incoming track is a new cluster and will specify that a new entry needs to be added to the cluster table Update After the accept module determines if an assignment is accepted the update module then updates the cluster table Th e update is computed from the velocity information contained in the track data and determines the projected position of th e track The projected position is passed to the cluster table in the track cluster module for storage The accept module determines whether the track is a new track and needs to be added to the set of known clusters The update module will calculate the projection of the track and then send the infor mation to the cluster table to be stored Time Compare The time compare module determines if the track should be dropped or forwarded to downstream modules/systems The module is comprised of a timetable that maintains two time values the last time the cluster/track was reported and the last time a track message was received A time threshold determines if a track message should be sent or aggregated If the difference between the last sent time and the current time is greater than the threshold the data is sent from the node However if the difference is less than the time thresh old the data updates the cluster table however the data is not sent from the node The timetable also contains information regarding the velo city and the accuracy of the incoming track data This data is used in conjunction with the time data to determine whether the system sends or drops the data The velocity information is used to determine the three time categories or priorities of trafc high medium and low 9 C LUSTERING O BSERVATION D ATA The track data is part of the network trafc owing to and from each clustering node Each track observation has a current position and velocity in the xy dimension The clusteri ng system can be expanded into a larger dimensional space although the dimensionality is set to two currently The clustering nodes are interconnected using a network where multiple sensors on different platforms report the sa me track information but may have different accuracies These tracks are similar representations of the same information  but are received at multiple clustering nodes at different t imes due to network traversal The clustering nodes maintain information on the current clusters active tracks and clust er centroids In addition to the position of the track the system uses time stamps to determine the last time a cluster was reported The clustering system uses a modied algorithm similar to K-means In traditional K-means the number of clusters K is set to a specied number We allow the number of clusters to start from zero and expand as new tracks are found The algorithm utilizes two tables to achieve the desired fun ctionality The rst table the cluster table is comprised o f the current clusters that are projections of where the track sho uld be in the next track message As tracks are received they are compared to the clusters using the Manhattan distance If th e distance is less than a threshold cluster threshold the t rack message is assigned to the specied cluster The velocity of the track message updates the projection of the cluster Thi s projection update allows the system to account for tracks th at are not static If the distance from the input track is greate r than the threshold for all the current clusters a new cluste r is added The second table the track time table maintains two times for each cluster the last time a message was sent about that cluster and the last time a message was received about that cluster Since the track data is time stamped when the clus9 


tering system receives the track the system compares the ti me received to the time sent If this time is greater than the tim ing threshold the system will allow the message to pass and update the cluster received time in the table However if th e time is less than the time threshold the system updates the cluster received time and removes the message from the outgoing trafc 10 H ARDWARE F ABRICATION The implementation on the NetFPGA platform was able achieve a clock frequency of 125 MHz The hardware utilization of a track clustering algorithm with four parallel distance metrics is shown in Table 1 With a slice utilization of 44 the number of distance metrics can be increased This increase in parallel distance calculation reduces the late ncy to compare incoming tracks to all known clusters XC2VP50 Utilization Resources Utilization Percentage Slices 10533 out of 23616 44 4-input LUTS 14318 out of 47232 30 Flip Flops 12958 out of 47232 27 Block RAMs 82 out of 232 35 External IOBs 353 out of 692 51 Table 1  Device utilization for XC2VP50 Hardware Track Clustering with four concepts Given our implementation with four parallel distance metri cs with 100 total tracks in the cluster table at any one time we can estimate the total time for clustering an incoming track  The parallel distances can be calculated in four cycles The total number of cycles required to produce all 100 distances would be 100 Since the operation of the clustering circuits are pipelined the accept module would only require three cy cles for determining the correct action to perform The upda te module would require three cycles to perform an update or creation of a new cluster The time table compare takes three cycles Add in an additional four cycles for header processing and we have a total of 113 cycles Since we are running the hardware at 125 Mhz the total time required for distance calculations assignment determination and updates requ ires 0.904  s for each incoming track This gives us an approximate throughput of 1.1 million packets per second 11 C ONCLUSIONS The results show that the real time hardware using the Kmean algorithm for clustering can accurately locate redundant track data for aggregation identify new tracks and se lect the critical tracks to be forwarded to other distributed sen sor nodes for fusing Improvements in the information quality and latency for distributed track fusion were demonstrated using advanced clustering Track data distributed using multicast is shown to generate 2.3 Gigabytes of trafc for large scale 75 nodes fusion Experiments revealed state-of-the-art CPUs could not handle bursts of packets received which resulted in loss of pack ets due to network buffer overow The clustering gateway node was shown to provide an 18 to 48x reduction in bandwidth through eliminating redundant data The results were tested in a distributed environment called Emulab that used a software version of the clustering algorithms State-oftheart Emulab CPUs could not keep up with the track data resulting in network buffer overow and loss of packets This illustrates the need for our special processing solution us ing FPGA technology Real time clustering is implemented in the network layer OS I layer 3 to reduce the bandwidth intelligently while mainta ining high information content Our pipelined hardware desig n calculates four parallel distance metrics for 100 total tra cks in 100 cycles The total time required for distance calculations assignment determination and updates is only 0.904  s for each incoming track The hardware solution is prototyped using the Stanford NetFPGA in the Boeing Center for Intelligent Networked Systems CINS lab Our real time solution preserves Layer 7 resources and decreases latencies The ability to add real time hardware in t he network layer improves MTT performance in bandwidth limited environments ultimately preserving legacy avionic ne twork resources 12 F UTURE W ORK Novel methods to illustrate the increased value of information using clustering over normal queuing methods was constructed based on spatial methods Our use of clustering algorithms was fairly limited with K-means however there are plans to implement solutions based on N-means algorithms in the future We realize selection of the correct clusterin g thresholds must be dynamic based on the separation of target s and is highly dependent on accurately projecting the centro id The relationship between our temporal and spacial clusteri ng algorithms must be integrated into a single solution We pla n to develop dynamic clustering thresholds for more accurate prediction of target paths while selectively reducing the d istribution bandwidth Real time assessment of the information value allows us to dynamically adjust the thresholds fo r preserving the key observations We theorize that changing the update rates proportionally with the target velocity wi ll provide improved information value We also plan to add a weighting factor to take into account proximity sensor acc uracy and threat level will provide a more intelligent soluti on Interconnecting the time increment used in the projection o f the clustering centroid with the temporal target rate will s implify the algorithms and hardware Reliable transfer of data using wireless is available in sev eral avionic systems and will be evaluated as a separate test case Latency will denitely increase if all dropped packet s are transferred as required by reliable transport 10

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
