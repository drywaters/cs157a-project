Abstract It is an excellent system design method, which could improve the reliability, security of the system. The coupling between the levels is greatly erased, thus is convenient for future expansion 1\ Appropriate 1\ Hierarchical Architecture I.  I NTRODUCTION With the rapid development of information technology and network technology, governments, colleges, enterprises are employing more and more information systems. In order to simplify identity management process, unified identity management system appears. Typically, an identity management system manages identity information of several application systems in one security domain. However, most identity management systems only focus on application user management or operating system user management In this paper we propose an organization-oriented model for federated identity management, which is very useful to hierarchy identity structure, especially for the government situation. And differing from common ones, our model considers application user, Windows system user and Linux system user to form a unified user information structure Along with the urgent requirement of cross-domain resource sharing and cross-domain operation, different security domains form a federation. So we give a solution to federation identity management based on the preceding model There is a life-circle of identity information. It starts with the registration of identity, through identity information provision, attribute modification till the destruction of the information. If identity information is physically destroyed then the life-circle comes to an end, else, if it is logically locked, then the life-circle can go on with the activation and the following procedure. So our discussion will cover the steps of identity life-circle To clearly explain the model, this paper is organized as follows: First, in section 2, we give an introduction on unified identity management model. In section 3, we give a solution to federation identity management based on the preceding model. In section 4, we introduce the model\220s application in our actual identity authentication system, which can be regard as a using example of our model. The conclusion in section 5 summarizes our work and points out the model\220s shortcoming and the future working direction II.  U NIFIED I DENTITY M ANAGEMENT M ODEL Our model aims to aid the implementation of an identity management system. In order to be widely employed in governments, colleges, enterprises, we should consider more about the universality. So we should abide by the following rules 2\ Stability An Organization-Oriented Model for Federated Identity Management and Its Application Lianzhong Liu and Junxiu Gao School of Computer Science and Engineering Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing, 100 083 C hina lz_liu@buaa.edu.cn and be ijicy@126.com There are separate user management modules in every operating system. So, we should take over the module to ensure the users are managed by us but the operating system can run with no other side effect So, we employ the LDAP \(Lightweight Directory Access Protocol\ in our model. LDAP is an Internet protocol that 3\ Expansibility 3\ Take over Windows and Linux User Management Module Along with the emerging various application system federation becomes a must in recent information construction Government, college and enterprise that have many information systems face a big problem of identity management after a federation is established. This situation is further intensified by Internet security threat for identity information has to be transferred in order to authenticate and authorize. In this paper we propose an organization-oriented model of federation identity management. Aim to simplify identity management process, we consider application user and operating system user and design a unified user attribute structure. Facing organization\220s hierarchy framework, our design should be realized in LDAP, which is competent for level structure. And we also propose a solution to implement the model to federation situation. Part of the model has been realized in an actual identity authentication system The model should be stable enough to ensure its usability The model should be applicable to a kind of multiple applications Based on the above principles, we set the following design principles 4\ Reusability Centralized identity management implies a high level of control and with that a high level of security. It is also sometimes inferred that simplicity and cost savings are further benefits of a centralized approach [1  D i rect o r y servi ce is used f o r m a naging hierarchical architecture and employing it as the core part means we should construct a centralized storage of the identity information and construct a new dependent system 2\ Centralized Directory Service The model should be adjusting its structure according to the specific situation The model should not only provide the functionality requirements, but also consider the specific request to satisfy the specific operation demand 


B.  System Association Relationship When users login to a system, the authentication proxy accepts the login request The proxy finishes the authentication for the system. There are two ways to complete the process. One is: the proxy delivers the accepted information to UIM, UIM finishes the authentication procedure and returns the result to the proxy and then the proxy can tell the result to the system. The other is: the proxy request identity\220s information from the UIM and then does the authentication procedure itself. The UIM performs authentication operation in the former and performs identity provision operation in the latter Fig.1 Unified User Management Model 2\ Authentication and Identity Provision 3\ Attribute Modification and Self-Service A.  Unified User Management Model An actual person may have multi-system access requirement in a security domain. For example, an officer is allowed to login to his working PC in which Windows 2000 is installed, and he is also allowed to login to the Personnel Administration System to finish his task. That is to say, an actual person may have various identities in the discussing area. So, we propose a unified user management model As is shown in Fig.1 below, one identity can be linked to different systems using the same series of information. So, we need to store only one record for the officer and all the registration, administration, destruction procedure can be done with the only set of information After confirming the identity will no longer login any system, the administrator of UIM can destroy the identity information physically. Hereto, all the procedure of identity management ends. If the identity information is logically destroyed, it can be activated later when necessary This always takes place when the person who is temporarily transferred comes back Also what we should pay attention to is that all identity information should be treated when delivered on the Internet but this is beyond our discussing scope here III.  A F EDERATED I DENTITY M ANAGEMENT M ODEL As federation comes into existence, the scope of identity  To illustrate our model, we suppose there is a Unified Identity Management system \(UIM for short\which acts as a centralized server. Its wor king mode and its interfaces are show in Fig.2 below As is shown in Fig.1, the main work of UIM is to manager identity information of applications \(including Win32 application, J2EE application\ and operating systems including Windows, Linux and UNIX\. So it is reusable to at least such five kinds of situation. To be expansible, any other application situation can be added in case that there is an authentication proxy  Wi th t his UIM it is no n eed to develop new identity management module and authentication module in other willing system According to the previous design principle, UIM is based on LDAP. UIM also reserves audit interface and access control interface for the future integration consideration. And there must be an administrator or multiple level administrators to manage the identities So, the over-all identity management procedure is Fig. 2 Unified User Management System Association Diagram The administrator of UIM has the right to modify any identity information and the UIM should provide the functionality of updating unimportant attribute to ordinary user [3  S e lf service enables ordinary user to modify his identity information, which are not correlated to over-all control. For example, he can modify his password and email now and again, but he cannot change his job duty and his privilege to resource for it influences the mechanism of the over-all run 1\ Identity Registration 4\ Destruction The administrator registers the identity information including username, authentication data such as password\, identity basic information \(such as real name, gender, email, mobile number and duty\, belonged security domain and the resource, which he has right to access After user\220s confirmation, commonly through email, the identity becomes valid simultaneously in the area UIM manages. And the user can use the username and authentication data to login to his legal systems To be safe, the identity registration procedure is always done locally and the confirmation letter is always encrypted That is to avoid transferring plain text on the unsafe Internet email and other programs use to look up information from. Its aim is to work as a lightweight me thod to access X.500 which defines a hierarchy directory structure-root at the top, branch extends downwards-DIT \(Directory Information Tree Whereas, LDAP costs less but is more efficient 


In section A, we talked about account linking. After account linking, UIM of security domain B knows \215d1pznedzs\216 is from security domain A.  However, when needed, it will consult UIM of A the detailed information of \215d1pznedzs\216 With the returned message, UIM of B knows wanted attribute but it does not know what system the person can access and which concrete function of the system the person can use. At this point, identity mapping is a good choice Identity mapping means one security domain identity\220s information should be mapped to the counterpart domain This should be done automatically and manually. To be automatic, the mapping should be auto-done when accord with the specific mapping rule. To be manual, the mapping result can be modified by the Administrator according to the concrete situation; and the unmapped should be mapped manually In the real situation, the automatically mapping always takes place when the federation establishes and the administrator assigns the corresponding level relationship between the exchange visiting identities of the two security domains. And the manually mapping always takes place when  model management enlarges to a wider area. Identity management systems are not independent; they must establish a mechanism to find each other and to cooperate with each other. This becomes a difficult problem where facing the vast Internet. In this section we will introduce you the application of the above model, you should pay attention to it adjusting change from the previous one The most distinct difference of federation identity management and ordinary identity management is that an identity from one security domain needs to access the resource application system or operating system\ at the other security domain. There is a trust problem because the entities at the different domain are not in the same trust circle, which means one does not believe the other will always act rightly especially if there is commercial secret or political secret [4 5 So  i d en ti t i es acces s i n g th e o u t er s ecu rit y d o m ai n m u s t  provide some credible material offered by an entity trusted by both sides In our model, we will not mention the security domains whose identity information is managed by different parties or different kind of systems. We suppose the identities from both security domains are governed by the same kind of systems For example, they are both managed by a system call UIM developed by the same company. The aim is to simplify discussion, because we do not discuss the communication of different systems and the trust between them, which need the cooperation of two companies or organizations. However, it is achievable Talking about unified identity management in federation we will cover the following main aspects: account linking identity mapping, ticket management, SSO support and the general architecture B.  Identity Mapping A.  Pseudorandom Identifier and Account Linking 3 Pseudorandom identifier and account linkin g g When federation operation begins, the security problem is noticeable. Let us see an example situation: organization A and organization B set up a federation and some identities from A want to access some resource of B \(both are governed by UIM system\ order to authenticate and authorize, UIM of B must know some information about the identity from A however, it is no need for the UIM of B to know the entire attribute about the identity, which may aggravate its burden of storing redundant data. So, a good method for UIM of B is to store only the identity account and the security domain where the identity comes. And if needed, it can ask UIM of A the exact information of the exact identity So, the returned message says \215John\220s information: age: 25 education background: master; duty: director; home Lianxiang Street...\216 All the information flees on the net and the unexpected ill-intentioned guy will capture the message and make ill use of the information. To avoid this, there is always a pseudorandom name shared by both side. That is to say, both UIM exchange John\220s information by the name of 215d1pznedzs\216 which is randomly produced by one side and recorded by both. Thus, unwanted middleman can only know 215d1pznedzs is 25 years old and he lives in Lianxiang Str. \203\216 which is no use in fact. To avoid the further association of the 215d1pznedzs\216 by illintentioned middleman, we can produce a different pseudorandom identifier [6 h ere co m m unicat io n starts between another system and UIM This looks like a link pointing from UIM of B and C to UIM of A. So it is call account linking 7 h en pseudorandom identifier and account linking model is shown below The more complex situation is user \215John\216 has different information set at both UIM. In this situation, it is like a bidirectional linking. UIM of A may request John\220s information which it doesn\220t know from UIM of B, and the reverse may also happen. In bidirectional account linking, just one pseudorandom identifier is needed Another solution to find who the identity is is called attribute aggregation, which means the willing UIM will aggregate identity\220s attribute getting from the source UIM and maintain the information for further use.

Authentication Engine Authentication The cross-domain access could be divided int o two different kinds: not authenticated and already authenticated If the user \(at the client\has not been authenticated, he will be redirect to the UIM of his local domain with the authenticating mode information. In the authenticating interface, the user can submit his authenticating data to the authentication service of the UIM. The authentication module  UUM Assertion Management a single identity\220s privilege changes. Finally, when the federation breaks, the mapping ends and all the record should be cleared up The common illustration of identity mapping is: department heads of a region should be mapped as section chiefs of the center when acce ssing the central resource. This can be the same as role mapping in the visual world. However, identity mapping, different from role mapping, include the instance that many users of different kind mapping to a single user having the same identity information In this section we will talk about identity provision. To provide identity information, we employ the identity assurance service When John has been authenticated in security domain A and he wants to access some resource in security domain B The proper situation is John does not provide his own authentication data to UIM of B, but to let UIM of A to prove his identity-in another word, UIM of A assure John\220s identity That is identity assurance service. In our paper, we just simply talk about identity assurance, see more please consult [9  Pseudorandom identifier can be used to ensure safety to some extent. It should be set up according to the strategy of both security domains and the identifiers should be changed now and again. Using pseudorandom identifier does not mean we transfer plain information on the Internet. Some disposal should be done before transferring and also after. The common way is encryption, however, it needs large amount of calculation, which needs difficult math foundation, on both sides to ensure its safety, or else, it is useless. In our model we will employ the method of ticket that is convenient to use Identity provision is realized by identity assurance service A ticket structure should be shared by the UIM. And the assurance module finishes the task of assurance assertion producing, analyzing, storing and destroying, and also provides its partner the ticket query service. At the same time it realizes the assurance ticket producing, granting, parsing and checking. The assurance assertion producing should be accomplished with the cooperation of the authentication service In the common implementation, ticket is a SAML assertion containing authentication information that can be shared by multi systems. Request and response protocol of SAML will be bind to other communication and transmission protocol, so in order to support SSO; the bound protocol should accomplish the task of cross-domain request and response together with SAML And another solution is to employ certificate that can be stored at the side of client. So, the better side of using certificate is if user has already been authenticated, he can directly submit his certificate to the UIM of the other security domain. It can be used in Internet Explorer without abundant client side software When federation sets up and the cross-domain identities are appointed, the identity mapping takes place. When one side requests the other side to establish a federation, if accepted, the federation is set up Commonly, the administrator will designate the identities that will do cross-domain operation. If mapping rule exists, the identities will automatically be mapped to a specific identity of the counterpart domain. In our model, the mapping result is stored in LDAP and the main items are username and the security domain where he is from. In another word, we just store the account linking. The detailed implementation will be shown at part 4 Fig. 4 The general architecture of unified user management in federation Identity Assurance D.  SSO \(Single Sign-On\ Support AS1 Based upon the above discussion, we give a general architecture of the federate identity management. The architecture is shown as Fig. 4  Fig. 4 illustrates a cross-domain access in a federation established between security domain A and B. Each domain is managed by a UIM.

B.  Identity Information Model RDB Read<Write SQL/PLSQL Relation Enabled Table.1 Difference between Two Storage Modes Fig. 5 Directory Information Tree LDAP Read>Write LDAP API Hierarchy Not Enabled 3\ Identity Information Synchronization A.  Directory Information Tree Structure Different from the attribute change, the identity information destruction should be spread quickly. So, the destruction certificate should be produced and passed on rapidly to ensure that the identity can access nothing from that moment on IV.  M ODEL 220 S A PPLICATION D ESIGN In this section, we will briefly introduce the model\220s application design, which is already being used in a real identity management system of our laboratory. We will not explain the design concretely, but to show the whole view And the concrete information can be different according to the specific appliance. In the model we select LDAP instead of the relation-based database. The differences of them are listed below Through the comparison of LDAP and RDB, we conclude that the main difference is LDAP, which employs a hierarchical storage mode, is more suitable of the mostly read operation. Considering the reality of an organization, where the users and the structures are rarely changed and the structure is level-based, we employ LDAP in our model will consult the LDAP and then pass the result to the identity assurance service. The assurance service will gives out an assertion and produces a ticket. The identity ticket is handed to both the client and the counterpart security domain. Then UIM of the outer security domain will save the ticket and tell the service system whether the user can access the resource The ticket is hold for the future authorization and access control until the user logout. And if the further information is needed, the UIM of the outer domain will consult the local domain the further information. And the authentication engine of the assurance service is responsible to request the authentication service the requested information. Attribute ticket is produced and passed to the requesting part for further use If the user \(at the client\as already been authenticated at his local domain, which means the client has the ticket of some level of the user, and then the user can hand in the ticket directly to the UIM of the outer domain. If the security level of the ticket matches the authentication, the user is allowed to the accessing. Else, the UIM will request the UIM of the user\220s local domain about the further authentication information using the ticket handed by the user. At the user\220s local domain, the ticket is parsed and further information is added to form a new one. The new ticket is handed to both the user to replace the old and the counterpart UIM for the authentication When the user\220s information is changed by the user himself or by the administrator, the correlating change should be made to the existing certificates. So the iden tity assurance service should announce to the user and the outer domain if the change matters much. Or, the changes will be reflected on the new certificate In order to show more clearly about the identity management function, we will cover the resource of an organization. So, the sub trees of an organization include its departments, people and resource. And one of the organization\220s departments is considered another organization node whose sub trees also include the directly managed users and the department\220s resource. Until the lowest level department is added to the information tree, the tree stops expanding The sub trees of every resource node in the tree are the same: application, Windows and Linux. Under the three types of nodes, three kinds of systems can be added separately. And the systems added, which belong to the parent node of resource are the final leaf nodes What we will emphases in the next phase is the sub tree of people. In all, all the sub nodes of people are the users of the parent node-the organization. There are two types of users including ordinary users and the \215common\216 user. We will concretely talk about the design of the user information model 4\ Identity Information Destruction Storag e Read Write Access Method Storage Type Transaction We design two kinds of users in the model in order to enable cross-domain identity mapping. The \215common\216 user is a visual identity, which is not directly used by a person. It is provided to the outer security domain and the aim is to ensure the identity mapping and make it convenient. Its inner structure is no difference than the ordinary users besides the name of the node is \215common\216, which means it is shared by many security domains. And the \215common\216 user is a must sub node of every people node Now, let us talk about the user information model. As is shown in Table.2 blow, we will not provide the exact attribute of user due to it should comply with the specific appliance The \215special resource\216 field record which systems originally refusing is now open to the user and which systems should be open to the user do not serve the user at the moment. The meaning of the other majority fields is comprehensible; we will mainly talk about the field of \215pseudorandom identifiers

And for the \215common\216 user, the field of \215Is global\216 is 0 and the \215special resource\216 is a big list, while the other fields are blank To show the relationship of the resource, we employ several characters including \215_ 216, \215@\216,\216$\216 and so on. What about the situation of the character exist in the username or the resource name? In order to avoid mistake, we will employ escape character-\215\\\216, which is rarely used. So if the username is \215Jose@phy\216, then we should use \215Jose\\@phy\216 in the String To enable self-service of attribute modifying, only basic information and authentication information can be modified by the user him/herself. All other is managed by the administrator V.  C ONCLUSIONS In this paper, we firstly propose unified identity management model and the identity life cycle management Then based on this, we give a federated identity management model and the detailed cross-domain access procedure, at the same time talk about account linking, identity mapping and identity provision. At last, we design the model\220s application that can be regarded as the example of model\220s application The contribution of this paper is as follows 1 Unified identity management model in different systems 2 Identity life cycle management both in one UIM and in federation 3 Pseudorandom identifi er enabled acco unt linking and identity mapping 4 Identity information directory tree structure design and LDAP user model information structure design However, further study is still needed: expanding the scope of unified identity management model; improving the security mechanism of the model and analyze the implementing details of the directory service.

of technical artifacts The cases shown document an increasing inclination of companies to invest in enterprise architecture management to meet the increasing complexity coupled with the introduction of service oriented architectures Most of these activities are focused on IS architectures by now but the requirement to address artifacts within the broad range of enterprise architecture is clearly visible A complementary study in sho ws the emer gence of suitable structures and processes to govern architecture development and enforcement The inclusion of business departments in enterprise architecture activities is a phenomenon showing a broad range of challenges and is very interesting from a research point of view Beyond technical questions especially service orientation requires the construction of appropriate methodologies to foster a sustainable alignment between business and IS departments As mentioned in the introduction of section III the company data especially the measures employed the repository reports used and project documentation standards illustrated that the measurement and evaluation of service oriented architectures is still in its infancy Therefore we started a research project dedicated to the establishment of a proper SOA and EA government framework which requires reformulating the measurement of structures and processes The measures will be derived from the corporate goal system with special emphasis on agility as laid out in section II The resulting metrics will allow statistical testing within the company Within the joint research project the other companies involved will partially apply the resulting measures and metrics allowing both intraorganizational analysis and the derivation of causal models based on a detailed statistical foundation R

I r Z  Figure 9 A Military Modeling and Simulation Configuration of the Ilium Framework To do that we have assembled a collection of trusted military simulations that span the range of such applications from fine-grained simulations that focus on detailed interactions between two entities to coarse-grained simulations of military campaigns Figure 9 illustrates the Ilium Framework configured to accommodate those simulations as well as representative prototype systems In this case the legacy applications are simulations analysis systems and design tools Prototypes are notional UAV autopilots route planners decision support systems and similar applications The Framework augments these applications with control objects and agents that coordinate computations in the composed system and specialize agents that typically represent the characteristics of a new system or technology that cannot be easily or adequately simulated in any of the component legacy systems In our current study the following systems have Ilium Framework plugins and are used as components in the study environment 12 Al f<cOmmi.ain FIa 1A  


THUNDER is a campaign simulation that models national military forces and military operations that extend over months 30  Characteristics of individual systems are evaluated statistically and their effects on the overall campaign are not explicitly known Political social and cultural objects and concepts are not included in the model In this configuration THUNDER is used to generate force level tasking mission orders and to evaluate and adjust for the results of missions with respect to campaign plans SEAS is a force level simulation that simulates battles between major forces in combat operations that typically last for hours and as much as a day SEAS features a flexible rules based decision logic that can influence behavior at both the commander and individual combatant level SEAS executes the missions requested by THUNDER and provides a manageable dynamic context for examining the behavior of prototypes in a range of typical operational situations  31 A dynamic plug-in supports interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components EADSIM is a trusted model of air defense systems that is in particular sensitive to many important design attributes of individual systems In certain modified forms it can reference advanced sensor and engagement decision models In our study configuration EADSIM simulates enemy air defenses in selected e.g significant to our investigation portions of the virtual battle A dynamic plug-in supports system control as well as interaction with the Framework and other pugged-in components A prototype aircraft mission planning system plug-in supports virtual real time mission plan creation and updates In particular the system provides automatic route planning for selected platforms that have been assigned missions by THUNDER and that are subsequently executed in simulation in SEAS and EADSIM The Ilium Framework itself provides software agents that are used to model notional or experimental UAV characteristics and behaviors Depending on the objectives of a particular study the Framework may also provide agents that address advanced Command and Control concepts to coordinate the interaction of the various component systems We maintain a semantic consistency among the plugged-in component applications by developing a single operational scenario as initial input for a study and deriving the necessary application configuration data from that source We create an RDF model of the scenario based on the Ilium suite of ontologies that includes political context issues objectives sensitivities etc military context centers of gravity campaign objectives etc geophysical environment military units order of battle unit equipment lists etc command and control assets platforms weapons ISR systems etc Figure 11 below is an excerpt from an operational scenario set in the Southwest U.S depicting a description of an Air Force Wing assigned to a notional Joint Task Force The Wing is based at Bishop Air Base and has six Fighter Squadrons assigned to it Additional detail about each of those squadrons as well as the base is found in the model in this case an rdf:resource  associated with it morg:AirForceWing rdf:ID="USAF_366 Air_Exp Wg dc:creator>Doug Holmes</dc:creator mgeo:basedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB geo:positionedAt rdf:resource="#BishopAB_pos morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 390_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_494_Ftr_Sq dc date I 0/20/07</dc date morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF_496 Ftr_Sq rdfs:comment>366 AEW F-22 F-15 KC-135 130]</rdfs:comment morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 389_Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 391 Ftr_Sq morg:assignedOrg rdf:resource="#USAF 495_Ftr_Sq rdfs:label>366 Air Expeditionary Wing</rdfs:label morg:AirForceWing ab9 7P.b ii uI1 L L CFigure 11 An RDF model of a notional USAF Wing Figure 12 is another excerpt from the same scenario illustrating a model of a particular Fighter Squadron and one of the F-15E aircraft it operates Figure 10 Legacy Components in the Ilium Framework 13 suka

aircraft Note that these models also have associated SEAS models that contain information peculiar to the SEAS simulation about these entities This information is used to configure SEAS to properly represent these particular entities We are also able to insert objects and information that may be of interest in our study that is not represented in any of the component simulations or other applications Where those objects are related to an object that is simulated that relationship permits inferences about the effects on them as a result of actions that are computed in a simulation For example it is possible to indicate that GeorgeAB defends the capital city and lend special significance to the actions of aircraft that are based there even though none of the simulations in the composite system have any notion of capital city Finally the operational scenario provides an explicit record of the assumptions that underly the study and can also include and explicit representation of system and study goals This practice improves analysis and may enable future knowledge based analytical tools Throughout the process of constructing the operational scenario and when it is complete we use one or more Description Logic Reasoners to ensure the logical consistency of the the model A number of these automatic theorem provers are freely available including Pellet 32 33 FaCT  34 and OWLIM 35 are used in the Framework to compute logical entailments and to complete RDF models as well as to ensure the consistency of models In the later capacity frequent checks will identify errors in the construction some e.g Pellet also indicate the source of the error and aid in repairing it As a result we are confident that the operational scenario is a sound model The primary use of the Reasoners allows us to significantly extend the explicit RDF model that is created For example a squadron is explicitly specified as assignedTo a wing and that relationship is the inverse of assignedOrg then the system can infer that the wing has the squadron as an assigned organization even though that fact has never been asserted Similarly if the same relationship is defined as a transitive relationship it is possible to infer that a flight that is assigned to the squadron is also assigned to the wing Once we have an operational scenario that has been classified by a Reasoner we then use the completed model to configure the composite system Ilium and the pluggedin systems to execute the simulation We use SPARQL a W3C standard query language designed to access RDFL to extract data from the scenario to create the input files needed to configure the various applications.[36 SELECT name pos long lat alt vis W1HLERE name rdf:type mast SeasLocation name geo:positionedAt pos pos pos:long long pos pos:lat lat pos pos:alt alt name msim:Visible vis  Figure 13 A typical SPARQL query In a similar fashion SPARQL is used to extract data from the scenario to create the necessary Ilium java surrogate control and agents SPARQL can also be used to review the scenario and answer questions that have arisen since the inception of the study At this point we are able execute the scenario with confidence that it will produce reliable results 7 CONCLUSIONS We have developed a methodology and supporting tools for creating an operational scenario that supports the semantic interoperability of an ad hoc collection of legacy applications and extends their capabilities The method depends on and ensures the logical integrity of the composite system Therefore when we assemble as a collection of legacy component systems that were not originally intended to interoperate with other systems we can be confidant that the composite system will produce consistent results Logical consistency implies that to the degree that we trust the interpretation underlying the model the results of operations on the model are trustworthy If for example the model is based on a Newtonian interpretation of physics the model ought to provide reliable answers to questions about automotive and even aeronautical engineering but probably not to all questions in astronomy or cosmology This methodology extends the utility of trusted simulations allowing integration of finegrained simulations that are sensitive to design requirements with high level coarse-grained simulations that are sensitive to acquisition issues and policy The potential benefits of 14 


this sort of interoperation may range from obvious production efficiencies to clearer insights into system requirements Finally an important side-effect of the approach is the OWL/RDF knowledge base formed by the combination of the operational scenario and the results of the operations of the legacy systems That knowledge base and the use of SPARQL queries and SWRL rules effectively expands the functionality of the system and greatly improves the analysis of the output of the system of cooperating simulations and tools We have prepared a foundation for the application of Semantic Web and other knowledge based tools in the analysis and design of unmanned systems We anticipate the development and application of these tools and the addition of autonomy directed Multiple Agent Systems MAS that use RDF/XML inter-agent communications in the coming year REFERENCES 1 NAFCAM 2001 Exploiting EManufacturing:Ineroperability of Software Systems Used by U.S Manufacturers available at 12 Protege Ontology Editor documentation available at http proteae.stanf6rd.edu 13 Top Braid Composer Datasheet available at 14 W and Nicola Guarino 2001 Support for Ontological Analysis of Taxonomic Relationships J Data and Knowled 39\(1 October 2001 15 Natalya F Noy and Deborah L McGuinness Ontology Development 10 1 A Guide to Creating Your First Ontology  Stanford University Stanford CA 94305 16 Alan Rector Modularisation of Domain Ontologies Implemented in Description Logics and related formalisms including OWL K-CAP'03 October 23-25 2003 Sanibel Island Florida USA pp 121-8 2003 17 Cyc Homepage available at htc.c 18 Open Cyc home page available at 19 SUMO Description and Home Page available at 19 SENSUS Description and Home Page available at 2 Bemers-Lee Tim Hendler Jim Lasilla Ora The Semantic Web Scientific American available at 20 DOLCE A Descriptive Ontology for Linguistic and Cognitive Engineering ontology and documents available at 3 Bemers-Lee Tim Blog on Design Issues available at 4 RDF Primer available at s chema/#ref-rdf-primer 5 Lacey Lee OWL Representing Information Using the Web Ontology Language Trafford Publishing 2005 6 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at Jten pHomewPage availal adt 7 Jena Home Page available at 8 Protege Home Page available at h1ttp  protegest nftanford.edu,X 1 9 Baader Calvanese McGuiness Nardi and PatelSchnieder Description Logic Handbook 10 Oberle Daniel Semantic Management of Middleware Springer 2006 OWL Web Ontology Language Guide available at 21 Nicola Gauarino Claudio Masolo Stefano Borgo Aldo Gangemi and Alessandro Oltramari Ontology Infrastructure for the Semantic Web Wonder World Deliverable DI 8 Laboratory for Applied Ontology Trento Italy 2001 available on line at ht X1t1 22 DUL.owl ontology available at www.1oa23t og DLl 23 Amy Knutilla Steven Polyak Craig Schlenoff Austin Tate Shu Chiun Cheah Steven Ray and Richard Anderson Process Specification Language An Analysis of Existing Representations NIST report available at http llwww.mel.nlist.gov/msid.librarZ/d.oc/psl-1 _.df 24 Process Specification Language Ontology available at http-//www,55,me l.nit gov/psl 25 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 owl ontology available at ok i.cae.drexel.edu./-wbs/onltology/2004/09/ogc-gmI1 26 Ontology for Geography Markup Language GML3.0 of Open GIS Consortium OGC Home Page available at 15

 17 Chris Burton received an Associate degree in electronic systems technology from the Community College of the Air force in 1984 and a BS in Electrical Engineering Technology from Northeastern University in 1983.  Prior to coming to the Georgia Institute of Technology \(GTRI\ in 2003, Chris was a BMEWS Radar hardware manager for the US Air Force and at MITRE and Xontech he was responsible for radar performance analysis of PAVE PAWS, BMEWS and PARCS UHF radar systems Chris is an accomplished radar-systems analyst familiar with all hardware and software aspects of missile-tracking radar systems with special expertise related to radar cueing/acquisition/tracking for ballistic missile defense ionospheric effects on UHF radar calibration and track accuracy, radar-to-radar handover, and the effects of enhanced PRF on radar tracking accuracy.  At GTRI, Chris is responsible for detailed analysis of ground-test and flight-test data and can be credited with improving radar calibration, energy management, track management, and atmospheric-effects compensation of Ballistic Missile Defense System radars   Paul D. Burns received his Bachelor of Science and Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering at Auburn University in 1992 and 1995 respectively. His Master\222s thesis research explored the utilization of cyclostationary statistics for performing phased array blind adaptive beamforming From 1995 to 2000 he was employed at Dynetics, Inc where he performed research and analysis in a wide variety of military radar applications, from air-to-air and air-toground pulse Doppler radar to large-scale, high power aperture ground based phased array radar, including in electronic attack and protection measures. Subsequently, he spent 3 years at MagnaCom, Inc, where he engaged in ballistic missile defense system simulation development and system-level studies for the Ground-based Midcourse defense \(GMD\ system. He joined GTRI in 2003, where he has performed target tracking algorithm research for BMD radar and supplied expertise in radar signal and data processing for the Missile Defense Agency and the Navy Integrated Warfare Systems 2.0 office.  Mr. Burns has written a number of papers in spatio-temporal signal processing, sensor registration and target tracking, and is currently pursuing a Ph.D. at the Georgia Institute of Technology  


  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
