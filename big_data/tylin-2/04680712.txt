In this paper, SAMTS 3 will apply OBSS to use the hierarchy of the ontology to calculate the distance between two concepts For classifier, there are many kinds of classification techniques such as k\205Nearest Neighbor \(kNN  c l us t e ri ng  and association rule.

In general those systems consist of the following steps: \(1\ Preprocessing 2\ Constructing a set of centroid-sentences as training data for each topic category, and \(3\ Learning classifier [16  The main roles of preprocessing are \(i\ segmenting requirements into sentences and \(ii\ extracting content word 16 F o r C h in es e  th e  C K I P g r o u p d ev el o p s  th e C h in e s e segmentation system which includes the methods for resolving unknown words [14 i s ve r y u s e fu l   A l t h ou gh   t h e s e  approaches are serviceable, they have lower power for special domain such as medical tourism in this case. For example, the sentence \215  216 which there are four segments \215 context features, which in the simplest form would be words that co-occur in a corpus with The IAs proceed such function as collection of the materials, searching, classifying, dealing with work, etc., the work can let users get the most MTS For inference user\220s requirement semantically, Ora Lassila and James Hendler [1  pr op os e d a a r c h i t e c t ur e of S W  applications based on RDF, with patterns in which one component uses another as a data source \(via SPARQL\ and acts as a data source to yet another component. However, RDF and RDF schema provide properties and syntax not completely to build ontology architecture.

SIM will translate each expert\220s suggestion to be a machine readable matrix and use MTSM, MO, and OWL-S standard to get conception matrix for inference. Second, AMTSIM will combine TF - IDF and LSA, and conception matrix to increase the accuracy.

In addition to the affix-rules, a number of special conditions have to be designed to cover some specific medical tourism.

And In traditional, the semantic web combined UDDI takes a long time to do the hierar-chical queries such as find_business\(\, find_service find_binding\(\, and find_tModel\(\ Therefore, we design the SRA to separate service information of huge quantity in UDDI to the Web Services Cache \(WSC\ in Database Server, in order to save the time for accessing various UDDIRs by complex queries while MBS analyze the user\220s requirements. SRA which is allowed an accelerated loo kup process for finding the best match for users and their requirements is powerful to reduce the UDDI query processes to pro-vide a brilliant performance in the MTS inference.

The SIM is combined specific Medical Tour-ism Stemming Mechanism \(MTSM\, Medical Ontology MO\, and OWL-S standard to inference and translate the original sentences to be machine readable.

In iteration m, therapy m is selected as the test corpus, and the other therapies are collectively used to train the values for each infirmity In this experiment, the feasibility of applying Medical Tourism Stemming Mechanism, Medical Ontology, or Latent Semantic Analysis to MTS requirement classification is evaluated. Table 1 and 2 show classification index in kNN combined with MTSM, MO, or LSA. Consider kNN first; it can be observed that it\220s performances of classification are 50.00%, 75.00%, 50.00%, 41.18%, and 60.00% when the classes are \215Air Bath\216, \215Thermal Spring\216, \215Sulfate Spring\216 215Carbon Dioxide Spring\216, and \215Salt Spring\216. The result shows that kNN algorithm combined MTSM, MO, and LSA to improve accuracy rates. Although, MO does not guarantee the obtained the most adaptable matrix always performs well for the MTS recommendations. For example, when kNN + MTSM MO + LSA are combined, the performance of \215Salt Spring\216 de-clines. In view of macro-average, there is a higher accuracy rate about 73.91% from the best combination of approaches which are kNN + MTSM + MO + LSA. Therefore, we apply kNN with MTSM, MO, and LSA in SAMTS 3  TABLE I C LASSIFICATION INDEXES IN K NN WITH MTSM MO OR LSA class kNN kNN+LSA Thermal Spring 75.00% 75.00 75.00 75.00% 75.00 75.00 Microaverage 55.24% 60.01 62.12 66.59% 72.62 69.54 Macroaverage 50.00% 58.70 67.39 58.70% 69.57 73.91 V CONCLUSION Recently there has a few medical tourism systems developed which mostly focus on location-aware service but no medical tourism service recommendation in Taiwan. In this research, we proposed a Situation-Aware Medical Tourism Service Search System, which provides user\220s requirements inference and relative services search by semantic inference engine and find the most adaptive Medical Tourism Service We discover the accuracy of the MTS inference is higher by combining Medical Tourism Stemming Mechanism, Medical Ontology, Term Frequency \205 Inversed Document Frequency Latent Semantic Analysis, and k-Nearest Neighbor. Mobile users can conveniently obtain customized MTS and decision to get and use those services according to their health requirement in advance by SAMTS 3 In the future, the MO can be modified to store more levels of medical tourism and other domain knowledge. For requirement classification, the similarity is computed by different level of MO to get adaptable medical tourism service from different industries A CKNOWLEDGMENT The research is supported by the National Science Council of Taiwan under the grant No. NSC 96-2416-H-009-008-MY3 R EFERENCES 1 E xec ut i v e Y u an i n R e p u bl i c  of C h i n a T ai w a n   215I nd us t r i a l  M a n p ow e r  Package for Three-year Head-start Project of Taiwan\220s Economic Development Visions for 2015\216, 2006.

  6 acquired by the ERS sensors in the 1995-2002 time interval and continuous GPS measurements relevant to 38 sites. The carried out analysis has shown that the SBAS technique allows to achieve an estimat e of the single displacement measurements with a standard deviation of about 5mm which is comparable with the LOS-projected GPS data accuracy Moreover, the presented resu lts clearly demonstrate the potential of the SBAS-DInSAR technology for monitoring deformation in active seismic ar eas characterized, as for the investigated Los Angeles case, by significant urbanization The possibility to provide space\226time information on the detected deformation at relativ ely low cost and sufficiently high accuracy represents a ke y element for involving the DInSAR technology in rou tine surveillance operations These issues may clearly have a strong relevance in civil protection scenarios because of their impact on deformation-related risk mitigation As additional remark, we underline that the integration of DInSAR and GPS \(and GALILEO soon\easurements is foreseen in future devel opments. Indeed, the former technique allows us to achieve spatially dense measurements but limited to a single component of the detected deformation phenomenon. On the contrary, the GPS \(GALILEO\data are relevant to single points but leads to retrieve temporally dense time series with fully 3D information. The complementariness of the two techniques is evident A convenient possibility is the use of GPS \(GALILEO as \223tie points\224 at the DInSAR phase-unwrapping stage. This renders the procedure overdetermined and appropriate processing techniques may be implemented to improve the accuracy of the solution. Ne w constellation SAR satellites as for the Cosmo-Skymed case [21 will d r astically red u ce the revisiting time, thus allowing statistical analysis to possibly detect systematic errors. In addition, knowledge of the full deformation map, as provided by DInSAR, allows to optimize the GPS \(GALILEO\ocation providing important hints for the development of geological models 3  A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This work has been partially sponsored by the CRdCAMRA, ASI and the \(Italian\We thank ESA which has provided the ERS data of the Los Angeles zone through the WInSAR data archive in collaboration with dr.

departments on average\ignificant differences were found regarding the age of the applications. The variables for the coverage of the products and processes were not included in this test because the overlap was computed using these two variables implying that there is a significant relation between the respective variables\his lends some support to proposition P2.4 stating that involvement of more users leads to greater overlap of applications. The proposition that older applications also exhibit a higher degree of overlap was not supported \(P1.4  A.2. Results from analyzing impacts of AA complexity  Impacts of interdependency-related AA complexity A Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 4\ealed a statistically significant difference in operations cost as well as maintenance cost across the three different interdependency-groups of applications. The more interdependent group \(i.e. applications with 3-7 or with 8 or more interfaces\igher median of operations \(Md=119,000 and 363,000 EUR respectively\ and maintenance costs \(Md=326,000 and 506,000 EUR respectively\ than the less interdependent group \(fewer than 3 interfaces applications \(Md=52,000 EUR operations costs and 64,000 EUR maintenance costs\. This supports the proposition \(P3.1\ that more interdependent applications also incur higher IT \(operations and maintenance\ts  Impacts of diversity-related AA complexity   Regarding OS-related diversity, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 5\howed no significant difference between the operations costs of more \(Md=93,890 n=105\d less diverse applications \(Md=131,540 n=27\09.5, z=-1.174, p=.24. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=166,400; n=121 vs Md=116,900; n =31\782, z=-.43; p=.668 To measure DBMS-related diversity, a MannWhitney U test was conducted \(Table 5\d revealed no significance difference in operations costs of more Md=129,985; n=85\d less diverse applications Md=154,777; n=16\5, z=-.237, p=.813. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=210,500 n=98 vs. Md=245,700; n=19\36, z=-.704 p=.481. Hence, the proposition \(P3.2\ that diversityrelated AA complexity leads to higher IT costs is not supported  Impacts of deviation-related AA complexity   Regarding deviation from the standard OS, a MannWhitney U test \(Table 6\revealed no significant difference between the maintenance costs and operations costs for standard-compliant \(Md=83,581 n=94 for operations cost and Md=148,300; n=113 for maintenance cost\nd non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=38 for operations cost and Md=166,400; n=39 for maintenance cost z=-1.921, p=.055 for operations cost and U=2116 z=-.371, p=.711 for maintenance cost Concerning deviation from the standard DBMS, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 6\ealed a significant difference between maintenance costs for standardcompliant \(Md=373,100; n=59\d non-standardcompliant applications \(Md=170,200; n=58 U=1303, z=-2.231, p=.026. It is remarkable that the non-compliant applications had lower maintenance costs than the compliant applications. The difference between operations costs for compliant Md=109,978; n=51\d non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=50\s not significant, U=1196.5 z=-.533, p=.594 Thus, the proposition \(P3.3\at application that deviate from technology standards incur higher IT costs is not supported. In contrast, for DBMSstandard deviation, we observed significantly lower maintenance cost for non-compliant than for compliant applications  Impacts of overlap/redundancy-related AA complexity a Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 7\ showed significant differences in operations costs across the applications with a low \(less than 34 overlaps Md=90,442; n=37\edium \(35-79 overlaps Md=55,770; n=56\ and high level of overlap/redundancy \(more than 80 overlaps Md=129,985; n=61 6.862, p=.032. It is striking to see that the applications with medium overlaps have a lower median operations cost than those with a low or high-level of overlap, implying a non-linear U-shape relation between overlap and operations cost. Interestingly, the same holds true for maintenance cost. Applications with a low degree of overlap exhibited a median maintenance cost of 96,600 \(n=59\, those with a medium level of overlap incurred a median of 81,300 \(n=58\d highly overlapping applications a median of 248,700 \(n=67 9.791, p=.007.

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
