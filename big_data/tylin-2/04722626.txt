Frequent Patterns of Investment Behaviors in Shanghai Stock Market  Huiyi Tan, H. J. Cai International School of Software Wuhan University, Wuhan, China tan6043@gmail.com Yong Li Information School Estar University, Qingdao China liyong1982617@126.com Abstract  To analyze the behavior of investors in Shanghai stock market, we mine frequent itemsets and association rules from a real securities clearing dataset. The mining results indicate that, most investors do not diversify 
their capital to avert risks according to expected risks of a stock. Further analysis reveals that most of the frequent stocks itemsets only cover a few state-owned big-cap \(SB stocks, and the right side of the association rules, both global and constrained, are mostly SB stocks. All these phenomena make clear a behavioral mode, investors in Shanghai market pursuit SB stocks universally. On the other hand, another group of investors who do not follow the behavior above incline to purchase extremely similar stocks to build their 
portfolios, whether in the same industry, like banking energy, materials, and transportation,  or in the same category, like “special treatment” stocks Keywords- Investment Behavior, Frequent Patterns, Data Mining  I   I NTRODUCTION  In data mining, association rule learning is a popular and well researched method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. PiatetskyShapiro describes analyzing and presenting strong rules discovered in databases using different measures of 
interestingness. Based on the concept of strong rules Agrawa trodu ced as s o ciation ru les  f o r discovering regularities between products in large scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale systems in supermarkets Han et al. \(2001\2 proposed a novel frequent-pattern tree \(FP-tree\ structure, and developed an efficient FP-tree-based mining method, FP-growth which is efficient and scalable for mining both long and short frequent patterns, and is about an order of magnitude faster than the Apriori algorithm Some researchers apply this algorithm to mine the stock trading data to learn frequent patterns of purchasing 
stocks. Wang & He \(2005\3 s c u s s e s t w o pat t e rns i n  data mining: association rules and sequential patterns, and describes the process to find these patterns by mining historical securities trading database. Through the analysis of mining result, their study presents the concept and realization of customer behavior model, and successfully applies the model to advance the performance of Internet securities dealing system These researches do not extract the investment behaviors behind these patterns and ignore their deep significance. In this paper, we focus on discovering the investment behavior in Sha nghai stock market, and apply the algorithm for association rules to a real securities 
clearing dataset. The results are in form of a list of frequent itemsets and association rules, from these results we know more about the investment behavior in Chinese Stock Market This paper is organized into five sections. We introduce the securities clearing data applied in our study and the method of association rules learning in Section 2 In Section 3, we describe the clearing data and explore it Our study results and corresponding analysis are presented in Section 4. Finally, we give out our analysis of the patterns, and conclude the paper in Section 5 II  M ETHODOLOGY  According to the comparability between portfolio and 
shopping basket, we use association rules to look for frequent patterns in the data  A  Frequent Itemsets and Association Rules The following three conceptions are used in this algorithm to analyze investors’ portfolio  Itemset An itemset is a set of items. Each item is an attribute value. In the portfolio example, an itemset contains a set of stocks such, as Microsoft, IBM, and Intel Each itemset has a size, which is the number of items contained in the itemset. The size of itemset { Microsoft IBM, Intel } is 3. Frequent itemsets are those itemsets that are relatively popular in the dataset. The popularity 
threshold for an itemset is defined using support Support Support is used to measure the popularity of an itemset. Support of an itemset {A, B} is made up of the total number of portfolios that contain both Stock A and Stock B Support \({A, B}\ = NumberofTransactions\(A, B 1  Confidence Confidence is a property of an association rule. The confidence of a rule A=>B is

calculated using the support of itemset {A,B} divided by the support of {A}. It is defined as follows  Confidence \(A =>B\ = Support \(A, B\ Support \(A 2  B  Algorithm parameters The process of finding these patterns is accomplished with the help of SQL Server 2005 Analysis Services SSAS\. We use it as our primary data mining tool, due to its complete DM algorithms and decent graphical user interface Association rules algorithm is very sensitive to the algorithm parameter settings. The following is the list of parameters for the Microsoft Association Rules algorithms. We will give a short introduction [4 d th e  parameter settings in our study are shown in Table I TABLE I  P ARAMETER VALUES IN OUR STUDY   Parameter Value Minimu m Suppor t 0.03 Minimu m Confidence 0.4 Maximu m Itemse t Size 3 Minimu m Itemse t Size 2 Maximu m Itemse t Count 200000  Minimum_Support is a threshold parameter. It defines the minimum support requirement items must meet to qualify as a frequent itemset. Its value is within the range of 0 to 1 Minimum_Confidence defines the minimum probability for an association rule. Its value is within the range of 0 to 1 Maximum_Itemset_Size specifies the maximum size of an itemset. The default value is 0, which means that there is no size limit on the itemset. Reducing the maximum itemset size reduces the processing time as the algorithm can save further iterations over the dataset when the candidate itemset size reaches this limit Minimum_Itemset_Size specifies the minimum size of the itemset. The default value is 0. Reducing Minimum Itemset Size will not reduce the processing time because the algorithm has to start with itemset size 1 and increase the size step by step Maximum_Itemset_Count defines the maximum number of itemsets. If not specified, the algorithm generates all itemsets based on Minimum_Support. This parameter avoids generating a large number of itemsets When there are too many itemsets, the algorithm will keep only the top n itemsets based on lift score of itemset III  D ATA  In this study, we use a real clearing data from a Chinese brokerage firm, and all investment accounts in this data are open in Shanghai Stock Exchange \(SSE Securities clearing data contains rich information[5  covering all the security  types — stocks, funds, bonds options, and tremendous accounts information, including daily security alteration, security holdings, capital alteration, opening or closing accounts, as well as every transaction’s stock name, quantity, market value and commission. Our study focuses on the Account Share Holdings\(ASH\which records all account holders every security purchasing and corresponding holdings The dataset contains 110,763 accounts, however, we pay most our attention to those who buy stocks, instead of fund or bonds. There are 106,941 accounts and 247,337 records in the database; every investor holds 2.31 individual stocks on average We explorer the securities clearing data, and calculate the frequency of purchase of every stock, from both the population of shareholders and the total amount of holding shares of every stock. In Table II and Table III the top 10 most purchased stocks are listed. For example stock 601398 is held by 7137 investors out of 55798 occupying 12.8 percent. Over 10% investors buy the first 3 stocks, 601398, 600050, 601988, and each investor, at average, holds 11089, 9668, 8608 shares of them respectively TABLE II  T OP 10 STOCKS BASED ON THE TOP NUMBERS OF SHAREHOLDERS  0005\000D\000Q\000N\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\024\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\025\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\026\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\027\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\030\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\031\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\032\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\033\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\034\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003 000\024\000\023 0006\000W\000R\000F\000N\000\003 000\031\000\023\000\024\000\026\000\034\000\033 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\030\000\023\000\003 000\031\000\023\000\024\000\034\000\033\000\033\000\003 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\024\000\031 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\025\000\033\000\003 000\031\000\023\000\024\000\026\000\025\000\033 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\024\000\023 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\024\000\033\000\003 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\024 000\034 000\031\000\023\000\024\000\034\000\034\000\033\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000R\000I\000\003\000+\000R\000O\000G\000H\000U\000V\000\003 000\032\000\024\000\026\000\032\000\003 000\030\000\034\000\031\000\031\000\003 000\030\000\031\000\024\000\024 000\027\000\027\000\033\000\023 000\026\000\034\000\027\000\033 000\026\000\024\000\030\000\034 000\025\000\034\000\034\000\030\000\003 000\025\000\030\000\034\000\027\000\003 000\025\000\027\000\033\000\023 000\025\000\026\000\031\000\026 TABLE III  T OP 10 STOCKS BASED ON THE TOP NUMBERS OF HOLDING SHARES  0005\000D\000Q\000N\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\024\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\025\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\026\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\027\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\030\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\031\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\032\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\033\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003\000\034\000\003 0001\000R\000\021\000\003 000\024\000\023 0006\000W\000R\000F\000N\000\003 000\031\000\023\000\024\000\026\000\034\000\033\000\003 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\030\000\023\000\003 000\031\000\023\000\024\000\034\000\033\000\033 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\024\000\031 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\032\000\025\000\031 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\026\000\031 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\024\000\034\000\003 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\023\000\025\000\033\000\003 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\030\000\024 000\033 000\031\000\023\000\023\000\034\000\023\000\023

  IV  R ESULTS  After the results of data mining are acquired, we display the frequent intemsets in Table IV and the association rules in Table V In Table IV, the first 10 frequent itemsets are listed ordered by their frequency, which can be read from the column “No. of Cases”. Every frequent itemset represents a portfolio, and the size of it equals the size of an itemset, it is 2 in Table IV The rates of return of a portfolio, shown in the column rate of return”, are the relative yield, which equals the real yield minus the fluctuation of SSE Composite Index, where the real yield is the weighted average of the portfolio with the number of shares of either stock as its weight, and the time spans of 30 days and 180 days are, representatively, from 07/02/2007 to 07/31/2007 and from 07/02/2007 to 12/28/2007 TABLE IV  F REQUENT I TEMSETS AND CORRESPONDING RATES OF RETURN                    The observation of these portfolios reveals that, among the first 10 frequent portfolios, there is only one of them 600016, 601398\hich successfully averts nonsystemic risk. It closely follows the fluctuations of the SSE Composite Index. The other nine portfolios, on the contrary, intensify the fluctuation instead of diminishing it This phenomenon contradicts the hypothesis of Markowitz’s mean-variance criterion that investors averts risks, at least in China   Figure 1  Top 20 stocks concentrate in four industries Furthermore, the first 10 frequent portfolios only cover seven individual stocks, all of which are SB stocks. Each of these stocks is commonly regarded as a blue chip stock a stock of a well-established company having stable earnings and no extensive liabilities. Accurately, these corporations are oligopoly enterprises in their industries and super big-cap stocks with a market capitalization value of more than 10 billion Meanwhile five of them belong to banking industry and top 20 stocks based on the top purchases are merely in four industries: banking, material, energy transportation. Because in China these industries are stateowned monopoly industries and are protected by governments with competence, therefore their profits are ensured The same phenomenon is found in the association rules as shown in Table V To express simply and clearly, we explain the meaning of the formula, “Stock A -> Stock B means that those who purchase Stock A are likely to purchase Stock B with the possibility of confidence and we say Stock B is the frequent partner \(FP\tock of Stock A. For instance, in Table V, stock 601328 is the FP stock of the union of 601919 and 601988 These ten rules contain eight stocks, seven of which are SB stocks, while 601318, the only exception, is of a non-state-owned financial company. That is to say, the FP stock of  an union of two SB stocks is still a SB stock In addition, there is a whole class of stocks on China's stock market called "special treatment stocks". Special Treatment \(ST\ stocks are shares in companies that have failed to earn profits for two years or have been fingered for false accounting. Apparently,  this kind of stocks are highly possible to fluctuate incredibly and bring investors especially retail investors, huge risks. We discovered some association rules which concerned with ST stocks and exhibit the first 10 in Table VI. At the right side of the rules are the most possible purchased stocks for those who purchase ST stocks, however, most of them are super SB stocks. Among all the 29 ST stocks, shown in Table

The portfolio is composed of Stock 601318 and 601628, Ping An of China and China Life Insurance Group, which are the two biggest insurance company in China. Among the 29 ST stocks, as mentioned above, there are four stocks whose FP stocks are not SB stocks, they are “600847 -> 600715”, “600076 600868”, “600695 -> 600108”, “600090 -> 600197 the first two pairs both are composed of ST stocks, and the two stocks in the third pairs are both in agriculture industry, and that of the last one are in Wine Industry and located in Xinjiang. In a word, some investors buy extremely similar stocks V  C ONCLUSION  In this paper, we seek the patterns about how a portfolio is built, and use these patterns to learn more about investors’ investment behavior to deepen our understanding to behavioral finance and financial market The association rules algorithm is applied to a real securities clearing dataset, and a group of association rules and frequent itemsets are obtained. The results disprove the hypothesis of Markowitz’s mean-variance criterion that investors avert risks, and the further analysis discovers two behavior, that most investors in SSE incline to build their portfolios with state-owned super-big-cap stock\(s\, and a certain proportion of investors buy highly similar stocks that are in the same industries, like banking energy, materials, and transportation, or in the same category like ST stocks R EFERENCES   1  R.

 National Identity Register part of scenarios If you choose to have an ID card, your biometric identification, along with information like your name, date and place of birth, current and all previous addresses and driving licence number and expiry date \(along with other relevant information\ would be stored in a centralized government database. This database would be held securely by the Government, and could be queried by all other government departments, the police, public service providers \(e.g. NHS\ and approved private sector organizations \(e.g. banks employers   When participants accessed the front page of the study \(which contained basic information and contact details about the researchers\ey were randomly directed to one of the three different scenarios. Thus each participant only responded to a single scenario  Following the scenario, participants were asked If this were the way in which ID cards were to be introduced, what would your attitude towards identity cards in the UK be and How certain are you about your attitude towards ID cards if this scenario were the one introduced using the same scales for the prescenario measures. A measure of attitude shift was calculated by subtracting the scenario attitude score from the pre-scenario attitude, such that a negative score meant a shift against ID cards, and a positive score, a shift in favor of ID cards. Participants were also asked In this scenario, to what extent would you consider yourself to have been forced to comply to receive an identity card This question was answered using a 7-point scale anchored at Not at all forced  and Very forced   On the final page of the study, participants completed a short measure to test their privacy attitudes eir tru s t in  the UK Gov e r n m e n t t h r ee  questions, see below\ and the perceived threat to their privacy of the ID Card proposals \(two questions, see below  3.3 Trust in the UK Government   Participants completed three questions The United Kingdom Government can be trusted  The United Kingdom Government is competent enough to create a secure Identity Card system and The United Kingdom Government is motivated by the desire to protect its citizen's best interests using a 4 point scale anchored at Strongly Agree  Somewhat Agree  Somewhat Disagree and Strongly Disagree No neutral option was provided to reduce satisficing These items cover three dimensions often associated with the measurement of trust: general trust competence and benevolence. The trust scale had an alpha of .82, showing acceptable internal reliability  3.4 Perceived Privacy Threat of ID Cards   Participants also completed two items designed to measure the perceived privacy threat of ID cards The introduction of Identity Cards in the UK is a threat to people's personal privacy and Data collected as part of the Identity Card system would be treated confidentially Reversed\sing the same 4-point Likert scale for Trust. The perceived privacy items had an alpha of .60, showing low but acceptable internal reliability for a two item scale  As would be expected, the privacy and trust scales were correlated \(r = .71, p<.001\onfirmatory factor analysis using principal axis factoring with a forced two factor solution and Oblimin rotation supported the creation of two scales  4. Results and Discussion   A manipulation check was conducted to see if the level of perceived compulsion differed across scenarios. There was a main effect of scenario on perceived compulsion F 2, 390\31.2 p 000 Post hoc Scheffe tests confirmed that the UKG implementation led to higher perceived compulsion scores \(Mean = 5.99\pared to the Lords  amendment version \(Mean = 4.56 p 001\d the LSE version \(Mean = 4.01 p 001\he Lords and LSE scenarios did not differ significantly in their level of perceived compulsion p 25  4.1 Politics and OU groups general attitudes   The initial attitudes of the politics and student groups differed significantly in both their attitudes towards ID Cards, the certainty with which they held those attitudes, their trust in the UK Government, the perceived privacy violation posed by ID Card proposals, and their general privacy concerns \(see Table 1  Participants in the politics groups were more antiID Cards, held these attitudes with greater certainty distrusted the government more, perceived ID cards as a greater threat to privacy, and had greater general privacy concerns. However, even amongst OU students, who on average were in favor of ID cards levels of distrust in the UK Government and the perceived privacy threat of ID cards were still relatively high Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5

Trust in Government, privacy attitudes and ID Cards   As noted earlier, the two groups of participants had differing attitudes towards the Government, ID cards and general levels of privacy concern. A linear multiple regression was calculated in order to examine the impact of the perceived privacy threat of ID cards general privacy concerns and  levels of trust in the government on respondents post-scenario attitudes. A regression was first calculated to examine the impact of age, gender and source \(politics groups vs. students on post-scenario attitudes. Age and gender were not significant, but source did significantly predict postscenario attitudes  40, p<.001\. As such, the source of the participants \(political groups vs students\nd their pre-scenario attitudes were entered into the regression equatio n as control variables. The results of the analyses are shown in Table 2  Table 2: Multiple regression: Dependent variable: Post-scenario attitude toward ID Cards \(R 2 75, p<.000  Variable  t p Politics vs. Students 01 18 86 Pre-scenario attitudes 51 10.69 00 Pre-scenario attitude certainty 06 2.20 .03 Presented scenario 02 69 49 Perceived compulsion in scenario 14 -4.10 .00 Distrust in Government 11 2.67 01 Perceived privacy threat of ID cards 26 -5.65 .00 Mean Westin Score 01 32 75   As might be expected, participants attitudes towards Identity Cards, and the certainty with which they held those attitudes, predicted their attitudes postscenario.

towards ID Cards was the perceived privacy threat of the ID Card proposals, followed by the perceived degree of compulsion involved in ID Cards. As reported earlier, the UKG approach was seen as involving the highest amount of compulsion, although given that scenario type was not significant, we should also assume an affective component to this evaluation alongside the content of the scenarios. Third, the level of distrust in the UKG also predicted post-scenario attitudes to ID Cards, such that higher levels of distrust led to more negative attitudes. Finally, the certainty with which pre-scenario attitudes were held also predicted post-scenario attitudes if pre-scenario attitudes were less certain, this led to more negative attitudes after the scenario was presented  The results of the regression strongly suggest that privacy concerns associated with ID Cards, distrust of Government and perceived compulsion of the implementation, significantly predict people s attitudes towards ID Cards. These results are in keeping with considerable research within the Human-Computer Interaction and e-commerce fields that have highlighted the importance of trust in people s response to privacy threats. That perceived compulsion was also a significant predictor, while scenario type was not, strongly suggests an affective element to control as best expressed by the LSE scenario  4.4: Privacy, Trust and Attitudes to ID Cards   The mediation of perceived privacy threat by trust on attitudes towards Identity Cards was tested using a series of regression equations     Figure 3: Privacy Trust mediation \(*** = p<.001   The direct effect \(standardized estimate perceived privacy threat on attitudes was -.78 \(p<.001 when tested alone, and -.61 \(p<.001\hen tested alongside distrust.

The interaction between privacy and trust was significant  F 1, 386\6.60 p 0.00\. The pattern of this interaction is illustrated in Figure 5  The interaction suggests that for those who considered Identity Cards to be a threat to their privacy, level of trust in the Government had little impact on their attitudes. However, for those who were more ambivalent about the privacy threat of ID Cards  Perceived privacy threat Distrust in Government R 2 51 Post-scenario ID Card attitudes R 2 64 61 24 71 Perceived privacy threat Distrust in Government Post-scenario Identity Card attitudes 59 53 65 Privacy X Distrust composite 96 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7 


the level of trust was critical in determining their attitudes.

General Discussion   According to the UK Information Commissioner the United Kingdom faces the prospect of sleepwalking into a surveillance society  ter m s  of e-government, citizen privacy concerns pose a substantial obstacle towards the implementation of data sharing, identity management schemes and verifiable authentication [7, 15, 38, 39  T h e resu lts of the  present study provide a number of important and novel insights into people s privacy concerns and their attitudes towards the implementation of Identity Cards in the UK. First, although the different methods of implementation did not differ significantly in terms of attitude change, they did have an impact on citizens  perceived compulsion. This suggests that issues of control and compulsion have an affective component as well as one as outlined in systems design. This is important since the affective component is likely to be influenced by people s sense of control and compulsion, rather than their actual level of control Successful e-government initiatives should seek to not only provide control to citizens, but should also make them feel in control  The relationship between the perceived privacy threat of ID cards and opposition to them was strong suggesting that e-government initiatives that collect data on citizens may encounter considerable opposition if the data collection is perceived as impinging on personal privacy. This was supported by both the regression analyses and the ANOVA. When there was a high perceived privacy threat, levels of trust did not moderate attitudes towards ID Cards. Only when the perceived privacy threat was felt less keenly by participants did trust impact on their attitudes towards ID Cards  This finding is important since we usually assume that privacy fundamentalists will generally oppose any e-government system that poses a privacy threat and the privacy unconcerned perhaps won t worry regardless e v e r privacy pragmatists are likely to judge a particular system in light of not only its costs and benefits, but also in relation to the potential data collector. The evidence in favour of moderation suggests that combining privacy threat with low levels of trust creates a particular impetus towards opposition something that may swing pragmatists towards opposition   5.1 Implications for e-government   As noted, once e-government systems are developed beyond information portals, there is an increased need for the collection of personal information, data sharing between departments and databases, and authentication of individuals and their entitlements. There are a number of methods available to develop e-government in a privacy friendly way e.g. through trusted third parties or identity management systems\. The results of the present research strongly suggest that the developers of egovernment ignore issues of privacy at their peril. In particular, trust would seem to be the keystone in terms of building e-government systems that request or reuse personal information. This trust can take the form of competence \(e.g. in the development of systems or the protection of personal information\, or in the integrity of the Government itself. However, the absence of trust is likely to render even privacyfriendly e-government initiatives unsuccessful  5.2 Implications for privacy and trust research   Privacy has been described as a concept in disarray  40 In part this is due to one of the strengths of the research area its multi-disciplinary nature but also because privacy can refer to so many different contexts and meanings 28 The research presented here strongly suggests that the interaction between privacy concern and trust is critical to understanding people s responses to a potential privacy threat Specifically, the creation and testing of the multiplicative composite provided strong evidence that the combination of low trust with privacy threat leads to a stronger reaction than would be expected by examining just privacy and trust independently  Theoretically, there are good reasons to assume that the combination of low trust with privacy threat poses a unique threat to peoples acceptance of a Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


technology. For inst des cribes a self boundary the boundary  around the person modified by the disclosure of personal information and a dyadic boundary that ensures the disclosers safety from leakage of information to uninvited third parties. The self boundary may be open or closed depending on such interpersonal factors as the level of trust in a disclosure target  In the present research, the combination of privacy concerns and low trust may have replicated a situation in which the self boundary is open \(i.e. information is recognized as at risk\he impermeability of the dyadic boundary is open to question \(i.e. information may be leaked to a third party or misused analysis suggests the possible benefits of applying insights from interpersonal interaction to the interactions between citizens and governments … if, as suggested by some, we are moving towards an era of personalized e-government then t h ere a r e clear  privacy implications [14, 45 ide t h e need to  consider issues of trust in terms of citizen-state interactions [11    5.3 Limitations and future research   In the present research, a single aspect  identification and authentication - of citizens relations with the state were studied. The case of ID Cards poses a number of issues in terms of generalizability that will need to be tested. First, the potential costs and benefits of ID cards in the UK are hotly contested, suggesting that not all respondents conceptions of the scenarios were similar. The importance of each individual s own interpretation was seen in the non-significance of the compulsion scenarios, and the importance of perceived compulsion, on attitudes towards ID Cards. Given that at the time of the research the legislation was being discussed in depth in the UK media, perhaps it is not surprising that people came to the study with preexisting attitudes that were stronger than the manipulated scenarios  6.
