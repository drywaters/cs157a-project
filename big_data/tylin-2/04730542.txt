Introduction Usability test is used to improve the usability of product in design process The value of usability test is that the problems of tested product or service can be found early and improving advice can be given before the final decision of the product 
can help the developers improve their products entirely with small investment so it can save the developing cost[1 Now the mainly usability test method is providing certain operation scenes and setting a series of tasks aimed at target users that the users 
It 
need to accomplish The operation scenes and tasks are highly related to the tested products or services Through observation the testers can find the problems occurred during the mutual process of human and machine They can also find function and operation fashion that users like or dislike and why The testers can provide improving advice based on their observation and analysis Establishing implicit data user behavior lib is a development direction of usability test and is very different from current usability test procedure The main idea is establishing an all-sided user behavior lib 
at the very beginning of design process and complementing 978-1-4244-3291-2/08/$25.00 2512008 IEEE data of this lib during the developing process Whenever there is some problem occurred during the developing process the developers can check the original data of the lib to get some direct or indirect support for their design Different from explicit feedback acquiring implicit feedback will not interrupt user's mutual operation and user need not to pay additional cost Implicit feedback can be acquired easily and can be used large-scale and long-term acquiring 
provides important guarantee of 
It 
the accuracy and reality of usability test This paper will acquire implicit feedback characters of user operation behavior aimed at focus function of certain product The method implicit mining of user behavior was prompted through investigation of the relations between these characters and usability principles 
included the following research problems I which implicit feedback characters were related to usability test according to focus function 2 how to get the main characters of usability implicit mining pattern from implicit feedback characters and summarize the optimal procedure system of 
It 
implicit mining of user behavior in usability research domain using 2 Establishment of users behavior lib by implicit mining Implicit data mining of user behavior IMUB is collection of a large amount of mutual data without users awareness 
can provide the designers users experience of using the product Narrow IMUB is the data mining procedure aimed at target users 
forms a user behavior lib of target users through data acquiring data mining and data display Through the conformity of target users 
It It 
by IMUB a user behavior lib that is very close to real users experience can be established see Figure.I Though the research of typical model in the behavior lib and compare with the initial ideal users the problems of user experience of the product can be validated and the first-hand improving advise can be acquired More closer the target user model in final users behavior lib is to the initial ideal user model the better the usability of whole design is So IMUB can be an evaluation method of user experience 157 


From Fig.1 we can see IMUB can be divided into three steps data acquiring data mining and data display The emphasis of each step detail of the procedure and method can be different according to different project From the point of data mining the three steps are necessary During the determining of acquiring points of user behavior testing points of some behaviors can be settled by experts experience The determination of these testing points is based the general knowledge of the behavior showed in table I and table 2 3 Complement and modification of User\255 Center Design UCD of IMUB liming Target User Ideal User 158 Usability means the product is effectiveness learnability efficiency memorability error tolerance and satisfaction to users It means whether the user can accomplish his task with the product what is his efficiency and whether he feels satisfied or not Here we investigated two focus functions and established implicit behavior mining point of usability test according to evaluation usability principles A.The switch of application windows between main screen and secondary screen The secondary screen is used to display some information that the users do not want to display on main screen and protect their privacy Implement scheme hide window on main screen7display the window come from the main screen on secondary screen7user make a pushing upward gesture on secondary screen and the window come back to main screen B.Timing update of information on secondary screen cut from main screen The secondary screen is a temporary display device It displays and updates the information users need to concern in real time Implement scheme select part area users want to display in main screen frame7display the selected area on secondary screen 7 update the information of secondary screen automatically 7 user make a pushing upward gesture on secondary screen and the window come back to main screen PnnclpleofUublllty User Experience of Fows Function 0  lliring The technique of data mining is necessary base during the procedure of IMUB Usability principle of user experience is key to framing implicit mining project of user behavior theoretically This can be validated from three facets First to transfer ideal user into target user usability principle and focus function of user experience will be used to filter users and even the setting of every target point the meaning of indicators used to guide data acquiring and the design and development of the third party so ftware Second at the stage of data prepare some core data direction principles concerned by the designers mostly can be formulated according to the design procedure of usability and the current situation of the whole project They can be used to regulate data integration data selection and data pretreatment and even form the core treatment guidelines in data prepare stage For example during data acquiring of system construction alternation data prepare guidelines as common attention are D rn.p!IY talk etc they can also validate whether user behavior implicit acquired are common or not 4 Example of implicit user behavior lib 4.2 Acquiring points signing of implicit users behavior lib 4.1 Filtering of focus functions and interactive design follow I focus of functions 2 curve of typical behaviors 3 time point of iteration 4 amount of resource consuming These factors are related to each other and indivisible They form the principles of critical data acquiring[2 Third the implicit data mining process of IMUB can be seen as implicit user behavior mining process based on usability design The guideline of each step should obey the idea of User-Center Design during DM data mining procedure The summary report can recover the mutual process between user and system maximally with accomplishment of mining process But in actual instance the potential influence factors of user behavioral decision are very complex such as environment factor sensibility factor and psychology factor and there must be some factors that IMUB cannot acquire So the common mainstream user test method would be used in the final stage of the procedure to accomplish the final usability report such as questionnaire focus group discussions and one to one Dati Acq After establishing a procedure construction of implicit mining user behavior lib a real project is needed to validate its correction and application The IMUB procedure adopted by Project Sideshow a method switching the mutual focus between main screen and secondary screen of notebook computer included the following stages prototype design stage prepare of data acquiring stage data mining and display stage and UCD complement stage Figure 1 A simple procedure of establishing IMUB lib IMUB

Figure 2 presents the results with non-significant path as a dotted line and the standardized path coefficients between the proposed constructs Hypothesis 1 to 8 but Hypothesis 9 was supported and statistically significant at different confident level Users satisfaction was significantly influenced by the proposed quality dimensions. The path coefficients from the quality factors all together explained approximately 33% of variance in the observed variance in satisfaction. Thus, Hypotheses 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were supported. Moreover, users behavioral intention to use 3G service was significantly influenced by satisfaction and trust. The path coefficients of satisfaction and trust accounted for approximately 22 of observed variance in behavioral intention to use 3G service. Thus, Hypotheses 7 and 8 were supported Note that Hypothesis 9 did not receive any significant statistical support Consistent with our expectations, the modified TAM fits well by the path coefficient of 0.49.

We rely on the bootstrap re-sampling method by setting the number of bootstraps equal to 1000 times and the confidence interval set at 95 The results are listed in the following table  Table 7 Effects on behavioral intention to use 3G service  Construct Direct effects Indirect effects Total effects Satisfaction 0.23 0.04 0.27  5. Discussion and implication  Motivated by the need to understand the formation of satisfaction, we conducted an online survey to empirically investigate proposed factors affecting user satisfaction of using 3G service with wireless handheld devices.  One of the main contributions was that we found that factors of interactivity, responsiveness customization, usefulness and ease-of-use significantly affected the satisfaction. While testing the variables of trust and satisfaction that influence behavioral intention to use 3G service, another contribution was to realize satisfaction having an existing casual relationship between trust and behavioral intention Most importantly, satisfaction was validated as the antecedent of behavioral intention to use 3G service Although satisfaction was shown to influence behavioral intention to use 3G service, satisfaction also exerts its influential power indirectly through the mediating variable, trust, impacting on a higher behavioral intention. Practically, this result implies that building a trust relationship between users and network operators may be as important as finding ways to improve users satisfaction. Moreover, trust was shown to be an important research issue in mobile commerce Previous research showed that trust building in mobile commerce can be enhanced through the factors of users perceptions of service quality such as site quality, business competence and security issues that arise from conducting business activi r model lent support to this trust building concept However, trust, in our observations, did not influence behavioral intention to use 3G service. This may be due to the reason that indirect experiences \(ex. wordof-mouth\were not treated as good way to determine the intention to use 3G service Several implications for market practitioners are raised. At first, understanding how satisfaction is built and improved is important for 3G operators because higher satisfaction with service provided may result in a greater customer base. Secondly, service quality factors such as interactivity, customization and responsiveness play keys to improve the satisfaction towards the use of 3G service. Thus, 3G operators should provide an interactive and customized mobile online environment for users especially for their first time use. Thirdly, service feedback is attention demanding. Users need the readily response from 3G service providers when they encounter usage problems A major practical implication of this study lies with verifying ease-of-use and usefulness to be another two important factors affecting users satisfaction. This finding implies that mobile software must be based on users needs. Interface design and the constraints of mobile devices are especially of great importance Furthermore, higher satisfaction refers to the attitude change, which may lead to the behavioral intention to Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


use the service.  Thus, operators should concern more on the obstacles or barriers that may distract or degenerate users attitude towards the satisfaction level Lastly, satisfaction for the behavioral intention to use the service through trust has significant impact. Thus 3G service operators should concern on providing a trustable service that does exert a persuasive influence The implication for research suggests that an examination of proposed service quality measurement may provide insights into the causality relationship with satisfaction. This would be the case for explaining why the combined quality factors have statistically significant effect on satisfaction and behavioral use decisions One of limitations of this study lies with the source of the data. The statistically significant result of satisfaction s impact on behavioral intention to use 3G service may not be applicable to 3G service providers in other countries. Another limitation would be that we might have omitted other as important factors as ones that affect service satisfaction in this study. Thus, the proposed satisfaction measurement may not possess the sole right to reflect satisfaction For the future work, we may pay attention to improve R-square. This can be done by exploring and investigating hedonic factors. Factors that can improve the quality of service can be seen as hedonic such as mobile connectivity and mobile enjoyment. Besides, it is interesting to investigate cognitive factors. Factors of cognition refer to the mental process of viewing the service such as expectancy of satisfaction confirmation Furthermore, a slightly modified version of TAM was included in our framework. Despite being an important indicator of satisfaction, extensive research has shown the consequences induced by TAM. Thus, it remains interesting to investigate the antecedents of usefulness and ease-of-use in 3G service context. Future researchers may investigate very specific quality of 3G service and their impacts on usefulness and ease-of-use so as to complement the fundamentals in 3G research issues  6. Conclusion  Acceptance of 3G service is crucial for the growth of mobile commerce. This paper sheds light on the aspect of satisfaction that acts as a fundamental to influence the 3G service acceptance, thus suggesting service users be equally important to the business operation compared to the 3G technology integration. Although communication technology facilitates the transaction activities, to 3G service providers, a well-designed service plan to accommodate users need cannot be absent, which will be especially useful for the first time users as it affects their further service subscription After a satisfactory initial use, it becomes easy for service providers to promote further business service in mobile commerce In Taiwan, the mobile commerce is open to business opportunities for service providers. As more users subscribe the service and enter the market, the demand for the mobile service will continue to grow and take off. How to retain old users, attract new users and comfort existing users become important issues especially brand switching is a common practice in Taiwan. The results of this study suggest that by focusing and improving the service quality s factors service providers can achieve a better service satisfaction. In turn, higher satisfaction may help service providers either retain the old customers or attract new service subscribers  7.

departments on average\ignificant differences were found regarding the age of the applications. The variables for the coverage of the products and processes were not included in this test because the overlap was computed using these two variables implying that there is a significant relation between the respective variables\his lends some support to proposition P2.4 stating that involvement of more users leads to greater overlap of applications. The proposition that older applications also exhibit a higher degree of overlap was not supported \(P1.4  A.2. Results from analyzing impacts of AA complexity  Impacts of interdependency-related AA complexity A Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 4\ealed a statistically significant difference in operations cost as well as maintenance cost across the three different interdependency-groups of applications. The more interdependent group \(i.e. applications with 3-7 or with 8 or more interfaces\igher median of operations \(Md=119,000 and 363,000 EUR respectively\ and maintenance costs \(Md=326,000 and 506,000 EUR respectively\ than the less interdependent group \(fewer than 3 interfaces applications \(Md=52,000 EUR operations costs and 64,000 EUR maintenance costs\. This supports the proposition \(P3.1\ that more interdependent applications also incur higher IT \(operations and maintenance\ts  Impacts of diversity-related AA complexity   Regarding OS-related diversity, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 5\howed no significant difference between the operations costs of more \(Md=93,890 n=105\d less diverse applications \(Md=131,540 n=27\09.5, z=-1.174, p=.24. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=166,400; n=121 vs Md=116,900; n =31\782, z=-.43; p=.668 To measure DBMS-related diversity, a MannWhitney U test was conducted \(Table 5\d revealed no significance difference in operations costs of more Md=129,985; n=85\d less diverse applications Md=154,777; n=16\5, z=-.237, p=.813. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=210,500 n=98 vs. Md=245,700; n=19\36, z=-.704 p=.481. Hence, the proposition \(P3.2\ that diversityrelated AA complexity leads to higher IT costs is not supported  Impacts of deviation-related AA complexity   Regarding deviation from the standard OS, a MannWhitney U test \(Table 6\revealed no significant difference between the maintenance costs and operations costs for standard-compliant \(Md=83,581 n=94 for operations cost and Md=148,300; n=113 for maintenance cost\nd non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=38 for operations cost and Md=166,400; n=39 for maintenance cost z=-1.921, p=.055 for operations cost and U=2116 z=-.371, p=.711 for maintenance cost Concerning deviation from the standard DBMS, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 6\ealed a significant difference between maintenance costs for standardcompliant \(Md=373,100; n=59\d non-standardcompliant applications \(Md=170,200; n=58 U=1303, z=-2.231, p=.026. It is remarkable that the non-compliant applications had lower maintenance costs than the compliant applications. The difference between operations costs for compliant Md=109,978; n=51\d non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=50\s not significant, U=1196.5 z=-.533, p=.594 Thus, the proposition \(P3.3\at application that deviate from technology standards incur higher IT costs is not supported. In contrast, for DBMSstandard deviation, we observed significantly lower maintenance cost for non-compliant than for compliant applications  Impacts of overlap/redundancy-related AA complexity a Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 7\ showed significant differences in operations costs across the applications with a low \(less than 34 overlaps Md=90,442; n=37\edium \(35-79 overlaps Md=55,770; n=56\ and high level of overlap/redundancy \(more than 80 overlaps Md=129,985; n=61 6.862, p=.032. It is striking to see that the applications with medium overlaps have a lower median operations cost than those with a low or high-level of overlap, implying a non-linear U-shape relation between overlap and operations cost. Interestingly, the same holds true for maintenance cost. Applications with a low degree of overlap exhibited a median maintenance cost of 96,600 \(n=59\, those with a medium level of overlap incurred a median of 81,300 \(n=58\d highly overlapping applications a median of 248,700 \(n=67 9.791, p=.007. Hence, the proposition \(P3.4\at applications with a greater degree of overlap also exhibit higher IT costs is not supported  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 12

[On http://www.bipm.org/en/si/base_units   B IOGRAPHY  Author, Karl Strauss, has been employed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for over 22 years.  He has been in the Avionics Section from day One.  He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
