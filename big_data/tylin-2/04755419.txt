Cyber Security Risks Assessment with Bayesian Defense Graphs and Architectural Models   Teodor Sommestad Royal Institute of Technology teodors@ics.kth.se   Mathias Ekstedt Royal Institute of Technology mek101@ics.kth.se   Pontus Johnson Royal Institute of Technology pj101@ics.kth.se  Abstract To facilitate rational decision making regarding 
cyber security investments, decision makers need to be able to assess expected losses before and after potential investments. This paper presents a model based assessment framework for analyzing the cyber security provided by different architectural scenarios The framework uses the Bayesian statistics based Extended Influence Diagrams to express attack graphs and related countermeasures. In this paper it is demonstrated how this structure can be captured in an abstract model to support analysis based on architectural models. The approach allows calculating the probability that attacks will succeed and the expected loss of these gi ven the instantiated architectural scenario. Moreover, the framework can 
handle the uncertainties that are accompanied to the analyses. In architectural analysis there are uncertainties acquainted both to the scenario and its properties, as well as to the analysis framework that stipulates how security c ountermeasures contribute to cyber security 1  Introduction The capability to assess the current cyber security posture as well as the cyber security posture after potential security investments is vital for efficient security management. For decision makers that deal with security investments, knowledge of the expected consequence of attacks prior and after a cyber 
investment is something that enables rational decision making  When assessing these numbers the decision maker is faced with a great deal of uncertainty. Firstly, there is an uncertainty in how the cyber security mechanisms influence each other and how, or if, they contribute to security of a system as a whole. As stated in ere  is today no algebra on perimeter security. Secondly there is an issue regarding the accuracy of information on which the assessment is based upon. As soon as 
enterprises become moderate in size, the number of security mechanisms and issues becomes very large highly diverse, and interconnected in complex manners. Information and indicators collected for security assessments are thus inevitably never fully credible, nor comp Still h o w e v e r, th e c y ber security decision maker needs to make choices that are rational from a holistic point of view This paper describes a framework for assessing the security of information systems while taking both these types of uncertainty into consideration. The framework 
bases its analyses on system architecture models Software, system, and enterprise architecture is commonly proposed as tool for managing system complexities on a high level, holistic, level of abstraction. Unfortunately many architecture languages and frameworks fail to explain how different kinds of analysis should be performed on an architecture model This paper describes an information system analysis framework that is well equipped for dealing with uncertainty can be merged with architecture metamodels by using a concept we call Abstract 
models The structure of this paper is as follows. In section two and three related work is described. This includes a description and an example of how extended influence diagrams can be used to model defense graphs. Section four describes abstract models and how these can be used to capture the type of defense graph that was presented in section three. Section five presents an example of how this abstract model can be instantiated into a concrete model and how it thereby facilitates security assessment. Finally, in section six 
and seven, some topics are discussed and conclusions are drawn 2  Attack graphs and defense graphs A great number of metrics have been proposed to capture the security of information technology Typically those metrics start analyzing the information system from an external perspective by considering Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3 2009 U.S. Government Work Not Protected by U.S. Copyright 


what kinds of attacks that would harm the system. An example is the attack surface m at m e a s u r e s  how attackable various resources of a system are to enable relative comparison with similar systems. Other examples are the weakest adversary me d t h e  mean time-to-compromise T h ese m e trics  capture the difficulty or effort an adversary faces when attacking a system. To some extent this requires specification of the paths an adversary can use to compromise a system. Attack  17  sometimes called threat trees\ an approach commonly used to model these attack paths In an attack tree, the attacker s main goal is depicted as the root of the tree and the steps to reach this goal are broken down into sub-goals of the attack through AND and OR relationships. Usually, several different attacker goals are of relevance and create a forest of attack trees Tree and graph structures of attack paths have been applied in several ways to assess security of systems and to assess system vulnerabilities and risks. Both  an d [1 3] h a s pro pos ed th e u s e of attac k trees during system development to analyze the security. In addition to this, plenty of analysis techniques based on graphs over attacks has been suggested, for example  19 20 an d [3 0  While it is typically difficult to directly control what actions an attacker will chose and how frequent their attempts are, decision makers can to great extent control the difficulty to perform undesired actions by imposing countermeasures. Hence, a natural extension of attack graphs is to include these controllable countermeasures in the graph. In n t er m eas u r es  are modeled together with trees depicting threats, and in the theses by Foster [1 d Sch e c h ter [15 countermeasures are included in the tree structures The concept of including countermeasures in the tree structure has also been used in s o m e th i ng called Defense trees cf. Figure 1   F i g u r e  1   T h e  d e f e n s e  t r e e  c o n c e p t   f r o m   2 6    Techniques has been presented which use defense trees for strategic evaluation of security investments  odeling  s t rateg ic g a m e s in  s ecu rit y 26], as  w e ll  as modeling of conditional preference of defense techniques using conditional preference ne The statistical mathematics apparatus of Bayesian networks is well suited for combining disparate concepts and managing the uncertainty present in assessments Bay e s i an  n e t w orks can als o be u s ed as  a formal underpinning for attack graphs 31] a  method for expressing defense graphs using Extended Influence Diagrams, a flavor of Bayesian networks, has been presented. This paper builds on that work 3  Using extended influence diagrams for expressing defense graphs 3.1  Extended influence diagrams An influence diagram is a Bayesian network extended with special nodes indicating decisions and utilities, in addition to the so called Bayesian chance nodes  ten ded in f l u e n ce dia g ra m s are i n  addition equipped with a new kind of edge in order to clearly separate between causal relations and definitions [4  c f  Fi gur e 2      F i g u r e  2  T h e  n o t a t i o n  o f  e x t e n d e d  i n f l u e n c e  d i a g r a m s   Extended influence diagrams feature random variables associated with chance nodes that may assume values, or states, from a finite domain such as High, Medium, Low} or {True, False}. A chance node could for example be encryption strength or use of digital signatures  The nodes in extended influence diagrams are connected to each other through causal or definitional arcs  Causal arcs capture relations of the real world such as stronger encryption yield higher confidentiality Definitional relationships are on the other hand defined by the modeler, who also specifies how the defined property is defined by its parents The concept of security can for example be defined through preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability. Probabilistic inference is performed by propagating values through the network; given the value of one node, the values of related nodes can be statistically inferred Decision nodes may as chance nodes assume one of several predefined and mutually exclusive states and can be coupled with chance nodes to express the capability to influence, or be influenced by, chance nodes. Utility nodes are used to express the utility associated with a combination of states in chance and decision nodes. A value expressing utility, positive or Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


negative, is assigned to each states of influencing chance nodes and decision nodes. A utility node could for instance be Economic loss and this could be influenced by whether an attack is successful or not For more comprehensive treatments on Bayesian networks, influence diagrams and extended influence diagrams s    d 8  Similar to the development of Bayesian networks the creation of an extended influence diagram involves two parts: one qualitative part where the structure of the extended influence diagram is constructed and definitional relationships are quantified; and one quantitative part where causal influences are quantified In the qualitative part various sources can be used as input, including literature, statistical data and expert judgment. A heuristic method developing Extended Influence Diagrams from scientific texts is presented in 12   T h e q u an titati v e d e f i n itio n o f co n d itio n a l  probability tables are often considered the more difficult part of modeling Bayesian networks   and consequently also extended influence diagrams The commonly used sources to quantify these conditional probabilities are also literature, statistical data, and human experts ods h a v e als o been developed to base probabilities on combinations of these sources    3.2  Expressing defense graphs with extended influence diagrams Extended influence diagrams can be used to express attack trees T h e s t ep s in an attack can be illustrated by chance nodes with the states Success  and Failure The AND-relationships and ORrelationships in the attack graph can be expressed using deterministic definitional relations and specified through conditional probability tables \(cf Figure 3  The impact from consequences of a successful attack can be taken into consideration and expressed through utility nodes where the negative impact of an attack is quantified By extending this structure with the countermeasures influencing how probable an attack is to succeed, a defense graph can h e  defense graph the countermeasures are included as attributes. These countermeasures have an influence the on probability that an attacker succeeds with his or her sub-goals, and indirectly with his ultimate goal \(cf Figure 4   F i g u r e  3   A t t a c k  t r e e s  e x p r e s s e d  t h r o u g h  e x t e n d e d  i n f l u e n c e  d i a g r a m s       F i g u r e  4   T h e  i n f l u e n c e  o f  c o u n t e r m e a s u r e s  o n  t h e  d i f f i c u l t y  i n  s u c c e e d i n g  a t t a c k s    The capabilities of the attacker may also be included in the model. These can be assessed by attributes such as the time he or she have to spend; the prior knowledge about the system that he or she attacks; and the skill of the attacker in terms of compromising system e e x a m ple u s ed i n  this paper the attacker s capabilities are however excluded in the model. Instead assume that the model is designed for specific type of attacker, e.g. an outsider with world-class skill and prior system knowledge 3.3  An example defense graph over password protection In order to further explain the approach we here present a simple example borrowed from h e example models a defense graph over access control of a standalone computer with password protection. Three general strategies are here assumed to exist to compromise a password protection mechanism. Firstly and secondly the attacker may performs a brute force attack or a dictionary attack against the system, and that way guess the password. A third strategy would be to find out the password by other means, for example by social engineering. An attack tree depicting these goals is given in Figure 5  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


 F i g u r e  5   D e f e n s e  g r a p h  f o r  a c c e s s  c o n t r o l  e x p r e s s e d  t h r o u g h  a n  e x t e n d e d  i n f l u e n c e  d i a g r a m   G r e y  n o d e s  r e p r e s e n t  t h e  a t t a c k  g r a p h  a n d  w h i t e  n o d e s  r e p r e s e n t  c o u n t e r m e a s u r e s  The figure also contains some defense mechanisms relevant for the mentioned attacks. It is assumed that the difficulty of obtaining passwords is directly dependent on three attributes: the existence of default passwords that grant access; if the passwords are used in other systems; and if password holders \(personnel are susceptible to social engineering or not. Two factors that influence the difficulty of cracking passwords in a brute force attack are the strength of passwords, and if there is a limitation to the number of attempts that an attacker can try passwords using standard logon functionality. The size of salt and the strength of hash algorithms are also to be important for the difficulty of succeeding with brute force attacks The same attributes are also of relevance to the difficulty of performing dictionary attacks, but most likely in another way The efficiency, functioning and strength of technical countermeasures are in many cases dependent on the quality of functions, processes and humans surrounding them. For instance, passwords do not offer strong protection if they are not kept confidential, if they are default passwords, or if they are weak. The presence of weak passwords may in turn reflect whether the employees have received security training or not, and if password policies are existent Figure 5 depicts the qualitative structure of an extended influence diagram expressing the abovementioned. In order to infer a numeric value to the top node unauthorized access to data, the qualitative properties of the extended influence diagram is also needed. Hence, to each attack goal and influencing attribute, a conditional probability table is assigned. The relationships between attack goals these are of either AND- or OR-tables, as exemplified above cf. Figure 3\The conditional probability tables of attack graph-leafs specify the probability of an attack succeeding given a certain state in the influencing chance nodes \(cf. Figure 4\An example of such a conditional probability table for the difficulty of obtaining passwords is given in Table 1. Conditional probability tables for how countermeasures influence each other are also specified. An example of such a table is given in Table 2 for the attribute Password Y used in multiple systems These tables can, as described above, be specified by experts, based on literature, or based on empirical studies   Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4

In recent years model based design and management of information systems have gained much attention and increased in popularity There are many propositions on how to do this, and for information systems design the Unified Modeling Language \(UML\ is the de-facto standard language For information system management a number of enterprise architecture frameworks have been proposed. A common denominator for these modeling languages is that they are designed from the point of view of what exists rather than what the models should be used for. The concept of abstract models has been proposed to avoid th e pu rpos e o f t h e s e i s to  merge analysis frameworks, such as extended influence diagrams, and modeling languages so that the analysis can be performed on scenarios modeled according the abstract model An abstract model comprise of four components entities, entity relationships, attributes and attribute relationships. The first three of these components can be recognized from standard modeling languages such as the class diagrams of the UML. Entities are a central component in most modeling languages and can as in class diagrams be used to represent concepts of relevance for the model. These can be either physical artifacts, such as computer and person or more concepts such as data and procedure Entities are represented in a similar was as classes in UML are: a rectangular box with the name of the entity specified at its top Entities can in abstract models be connected through entity relationships. These entity relationships are depicted as lines spanning between the entities with roles names and multiplicities declared at the endpoints Attributes of abstract models are as in UML held by entities and are depicted as squared boxes within the entity belong to. However, unlike in UML, they are random variables or utility variables of finite domains In other words the attributes of the abstract model are the chance and utility nodes of the extended influence diagram Finally, and thus naturally, abstract models in addition to other modeling languages have the attribute relationship. This is relationship is the same as the relationship in the extended influence diagrams and is either causal or definitional. If this attribute relationship spans two entities, it is always associated with a particular entity relationship, which is denoted by the dashed line, for indicating which entity relationship that is the reason why the attribute relationship exists. Cf. Figure 6         F i g u r e  6   E x a m p l e  o f  a n  a b s t r a c t  m o d e l   Abstract models can thus be seen as metamodels enhanced with extended influence diagrams. This enhancement is not as straight forward as it seem.  The reason for this is that the extended influence diagram does not differentiate between the instantiated and abstract modes. For instance, as a result of the multiplicities of entity relationships, the number of parents an attribute has may differ between instances of the abstract model. One way to handle this when describing the instantiated extended influence diagram is to use aggregation functions to specify the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


conditional decency an attribute has on its parents Examples of such aggregation functions are AND  OR  AVERAGE and MAX  4.2  Generating abstract models from defense graphs Schech o in ts ou t t h at th e stru c t u r e of attac k  trees depends on the system architecture and the choice of countermeasures. For example, in architectures that contain confidential data, attacks compromising the access control of this data are relevant. The countermeasures included in the architecture are also of relevance since the attack vectors that are available depend on these. The attacks bypassing an access control mechanism based on biometrics does for instance differ from attack against an access control mechanism based on passwords. Also, the multiplicity of countermeasures is of importance since additional countermeasures introduce additional hinders for adversaries Abstract models offer a way of handling these dependencies by dictating the attribute relationships as a consequence of an entity relationship. With this as a basis, it can be expressed how the relationship between attack-goals depend on the entities included in a model and their relationships to each other The nodes of a defense graph, expressed as a extended influence diagram, are typically associated with some entity to which they belong.  Based on this the entities that are relevant for the assessment can be identified and populated with the appropriate attributes For example, the node Password Strength can be interpreted as the entity Password holding the attribute Strength  If an entity relationship shall be included in an abstract model depend on the structure of the associated extended influence diagram. The entity relationships of relevance are those that determine if an attribute relationship shall exist in an instantiated version of the model. The example abstract model in Figure 6 does for instance have the entity relationship includes since this relationship between a system and component would result in attribute relationships between their attributes 4.3  An example abstract model over password protection The attributes of the extended influence diagram in Figure 5 refers several concepts that needs to be investigated in a security assessment. The objective is to protect some data and vital for this is the password authentication mechanisms which protects software such as application and operating systems The password authentication mechanism uses passwords to grant or deny access and these passwords could or should be governed by a password policy The persons  who own the passwords have an influence on security related attributes according to the extended influence diagram and should also be considered in the assessment. Furthermore, if password holders are covered security training and awareness program is influencing the probability that these individuals have received training and participated in awareness sessions Hence, this aspect should also be included The entities are included because they hold attributes that are of relevance to the assessment. For example, the entity password is relevant because they should have strength The persons holding the passwords are relevant since their susceptibility to social engineering influence the difficulty to perform attacks For personnel, the participation in awareness and training programs is believed to influence their susceptibility to social engineering, hence if they are covered by such programs is also of relevance. The password authentication mechanism itself holds attributes such as strength of password hash and if there is an active password checker in use. These defensive attributes and the attributes representing attack goals and sub-goals give rise to the abstract model in Figure 1  Relationships among attributes in the abstract model should exist if they will lead to an attribute relationship in an instantiated model. For instance, in an instantiated abstract model the entity relationship owns  between a person and a password would imply that the person s attribute Has participated in security awareness session influence strength of the password If a password s strength is influencing the minimum password strength of an authentication mechanism depends on whether it gives access to that particular password authentication mechanism. In the same way a password protection mechanism s attributes will only influence the difficulty of bypassing logical access control of software if it protects that specific application or operating system. The attribute relationships that these en tity relationships are associated with is shown with dashed lines Figure 7 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6

The purpose of this is to collect information \(evidence\ about matters that are believed to influence security to facilitate analysis. One part of this information collection serves to identify the entities that need to be investigated and their relationship to each other. Another part of the data collection concerns the quality of various attributes and analyzing how these qualities influence security In relation to the framework presented herein the first part of information serves to scope the model based on the entities and relations available in the metamodel. The second part will add evidence to the state of attributes that influence the security. Evidence on attributes state can be added by for example studying documents, performing interviews, from firsthand experience, or form penetration testing There is always some uncertainty as to whether the evidences has credibility and reflect the actual state of attribut pen e tration test w i l l f o r in s t an c e  provide a high degree of confidence in results if the simulated attack is successful while unsuccessful attempts do not ensure the nonexistence of vulnerabilities. Documents describing systems may be old and obsolete, persons interviewed may be biased etc. Furthermore, some attributes are harder to assess directly than others and the evidence collected on these will consequently be vaguer. Abstract models allow the uncertainty of collected information to be included in the assessment by expressing evidence on the state of attributes through chance nodes. These evidence chance nodes are influenced by the state of the assessed attribute In Figure 8 evidence obtained from an interview on the use of automatic password checker is depicted as an ellipse. Table 3 expresses the significance of this of evidence by describing the expected outcome of the interview based on the possible states of assessed attribute. In this example, the system administrator would give the answer true with 95 percents probability if there is an automatic password checker With 10 percents probability the system administrator would wrongfully answer true even if there was no automatic password checker Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 7

However the more evidence that is collected, the more certain the result is. A method for dealing with the tradeoff between data collection cost and its impact in abstract models has been presented by  5.2  Constructing the concrete model By instantiating the abstract model, a concrete model can be created. The model depicted in Figure 8  is a concrete model based on the abstract model in Figure 7 In this example the data for which expected losses is assessed are customer records and strategic plans To base an abstract model on an extended influence diagram that expresses the defense graph has direct benefits. Firstly, it ensures that the model used for assessment, and consequently the data collected for it contains the data needed to for generating and assessing security using defense graphs. Secondly since the model only covers the parts that are of relevance to the assessment, the assessment will only focus on things of relevance to its result. Furthermore it is from an instantiated abstract model straightforward and supported by tools o deri v e t h e a t t r i b u t e s  attribute relationships, and conditional probability tables. Using an abstract model, the modeler will only have to model the entities, their relationships, and the state of attributes to assess the security Shown in Figure 8 is the expected loss from unauthorized access to the strategic plans. This depends on the probability that an adversary will succeed bypassing the logical access control of the ERP Client. This in turn depends on the attributes of its password protection mechanism, and so on Based on the entities instantiated in the concrete model and the relationship among these, a network of attributes can be derived. This network will correspond to an extended influence diagram expressing a defense graph. The attributes to be included can be derived from the entities that have been instantiated. And since the attribute relationships are associated with entity relationships, these can be derived based on the entity relationships that exist in the concrete model Together with evidence, like the interview system administrators, Bayesian inference can be used derive a value of attributes in the same way they can in an influence diagram. This would include deriving the probability that certain attacks succeed; the expected consequence of attack attempts; and an index comparing the expected losses of today s solution and the optimal one. Furthermore, this can be done even if the evidence is incoherent, or incomplete   F i g u r e  8   A  c o n c r e t e  m o d e l  o f  t h e  a s s e s s e d  e n t e r p r i s e   E n t i t i e s  a n d  e v i d e n c e  o n  t h e i r  a t t r i b u t e s  e n a b l e  t h e  p r o b a b i l i t y  o f  a t t a c k s  s u c c e s s  t o  b e  i n f e r r e d  a n d  t h e  e x p e c t e d  l o s s  t o  b e  c a l c u l a t e d   Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 8 


6  Discussion  When modeling security, or anything else for that matter, there is typically a tradeoff between completeness and feasibility on one hand, and simplicity and accuracy on the other. Models of attacks against cyber technology is no different, in fact attack graphs growing large is a known problem ce identifying all plausible attack steps and defense mechanisms prior an evaluation could become a daunting task. A suggested solution to the problem proposed by Liu and Hong s t o us e Ba y e s i a n  networks to express attack graphs In a similar manner is the method proposed in this paper using extended influence diagrams, which also is form of Bayesian networks, to enable a compact representation of both attack graphs and defense mechanisms. By taking advantage of the probabilistic expressiveness of these Bayesian networks, the complexity of graphs can be reduced to a desirable size. This allows models to be created, without enumerating all plausible attacks or specifying them to the last detail, and instead include the uncertainty that is a result of keeping models on a high level. This also enables models to express uncertainty related to for instance access success that is a result of unknown novel, attacks. By introducing this uncertainty to the analysis framework it is also possible to refine it iteratively. The more we learn about certain attacks and how to protect against them \(by case studies experiments or otherwise\he more we can reduce the uncertainties in the framework. In other words, the quality of results is related to how well we have prepared the analysis framework Except for managing the problem with knowing exactly all kinds of attacks and how to defend oneself against them, there is also always a practical problem of assessing cyber security with respect to our current knowledge. Typically in real world situations there are so many things that we know have a bearing on cyber security that there are an enormous amount of information about the state of the world that are needed for performing the security analysis. To collect all this data with high confidence take substantial efforts, if possible at all. However, the level of certainty in the results that is the highest imaginable. These two parameters thus need to be traded against each other by the decision maker. By using abstract models to generate defense graphs, and provide evidence on attribute states together with their credibility, a model based on incomplete information can provide a value on security that also provide an indication of the certainty of this value  7  Conclusions Model based design and is an established approach for management of information systems. For these models to support decision making relating to cyber security, the models of systems, software, and enterprises need to include the factors that influence security This paper has shown how defense graphs expressed with extended influence diagrams can be merged with the concept abstract models. Used as a metamodel this type of abstract model will include all the components necessary to perform a security assessment based on an architecture model. In addition to this, it will express how these components influence each other and how to derive a value on security and expected losses from an instantiated model 8  References 1  Y. Liu and M.

  11 to request, review, and propose changes to the current state of the science plan Distributed Operations 227 Cassini distributed all aspects of the instrument operations to the science teams. Science Teams were required to develop the spacecraft commanding for pointing the spacecraft. Th is significantly complicated the interfaces and coordination required by the JPL science and sequencing teams. The distribution of internal instrument commanding and monitoring instrument health and safety worked well. Dedicated full-time operations personnel were required at all instrument sites. The liaison between the distributed sites and JPL required definition of a strong JPL Investigation Scientist \(i.e., Experiment Representative\le Distributed operations is a two-edged sword. Scientists personally worked operations and were better able to optimize for their science objectives. Their insight provided the feedback necessary to quickly respond to science discoveries in the science selection and uplink processes This allowed the operations team to capitalize on truly extraordinary opportunities to a degree not thought possible However, this was at the cost of doing science analysis and publishing science results Software Development 227 The Cassini mission deferred most of its ground software development until post launch. In fact, considerable effort was spent accelerating the development of the tools required to plan the Jupiter flyby observations in 2001. For the start of the science integration for Cassini\222s prime mission, many of the ground software planning tools were immature or unavailable. To compensate, homegrown tool development occurred at the instrument sites and within science planning. System engineering of these types of ground software tools was lacking. A better paradigm would have been to develop the operations and ground system\222s architecture, requirements models, and software to a level sufficient to support operations pre-launch. Sufficient project resources needed to be applied to Phase B/C/D development. The science planning tools should be developed to a sufficient level during these phases such that th ey can be used as part of evaluating the ground and flight system requirements and capabilities. Based on this evaluation, refinements could be made during cruise and throughout the mission to the unified ground and flight system architecture and software requirements Programmatic  Project Science 227The orbiter consists of 8 Principal Investigator \(PI\struments and 4 Facility Instrument with corresponding Team Leads. In a ddition, there are 5 different science discipline teams: Rings, Saturn, Titan, Icy Satellites and Magnetosphere. The Project Science leader ship needed to be highly involved in the tactical and strategic science planning activities. The consensus building culture used on Cassini was time consuming. The Project Science support staff should be funded adequately to allow the Project Scientist to participate in the integration process. Clear Project Science guidelines are very helpful Instruments 227 Instrument Flight Rule development must be mature pre-launch. Instruments should be designed to minimize impacts on the operations of the other instruments, e.g., radiator placement. Data compression internal to instruments is vital. For Cassini, the science instruments had internal sequencing memory for storing instrument commanding for upcoming sequence. This allowed the science teams th e ability to send real-time noninteractive instrument commands that bypass the sequencing process by using the Automated Sequence Processor \(ASP  In-flight Testing 227 The targeted gravity assist flybys provided a unique opportunity to exercise the ground system on realistic science data acquisition scenarios that simulates the operational environment during the Tour phase of the prime mission. This also had the advantage of providing the science instrument teams an opportunity to acquire useful science data for the purposes of instrument checkout and science data analysis. The in-flight exercises should use the processes, procedures, software, and ground system capabilities in the same manner, to the extent possible, as will be used during Tour and Orbital operations The entire flight team \(mission planning, science planning sequencing, spacecraft, naviga tion, and science teams should be fully engaged to provide the maximum benefit to the Project 7  C ONCLUSION  Even though Cassini was a NASA flagship mission maximizing the science return was a challenge to science planning operations. Decisions aimed at saving both prelaunch and operations costs added considerable complexity to both the spacecraft and the ground system. Among the key ones were removing the scan platform, opting for distributed operations rather than co-location, and delaying development of some flight software and most of the ground system until after launch Understanding the operational challenges to maximizing Cassini science return and the successful techniques employed to overcome those challenges as presented in this paper should be of value to other deep space science missions.  Future missions should carefully consider the following advice 200  Pay careful attention to operational scenarios in development cost saving decisions, both spacecraft and ground. Additional, more sophisticated commanding constructs may be required in operations to compensate for lack of spacecraft capabilities. Ground management of stressed or

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs.
