Specifying and Analyzing Workîows for Automated Identiìcation and Data Capture Elsa L Gunter Ayesha Yasmeen Carl A Gunter and Anh Nguyen University of Illinois  egunter,yasmeen,cgunter,anguyen7  illinois.edu Abstract Humans use computers to carry out tasks that neither is able to do easily alone humans provide eyes hands and judgment while computers provide computation networking and storage This symbiosis is espe 
cially evident in workîows where humans identify objects using bar codes or RFID tags and capture data about them for the computer This Automated Identiìcation and Data Capture AIDC is increasingly important in areas such as inventory systems and health care Humans involved in AIDC follow simple rules and rely on the computer to catch mistakes in complex situations this reliance can lead to mismatches between human workîows and system programming In this paper we explore the design implementation and formal 
modeling of AIDC for vital signs measurements in hospitals To this end we describe the design of a wireless mobile medical mediator device that mediates between identiìcations measurements and updates of Electronic Health Records EHRs We implement this as a system Med2 that uses PDAs equipped with Bluetooth WiFi and RFID wireless capabilities Using Communicating Sequential Processes CSP we jointly specify workîow and computer system operations and provide a formal analysis of the protections the system provides for user 
errors 1 Introduction Automated Identiìcation and Data Capture AIDC provides support for a growing collection of tasks in which sensor systems often manipulated by humans are used to identify objects and collect measurements about them Identiìcation uses tools like bar codes or Radio Frequency Identiìcation RFID tags with optical or radio readers Data capture involves both manual input and an increasingly rich collection of measurement devices often linked wirelessly to computer networks While workîows like the checkout lanes at 
grocery stores are fairly simple and have become wellestablished in other areas AIDC is only beginning to see practical application because reliability exibility and cost savings have not yet been adequately addressed A particular case in point is medical workîows where the identiìcation of readings and samples is of safety critical importance and workîows are quite complex Better analysis techniques are needed to help design workîows and systems so that these concerns can be addressed with high conìdence In this paper we explore modeling techniques based 
on process algebras to better design and analyze human workîows and the computer and networking systems that support them Our primary focus and contribution is on the analysis of the gap between the human workîow instructions which must be comparatively simple and the protection envelope comprising the collection of erroneous behaviors the computer is able to detect It is typically impossible to detect all types of human error using storage and sensor data so it is essential to identify exactly which types of conditions lie outside of the 
protection envelope and address these through system extensions or user training As systems become more complex and safety critical it is increasingly undesirable to base the detection of errors on operational experience and hence formal means of analysis provide a premium As a simple example consider the move from current grocery store checkout lines which use attendants to scan items to ones that encourage the customer to perform this task A typical system of this type might for instance provide a scale onto which the user places items after scanning them if there are inconsistences be 
tween the expected weight of the item scanned and the measured weight of the item placed on the scale then an attendant may be called to review the situation This example illustrates the combination of automated identiìcation the scan data capture the weighing and the envelope of protection exceptional conditions arising from inconsistency between identiìcation and data Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


capture The default behavior is simple scan items and put them on the scale but a broader protection envelope is supported if this workîow is violated The situation is made more complex when additional issues arise such as a customer using their own cloth bag to avoid choosing paper or plastic can or should the system be designed to account for the added weight of the customerês bag on the scale without generating a call-attendant signal This paper introduces a methodology based on Communicating Sequential Processes CSP that provides basic vocabulary for AIDC We show that this language can be effective in characterizing and analyzing the human workîow the system protection envelope and the implementation for complex and potentially valuable AIDC systems We demonstrate this with a device we call a medical mediator which can be carried by a nurse or other clinical personnel and used to identify devices and subjects patients so their data can be automatically recorded into the hospital information system with a well-understood set of rules about the protection envelope of the device and workîow The paper is divided into seven sections We begin in Section 2 with background material on CSP how it can be used to model workîow and the opportunity and challenge of AIDC in healthcare Section 3 describes the design of the medical mediator and Section 4 sketches a prototype implementation of a medical mediator using PDAs with WiFi Bluetooth and RFID In Section 5 we describe our modeling technique for AIDC using CSP and apply it to the medical mediator by specifying human workîow and the protection envelope Section 6 sketches safety properties of the medical mediator derived from our three speciìcations Section 7 describes some of the related work on workîow modeling and AIDC and Section 8 provides some conclusions 2 Background Since our focus will be on using CSP to model AIDC in health care we need some background on CSP notations how CSP can be used to model workîows and the opportunity and challenge of AIDC in health care Communicating Sequential Processes CSP CSP is an algebraic notation for concurrency and communication that is used to describe processes in terms of their patterns of behavior We will try to make our discussion self-contained but more details and examples can be found in 11 A simpliìed grammar of CSP is given below It is based on a primitive set of events e and booleans b  P Q  e  P  Stop  Skip  if b then P else Q  P  A  P  Q  P  Q  P  Q  P  Q  P    A    Q  P  Q  P  Q The process e  P rst does e and then behaves like P  The constant Skip indicates successful completion while Stop indicates a deadlocked process The process if b then P else Q behaves like P if b holds and like Q otherwise The process P  A behaves like P but with all elements of A removed from its traces as if they have been internalized The process P  Q behaves like P but becomes Q on interrupt The process P  Q behaves like P until P terminates and then behaves like Q  The process P  Q denotes the interleaved parallel composition of the two processes P and Q In the process P   A   Q  the processes P and Q must synchronize on the events in the event alphabet A but execute with parallel interleaving otherwise The processes P  Q and P  Q each behave either like P or Q but the choice between them is made by the environment for P  Q and internally for P  Q  The operators     and  are associative and commutative We will abbreviate P  x 1     P  x n  by  x  X P  x  where X   x 1 x n   and similarly for  and   All sets will be assumed to be nite We will further abbreviate   C.x  x  X  C.x  P  x   where X is an understood set of values for a communication by C  x  P  x  meaning the possible receipt of a value and write C  v  P for C.v  P  representing the sending of a value v  We will refer to the modiìer C in a set of events  C.x  x  X  as a communication channel or channel for short Using CSP to Model Workîow Perhaps the easiest way to understand CSP and its potential for workîow modeling is to work through an example We do this for an identiìcation workîow used by the U.S Transportation Safety Agency TSA and illustrate a kno wn procedural gap using CSP notation Our goal here is simply to show how concurrency contructs can be used to express sometimes subtle aspects of human workîow using an example that will be familiar to most readers The bulk of the paper will focus on more complex and specialized workîows in health care TSA provides screening of passengers and their carry-on baggage in a checkpoint that passengers must traverse to reach boarding gates At the checkpoint the passenger is required to place their bags onto a conveyor belt where they are screened by X-ray while the passenger steps through a metal and possibly chemical detector After stepping through the metal detector a passenger may be selected by TSA for further screening In this case the passenger is asked to identify their Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


bags and step to a separate screening zone A security gap arises in this workîow because the workîow does not bind the passenger to his baggage before the screening step is executed thus allowing the passenger to potentially select a different bag than the one they were originally carrying The check against this happening is the assumption that the selected passengerês bag would remain unclaimed while the other passenger whose bag was taken would complain thereby alerting the the TSA to a problem However if the person selected has an accomplice they could enter together and swap bags if one was pulled for further screening The end association of bag with passenger has failed to match corresponding identities after the bag selection is complete the TSA agent does not know the identity of the bag selected relative to the passenger selected It is arguable that there is an error in the workîow speciìcation the workîow should specify that the TSA agent makes the choice of the bag for the passenger to reclaim and not the passenger Let us see how the workîow in particular and this issue in general can be modeled formally using CSP We model the speciìcation of the passenger and TSA agent as follows We assume events for clearing a passenger Clr  selecting a passenger Sel  and getting a bag Bag  and processes for going to the gates Gate orfor going to the waiting area Wait for further screening Pass  p   Clr p   b  Bags Bag b  Gate  p b    Sel p   b  Bags Bag b  Wait  p b  TSA   p  Pass  Clr p   b  Bags Bag b  TSA    Sel p   b  Bags Bag b  Screen  p b  This allows for the following implementation  failure reìnement in CSP terminology in which a suspicious passenger p plans ahead to swap bags with accomplice passenger a   Clr p  Bag b p  Gate  p b p    Sel p  Bag b a  Wait  p b a  One strategy to address this problem is to change the speciìcation of the workîow for the passenger to Pass  p   b  Bags Bag b   Clr p  Gate  p b    Sel p  Wait  p b  Practically speaking this means not selecting the passengers for extra screening until after they have selected the bags they plan to take to the gate with them The speciìcation of the TSA would now need to be changed to reîect the order of bag selection and passenger screening selection By changing the speciìcation this way we are more assured that the bag has been identiìed as the one that the passenger plans to take with them However this still does not guarantee that the bag is the one that the passenger brought with them An alternative strategy is to change speciìcation of the TSAês workîow TSA   p  Pass  Clr p   b  Bags Bag b  TSA    Sel p  Bag b p  Screen  p b p  This speciìes that the TSA ofìcer is required to select the bag of the passenger Of course a proper execution requires that the TSA agent remember or somehow record which bag the passenger had when he reached the checkpoint so the selection can be made accurately if it needs to be made AIDC in Health Care Identiìcation is especially important in health care Everyone has heard horror stories about patients who got an operation intended for another patient died because the y got the wrong medication or had sur gery that mis-identiìes a limb that needed to be amputated Samples must be very carefully handled in labs and there is an especially important gap between the collection of a reading and its entry into an Electronic Health Record EHR As a result health care facilities such as hospitals labs and clinics have rigorous workîows for clinical personnel that involve careful identiìcation Clinicians patients and samples are all labeled with badges arm tags and stickers respectively for use in many procedures There are efforts to improve efìciency in hospitals by using AIDC and we will overview a few in our related work section Our primary focus in this paper concerns using tags to facilitate EHR updates from readings a clinician takes from a patient using a medical device Wireless communication capabilities such as WiFi Blue-tooth and RFID are changing hospital workîows To see the trend rst note that much current workîow is comparatively manual For instance a nurse collects the weight of a patient on a mechanical scale and writes it on into a paper le With the emergence of EHRs the nurse then enters this information into an EHR at a later stage But if wireless medical devices were used the workîow could have been streamlined For instance a wireless scale has a Blue-tooth link to a computer and the reading is transfered directly to the computer with the nurse providing other necessary identiìcations Or the scale connects by Blue-tooth to a Personal Digital Assistant PDA carried by the nurse displays the reading and enters it via a WiFi link into the EHR Or inthe case of our system in this paper a scale  pulse oximeter connects by Blue-tooth to a PDA which we will subsequently refer to as a medical mediator  which uses an RFID reader to identify the patient and the clinician before entering the results into an EHR via a WiFi link We add the additional step of identifying the device making Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


the reading to obtain the following Nurse Workîow Identify the patient by scanning the patientês identiìcation tag then identify the device to be used to take a reading by scanning its identiìcation tag View the information to verify whether the correct entities were identiìed Take a reading and check the reading to see if it is acceptable for entry into the EHR and approve if it is This is the type of workîow a human can understand and follow it can be augmented by some simple recovery instructions like using a reset function if the entities are not correctly identiìed or the reading is not satisfactory It can be expressed in CSP without great complexity as follows Nurse  n m  HCI n m  GetID  p  HCI n m  RFIDChan n,m p    d  HCI n m  RFIDChan n,m d   HCI n m  x  if x  Name  p   Name  d  then  HCI n m  Yes  TakeCkReading  n m p d  else if x  Error then  HCI n m  OK  Skip  else  HCI n m  No  Skip  where HCI n m is the human-computer interface for the PDA m used by the clinician n and RFIDChan n,m x is the connection between the RFID tag on x person p or device d  and the medical mediator m provided by the clinician n bringing the RFID reader in range of the RFID tag The process TakeCkReading for collecting the reading from the device is described in Section 5 Our primary interest is in what happens when we step outside of the simple human workîow and consider the many exceptional conditions that plague practical operational deployment and implementation For example what happens if the nurse scans the patientês ID more than once or skips the identiìcation of the device or does the identiìcations in a different order or identiìes the wrong type of object like herself as patient and so on In these cases one hopes that the computer can correct many errors but it is generally impossible to correct all of them for example a nurse who takes a reading of a patient different from the one identiìed so it is important to know exactly which ones will not be caught 3 Medical Mediator As mentioned earlier it is not unusual for a nurse to take a measurement from a patient record the reading into a piece of paper and enter it into patientês EHR at a later stage This workîow is not only inefìcient but it also creates many opportunities for mistakes In the meantime there has been excellent progress on developing wireless medical devices that automatically transfer Figure 1 Communications their readings to a nearby station Research-oriented efforts include Harvard CodeBlue and UCSD s WIISARD Man y technologies ha v e reached commer cial deployment including the Nonin Bluetooth pulse oximeter used in our implementation and with wireless network quality getting better and battery life getting longer we expect to see signiìcant adoptions of wireless medical devices in the near future However current systems solve only a piece of the overall problem For example the Nonin pulse oximeter can pair with nearby computers that use Bluetooth but has little capability itself and in particular it is not able to identify the subject on which it is being used Also this new technology only becomes practical if there exists an efìcient mechanism to handle the heterogenous nature of the system that is requiring a modest amount of effort to manage and install various devices potentially from different vendors The medical mediator is a design that effectively addresses this gap using a mobile computer that can carry out identiìcations and mediate communications with devices that lack identiìcation capabilities We have developed an overall system architecture which has been implemented and tested with existing hardware platforms Our tests show that such a system is feasible and could be deployed in practice The medical mediator combines patient identiìcation and medical data capturing functionalities into one single handheld device and provides automatic aggregation of the two It can assist the nurse in detecting and preventing medical errors which if go unnoticed might lead to harmful consequences for patients such as injuries or even death We will discuss its architecture and intended operations in this section we describe a prototype implemention in the next section Architecture Figure 1 shows communication paths between the components and with the clinicians and subjects There are three software components an elecProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


tronic health record database EHR  the medical mediator software and a server which processes data and interfaces with the EHR EHRInterface  EHR contains information about the agents clinicians like nurses subjects patients and medical devices  This includes the name and role of each agent in the hospital medical notes such as medication allergies of each patient a short description of each medical device its functionality pulse oximeter scale and its working status working/broken etc This information can be queried using the ID number of the corresponding object or subject EHR also stores information about medical measuring schedules when it should take place who is the patient and what type of device should be used etc The mediator Med  runs on a handheld device that can connect to EHRInterface and to medical devices It also has the ability to read identiìcation tags The mediator acts as an interface between the participants agents subjects and devices and our backend system which comprises EHR and EHRInterface  Each agent subject and device has a tag containing their identiìcation number ID Note that we do not limit ourselves to any particular identiìcation mechanism A barcode or any other type of automated ID such as RFID can be used to identify the participants The last component EHRInterface  processes requests from the agent makes queries to EHR  analyzes medical data checks for possible errors and commits changes to EHR based on decisions made by the agent By comparing data given by Med and data stored in EHR  EHRInterface is capable of detecting and preventing a wide range of errors during the identiìcation and data capture process System Operations At the beginning of her shift a nurse checks out a PDA with the mediator software installed and running She scans her badge to associate herself with the mediator perhaps entering a password or PIN To take a measurement for a given patient and device the nurse scans the patientês tag and the tag of the medical device The two IDs are sent from the mediator to EHRInterface  Then EHRInterface queries EHR to get detailed information regarding these IDs such as the patientês name and the deviceês description If EHRInterface detects any mismatch such as a wrong combination of IDs or no scheduled measuring for the patient at this given time etc an error is raised that may cancel the whole transaction and notify the nurse through the mediator otherwise the identiìcations are sent back to the mediator This check is capable of detecting many common errors such as patients wearing wrong ID tags or nurse taking measurement of wrong patient perhaps having a name similar with the correct one After this point the nurse can verify these identiìcations one more time making sure that these data reîect the actual patient and device before advancing to the next stage The mediator then connects to the identiìed device if necessary Since many of the new medical devices are enabled with Bluetooth this may mean a Bluetooth link but other communication technologies like ZigBee or infrared are also possible In our implementation the nurse needs to select the identiìed Bluetooth device from a list a more streamlined program could avoid this step The mediator then collects the data captured by the identiìed medical device The collected data will be tunneled from the mediator to EHRInterface  The mediator does not need to understand the semantics of the collected data since it will not analyze it it will instead be parsed by EHRInterface  The result in a human readable format will be transferred back to Med  The nurse can now examine the outcome along with meaningful identiìcations of the patient and the device before deciding whether the data is correct and should be recorded into the patientês EHR This design ofîoads heavy computations from a PDA to a much more powerful server Doing this not only reduces the cost of the system but also eases management both of which add to scalability and applicability of our system If we were to rely on the mobile device for computational power the mediator would probably need to be a laptop or tablet PC which are much more expensive than a PDA However the more serious concern is conìguration management in order for a new medical device to be introduced into the system its software must be installed on all of the mobile devices Even in a medium-sized hospital this number could be hundreds In our system only the backend server needs to be updated 4 Med2 Implementation We implemented a prototype of our design Med2 and tested it in taking real medical measurements In our implementation we put both EHR and EHRInterface components in a single laptop equipped with Intel Core2Duo 2.00GHz processor 2GB of RAM running Microsoft Windows XP The Med2 software runs on top of an HP iPaq 4150 PDA with Microsoft Windows Mobile 2003 platform The Pocket PC has 64MB of RAM 400MHz Intel XScale processor and an SD slot armed with a SDIO RFID reader from SDiD The PDA connects to the back end server via WiFi and communicates with a Nonin 4100 wireless pulse oximeter via Bluetooth We use ISO 15693 compliant RFID tags to identify the participants The RFID tags in the prototype are shaped like Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


Figure 2 Med2 Hardware credit cards but these tags also can be had in wrist bands or as tags that can be stuck on devices The mediator identiìes a tag by being held within a few centimeters of it This proximity reduces the risk that tags from other nearby devices or patients will be collected accidentally Figure 2 shows the Med2 mediator in action Med2 has about 3000 lines of C  code and a small mySQL database This includes code for our framework a piece of code to control the SDiD reader and read data from RFID tags and a piece of code to interpret data from the pulse oximeter EHRInterface was programmed using MFC while the mediator software on the PDA was developed with Microsoft Net Compact Framework Figure 3 shows detailed modules of Med2 The funcFigure 3 Med2 Software Components tions of the modules are intuitive and can typically be deduced from their names Identiìcation Logic and Data Collector help the nurse to identify the participants and collect readings from medical devices Transaction Control at EHRInterface creates and terminates transactions To enhance reliability of the system each transaction is realized using a separated instance of Transaction Logic  This is to make sure that if anything wrong happens in a transaction it will be contained and cannot affect other transactions taking place at the same time Readings collected from medical devices will be interpreted by the Device Logic module This is a layer of abstraction that addresses heterogeneity by providing a common interface when handling multiple types of devices from the same or different vendors Each type of device will have its corresponding device logic implemented in a dynamic library This logic may include wrappers for vendor-speciìc code to assure compatibility in the EHR or the mediator interface This approach allows new devices to be installed with no changes to the code on the mediator and controlled changes in the EHR schemas We tested our implementation by taking blood oxygen-percentage and heart rate readings on people in our lab We set up a few scenarios with errors within the speciìed protection envelope and showed that our implementation was able to detect and prevent these errors Several people were given RFID cards each with a programmed ID that identiìes its owner One of them was given role as a nurse and the others were patients The Nonin Bluetooth Oximeter was also given an ID These roles and IDs were reîected in our EHR database which was implemented using mySQL In a normal transaction the nurse began by scanning a patient ID and the pulse oximeter ID She then waited to receive the patientês name and picture and the deviceês description and veriìed them She then put the hand of the patient in the oximeter selected it in the list of devices discovered by the PDA and waited for the data collecting process to complete The raw data was sent to our backend system and the patientês blood oxygen percentage was sent back to the nurse This result is displayed in HTML format along with other identiìcation information The nurse approved the result and the device moved into a state ready for the next patient To prove the error detection capability of our system we set up a few abnormal scenarios as well These fell into the protection envelope and all of them were detected There were trivial errors such as scanning the wrong type of ID or using the wrong type of device Some type of errors were even prevented before they could happen We tried changing the status of the oximeter from working to broken or changing the schedule to another date in our EHR database These actions triggered our backend system to stop the transProceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


action and informed the nurse of the according error There is work on improving patient identiìcation using automated identiìcation techniques 28 b u t these works do not address aggregating automated patient identiìcation with automated medical data capture Due to time and resource constraints we did not fully implement some aspects of Med2 such as security and optimized power management But our prototype and testing results show that these issues can be addressed and the approach is feasible to deploy in practice using inexpensive stock platforms communication cards and medical devices 5 Formalism Our approach to modeling AIDC is to represent each of the environment typically entities supplying identity and information the human workîow the identiìcation system and the identiìcation platform typically a database such as an EHR on an inventory system as CSP processes to be composed with synchronization The environment and the identiìcation platform should be thought of as xed and the purpose of their speciìcation is to capture existing functionality The speciìcations for each of the human workîow and the identiìcation system should be thought of as stating the required behavior to be implemented The composition of the human workîow and the identiìcation system is the total system to be supplied However since the human behavior can not be guaranteed it is critical that its speciìcation be broken out separately to clarify the precise limitations of the system deployed For each type of pairing of entities in the environment human agents identiìcation system components and platform components we associate a parameterized family of channels where the parameters give the speciìc implicit and explicit participating entities In our examples we have given the parameters as indexing subscripts and superscripts To the extent one can say one party owns a channel we have used the subscript to indicate the owner The superscripts indicate information about the other participant\(s in the communication and the source\(s of the data being communicated These are mathematical labeling of the channels by real world entities and are not visible to the system being implemented only the data transmitted is actually visible However these indices play a critical role in enabling us to state the needed correspondence properties guaranteeing that the recorded data had originated from the expected source i.e  they have the expected identity To clarify this general methodology we will demonstrate it through the example of the medical mediator We explore a scenario at a hospital where nurses take patient readings from devices capable of reporting results wirelessly The challenge here is to ensure that the correct reading gets associated with the correct patient in the hospital database To aid in ensuring this all elements of the hospital environment are equipped with identiìcation tags and the nurse is required to identify with those tags the patient and the device being used and then the system should ensure that the data collected are associated with the identiìed patient and device The whole process can be seen as an interaction among the physical actions taking place in the environment like the nurse taking the reading using a device and the actions in the electronic system which receives interprets and stores the readings collected from patients In accordance with the general methodology outlined above the environment comprises the patients the medical devices and all tags associated with these entities The nurse must adhere to the human workîow The medical mediator the PDA plus readers and software is the identiìcation system and the combination of the EHR and its interface make up the identiìcation platform To model these elements we will use the CSP processes Tag  Pat  Nurse  Med  Device  EHRInterface and EHR  Some of these processes will be further described in terms of subprocesses such as TakeCkReading for Nurse  The channels are as follows HCI n m is used for interactions between the nurse n and the medical mediator m  RFIDChan n,m o for communicating RFID tag numbers for a tagged object o to a medical mediator m operated by nurse n  BTAddr n,m d is the Blue-tooth connection between m and device d selected by n  while BTScan m represents scanning the radio frequencies for blue-tooth devices EHRCh m is the channel for m to communicate with the EHR interface to get names associated with id numbers and EHRBECh m is the channel for m to use to store information in the EHR Human Workîow In Section 2 we introduced the nurseês workîow including its CSP speciìcation That speciìcation relied upon the speciìcation TakeCkReading of the workîow to be followed when taking and verifying a reading for a patient For this phase when the nurse is ready to take a reading he pushes a GetReading button on the medical mediator then selects a blue-tooth device from the list displayed assuming it is present

6 Safety Properties There are a variety of different semantics and models for CSP processes We concentrate on the trace model and the failure model in this work In a trace model a process is represented by the sequences of communications or events it can perform In the stable failures model a process is represented by its failures A failure for a process P  is given by a pair  s X   where s is a trace of P and X is a set of things it can refuse to perform after performing s  We intend to provide some desired safety and liveness properties for the hospital AIDC system We will provide the speciìcations for a CSP process by providing the most nondeterministic process satisfying the speciìcation The CSP process for a hospital AIDC system satisìes a speciìcation S if the CSP process P representing the speciìcation is reìned by the AIDC system process We will consider two different types of reìnement trace reìnement for safety properties and failure reìnement for liveness properties  A process Q is a trace reìnement of another process P  denoted by P  T Q if traces  Q   traces  P   A process Q is a failure reìnement of another process P  denoted by P  F Q if failures  Q   F failures  P   If we have a process P and its safety speciìcation S and we have S  T P  then we can say P is a safe process as all its traces are traces of the speciìcation so no bad event can be performed by P  Similarly failure reìnement can be used to express liveness properties We now express the environment of a hospital AIDC system as the collection of all the identiìcation tags representing the devices and patients and the devices sending out the readings for patients together with the electronic records system These are the given components which we cannot control Given   d  Dev Dev  d     p  Pat Pat  p   BTDevs  EHR We shall refer to the combination of all instances of nurses and medical mediators as the system It is important that only one nurse have use a medical mediator at a time This is reîected in our speciìcation by allowing each medical mediator to choose a nurse System   m   n  Nurse  n m     y  x.y  HCI n m x    Med  n m     y  x.y  EHRCh m x    EHRInterface   y 012 nmpdx y   RFIDChan n p x  y   EHRBECh m x  y   BTAddr n,m d x  y   BTScan m x   System In the system we hide away almost all internal and interelement communication The only events that we are interested in are the actual scanning of patient and device identiìer tags and the ultimate sending of the medical measurement to the EHR for storage after it has been veriìed by the nurse We now provide the safety speciìcation for the hospital AIDC system where the speciìcation ensures that if a tuple of data is entered into a database stating that a particular device d was used to take a reading x from a patient p by a nurse n  then it had been the case that the nurse n did identify p and d and had taken a medical measurement x from the patient p using d after identifying them Safety   m   n  p  d  RFIDChan n,m p  IDnum  p     RFIDChan n,m d  IDnum  d      RFIDChan n,m d  IDnum  d     RFIDChan n,m p  IDnum  p      Skip   BTScan m  X   Skip   if BTAddr n,m d  X then  BTAddr n,m d  r   Skip  EHRBECh m   n m IDnum  p   IDnum  d  EHR  r   Skip  else Skip  Safety Now we are ready to specify the desired safety and liveness properties Let Vis   y   ndx.y  RFIDChan n,m d x     mz.y  EHRBECh m z    The properties then are as follows Safety    Vis    Given  T System    Vis    Given LIVE  F System    Vis    Given where LIVE   x x  LIVE  LIVE is the most nondeterministic process that is deadlock free The rst property states that no wrong random non-associated tuple gets stored in EHR and the second property states that the nurse can eventually take steps and will not get deadlocked We have sketched proofs for the above results based on their semantics using traces of events Due to the large number of cases to be considered we feel that such a proof is easily subject to accidental omissions and hence is best checked by automated assistant To this end we have encoded the CSP processes described in this paper two such tools The rst system we used was the fully automated CSP failures-reìned prover FDR2 Failures-Divergence Reìnement Our e xperience with this system is limited but a straightforward encoding led the system to run for hours probably indicating divergence The second system we used was the extension CSP-prover to the interacti v e theorem pro v e r Isabelle In this system there is a restricted type system for communications and the encoding entailed creating a number of functions for coercing data into this type system Also certain operators were lacking Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 9 


index interleaving in particular and so we had to expand the code to accommodate this lack As of this writing the proofs in CSP-prover of the above two results are incomplete We conclude from this effort that there are interesting challenges to automating proofs of AIDC workîows such as the ones for the mediator To summarize these results in less technical language there are three possibilities for the outcome of operator actions First there are actions that make progress by providing proper updates of the EHR This will occur when the nurse adheres to the speciìed workîow Second there are actions that lie within the protection envelope but do not make progress For example repeated reading of a patientês tag is tolerated by the system although it is not the speciìed workîow A detected error occurs when reading tags on two devices rather than on a patient and a device Third there are actions that corrupt the EHR database These require signiìcant deviation from speciìed workîow such as reading the tag on one patient and then collecting a reading from a different patient 7 Related Work We are not aware of any prior work on formal modeling and analysis of ADIC workîows in health care but formal techniques have been applied to workîows in general there have been case studies in heath care applications and there is a signiìcant body of non-formal work on AIDC in health care Yong et al in use CSP to model and reìne workîows to prove correctness properties Puhlmann et al  use the  calculus to model workîow patterns Stafansen sho ws ho w the Calculus of Communicating Systems CCS can be used to model workîow Davulcu et al  use Concurrent T ransaction Logic CTR to specify analyze and schedule workîows Van der Alast et al  use Petri nets to model w orkîo w  Petri nets are able to model Yet Another Workîow Language\(YAWL which in turn can model a wide range of workîow patterns Barkaoui et al  use Petri nets to model v erify and improve an operating room workîow Song et al 22 provide a classiìcation of computer-aided health care workîows and workîow application issues Van der Alast et al  describes a method for nding w orkîo ws as Petri nets automatically from hospital process logs Ardissono et al  present a frame w ork for the management of context-aware workîow systems They use the framework to develop a prototype application handling medical guidelines specifying workîow for monitoring patients treated with blood thinners In our research on AIDC we attempted to use  calculus and Finite State Machines FSMs before concluding that CSP was better-suited to our needs because of its algebraic notation simple treatment of communication and its representation for internal and external choice However it is likely other models discussed above could provide good formalisms for reasoning about AIDC AIDC techniques are now being used in many different areas in the health care sector One notable area is the use of AIDC techniques for the blood management to reduce blood handling errors so that the chances of bad blood transfusions is reduced Clarke et al 7 model and verify an in-patient blood transfusion process Al Nahas et al  o v ervie w research in v arious applications of RFID-based AIDC systems in hospitals Automated identiìcation of patients pro vides more accurate and efìcient association of patients with their medical readings and the medical procedures they should undergo AIDC techniques are being deployed to provide error-free and fully-audited drug management in hospitals 4 Hospital-wide AIDC 9 10 is being investigated for tracking patients assets and staff 8 Conclusion We have introduced a methodology for modeling and analyzing AIDC workîows to provide high assurance protection envelopes Such techniques will aid the development of computer and networking systems that support AIDC in safety-critical workîows like those used in hospitals To illustrate and demonstrate the value of our approach we have designed and implemented a medical mediator system which provides RFID identiìcation using a mobile device that links to medical devices to collect patient readings and enters them automatically in the EHR of the correct patient within wellspeciìed and veriìed conditions This is the rst work on formal analysis of AIDC workîows it contributes insight into good primitives for clear speciìcations in this area and promises wide applicability Acknowledgements This work was supported in part by NSF CNS 07-16626 NSF CNS 07-16421 NSF CNS 05-24695 ONR N00014-08-1-0248 NSF CNS 05-24516 DHS 2006-CS-001-000001 and grants from the MacAruthur Foundation and Boeing Corporation Anh Nguyen was supported by a fellowship from the Vietnam Education Foundation The views expressed are those of the authors only References  FDR2\(F ailures-Di v e r gence Reìnement internet website http://www.fsel.com  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10

  12 the PL is intended to fulfill, thus many requirements and specifications that would be found in a PL design specification would need to be provided by the specific PL procurement agency. The ORS Phase III standards can be downloaded from http://projects.nrl.navy.mil/busstandards  Communications Interfaces  A key external interface for th e space segment \(bus and PL is RF communications to the ground. This topic investigated standardization for SC command and control \(C&C communications link and the tactical communication link Figure 11 presents a basic high-level view of the RF communications pathways envisioned in the standards Other issues investigated related to both current and future approaches the military is planning for RF communications including, data flow, frequency band definitions modulation techniques, data rates, communication security COMSEC\and basic defi nition of ground interface locations. Given the current maturity of the general military SC C&C network, the presen t SGLS architecture and the expected Unified S-Band \(USB\architecture were established as the standard. Fo r the tactical links, standard UHF was established for LDR application, and the Common Data Link \(CDL\ocol was established as the HDR standard Ground Support Checkout Interface In support of the rapid call-up scenario, standards for interfacing spacecraft bus and the payload, and processing the integrated space vehicle though launch, is one of the unique activities under the IS ET derived ORS system design. The need to develop an approach for this effort in sufficient detail in order to derive requirements that would influence the spacecraft bus design is critical. The approaches developed have design and manufacturing ramification on the bus, such as the ability to install batteries late in the flow, rapid \223built-in-test\224 capabilities periodic checks, and access a nd safety implications Data Interfaces: Bus to Payload and Ground This document defines the data exchange protocols, data transport formats, packet definitions and field definitions for the bus/PL interface. Underlying electrical interface for the bus/PL interface is the HDLC and SpaceWire. The bus/PL interface is defined such that the HDLC interface SpaceWire interface, or both can be used. The bus design will provide support for both interfaces. The PL may choose to implement either one or both. The bus/PL interface is defined to dynamically suppor t either or both interfaces without needing bus reconfiguration \(i.e., FSW changes This document also defines the data exchange protocols data transport and packet template for the space/ground interface. The space to ground interface definition assumes the use of a flight side SGLS transponder integrated with COMSEC slices. The SGLS forward link assumes a flightside Cardholder COMSEC slice. The SGLS return link  Figure 11 Radio Frequency Communications Architecture  


  13 assumes that the SGLS transponder supports both the narrow-band and wide-band inte rfaces. While a return link COMSEC is required, this document assumes that the return link COMSEC does not levy any blocking or packaging constraints for the return link This interface standard was developed as part of the ORS Phase 3 Bus effort. This interface standard was adopted by the ORS Phase 3 Bus and COMMx payload elements. As a result, the TACSAT-4 spacecraft implemented the encl osed interface standards for its bus to payload and space to ground interfaces This document is limited to and currently defines the interfaces between the spacecraf t bus and the payload, and between the spacecraft bus and the ground. Subsequent releases will define the add itional internal interfaces. The depth of detail required for in terface standardization and the need for coverage of additional interfaces is an ongoing assessment effort by ORS s upported standards definition efforts. The intent is to levy interface standards where these standards will lead to efficien t system integration, robust operational capabilities, and improved system flexibility while reducing overall system cost 4  C ONCLUSION  Both the STP-SIV and the ORS ISET efforts have developed standards that provide options for cost-effective capable, flexible spaceflight. Pathfinder SC buses are currently in development for both efforts and will have flight heritage within approximately one year Through the efforts of ISET and the associate prototype teams, the ORS program ha s successfully produced an extensive and well-documented set of ORS bus standards consistent with the ORS concept of operations \(CONOPS and classes of missions. The process used to produce these standards has resulted in technically sound standards which are understood, with buy in from industry. Business factors were also strongly considered to improve the transition of these standards into successful acquisition under a subsequent operational phase While ORS must provide the business foundation, these technical standards are intended to be more broadly useful in order to further volume production, standards acceptance, and the industry business cases. The ORS standards are readily available to Government organizations and payload developers SDTW employs lessons learned from decades of space flight to standardization of STP-SIV design. Flexibility is planned from the beginning and missions are adapted within the range of the SC\222s capability. Development of SC standards requires upfront investment in order to achieve a return on investment once multiple missions have been built and flown. The more PL provi ders who are willing to adopt the STP-SIV interfaces and deve lop experiments applicable to the capabilities of the SC the more successful this program will become R EFERENCES   National Research Council The Role of Small Satellites in NASA and NOAA Earth Observation Programs National Academy Press, Washington D.C., 2000  G F Squibb, \223Meeting the Needs of the Space Technology Industry,\224 ISO Focus, Oct 2005   T.

 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

As the absorption is greatly affected by the molecular structure of the material, citations should al so indicate the material as a subscript to the term 223rad\224, as in rad Si indicating Silicon equivalency.  For the purposes of this paper, radiation equivalency always assumes Silicon For completeness, it should be noted that System International replaced the \223rad\224 with the unit Gr ay \(Gy\nd having an equivalency of 100 rads = 1 Gy [27 How e v e r   the use of rads, kilorads, megarads remains in the industry vernacular and is used in this document Moore\222s Law Named after Fairchild Semiconductor technologist Gordon Moore, Moore\222s law was derived from empirical data which shows that the dimensions of basic memory cells will shrink by approximately 50% of the previous value every 30 to 36 months.
