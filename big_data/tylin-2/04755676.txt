Studying Knowledge Management System Success in System Administration  Nicole F. Velasquez The University of Arizona nicolefv@gmail.com  Alexandra Durcikova The University of Arizona alex@eller.arizona.edu  Rajiv Sabherwal University of Missouri, St. Louis sabherwal@umsl.edu   Abstract  Significant temporal and monetary costs are associated with the development and implementation of a knowledge management system KMS\. To justify this investment, it is important for organizations to 
measure the success of such systems To help achieve this objective, this paper proposes a KMS success model, which is based on prior success models for information systems \(IS\MS.  This model extends previous models by investigating two modes of KMS use … knowledge sourcing and sharing Additionally, individual im pact is extended to include both merit \(perceived usefulness\ and worth productivity\rics.  By also taking into account the effects of other knowledge sources, such as Google, email, and instant messaging, we are able to explore the contribution of KMS use.  This research in progress proposes testing the model in the context 
of s y s t em admi n i s t r at ors t echni cal exper t s w ho w o r k  in complex and dynamic environments  1. Introduction  Forty-five percent of executives surveyed as part of the Foresight 2020 study stated the belief that effective knowledge management offers the most potential for increased productivity in the next decade   bu i l d i n g an d i m pl e m en t i ng kn o w l e dg e  management systems \(KMS\ that truly improve employee productivity is difficul    Therefore, the evaluation of success or failure of these systems is of importance to both researchers 
and practitioners In general, the success of an information system IS\ prior research has been evaluated using the DeLone and McLean \(DM\odel of IS success  or its adaptations e n t h at a k n o w l ed g e  management system is a specialized type of IS, many models of KMS success are built upon these IS success models.  Recent examples include Maier  Jen n e x an d Olfm a n 1517], Ku lk arn i et al   d B o ck et al. [3].  Ou r res e arch b u ilds o n  these existing models of KMS success, but seeks to advance the literature by incorporating some additional aspects: two modes of KMS use, the 
specifics of individual impact, and the general context in which the KMS is used This research proposes the study of a KMS in the context of system administration. Systems that help improve the productivity of system administrators have become increasingly important with the human cost of system administration doubling over the past ten years and now exceeding the cost of hardware and softwa T h eref ore in v e s t i g ati ng th e e f f e ct  of KMS use on system administrator productivity is of high interest to most companies 
The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the two modes of KMS use \(knowledge sourcing and knowledge sharing\ influence individual impact perceived usefulness and productivity\in the context of system administrators work.  This paper contributes to both knowledge management research and practice by investigating 1\ how KMS use impacts relevant outcomes of system administrator s work, such as perceived usefulness and productivity 
2\ how the two types of KMS use, sourcing and sharing, influence these relevant outcomes, and 3 what the fractional benefit of KMS use on individual outcomes is while controlling for other sources of knowledge  2. Theoretical Background & Hypotheses  2.1. Measuring KMS success  DeLone and McLean presented a model of IS success grounded in information and communication theories [35, 25  T h is cau s al m odel in cl u d es s i x interrelated constructs: information quality, system 
quality, use, user satisfaction, individual impact, and organizational impact.  This model has been validated in many contexts, with most studies focusing on the individual impact of the system citing difficulties in capturing organizational impact 31  In th is m o d e l, s y ste m  q u alit y a n d in f o r m atio n  quality affect both IS use and user satisfaction, which Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 1 978-0-7695-3450-3/09 $25.00 © 2009 IEEE 


in turn affect individual impact.  Although this model does not explicitly include perceived usefulness, most studies identify perceived usefulness as an individual impact, often citing the difficulty of obtaining hard  impact measures h e portion of  th e  m odel m o s t  commonly tested, culminating in individual impact measures, is presented below in Figure 1    Figure 1. DM Model of IS Success \(1992   One significant modification of the original DM IS success model was proposed by Seddon h e main difference in these two models is the location of the IS Use construct.  Seddon stated that the use of an information system is a result of the success of the system, and is therefore placed after the success measures of Perceived Usefulness and User Satisfaction.  Seddon s modification of DM s IS success model most commonly tested is presented below in Figure 2    Figure 2. Seddon Model of IS Success \(1997   KM success models build upon either the DM IS success model or Seddon s respecification.  Jennex and Olfman \(JO pres e n t ed a KM s u cces s  m odel  based on Pitt et al s adaptation th e DM m odel  w h ic h added s e r v ice qu a l it y a s a n a n teceden t to use and user satisfaction.  The JO model adapted this extended model by expanding system quality information quality, and service quality constructs specific to KMS. Qian and Bock ild on th e JO m propos in g and em piricall y  tes t i n g a model that investigates antecedents to output quality and extends output and system quality measures to better capture KMS characteristics.  On the other hand, Kulkarni e a m odel of  KMS success based on Seddon s DM respecification extending the model by controlling for organizational support measures.  Finally, Bock te n d t h e  Seddon model by investigating the effects of social context on KMS success It is clear that in these recent KMS success models, the foundation of IS success models is intact though adapted to the nature of KMS.  While these studies have contributed to the understanding of KMS success, we see room for improvement in three areas: 1\se, 2\dividual impact, and 3\e knowledge environment in which a KMS is implemented.  We will discuss these extensions of the model in the following sections  2.2. KMS Use  When studying KM and KMS, researchers clearly define two distinct activities involved in the use of a KMS: 1\ knowledge sourcing [12 a n d 2  kno w l e d ge  sharing i n e kn o w ledg e s o u r cing as theextenttowhichindividualsintentionallyaccesseach other sexpertise, experience, insights, andopinions   ildin g  u pon t h is def i n ition of  kn o w ledg e  sourcing and the work of others [18  w e def i n e  knowledge sharing as the extent to which individuals intentionally share their expertise, experience insights, and opinions.  While some users may only source knowledge from a system e rs  m a y dominantly share their knowledge, perhaps assigned to the role of knowledge champions in their organizations [8  M a n y t i m e s  ho w e ve r  u s e r s  accept both roles and participate in both sourcing and sharing knowledge.  It is not clear, however, how these two KMS usage behaviors influence individual impact.  Therefore, there is a need to model KMS use as two behaviors performed by a user  2.2.1. Antecedents of KMS Use Based on prior IS and KMS success models, system quality and output quality affect KMS use and user satisfaction Additionally, system quality affects output quality In the context of this study, KMS use can take two forms: knowledge sourcing and knowledge sharing  System quality has been represented in KMS success research studies as searchability [3 d it is also the most frequently identified issue with KMS failure [24 If an in div i du al v i e w s a KM S as  difficult to search, that KMS would be less likely to be us h is is tru e  f o r both s o u r cing a n d sharing activities.  Why would a user spend time submitting knowledge to a system that does not appropriately retrieve it?  Furthermore, the easier it is for a user to search for knowledge in the KMS, the more satisfied the user will be with th   Moreover, good KMS searchability allows a user to access knowledge necessary to perform tasks.  If  System Quality  Information Quality   IS Use  User Satisfaction  Individual Impact System Quality Information Quality Perceived Usefulness User Satisfaction  IS Use Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 2 


two KMSs with similar knowledge content quality exist, the KMS with greater searchability will yield better output than the other  T h eref ore, h i g h  searchability positively influences output quality Consistent with previous KMS and IS success models e m pl oy ee s perceiv e  th at t h e system quality and searchability is high, it will positively impact KMS use, user satisfaction, and output quality.  Therefore, recognizing that KMS use incorporates knowledge sourcing and knowledge sharing, we hypothesize  H1a: System quality positively affects knowledge sourcing H1b: System quality positively affects knowledge sharing H1c: System quality positively affects user satisfaction H1d: System quality positively affects output quality  Information quality has been represented in KMS success research studies as output quality  knowledge content quality [19  I f a n i n d i vi d u a l i s  able to obtain good quality output from a system, he will be more likely to use the system again [6   A l s o   he will be more likely to contribute his knowledge to the KMS o n s i s ten t  w i t h prior IS an d KM S  success models, high output quality leads to high user satisfaction.  We therefore posit the following  H2a: Output quality positively affects knowledge sourcing H2b: Output quality positively affects knowledge sharing H2c: Output quality positively affects user satisfaction  Finally, previous research tells us that user satisfaction affects KMS use.  Users who are more satisfied with a KMS are more likely to us   H3a: User satisfaction positively affects knowledge sourcing H3b: User satisfaction positively affects knowledge sharing   2.3. Individual impact The dependant variable, individual impact deserves further discussion.  Due to the difficulty of capturing objective use metrics, most studies operationalize individual impact as perceived usefulness [31  W h ile pe r c e i ve d use f ulne ss i s  widely used in models s u bj ectiv e m e a s u r e s are primarily important to the end users themselves However organizations are also looking for hard measures that can be more closely tied to financial metrics Most systems are intended to improve the efficiency of end users, often with the goal of reducing labor cost y t i n en [21] an d Massey u gg e s t t h at dif f e re n t  m eas u r es o f  success are appropriate for different stakeholder groups.  Brown ti fy t w o t y pe s of success metrics for users and organizations:  merit and worth.  Merit is concerned with whether the system performs as it is supposed to and includes user experiences of the system.  Perceived usefulness is a measure of system merit and is often the success metric used in IS and KMS success studies.  Worth is concerned with whether the system has an organizational impact that justifies its cost.  Worth metrics, such as productivity, are often less important to end users, yet ultimately important to the organizations that sponsor the development and implementation of such information systems With the clear importance of both subjective merit\d objective \(worth\ measures, we propose the inclusion of both in the measurement of individual impact.  To determine the merit and worth metrics appropriate for the study of a KMS used by system administrators, we observed their work and conducted interviews  2.3.1. The work of system administrators System administration involves the installation configuration, troubleshooting, and maintenance of computing infrastructures, much of which is often at the bleeding edge Hardware and software additions to the network, firmware updates, and usage fluctuations result in a network that is constantly in flux and incredibly complex [1, 2   This continually evolving environment results in new situations and contexts every day, making even routine tasks a new challenge. The difficulty in supporting this complex infrastructure lies in simply locating the source of an error [28 d th en f i n d i n g up-to-date information about the error and its set of possible causes and solutions.  Because so many things can go wrong, much of a system administrator s time is spent defining the problem and then researching and debugging it Although much of their work is invisible to the outside world, visible manifestations of their knowledge work lies in a variety of hardware and software tasks such as: installing patches, laying cable, installing and configuring new hardware, and creating infrastructure schema h is knowledge work is most often learned on the job and through self-learning, and mastering the field of Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 3 


system administration may take several years [33    For example, one system administrator we interviewed stated that while he had done the work of system administration for almost a decade, he had only been a system administrator for the past five or six years  The system administrators targeted for this study are level 2 and higher technical support operators whose work is dictated by problem tickets and change tickets.  Problem tickets are entered in the system by supported customers in response to a system error, such as a server crashing.  Change requests are entered in the system by customers or by management to improve the system; these can include a firmware upgrade or new server installation.  One aspect of their annual performance assessment is based on the amount of tickets they resolve and their average response time on tickets Studying system administrators in this context allows us the unique opportunity to investigate their KMS use while providing discrete productivity measurements based on problem and change ticket completion As described above, this study uses two measures of individual impact.  Consistent with DM and JO models, we argue that KMS use positively influences perceived usefulness and productivity.  Following these studies, user satisfaction positively influences perceived usefulness and productivity  H4a: Knowledge sourcing positively affects the perceived usefulness of a KMS     H4b: Knowledge    sourcing    positively    affects worker productivity H4c: Knowledge  sharing  positively   affects   the perceived usefulness of a KMS H4d: Knowledge sharing positively affects worker productivity H5a: User satisfaction positively affects the perceived usefulness of a system H5b: User satisfaction positively affects worker productivity  2.4. Control variables Studies show that knowledge workers use not only knowledge repositories but also other knowledge sources to do their job [13 T h es e can  include colleagues and manuals u d ies o f  system administrator work practices have shown that they utilize knowledge management systems, Google vendor documentation, and colleagues to seek and share knowledge essential in the execution of their work [2  H o w t h e n  d o e s a  kno w l e d ge  ma na ge me nt  system affect the individual impact of system administrators in the presence of these other sources of knowledge?  In order to answer this question, we need to control for other sources of knowledge when studying the role of KMS use in KMS success In addition to controlling for other knowledge sources, our study will control for variables found significant in other studies.  These variables include incentives \(intrinsic and extrin in div i du al  characteristics \(experience and tenur  organizational characteristics \(time pressur  trus d leaders h ip [19     System Quality Output Quality KMS Use User Satisfaction Individual Impact Knowledge Sourcing Knowledge Sharing Perceived Usefulness Productivity Fi g ure 3.

3. Proposed Methodology  An international Fortune 500 company has agreed to participate in this study.  A division of this company contracts out system administration support work involved in the configuration, maintenance, and management of computing infrastructures.  All work activities are initiated through problem tickets or change tickets, as described above In an effort to improve the productivity of their system administrators, the organization has developed a knowledge management system.  This voluntary use system provides a list of tickets to be worked on, current and historical system state information, and an interface to search for solutions to similar tickets The organization employs thousands of external support system administrators and has agreed to randomly select 300 to participate in this study Survey data will be collected through online surveys and the employer will supply productivity data in Fall 2008.  Except for productivity measures, all other measures will be adopted from previous research The data will be analyzed using structural equation modeling, given that this method allows us to test complex causal models  4. Conclusion  This study proposes an extension to existing KMS success models by measuring the effects of both knowledge sharing and knowledge sourcing activities. When evaluating individual impact of KMS use we will be able to evaluate the additional contribution of KMS use when other sources of knowledge are available. Furthermore, we will also be able understand whether there is a difference in the influence of the two KMS use modes on productivity and perceived usefulness of the KMS. A better understanding of the impacts of sourcing and sharing can help us answer some interesting questions:  Are free-riders \(those that only source more productive than knowledge providers? As compared to free-riders, are knowledge providers adversely affected by spending time to share their knowledge? If so, are free-riders more satisfied with the KMS?  In regard to the context of this study, who are the more productive system administrators knowledge seekers or knowledge providers These important questions have not been adequately addressed in prior literature, and we hope that the proposed study will contribute by providing some initial answers  5.

 11  Impact \226 Strauss\222s Derivative of Moore The impact of such a simple statement is at the same time beautiful and difficult to realize.  What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.  It can be easily seen that in terms of memory technology for space, the selection is limited \226 especially so when it comes to non-volatile radiation hardened devices Part II 6  H IGH C APACITY S OLID S TATE R ECORDER  The impetus of this paper was the assignment to predict mass, power, volume, and cost for multi-terabit data recorders of the capacities shown in Table 3 with deliveries occurring in the year given [2   Table 3 - Data Recorder Capacity Requirements YEAR DATA CAPACITY 2010 2.88 Tb 2020 30 Tb 2030 130 Tb  This part of the paper presents a design of a 130 Tb NonVolatile data recorder which could be built for delivery in the year 2030, based on the information presented in Part I In developing the SSR design, technology selection was limited to the two technologies examined in detail in Part I Flash and NROM\nd a technology freeze date of 36 months in advance of delivery was assumed  SSR \226 Flash & NROM Based designs Table 4 - ITRS predicted device capacity \(Gb for three technologies Year 2015 2018 2021 2025 Technology CRAM 0.032 0.064 0.064 0.128 NROM 4 8 16 32 Flash 64 128 256 512  In this particular case, the year 2025 is selected as the freeze date and appropriate device capacity is used.  The ITRS is predicting that by the year 20 25, CRAM-based devices will have a capacity of 128 Mbit per die; NROM will have 32 Gb per die. Flash will be available at 512 Gb per die [9 Table  5 highlights the number of die necessary of three discussed technologies to achi eve a recorder of specified capacity in the timeframe given Table 5 - Minimum Device Count by Technology to achieve a Data Recorder of Specified Capacity in the Year shown.  \(Example, a 30 Tb recorder being designed in the year 2020 would require 468,750 CRAM devices or 1,875 NROM devices, or 118 Flash devices  Therefore, a 130 Tb data recorder designed using devices predicted available in the year 2030, would require the following number of devices \226 not including any additional devices used for Error Detection and Correction \(EDAC\ or sparing and word control 200  CRAM: > 1 million devices Year Recorder Capacity CRAM 4Mb NROM 1Gb Flash 16Gb 720,000 2,880 180 64Mb 16Gb 256Gb 468,750 1,875 118 128Mb 32Gb 512Gb 1.02E+06 4,063 254 Required Not Reqiured Required EDAC Technology / Device Capacity /Chip Count 2010 2020 2030 2.88 Tb 30 Tb 130 Tb 


 12  200  NROM: approx 4060 devices 200  Flash: approx 256 devices By examination, it can be easily seen that developing a high capacity data recorder as pr oposed using CRAM technology is impractical Error Detection and Correction Codes  All technologies are subject to lo ss of information, be they the loss of a single bit or the loss of an entire chip, the inclusion of Error Detection and Correction is an appropriate action by any system designer Just by using EDAC, there is an associated bit-penalty ranging from a few percentile to over 25 per cent   The exact selection of most-appropriat e Error Correction codes is highly dependent upon error phenomena not only for each  rt ain aspects of the exact part being considered as well as the environment to be encountered [2  25  F o r t h e reco rde r  de scri be d bel o w a Reed-Solomon code was selected.  It is important to note that this may not be the prime candidate, but was chosen for known characteristics Selection of a more appropri ate EDAC code [2 w oul d  most assuredly, bring about a reduction in recorder mass and power One final, important, distinction between the two prime technologies is required The NROM devices analyzed for this paper have built-in an incredibly powerful error detection and correction machine, capable of detecting four bits in error in a single word, and correcting three bits per word [10  W i t h th is m e th od t h e Bit Error Rate is calculated by the manufacturer to be less than 1.18E 19  errors/bit-day \226 equivalent to 3 unrecoverable bit errors every 550 years for the entire recorder; therefore, the package numbers presented here do not include extra devices required for EDAC other than that provided by the chip itself Table 6 - HC-SSR Basic Features 200  Redundant SpaceWire interfaces 200  Redundant Power Converters 200  Redundant Controllers/Supervisors 200  Multi-plane Non-volatile storage 200  Error detection and correction 200  Device isolation to the EDAC Word  Figure 18 - HC-SSR Conceptual Block Diagram

The recorder features cross-coupled SpaceWire interfaces as well as redundancy down to the memory plane Cross-coupled controllers w ith shared memory ensure operation without the need to re-build memory allocation tables should a fault occur Recorder Summary  Using conservative packaging techniques, two recorder designs were developed: one using Flash memory and the other using NROM.  A summary of their characteristics is provided in the tables below.  A more detailed discussion of design and implementation follows Board Design  Figure 19 - One side of 8Tb Memory Slice using NROM Technology The NROM-based solution is presented as Figure 19.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous
