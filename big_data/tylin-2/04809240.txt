generated or standalone and only the users had access to data security was not in a hardware device Should encryption keys be kept inside a big concern All this changed when computers became linked in the database or somewhere else where it is more secure networks in form of small dedicated networks to large LANs Should the granularity of encrypting data be applied to a WANs and the World Wide Web With the growth of networking database a table or a column level 2 the security of data became a big issue Data passes 
through various networks communication protocols and devices to In this paper we will focus on a security solution for protection ultimately reach to the user which has made data security of data at rest specifically protection of numeric data that increasingly important Security is becoming one of the most resides in the databases urgent challenges in database research and industry Instead of ENCRXTION building walls around servers a protective layer of encryption should be provided around specific sensitive data-items This also la Il:tlXXT allows us to define which 
data stored in databases are sensitive PLAINTEXT and thereby focusing the protection only on the sensitive data which in turn minimizes the delays or burdens on the system that 0|00012 34 ENCRYPTION 3412 4 may occur from other bulk encryption methods This paper describes a highly original and new approach of securing numeric data of databases It presents a practical ENCRPTT N PRO\(CESS solution to the problem where numeric data was converted to alphanumeric type and hence encrypted data was not possible to Figure

algorithm is named 3Kdec from its working as it the network In such situations security protocols are used encrypts numeric data which is in form of decimal using three Incase that a malicious user somehow breaches the above keys which can be changed anytime security provisions and gets access to data the only solution is scrambling the data So encrypting the data whether it is in3Kdec is a Symmetric key Block encipherment motion or at-rest is the next level of security that will make algorithm the data worthless for 
the hacker F[10 the data wortless for thehacker 10].Symmetric key algorithm is one which uses a single secret Encryption is the process of disguising data in such a way key for both encryption and decryption Encryption/Decryption to hide its substance is a very effective way to achieve security as visualized in Figure 1 and 2 above can be considered as an for data at rest Implementation of a database encryption electronic locking where sender puts the message in a box and strategy raises several important factors that must be taken into locks the box using the shared secret key receiver unlocks the 978-1-4244-2928-8/09/$25.00  2009 IEEE 1 501

Similarly the process of Decryption can be carried out as have low level of complexity and we need an algorithm used follows by the cryptanalyst who is trying to break the code to have high level of complexity This means we need to perform encryption and decryption in short span of time but at the I 15 043 9 1 0i 4 9 4  5 same time we want the intruder to run her computer infinitely if trying to break the code  R{'dE 2 4 11 73 1t 1 T 3 3 0 1 l lComplexity of program is based on two types of 21t 5 40 00 0i oi1  oresources space complexity of algorithm which refers to amount of memory needed to store the algorithm and the data and the time complexity which refers to amount of time needed to run the algorithm and get the results The time complexity of 3Kdec algorithm can be  13 lo W1 3 1315 06 lD 13 15 1 14 1 7 1 measured independent of the computer on which it is running by defining the bit-operation complexity which 2 14144 1  9 1\260 16 15 14 1 counts the number of bit operations the computer needs to perform to create the output from the input Bit operation can be defined as the time required for the computer to add subtract multiply or divide two single bits 1411 T 13  1 02 12 s 11 116 11 1 3 1 ortoperform one singlebit shift 4 For example bit operation complexity of function that 4 0 0 0 adds two integers each having d decimal digits can be calculated as d log2 10 RMu6  7 a 7 7 7 3 0 0 1 B 3Kdec Algorithm Security 2 3 11 0  1  6 111 2 4 The main strength of 3Kdec algorithm is that it converts the numeric data input to numeric data output which makes it Figure 7 Decryption Process harder to see and guess whether the input is even encrypted or not STRENGTHS OF 3KDEC  As the encryption is from numeric to numeric one 1 BruteForce attack cannot know that the information is encrypted It Also known as Exhaustive key search method tries to use all appears apossible keys As in our algorithm the three keys are expanded content as if the encrypted data is itself the original based on the number of rounds there will be 10 27 dfferent key content combinations Lack of weak keys is another advantage of  As the number of keys are more and hence the key 3Kdec algorithm combination increases to 10 27 which makes guessing of keys harder 2 Statistical Attacks  As S-Box has simple structure and variable entries so The strong confusion and diffusion provided by the the 3Kdec algorithm can be used as Personal Substitution Box lookup and Row Shift transformations Encryption Algorithm where different encryption removes any frequency pattern in the plaintext processes can be carried out with varying degree of complexity depending on the user requirements 3 DifferentialandLinearAttack  Since 3Kdec Algorithm encrypts numeric to numeric The algorithm was designed to be resilient to linear and data encrypted data is possible to be stored in the differential attacks existing numeric field thereby algorithm does not Differential cryptanalysis/Chosen-plaintext attack needs the change the data field type and set fixed data length analysis of encryption algorithm to collect information about plaintext-ciphertext relationships with the goal of finding the V 3KIDEC ALGORITHM ANALYSIS cipher key 11 The probabilistic relationship can be created from the information about the S-box input/output table Incase A 3Kdec Algorithm Complexity of 3Kdec algorithm the S-box values are not fixed and does not depend on any algebraic structure the sender may use different To analyze the computational complexity of a S-box values each time attempting to encrypt the input So the cryptographic algorithm we need an encryption algorithm to 1504U 2009 IEEE Internaftionazl Advalnce Computing Conference IA CC 2009

 10 data obtained from the industrial motor test setup. Data was acquired using the experimental fault profile in Figure 15. A snapshot of raw data, including the calculated feature values, is provided in Figure 16 Anomaly Detection\227 The particle filter framework was integrated into LabVIEW to evaluate the real-time performance of the anomaly detector during data acquisition. Shown in Figure 17 is a GUI developed in LabVIEW to manage the anomaly detector settings which include the false alarm rate \(type I error\and false alarm threshold \(type II error  Addi t i onal  confi gurat i on settings include the number of particles used by the particle filter, baseline statistics, fault model, and particle filter update / sample time The results from anomaly detector, using the data shown previously in Figure 16, are provided in Figure 18. The green line represents the confidence of detection based on the false alarm rate and the red line represents the alarm, or detection, threshold as defined earlier in Figure 17. The red dot designates the crossing point during which the red health-state light illuminates to indicate an anomaly has occurred 6  C ONCLUSION  This paper presented a particle-filter based anomaly detector capable of detecting the occurre nce of a major fault mode in its incipient stages for a safe ty critical aircraft actuation system. An overview of a ge neric PHM architecture were presented and applied to a particular EMA fault mode based on an internal FMEA study. The fault mode investigated in detail was a turn-to-turn winding insulation short for a brushless DC motor. The primary fault mode was modeled using physics-of-failure mechan isms indicating the primary failure effect, phase current asymmetry. A feature was derived using a Hilbert transform and statistical analysis to quantify the primary failure eff ect. Then, experimental data was acquired to validate the Simulink simulation model Finally, real-time evaluation of the anomaly detector was performed using LabVIEW  Although a specific system, an EMA, was selected as the test-platform with a specific fault mode, the overall PHM architecture can be applied to an entire range of systems and application domains. In fact, similar techniques which allow  Figure 16\227Plots of experimental data \(top computed features \(bottom experimental test setup using LabVIEW  Figure 17\227LabVIEW interface used to define particle filter settings Figure 18\227Plot of anomaly detection confidence \(top and health state indicator \(bottom\the experimental test setup using LabVIEW 


 11 for early fault detection dur ing acceptable performance in the presence of faults are being developed for a wide variety of system in both manned and unmanned air vehicles Therefore, the concept of usi ng system health information diagnosis and prognosis\n conjunction with reconfigurable control is at the forefront of modern space and avionics applications requiring increasingly sophisticated fault-tolerant systems that are robust, reliable and relatively inexpensive. Ther efore the need arises for a fault-tolerant control architecture to further maximize performance and extend the operating life of COTS components in future avionics systems A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  This work was performed under the United States Air Force USAF\contract number FA8650-06-C-7628.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
