The configuration has the potential to be the optimal imaging spectroscopy solution for lighter-than-air \(LTA vehicles, unmanned aerial vehi cles \(UAV platforms due to its small form factor and relatively low power requirements.

25.00 \2512009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC paper#1583 Version 2, Updated 2009:01:09 In late 2006, JPL began the development of a breadboard thermal infrared line-spectrometer named the Quantum Well infrared photodetector Earth Science Testbed QWEST\o end laboratory demonstration of both the thermal Dyson spectrometer as well as the quantum well infrared focal plane technology. The testbed is a precursor to the airborne version under development referred to as the hyperspectral thermal emission spectrometer \(HyTES\and funded by the NASA Instrument Incubator Program \(IIP\The curre nt effort brings together numerous in-house specialties such as optical design and general spectrometer alignment optimization, precision slit 
fabrication, high efficiency and low scatter concave diffraction grating design and fabrication, precision mechanical and machining capability and quantum well infrared photo detectors \(QWIP\ plane arrays The long wave infrared \(LWIR\ is typically expressed as the wavelength range between 7 and 14 \265m. Our current demonstration instrument operates between 8-9 \265m and the planned airborne instrument will operate between  8 and12 265m. Spectral information from this wavelength range is extremely valuable for  Ea rth Science research. The airborne instrument will be us ed in support of the HyspIRI mission which was recently recommended by the National Research Council in their Decadal Survey. The LWIR 
component of the HyspIRI mission will address science questions in five main science themes Volcanoes What are the changes in the behavior of active volcanoes Can we quantify the amount of material released into the atmosphere by volcanoes and estimate its impact on Earth's climate? How can we help predict and mitigate volcanic hazards Wildfires What is the impact of global biomass burning on the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere, and how is this impact changing over time Water Use and Availability As global freshwater supplies become increasingly limited how can we better characterize trends in local and regional 


  2 water use and moisture availability to help conserve this critical resource Urbanization How does urbanization affect the local, regional and global environment? Can we character ize this effect to help mitigate its impact on human health and welfare Land surface composition and change What is the composition and temperature of the exposed surface of the Earth? How do these factors change over time and affect land use and habitability The QWEST testbed is providing enabling technology for the development of a fully operational airborne platform suitable for earth science studies. It will have sufficient spatial and spectral resolution to allow scientists to acquire the necessary data to aid in the planning future spaceborne missions 2  O PTICAL DESIGN  Concentric designs allow a point to be mapped perfectly to a focal plane array. Past and future planned imaging spectrometer systems have su ccessfully implemented the Offner 3,4 design. The idea behind the Offner concentric design was to provide a relay unit magnifier to alleviate distortion and third order system aberrations while having an accessible object and image plane. The first published supplementary idea for an all reflecting or 2-mirror concentric imaging spectrometer was cast by Thevenon and Mertz 5 Subsequent work was also done by Kwo 6  and Lobb 7 A concentric design like the Offner is well-suited to pushbrooom spectrometers. Smile and keystone distortion are nearly eliminated using proper alignment and design techniques Although an excellent performer, for the TIR the Offner design would be relatively large and would require a bulky temperature controlled dewar and large power supplies to maintain adequate thermal control. J. Dyson 8 published a paper in 1959 outlining a Seidel corrected unit magnifier which was composed of a single lens and concave mirror. It was to be used to project groups of lines for emulsion photography and also phase contrast microscopy. Mertz also proposed the Dyson principle in the same paper where he discussed the Offner. Wynne 9 proposed a Dyson design for microlithography in the visible and ultraviolet and Mouroulis 10,11 et al. considered Dyson designs for visible spectrometry and for coastal ocean applications. A thorough treatment of these designs as well as an operational thermal infrared system is describe d in work by Warren et al 12  Kuester 13 et al. discuss an airborne platform which uses a visible transmitting Dyson      Figure 1 Larger Offner \(bottom\aller Dyson \(top designs for comparable F/#\222s and slit width Our effort uses the same principle but extends the Dyson design to work optimally with the LWIR.  The savings in physical size for similar F/# syst ems is dramatic as shown in figure 2. QWEST was designed to minimize smile and keystone distortion 14 while simultaneously virtually eliminating ghosting. The slit width is 50 265 m, which corresponds to two detector pixels. Smile and keystone distortions were kept to no more than 1-2% of this or ~2 265 m JPL can fabricate ultra precision slits using reactive ion etching which can be kept straight to an order of magnitude better than this [do you mean figure 2 For t h i s reason t h e slit straightness is not typically the limiting factor in spectrometer performance. As shown in figure 1[2  a single monolithic block is us ed in double pass where light from the slit enters at a narrow optical passageway and is transmitted through the rear pow er surface, diffracts off the grating and re-enters the block to totally internally reflect off the back surface which gui des the spectrally dispersed radiation to focus at the QWIP location. This design minimizes the travel and form factor of the system. The actual block fabricated is shown in figure 3. Broadband area coatings are used on all applicable light transmitting surfaces. The coatings allow 99.5% or better LWIR light to transmit. The block was fabricated from ZnSe, a robust material with a transparent wavelength region from 0.4 ~ 23 265m and an absorption coefficient between 10 3 cm 1 and 10 4 cm 1 The ZnSe slab is produced by chemical vapor deposition

Th is is the first integration of the QWIP with a spectrometer system for earth science studies requiring accurate ly calibrated data The detector pixel pitch of the FPA is 25 m and the actual pixel area is 23x23 m. Indium bumps were evaporated on top of the detectors for hybrid ization with a silicon readout integrated circuit \(ROIC\IP FPAs were hybridized \(via indium bump-bonding process\to a 640x512 pixel complementary metal-oxide semiconductor CMOS\ROIC and biased at VB = \2261.25 V. At temperatures below 72 K, the signal-to-noise ratio of the system is limited by array nonuniformity, readout multiplexer \(i.e., ROIC and photocurrent \(photon flux\se. At temperatures above 72 K, the temporal noise due to the dark current becomes the limitation.  We are currently running the system at 40K to have a SNR advantage. The QWIP is known for its high spatial uniformity \(<0.51%\This is a clear advantage over other detector technologies such as HgCdTe and InSb. A custom made LCC and titanium FPA clamp was designed to accommodate the close proximity mm\222s the ZnSe block as shown in figure 4     Figure 4 QWIP and custom made clamp assembly to hold QWIP and leadless chip carrier \(LCC 4 DIFFRACTION GRATING  Diffraction grating design and fabrication is a key enabling technology for these spectrometers.  JPL has developed electron-beam lithography techniques that allow fabrication of precisely blazed gratings on curved substrates having several millimeters of height variation 18,19,20 Gratings fabricated in this manner provide high efficiency combined with low scatter.  The blazed grating for this LWIR Dyson spectrometer was fabricated in a thin layer of PMMA electron-beam resist coated on a diamond-turned concave ZnSe substrate.  After exposure and development to the desired blaze angle, the resist was overcoated with gold for maximum infrared reflectance.  A photograph of the grating and the simulated efficiency of the fabricated grating are shown in Fig. 5.  The design was optimized for maximum efficiency in the -1 order, and the other orders remain relatively weak across the ba nd. The grating in correct system orientation is shown in figure 6

A U.S. quarter \(diameter ~24 mm\s shown for size comparison 5 SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS AND RESULTS  The main goal of this effort was to show as a proof of concept that high quality data can be obtained using the combination of Dyson spectrometer with QWIP detector Total system isolation from stray light past the spectrometer slit was established by cryogenically cooling all optomechanical structures to 40K This is reasonable due to the small form factor of the system. Currently, stray light analysis using FRED \(Photon Engineering, LLC\s being performed to assess further di rection in design for HyTES First light data reductions are presented for QWEST and look very promising. Excellent spectral signal linearity as well as spectral noise equivalent delta temperature \(NEdT are observed for the peak QWIP sensitivity region surrounding 8.3 265 m while these response characteristics over the entire band are very reasonable considering the QWIP quantum efficiency \(QE\l-off on either side The basic specifications of QWEST and HyTES are shown in figure 7a with a schematic of the instrument in figure 7b Both systems will use large format detectors and have large spatial swath widths. The current optical design and grating works for the entire 8-12 265 m regime but the existing QWIP FPA which is being used for preliminary testing in QWEST is only sensitive from 8-9 265 m. The broadband QWIP installation is currently underway and results will be presented in future publications. The close proximity of all electro-optical components can be appreciated in figure 8 This shows the ZnSe block and hardware in nearly its final configuration a  b  Figure 7 a\ specifications for QWEST and expected for HyTES and b\atic concept of Dyson spectrometer 


  5   Figure 8 Dyson spectrometer testbed in dewar environment A spectral calibration was performed using narrowband interference filters. This is an easy way to determine the position of the spectral bands and verify the full width at half maximum. Measured Gaussian filter functions are shown in figure 9. For radiometric performance, a NIST traceable transfer calibration is performed on our electrooptic blackbody to verify its performance between the two end bracket temperatures of 5C and 30C. JPL has multiple NIST traceable blackbodies with a stability at 25 C of 0.0007 C and a thermistor standard probe with an accuracy of 0.0015 \260 C over 0-60 \260 C and stability/yr of 0.005. A transfer calibration of the NIST traceable blackbody with the one used for the tests was performed in a ramp and soak mode where the blackbody temperature is increased by a set interval and allowed to soak for several minutes and then the temperature is measured. We use a 2-point nonuniformity correction 21,22,23 where 5C and 30C are used to bracket the temperature range. The blackbody is ramped from 5C to 30C and then is left to drift in 5C increments to finally end up back at 5C. Fram es are taken at each interval to check for both temporal artifacts as well as single frame noise equivalent temperature difference per spectral band as well as determining any spectral non-linearity   Figure 9 Narrowband spectral calibration filter response Two tests were performed to characterize the instrument performance. Test one was for spectral linearity while the other determined the spectral noise equivalent delta temperature \(NEdT\gure 10 shows that QWEST has very good linearity with many temperature measurements showing absolute errors below 0.1C.  Figure 10 shows the noise equivalent delta temperature for spectral channels at blackbody temperatures between 5C and 30C. This implies that for a given temperature between this range QWEST has a mean NEdT of 124.7mK     Figure 10 Basic QWEST linearity \(l.\art plotted with respect to straight line, \(r actual readings and absolute 


  6 error    Figure 11 Noise equivalent temperature difference. The distribution is shown for all spectral channels irrespective of blackbody temperature measured. Measurements were made for a calibrated blackbody between 5C and 30C A room-temperature piece of known polyethylene was placed in front of a cold \(dar k\aged with QWEST indoors. This was done to measure the emission from the known polyethylene source. It also allows understanding of how QWEST radiometric characterization translates into real data. The raw data is divided by a calibrated blackbody at some temperature. Figure 12 shows the derived emissivity relative to the blackbody. Some slight bloating is found of the peak near 8 265 m of the spectral emissivity response function, and this is attributed to a slight defocus error of the instrument spectral response function  Figure 12 Emissivity spectra from miscellaneous polyurethane source The current system is being operated outdoors under direct sunlight to understand and characterize the science usefulness of the instrument towards remote sensing earth science applications. The data shown is using an integration time of 30ms and observed at roughly noon time \(Pacific Standard Time\gure 13 shows radiance calculated for a gold standard. This plot shows atmospheric water band absorption and appears to be both spectrally and radiometrically accurate  Figure 13 Radiance of gold standard with superimposed atmospheric bands as measured in direct sunlight This data is then used in part to further reduce data taken with the system in direct sunlight. As shown in figure 14 Quartz deposits within Ottawa sand are found with the following apparent emissivity. This compares favorably with previously taken data 24   Figure 14 Apparent emissivity of quartz as measured by QWEST in direct sunlight 6  R EMARKS  A small form factor long wave infrared Dyson spectrometer using a QWIP focal plane array has been demonstrated. The main advantage of the QWIP technology is its excellent Mean Spectral NEdT: 124.7mK 


  7 spatial uniformity \(< 0.5%\Preliminary results show measured NEdT and linearity are excellent. The same spectrometer performance over the nominal LWIR bandpass 8-12um\s expected once the broadband QWIP installation is completed. Future effort will start to optimize the system using alignment techniques  \(both cold in rotation and using temperature cycles\o achieve required smile and keystone performance, install the broadband 8-12um QWIP focal plane array, perform field work to support the earth science testbed effort and begin the transition to a cryocooler airborne instrument Strain-layer super lattice detectors 25 which are also being fabricated at JPL have the potential of offering similar uniformity but with a higher operating temperature and higher QE. Future Dyson platforms may be able to take advantage of this technology as well 7  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  We would like to thank the AVIRIS team \(R. Green, M Eastwood, M. Hernandez, C. Kurzweil, M.

Hence, the proposition \(P3.2\ that diversityrelated AA complexity leads to higher IT costs is not supported  Impacts of deviation-related AA complexity   Regarding deviation from the standard OS, a MannWhitney U test \(Table 6\revealed no significant difference between the maintenance costs and operations costs for standard-compliant \(Md=83,581 n=94 for operations cost and Md=148,300; n=113 for maintenance cost\nd non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=38 for operations cost and Md=166,400; n=39 for maintenance cost z=-1.921, p=.055 for operations cost and U=2116 z=-.371, p=.711 for maintenance cost Concerning deviation from the standard DBMS, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 6\ealed a significant difference between maintenance costs for standardcompliant \(Md=373,100; n=59\d non-standardcompliant applications \(Md=170,200; n=58 U=1303, z=-2.231, p=.026. It is remarkable that the non-compliant applications had lower maintenance costs than the compliant applications. The difference between operations costs for compliant Md=109,978; n=51\d non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=50\s not significant, U=1196.5 z=-.533, p=.594 Thus, the proposition \(P3.3\at application that deviate from technology standards incur higher IT costs is not supported. In contrast, for DBMSstandard deviation, we observed significantly lower maintenance cost for non-compliant than for compliant applications  Impacts of overlap/redundancy-related AA complexity a Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 7\ showed significant differences in operations costs across the applications with a low \(less than 34 overlaps Md=90,442; n=37\edium \(35-79 overlaps Md=55,770; n=56\ and high level of overlap/redundancy \(more than 80 overlaps Md=129,985; n=61 6.862, p=.032. It is striking to see that the applications with medium overlaps have a lower median operations cost than those with a low or high-level of overlap, implying a non-linear U-shape relation between overlap and operations cost. Interestingly, the same holds true for maintenance cost. Applications with a low degree of overlap exhibited a median maintenance cost of 96,600 \(n=59\, those with a medium level of overlap incurred a median of 81,300 \(n=58\d highly overlapping applications a median of 248,700 \(n=67 9.791, p=.007. Hence, the proposition \(P3.4\at applications with a greater degree of overlap also exhibit higher IT costs is not supported  Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 12
