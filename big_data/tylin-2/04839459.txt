Christian.Servais@ulg.ac.be Abstract\227 The MATMOS Fourier Transform Infrared FTIR spectrometer is a concept instrument designed to measure the Mars atmospheric composition using solar occultation from orbit MATMOS requires high sampling rate up to 300 kHz high dynamic range up to 22 bits data acquisition to record time-domain interferograms which get converted to spectra on-board the spacecraft Our previous work presented a system that utilized the Xilinx Virtex-4FX hybrid-FPGA to process raw interferogram data in a mixed HW/SW environment We are now expanding the role of the FPGA to the analog data acquisition domain by interfacing it to high bandwidth high data rate analog-to-digital converters The quality of the collected data is veri\002ed by recording ground-based solar spectra with the existing JPL MkIV interferometer using the new acquisition system in parallel with the standard MkIV electron

Virtex-4FX V4FX hybrid-FPGA We focused our work on optimizing time-consuming 003oating-point calculations necessary for processing and compression of MATMOS 1 data prior to downlink Independently targeting single-precision and double-precision 003oating-point arithmetic in both hardware and software domains we demonstrated a more than 8x reduction in execution time when compared to an unoptimized software-only implementation on the FPGA's embedded PowerPC 405 processor However this still lagged behind the 003ight-proven space processor the BAE RAD750 In the past year we have re-targeted the FTIR spectrometry algorithm to the newly released Xilinx Virtex-5FXT V5FXT hybrid-FPGA This new platform brings many enhancements over its predecessor including a new processor more cache and better memory interfaces An improved aux 
iliary processor unit APU controller and 003oating-point unit FPU were most signi\002cant in helping us achieve nearly 5x improvement over the V4FX implementation With many software and hardware optimizations yet to be explored the performance of the V5FXT system is already showing better execution times than the BAE RAD750 Furthermore Xilinx's current efforts in developing a radiation hardened by design FPGA known as SIRF Single-Event-Immune Recon\002gurable FPGA are putting the V5FXT on a direct path to 003ight In addition to transitioning our development to the V5FXT 1 M ars Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy MATMOS 1 


FPGA we have also focused on implementing the control and d ata acquisition architecture for interfacing with an analogto-digital converter ADC The ADC is a critical component of any instrument that collects data from the surrounding environment and it is the frontend to all Fourier Transform Spectrometers FTS such as MATMOS Our work targets the Analog Devices AD7760 ADC for its high dynamic range high bandwidth and high data-rate acquisition all of which are necessary for our application To the best of our knowledge this is the 002rst and only ADC that would make MATMOS data acquisition possible given the required sampling rates and dynamic range A dual-channel system using two AD7760s connected to one V5FXT has been con\002gured to record ground-based solar spectra with the existing JPL MkIV interferometer as the MA TMOS FTS has not been built yet The MkIV feeds analog signals to the AD7760/V5FXT system and to its standard electronics The quality of the data acquisition is compared between the two systems This paper overviews the performance of the MATMOS FTIR spectrometry algorithm on the V5FXT FPGA and compares it with our last year's work on the V4FX FPGA However the core focus is on the design simulation and testing of a dualchannel analog signal acquisition system that would provide the data input to the MATMOS algorithm 2 I NSTRUMENT O VERVIEW The MATMOS instrument measures the 850-4300 cm 000 1 region of the infra-red spectrum of sunlight as it shines through the Martian atmosphere Figure 1 This measurement is done at a high spectral resolution of 0.02 cm 000 1 necessary to identify certain trace gases such as CH 4 and N 2 O that might be produced by life or volcanism MATMOS records roughly 26 spectra per occultation with each containing 172,500 spectral elements There are two occultations per orbit one for sunrise and one for sunset Figure 2 The duration of an occultation is between 78 and 169 seconds thus requiring that each spectrum be collected in 3.0 to 6.5 seconds The spectrum is recorded with a Fourier Transform Spectrometer FTS a Michelson interferometer in which the optical path difference of light rays is continuously varied with moving mirrors Using photovoltaic detectors this modulated light is converted to an electric signal known as an interferogram The MATMOS FTS utilizes three separate detectors to collect occultation spectra An HgCdTe detector is used for the long wavelengths 12 026 m to 5 026 m and an InSb detector collects the short wavelengths 5 026 m to 2 026 m A Ge detector records the reference laser interferogram used internally to the FTS to measure the path difference MATMOS uses a variant of the Brault method for interferogram sampling whereby the laser and IR are digitized together at equal increments of time This simpli\002es the signal chains greatly and allows for the use of delta-sigma ADCs For each orbit the three detectors produce 659 Mbytes of raw data that must be processed and compressed prior to downlink Figure 1   A conceptual drawing of the spacecraft with the MATMOS instrument gathering data through the Martian atmosphere as it points towards the Sun Figure 2   The spacecraft sees two solar occultations per orbit sunset shown above 3 A LGORITHM P ERFORMANCE  C OMPARING V IRTEX 5 TO V IRTEX 4 MATMOS FTIR data processing consists of 002ve steps interferogram re-sampling phase correction FFT spectra averaging and lossless compression Table 1 These steps are necessary in order to reduce the volume of data to be transmitted to Earth from 659 Mbytes down to 8 Mbytes For performance analysis the focus is on interferogram re-sampling phase correction and FFT as these steps are the most time consuming Software and Hardware Preparation The FTIR software is written entirely in Fortran Using the Fortran-to-C f2c converter and its supporting libraries the source is ported to the FPGA's embedded processor This produces code that can be compiled using the tools provided with Xilinx Platform Studio XPS Since FTIR spectrometry makes use of 003oating-point arith2

lection Figure 5   V5FXT 5 x 2 crossbar switch Besides the MCI memory controller two other important IP cores in XPS 10.1 are the new PLB 4.6 bus and the V5APU-FPU The PLB 4.6 is an upgrade to the previously used PLB 3.4 Both version are based on IBM's CoreConnect bus infrastructure The main difference between the two is the bit width PLB 3.4 is 64 bits while PLB 4.6 is 128 bits This means more ef\002cient data transfer and higher data rates Older 64 and 32 bit peripheral are still supported on PLB 4.6 with dynamic bus resizing The V5-APU-FPU core is an improved 003oating-point unit compared to the V4 version with many enhancements and bug 002xes This core connects to the APU controller as a coprocessor with access to the CPU instruction pipeline In the V4FX bugs in the silicon prevented the APU from operating at its full capability thus pulling down the FPU clock frequency with it Furthermore the V4-APU-FPU itself had issues that prevented it from operating at more than 1:2 clock ratio to the APU via the FCB Altogether the V4FX FPU ran with much lower performance than it was designed for These issues have been taken care of in the V5FXT silicon and the new V5-APU-FPU demonstrates a 2x-3x performance improvement over its predecessor In addition while the V4-APU-FPU was only available as a single-precision unit the V5-APU-FPU is available in both single and doubleprecision as well as low latency and high speed modes dependent on CPU/FCB clock ratio  It is due to the enhancements mentioned in the paragraphs above that the V5FXT FTIR system has much lower execution time compared to the V4FX system However the V5FXT build shown in Figure 4 has alternate con\002gurations which tweak the CPU/FCB frequencies and FPU features to achieve even better performance Further Optimizations Two alternate con\002gurations for the FTIR system were tried on the ML507 board see Table 4 In both con\002gurations the CPU frequency was increased to a maximum stable frequency of 400 MHz This allowed for the FCB frequency to be increased to 200 MHz The FPU was switched to a high speed con\002guration as opposed to a low latency con\002guration in the previous build These rate increases had a very positive re\003ection on the execution times enabling the FTIR system to achieve over 3x speedup compared to last year's ML410 system Table 4  FTIR system on ML507 board with alternate con\002guration showing speedup over ML410 system Dev Board ML507 ML507 Xilinx FPGA V5FX70T V5FX70T Processor PPC440 PPC440 CPU Frequency 400 MHz 400 MHz FPU Type single HS double HS FPU Frequency 200 MHz 200 MHz Per\003ib Type 227 227 Execution Time Statistics Software Component Time sec Time sec Re-sampling 50.0128 31.1235 Step Speedup 3.0229 4.8575 Spectrum Phase Corr FFT 3.1896 3.3456 Step Speedup 4.5044 4.2944 TOTAL 53.2024 97.2438 NET SPEEDUP a 3.1117 4.8028 Resource Utilization Number of occupied slices 2156/11200 2857/11200 Number of BlockRAMs 4  148 4  148 Number of DSP slices 3  128 13  128 Post Synthesis Clock Target  Limit MHz FPU 200  219.8 200  209.8 DDR2 Memory Controller 200  204.8 200  204.8 Processor 400  406.0 400  406.0 System clock oscillator 100  106.7 100  102.5 a T he speedup shown is in relation to the ML410 system in Table 2 In addition to increasing the CPU frequency the FPU type in one of the alternate con\002gurations was changed from singleprecision to double-precision Although a strong effort was made to eliminate much of the double-precision arithmetic from the MATMOS FTIR algorithm some of these computations still remained This was the motivation for evaluating the system performance with a double-precision FPU Of course double-precision optimization via the Per\003ib collection was disabled not to interfere with hardware 003oatingpoint of\003oad The execution time with this single change decreased dramatically achieving nearly a 5x speedup over 5 


the ML410 system This showed that the resampling port ion of the FTIR algorithm was still heavily reliant on doubleprecision arithmetic and con\002rmed that the phase correction and FFT steps were single-precision based The change to a double-precision FPU required a signi\002cant amount of addition DSP slices 4 AD7760 C ONTROLLER D ESIGN Complementing the work of porting FTIR spectrometry algorithm to the new V5FXT FPGA a large portion of the effort in the past year focused on designing and implementing a controller and appropriate system architecture for interfacing with an Analog Devices AD7760 ADC The AD7760 is a 24 bit 2.5 Msamples  sec Msps 100 dB Sigma-Delta ADC To the best of our knowledge it is the 002rst and currently the only ADC that provides the dynamic range and sampling rate that is required for the MATMOS FTS The AD7760 ADC is evaluated using the EVAL-AD7760 kit This kit comes with the ADC on a board which allows for direct access to its control and data lines via 12 pin and 16 pin headers respectively This is very convenient for developing and interfacing to the ML507 board which also has easily accessible pin headers The AD7760 is a feature packed device offering a selection of decimation rates from 8x to 256x and custom 3-stage FIR 002ltering At the maximum clock frequency of 40 MHz the 8x decimation fully 002ltered mode outputs data at a rate of 2.5 Msps The AD7760 can also be placed in un\002ltered modulator output mode where 16 bit data is output directly from the 006 001 modulator at a rate of 20 Msps Multiple chips can be synchronized via a shared control signal The interface to the AD7760 is via a 2.5V level single-ended I/O The AD7760 is provided with an external clock source and is controlled by various handshaking lines A 16-bit bidirectional bus is used to transfer digitized samples from the ADC as well as commands to the ADC The EVAL-AD7760 board provides buffers 4 that switch this bus in different directions tri-state Design and Simulation The AD7760 controller and surrounding logic is written in VHDL Counters are used inside the state machine in order to switch handshaking signals at the right time after edge transitions to meet timing requirements speci\002ed in the datasheet The controller is designed to work off a 200 MHz or a 100 MHz clock These frequencies were selected since they provide the level of granularity needed for the state machine counters to precisely meet the timing speci\002cations of the AD7760 These are also very convenient frequencies to 4 T his board came populated with Analog Devices ADG3308 bidirectional logic level translators These buffers however can't meet the fast signal switching requirements of the AD7760 We had to replace these buffers with Fairchild 74ALVC245 low voltage bidirectional transceivers work with from the system level perspective since the ML507 board comes with a 100 MHz oscillator from which other frequencies are generated via DCMs and PLLs At the high frequency 200 MHz the controller core is intended to interface with the ADC running at 40 MHz Similarly when a 100 MHz clock is provided to the core it is intended to interface with the ADC running at 20 MHz Before verifying the VHDL controller design the AD7760 was 002rst evaluated using the provided Black\002n ADSP-BF537 EZ-KIT Lite In this setup a Black\002n DSP board is used to capture data from the AD7760 and send it to an attached computer for display in a LabView window Using this con\002guration a data capture was taken with the AD7760 gathering data from a function generator outputting a sine wave A single cycle of this wave was extracted and saved for use in the controller core simulation The AD7760 controller core was simulated in Mentor Graphics ModelSim 6.3f SE The analog input signal to the simulation was read from a 002le containing the data capture mentioned above A testbench written for the controller exercised its functionality by simulating AD7760 turning on/off and switching decimation rates In order to provide realistic feedback to these control commands an AD7760 emulator core was also developed This core mimics the behavior of the AD7760 by outputting simulated data at the requested decimation rates Figure 6 below shows the output of a simulation turning on the AD7760 and sweeping its decimation from modulator output mode 20 Msps to 32x 625 Ksps Figure 6  ModelSim simulation of decimation sweep for AD7760 controller  emulator cores Hardware Integration To verify the controller design in hardware and prepare for instrument integration the emulator core used in the ModelSim simulation was slightly modi\002ed to decouple it from its 002leread frontend so that it too can be implemented in the FPGA fabric A static ROM block containing previously recorded AD7760 digitized output was implemented in the FPGA fabric and fed into the emulator core This allows for a very robust testing environment where the integration of the AD7760 controller into the overall system can be veri\002ed without connecting the EVAL-AD7760 board hosting the chip itself the emulator core provides this functionality Once

  Figure 7   System Integration of AD7760 Controller out of the design and the AD7760 controller core signals fed directly out of the FPGA to pins connected to the EVALAD7760 board see Figure 7 Quite some thought was given to the question of how to handle the data coming out of the AD7760 controller core The architecture chosen in response to this question is based on an interrupt-driven design with Ethernet and compact 003ash CF interfaces The controller core itself sits on the PLB as a slave to the CPU The following are the main steps in the data path 017 The AD7760 is con\002gured for the correct decimation rate and synchronized with other channels data acquisition begins 017 The AD7760 controller core writes its digitized 24 bit samples 8 bit status to a 1024 x 32 FIFO 4 KB 017 Every 372 samples 5  the controller core raises an interrupt line to the system interrupt controller 017 The interrupt controller notices the IRQ evaluates its priority and noti\002es the CPU of a pending interrupt 017 The CPU jumps to an interrupt service routine that copies the data from the FIFO to external memory 226 The data is transmitted over gigabit Ethernet as a UDP packet OR\226 The data is saved in memory until a suf\002cient amount is collected at which point it is written to the CF card 017 A PC is used to read back the data 226 The data is viewed in real time using a Matlab program with UDP connectivity OR\226 The data is read from a large 002le from the CF card 5 T his number of samples was chosen because it approaches the 1500 byte limit for data sent in non-fragmented UDP packets i.e no jumbo frames Two complete sets of 372 samples 002t with some margin into a 4 KB FIFO which acts as a double buffer This architecture is presented in Figure 7 At least two channels are needed for a MATMOS-like con\002guration one for the reference laser and at least one for a detector Integration of additional channels is trivial requiring additional AD7760 controller cores connected to the PLB with interrupt lines to the same system-wide interrupt controller and of course a dedicated set of external I/O One important point to make about this architecture is that it is fully compatible with both the V4FX and the V5FXT FPGAs The same controller and emulator pair can be used for either family of FPGAs System Deployment and Veri\002cation For veri\002cation purposes a dual-channel V5FXT/AD7760 system is deployed with a function generator providing the same input to both channels The idea here is to determine three things 1 Can each channel properly digitize the wave being generated 2 Can the system handle different decimation rates without lagging behind 3 Can both channels be synchronized so that the same sample is acquired at the same time The 002rst point is a good check to verify that the FPGA pinouts are speci\002ed correctly and no bits are swapped This check did show us that in our 002rst build we indeed had some swapped pins in our data line This was an easy 002x The second point is one that gave us the most trouble In our initial test runs we relied on of\003oading digitized ADC data 7 


from the FPGA via UDP packets over a direct gigabit Ethern et connection to a PC running a Matlab acquisition program All seemed to work 002ne until we either decreased the decimation thus increasing the data rate over Ethernet or ran long acquisition sessions The ADC input was a sine wave coming from a function generator Looking at the data collected with Matlab we could see that points were being dropped from the sine wave that we fed into the ADC Checking the data rate over Ethernet with a packet sniffer it was observed that the peak rate was only 100 Mbps even though the bandwidth of the connection was 1Gbps But even at decimation rates that could be handled with a 100 Mbps throughput data points were being dropped sooner or later in the acquisition The reason for the lower-than-expected throughput is most likely a combination of the overhead of packetizing the data into UDP packets and computing checksums and the underlying implementation of the IP stack that we used in our system We relied on lwIP Lightweight TCP/IP Stack distributed by Xilinx and designed by Adam Dunkels Swedish Institute of Computer Science to pro vide the dri v ers necessary for UDP communication However as suggested by many user forums it may not run at its full potential on the embedded processor in Xilinx FPGAs Furthermore the receiving PC running a Matlab acquisition program can also be slowing down the communication causing the input rate into the AD7760 controller core FIFO to exceed the output rate Due to the issues experienced on longer acquisition runs using UDP over Ethernet to facilitate FPGA data of\003oad we decided to record a 002xed amount of digitized data directly to a compact 003ash card connected to the development board This method has the bene\002t of easing the load on the CPU as all it needs to do is read the AD7760 controller core FIFO and store that data into external RAM When a speci\002ed amount of data is present in external RAM the CPU stops data acquisition and writes the collected samples to the compact 003ash card Of course the drawback is that we no longer have a 223real-time\224 data acquisition system Furthermore the Xilinx drivers provided for accessing the compact 003ash card are very slow in writing data to a FAT 002lesystem Nevertheless with this method clean and long data captures became possible Synchronization was the last crucial point to check For an FTS synchronization between the signal beam and a reference channel are absolutely critical in order to obtain meaningful data To check for good synchronization in our dualchannel system we simply plotted the data acquired from both channels which comes from the same function generator against each other in order to observe a 1:1 ratio If the signals are not synchronized we would see various patterns or missing points in an otherwise diagonal line passing through the origin 5 M K IV D ATA A CQUISITION To ensure that the AD7760 meets all the requirements of the FTIR data acquisition we have recorded solar interferograms with an existing instrument the JPL MkIV spectrometer designed for stratospheric balloon observations of sunset and sunrise The MkIV optical laboratory includes a coelostat that brings sunlight to the spectrometer for ground-based tests and measurements This allowed us to perform an end-to-end test of our recording system including full veri\002cation of the synchronization between the two ADC channels one for the reference laser and one for the IR signal beam In our lab setup shown in Figure 8\(a we have connected the data acquisition system to the MkIV spectrometer Our FPGA development board Xilinx ML507 has enough I/O to accommodate collecting data from two AD7760 evaluation boards As shown in Figure 8\(b we connect these boards to the output of InSb and reference laser channels Control of the data acquisition process is administered via an RS232 link to a lab computer a acquisition system with the JPL MkIV spectrometer b chain setup showing FPGA and AD7760 boards F igure 8  MkIV data acquisition An interferometer produces an output in the form of a DC term plus AC modulation the signal never goes negative since the lowest possible value is that of total darkness at zero volts It is important to avoid AC coupling and preserve the DC term because the low frequency variations of this DC 8

The variables for the coverage of the products and processes were not included in this test because the overlap was computed using these two variables implying that there is a significant relation between the respective variables\his lends some support to proposition P2.4 stating that involvement of more users leads to greater overlap of applications. The proposition that older applications also exhibit a higher degree of overlap was not supported \(P1.4  A.2. Results from analyzing impacts of AA complexity  Impacts of interdependency-related AA complexity A Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 4\ealed a statistically significant difference in operations cost as well as maintenance cost across the three different interdependency-groups of applications. The more interdependent group \(i.e. applications with 3-7 or with 8 or more interfaces\igher median of operations \(Md=119,000 and 363,000 EUR respectively\ and maintenance costs \(Md=326,000 and 506,000 EUR respectively\ than the less interdependent group \(fewer than 3 interfaces applications \(Md=52,000 EUR operations costs and 64,000 EUR maintenance costs\.

The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=166,400; n=121 vs Md=116,900; n =31\782, z=-.43; p=.668 To measure DBMS-related diversity, a MannWhitney U test was conducted \(Table 5\d revealed no significance difference in operations costs of more Md=129,985; n=85\d less diverse applications Md=154,777; n=16\5, z=-.237, p=.813. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=210,500 n=98 vs. Md=245,700; n=19\36, z=-.704 p=.481. Hence, the proposition \(P3.2\ that diversityrelated AA complexity leads to higher IT costs is not supported  Impacts of deviation-related AA complexity   Regarding deviation from the standard OS, a MannWhitney U test \(Table 6\revealed no significant difference between the maintenance costs and operations costs for standard-compliant \(Md=83,581 n=94 for operations cost and Md=148,300; n=113 for maintenance cost\nd non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=38 for operations cost and Md=166,400; n=39 for maintenance cost z=-1.921, p=.055 for operations cost and U=2116 z=-.371, p=.711 for maintenance cost Concerning deviation from the standard DBMS, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 6\ealed a significant difference between maintenance costs for standardcompliant \(Md=373,100; n=59\d non-standardcompliant applications \(Md=170,200; n=58 U=1303, z=-2.231, p=.026. It is remarkable that the non-compliant applications had lower maintenance costs than the compliant applications. The difference between operations costs for compliant Md=109,978; n=51\d non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=50\s not significant, U=1196.5 z=-.533, p=.594 Thus, the proposition \(P3.3\at application that deviate from technology standards incur higher IT costs is not supported. In contrast, for DBMSstandard deviation, we observed significantly lower maintenance cost for non-compliant than for compliant applications  Impacts of overlap/redundancy-related AA complexity a Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 7\ showed significant differences in operations costs across the applications with a low \(less than 34 overlaps Md=90,442; n=37\edium \(35-79 overlaps Md=55,770; n=56\ and high level of overlap/redundancy \(more than 80 overlaps Md=129,985; n=61 6.862, p=.032. It is striking to see that the applications with medium overlaps have a lower median operations cost than those with a low or high-level of overlap, implying a non-linear U-shape relation between overlap and operations cost. Interestingly, the same holds true for maintenance cost. Applications with a low degree of overlap exhibited a median maintenance cost of 96,600 \(n=59\, those with a medium level of overlap incurred a median of 81,300 \(n=58\d highly overlapping applications a median of 248,700 \(n=67 9.791, p=.007.

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
