PWEM detects mislabeled examples by assi gning to each training example a probability that its label is correct. PWEM calculates this probability by clustering examples from pairs of classes together and analyzing the distribution of labels within each cluster to derive the probability of each label\222s correctness We discuss how one can use the probabilities output by PWEM to filter, mitigate, or correct mislabeled training 
examples.  We then provide an in-depth discussion of how we applied PWEM to a sulfur detector that labels pixels from Hyperion images of the Borup-Fiord pass in Northern Canada. PWEM assigned a large number of the sulfur training examples low probabilities, indicating severe mislabeling within the sulfur class.  The filtering of those low confidence examples resulte d in a cleaner training set and improved the median false positive rate of the classifier by at least 29 12   T ABLE OF C ONTENTS  1  I

 Supervised learning algorithms are popular for building automated classifiers from a set of labeled training examples.   Achieving maxima l classifier accuracy depends upon the selection of an appropriate learning algorithm, as well as high quality training data 1  1 978-1-4244-2622-5/09 25.00 \251 2009 IEEE 2 IEEEAC Paper #1607, Version 4, Updated January 9, 2009 A human expert usually labels training data.  Unfortunately the labeling of the training data can be an error prone process due to data entry error, human subjectivity 
different experts may disagree on which label is correct   or t h e use of an ext e rnal dat a source t o  l a bel  dat a  For example, when labeling pixels in image data, the expert may use visual data rather than numeric values Figure 1 shows the effect of mislabeled training data on classifier accuracy.  We introdu ced two types of noise into an eleven-class landcover data set: random and rule-based noise.  Under random noise, a training example\222s label may be flipped to any of the other labels. Under rule-based noise, we only flip labels if the example\222s assigned class is easily confused with any of the others according to rules specified by a domain expert.  We introduce up to 40 
random noise and 25% rule-based noise in the landcover data set.  In both cases, we observe a significant decrease in classifier accuracy as class noise levels increase This paper presents PWEM a t echni que for det ect i ng mislabeled training exampl es. PWEM assigns to each training example a probability of cleanliness.  These probabilities are calculated by clustering instances \(without their class labels\ pairs of classes using Expectation Figure 1.

  2 Maximization \(EM t o perform t h e cl ust e ri ng  Once t h e EM algorithm estimates the data distribution, we apply the assigned labels to the clusters and evaluate how well the labels correspond to the natural groupings of the data Intuitively, if an example that was assigned to class A clusters with examples that are mostly assigned to class B there is a good chance that the "A" example is mislabeled From the set of clusterings and the assigned labels, we calculate for each example the probability that the example was assigned the correct label We present three options for using the probabilities calculated by PWEM.  One can filter out examples with low probability, use the probabilities as weights during training or iteratively query the domain expert for new labels on examples with low probability. We also present an in-depth discussion of how the filtering option was used to improve the performance of a sulfur detector designed for use onboard the Earth-orbiting satellite EO-1.  Members of our team hypothesized that mislabelings in the training data caused the false positive rate of the classifier to be unacceptably high.  Because a positive classification can be programmed to trigger follow-up imaging, it is crucial to minimize the classifier\222s false positive rate.  We applied PWEM to this problem, and discovered mislabeled examples in the training set\222s sulfur class.  Filtering out the low-confidence sulfur exampl es improved classification accuracy and reduced the false pos itive rate of the classifier by approximately one half We organize our paper by presenting the PWEM method in Section 2 and possible ways to use its probability outputs in Section 3.  In Section 4, we discuss the sulfur detection task to which we apply PWEM and the steps that led the members of our team to conclude that the sulfur training set contained mislabeled examples.  In Section 5, we describe the sulfur training data, and the contributions of PWEM to this problem in Section 6 2  PWEM PWEM works by calculating a probability of correctness for each example\222s assigned label. Label correctness is defined in relation to the features of the training example.  PWEM also assumes that a mixture of Gaussians generates each class\222s data For each example x PWEM outputs the probability P\(l|x  that the label of x is l from set L where L is the set of class labels.  We use clustering to find P\(l|x since, intuitively one might expect instances from the same class to cluster together.  We can use clustering to generate a set of class probabilities by having each inst ance inherit the distribution of classes within its assigned cluster.  The drawback of this method is that there is no guarantee that a multi-class data set will cluster perfectly along cl ass lines.  Feature selection may improve class separability, but it is possible that two or more classes may not separate under any circumstances because their data di stributions overlap We improve class separability by clustering pairs of classes For each pair of classes, we cluster only those examples assigned a label from one of the classes in that pair.  Thus each example belongs to only L|-1 clusterings. If a clean example has a lower confidence in one clustering due to class inseparability, it may still receive a high confidence in its other clusterings if its assigned class separates well from others Given a set of L|-1 clusterings for instance x, we calculate the probability that x belongs to class l as follows P\(l|x 002 003 P 003 l|x 003   002 003 P 003  002 c=1 to k P\(l|c 003 P\(c|x 003 1   where l is a class label x is an instance c is a cluster k is the number of clusters, and 003 is a given clustering P\(l|x  represents the probability that instance x should have class label l  P\(l|x 003  represents the probability that x should have label l given clustering 003 This probability is calculated by summing the probability that x belongs to cluster c as calculated by our clustering method EM\imes the probability that c should be labeled as l Summing over all clusters results in the probab ility that x should be labeled l  If P\(l|c 003  and P\(c|x 003  form probability distributions, it is trivial to show that P\(l|x also forms a probability distribution over the class labels. If we assume each clustering 003 is equally likely P 003  is 1/\(|L|-1 Each P\(l|x  acts as a confidence on the class label l for instance x  Although P\(l|x forms a probability distribution over the class labels, only the probability for the assigned label is useful given this scheme.  This probability distribution cannot be used to correct labels.  The reason is that example x only participates in clusterings where its assigned label is represented.  We leave to fu ture work the calculation of a meaningful probability distribution that may be useful in correcting labels We use the Expectation Maximization \(EM\ algorithm to perform the pairwise clusterings [8 EM is an  o p tim izatio n  method that finds the maximum likelihood estimates of parameters in probabilistic models that depend on some hidden variables.  Because we assume our training data conforms to a Gaussian mixture model, the hidden variables estimated by EM are the means and covariance matrices of the k Gaussians in the mixture, where k is a user-supplied input parameter to EM. We perform clusterings with multiple values of k typically between two and four, in case a particular class is multi-modal.  We select the clustering with the k value that minimizes the Bayesian Information Criterion [6 o d el selectio n criterio n fro m  statistics 


  3 Our implementation of PWEM in which we estimate mean and covariance matrices via EM assumes that the training data is well conditioned prior to using our methods.  If not the user will experience computational issues associated with matrix singularity.  In the case of the sulfur training data, feature selection was applied to the original data and resulted in twelve bands that were well conditioned.  Thus we were able to use an implementation of EM that estimates a full covariance matrix.  For data that is not well conditioned, a possible workaround is to use a version of EM that only assumes a diagonal covariance matrix for the mixture models.  We also implemented this version of PWEM, using an open source machine learning software package called WEKA W e found t h at t h e assum p t i on of a diagonal covariance matrix does not significantly impact the results of PWEM  3  D ATA C LEANING O PTIONS  PWEM is successful when it assigns low probabilities to mislabeled examples and high probabilities on clean examples.  Table 1 shows probability results from two scene segmentation data sets \(segmentation, road\he landcover data set.  We introduce up to 30% random and ruled-based noise on each.  Ta ble 1 demonstrates that PWEM assigns lower probabilities to mislabeled instances versus clean instances on average. Having calculated probabilities for each example in the training set, we present three options for using PWEM\222s probabilities to clean the training set.  The first is to choose a threshold and discard examples whose probabilities are below this value.  The advantage of this method is that it is the simplest of the three options to implement The drawbacks are the selection of the threshold value and the potential loss of valuable training examples The second option is to use PWEM\222s probabilities as instance weights during training.  Rebbapragada et al compared weighting to discarding and found that instance weighting outperformed discarding on the data sets tested  However, t h e i n st ance wei ght i ng opt i on requi res a classifier that can incor porate instance weights during training The third option is to use the PWEM probabilities to engage the domain expert in the pro cess of iteratively cleaning the training data.  In this option, the domain expert is presented with the m lowest probability examples from PWEM.  The expert examines the labels on this set and relabels anything that is incorrectly labeled.  The training set is updated with the new labels.   The process repeats with PWEM only presenting examples the domain expert has not already seen.  The process terminates when the domain expert is satisfied with the cleanliness of the sets. This option is clearly the best in terms of ensuring the quality of the training data.  The drawback is that it requires a significant time commitment from the domain expert For the sulfur detection problem, we chose to discard low probability examples.  We could not take advantage of instance weighting because our classifier implementation could not accommodate instance we ights.  In future work we plan to present low probability examples to our domain expert for iterative relabeling  4  S ULFUR D ETECTION ON EO-1 In this section, we describe the sulfur detection problem and how we used PWEM to identify mislabeled examples in the training set of ice, rock and sulfur examples. The detection of sulfur in remote-sensing imaging supports NASA\222s mission to discover evidence of living systems within our solar system.  The importance of sulfur detection to both science and NASA is described thoroughly in W e  summarize the key points in this paper, but refer the reader  for m o re detailed inform ation Sulfurous glacial springs are of scientific interest because the presence of elemental sulfur \(among other compounds may be an indicator of microbial activity.  The Borup-Fiord Pass on Ellsmere Island in northern Canada is known to have sulfurous glacial springs.

  4 Jupiter\222s moon Europa is also thought to have an analogous  ages of Europa\222s icy landscape show reddish-tinged upwellings that may be an indicator of sulfurous compounds on solid i Thus the study of sulfurous ice in the Borup Fiord pass may inform the study of Europa\222s biological potential.  Given the inaccessibility of the Borup Fiord Pass and Europa remotely-sensed images are the only source of regular data for those regions EO-1, managed by NASA's Godda rd Space Flight Center, is an Autonomous ScienceCraft that has onboard decisionmaking abilities.  This means that EO-1 may autonomously modify its observation plan and schedule repeated observations of a scientific event or point of interest Onboard processing can speed such modifications by the order of hours.  A sulfur detector onboard EO-1 can trigger follow-up imaging of the Borup-Fiord pass on the satellite\222s next pass over the region.  It is crucial that imaging is not triggered on areas that do not contain sulfur.  Thus minimizing the classifier\222s false positive rate is an important goal Figure 3.

  5 Mandrake et al di scuss t h e chal l e nges i nherent i n  detecting sulfur from Hyperion images of the Borup Fiord pass.  The first set of challenges is related to the computational constraints of onboard processing.  For example, only twelve out of 220 bands may be analyzed at once.  One must employ featur e selection to search for the best feature subset to use during training and classification One must also select a classifier that yields good performance under integer arithmetic and tune its associated parameters The second set of challenges concerns the quality of the training data.  Figure 2 shows the source of the training data. These are seven flyover images of the Borup Fiord pass that were labeled by a geologist on our team.  Detailed information about the training data and its labeling process can be found in The am ount  of t r ai ni ng dat a  avai l a bl e to Mandrake et al. was signifi cantly larger compared to previous work [2 wev e r, th e q u a lity o f  th e train i n g  d a ta was questioned when preliminary results did not yield an adequate false positive rate Mandrake et al. [1 en tified two p r o b l em s with th e training data.   The first problem was that a single sulfur class did not adequately repres ent the sulfur examples.  A clustering of the training data revealed that the sulfur examples formed a bi-modal distribution.  Thus, the decision was made to partition the sulfur examples into two classes: bright sulfur and dark sulfur.  Thus, the training set was now relabeled to have four classes.  However, the relabeling of the training data did not result in a major reduction to the false positive rate of the classifier. At that time, the researchers from Mandr ake et al. suspected that the problem was due to mislabelings in the training data We used the PWEM method to determine whether the training data was mislabeled and present our analysis in Section 6 5  DATA Figure 2 shows the source images that were used to generate labels for the training data.  The original labels were rock ice, and sulfur, depicted by the yellow, cyan, and magenta streaks.  Detailed information on how the images were labeled is provided by The t rai ni ng set cont ai ned 12029 pixels labeled as rock, 9485 labeled as ice, and 235 labeled as sulfur.  As described in  t h e sul f ur cl ass was eventually partitioned into two sub-classes: bright sulfur and dark sulfur.  There were 144 bright sulfur pixels and 91 dark sulfur pixels. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the breakdown of examples by class in both training sets.  In both training sets, the sulfur examples are in the extreme minority  ROCK 12029 ICE 9485 SULFUR 235 Table 2.

  6 probabilities.  Figure 4 shows the distribution of probabilities in each training set. The top and bottom panels show that in both training sets, the majority of rock and ice examples are assigned probabilities above 0.7.  This is not surprising since these classes dominate the training data set and therefore have the most influence on the cluster models If the rock and ice examples did not separate well in the rock/ice clustering of PWEM, then the probabilities would have been lower.  This is good evidence that the rock and ice examples were cleanly labeled  The top panel of Figure 4 shows that the 3-class training set has very few sulfur examples with a probability of correctness greater than 0.6 Given the skewed nature of the 3-class training set, it is expected that the sulfur-rock and sulfur-ice clusterings would result in low probabilities for sulfur examples given the overwhelming amount of rock and ice present.  Using PWEM under extremely skewed class distributions could result in low probabilities that are indicative of the imbalance in the class distributions, not the correctness of the training set  The 4-class training set rec tifies this problem because probabilities on sulfur examples are evaluated against three clusterings each, rather than two A bright sulfur example is evaluated against the bright-sulfur/ice, bright-sulfur/rock and bright-sulfur/dark-sulfur clusterings.  With an extra approximately\ass-balanced clustering to evaluate against, it is possible for the sulfur examples to achieve a higher probability.  Indeed, the bottom panel of Figure 4 shows a greater spread in the sulfur probabilities, with many examples achieving a probability above 0.75.  With a larger spread in the probabilities, it is easier to determine which examples are likely mislabeled and which are likely clean  The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows that PWEM calculates higher probabilities for the bright sulfur examples pixels compared to the dark sulfur.  Indeed, the mean probability for bright sulfur is 0.81.  For dark sulfur, it is 0.62.  PWEM indicates that the dark sulf ur class is more severely mislabeled.  The left panel of Figure 5 shows the original bright and dark sulfur labels in light green and dark green Note that a few dark sulfur pixels are mislabeled as bright sulfur. The right panel shows the PWEM probabilities for those pixels with probabilities over 0.9 in green probabilities over 0.75 in yellow, and probabilities below 0.5 in red. Note that the area containing light sulfur pixels is mostly yellow.  The area labeled as predominantly dark sulfur, has splotches of red b ecause they were assigned low probabilities.  Our hypothesis is that the dark sulfur and rock examples are easily c onfusable. Because correctly labeling and classifying dark sulfur pixels are the harder problem, we focus our evaluation efforts on classifying bright sulfur  Due to our use of the SVM learning algorithm, we chose to clean our training set via filtering. We selected an arbitrary confidence threshold of 0.75 and discarded any bright or dark sulfur examples below this threshold. We retained 104 out of 144 bright sulfur examples, and 39 of 91 dark sulfur examples.  This was approximately 72% of the bright sulfur examples, and 43% of the dark sulfur examples.  As discussed in and above, t h e l o ss of m o re dark sul f ur examples is understandable given that dark sulfur is difficult to distinguish from rock.  In contrast, bright-sulfur is relatively easier to distinguish from dark sulfur, rock and ice  Figure 5.  The left panel shows labeled br ight sulfur \(light green ur \(dark green shows the probability ranges on those sulfur examples.  Green pi xels have probabilities greater than 0.9, yellow pixels have probabilities greater than 0.75, and red pixels have probabilities less than 0.5 


  7 Having discarded examples from the training set, we trained a Support Vector Machine \(SVM\assifier to test the effects of the filtered training set on the false positive rate of the classifier.  We report re sults from an SVM classifier using a linear kernel.  We performed multiple runs of the classifier using different values for the regularization parameter C.  For each value of C, we performed seven-fold cross validation.  Specifically we trained the classifier on six of training images, and test on the seventh, rotating each image as the test image. We calculated an F-measure score for each run, where F-measure was calculated as F=2PR/\(P+R and P and R are precision and recall respectively.  We modified the definitions of P and R to penalize less for mistakes on dark sulfur.  If the SVM identified an ice or rock exam ple as dark sulfur, it did not count as a false positive.  Similarly, if the SVM failed to positively identify a dark sulfur example, the mistake was not counted as a false negative.  We only penalized for precision and recall mistakes on bright sulfur examples A second evaluation metric was the mean number of false positives per image. This is simply the number of false positives averaged across each test image.  For this metric we used two additional se ts derived from different evaluation images. The first, referred to as \223Likely\224 consisted of all unlabeled pixels from the original training images \(see Figure 2\Because these images were unlabeled, they were most likely from regions that did not contain sulfur.  Therefore, positive classifications in these regions are likely to be false positives.  Of course, without explicit labels we cannot be absolutely certain that no sulfur exists in these areas.  The second set of evaluation images called \223Sulfur Free\224, consists of other Hyperion images \(not of the Borup Fiord Pass\in wh ich we are certain there are no known sulfur sources.  Positive classifications on these regions are definitely mistakes  We present the F-measure results in Table 4, and the mean false positive results in Table 5.  EXPERT denotes results on the unfiltered training data using features \(image bands that were selected by the domain expert.  PWEM FILT is the same training set minus the any example whose probability of correctness was less than 0.75. We report the median and best result of all runs  MEDIAN BEST EXPERT 0.92 0.98 PWEM-FILT 0.91 0.98 Table 4.

Median and best mean false positives per image results on both the \223Likely\224 and \223Sulfur-Free\224 evaluation sets  According to Table 4, the filtered training set provides no improvement over the original training set in terms of Fmeasure.  PWEM\222s contribution is in the reduction of false positives. On the Likely evaluation set, PWEM reduced the median false positives per image by approximately 29 On the easier Sulfur Free ev aluation set, PWEM reduced the median false positives per image by approximately 83 and also recorded a best false positive rate of one false positive per image  7  C ONCLUSION  This paper presents the PWEM method for detecting mislabeled training data.  We describe PWEM\222s contributions to NASA\222s sulfur detector that is scheduled for use onboard the EO-1 sp acecraft.  By filtering the labeled training set based on PWEM\222s estimated label probabilities, the false positive rate of the classifier is reduced, ensuring that fewer resources would be wasted if EO-1 is programmed to do follow-up imaging upon positive sulfur classifications Coping with erroneous labeled data is critical for many scientific domains. This paper provided an in-depth study of how PWEM improved classifier performance in one particular domain through the filtering of low probability examples.  No doubt, PWEM can be useful in mitigating label noise in other domains.  Furthermore, using the probabilities to filter training sets is only one of three options available.  We also discussed the use of the probabilities as instance weights in learning algorithms that can take instance weights as inputs.  We also discuss a third and possibly better option, to iteratively query the domain expert on labels that have a low probability of correctness Because the probabilities calculated by PWEM are robust we expect classifier performance to improve under any of these three options  A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  We gratefully acknowledge support, assistance, and data from the Earth Observing-1 mission.

 11  Impact \226 Strauss\222s Derivative of Moore The impact of such a simple statement is at the same time beautiful and difficult to realize.  What this is telling the designer is that 223For any technology selected, mass and power of any data recorder design will remain relatively constant even as mission data demands increase from one generation to the next.\224  What it Means For all intents and purposes, the \223fit\224 of the SSR can remain relatively constant throughout the years \226 that as the required capacity doubles, the media meets the challenge at the same pace.  Therefore, assuming a recorder of Size X  bits today and performing mass and volume predictions on that design, moving that recorder ahead several generations will result in the same mass and volume, even though the capacity of the data recorder increases exponentially Technology Comparison Table 2 is a compendium of known, published technologies in use or in development today enabling a comparison of any one technology listed for specific attributes against another.  In this stoplight chart, red indicates disfavorable attributes, green equals favorable, and yellow indicates cautionary acceptance.  It can be easily seen that in terms of memory technology for space, the selection is limited \226 especially so when it comes to non-volatile radiation hardened devices Part II 6  H IGH C APACITY S OLID S TATE R ECORDER  The impetus of this paper was the assignment to predict mass, power, volume, and cost for multi-terabit data recorders of the capacities shown in Table 3 with deliveries occurring in the year given [2   Table 3 - Data Recorder Capacity Requirements YEAR DATA CAPACITY 2010 2.88 Tb 2020 30 Tb 2030 130 Tb  This part of the paper presents a design of a 130 Tb NonVolatile data recorder which could be built for delivery in the year 2030, based on the information presented in Part I In developing the SSR design, technology selection was limited to the two technologies examined in detail in Part I Flash and NROM\nd a technology freeze date of 36 months in advance of delivery was assumed  SSR \226 Flash & NROM Based designs Table 4 - ITRS predicted device capacity \(Gb for three technologies Year 2015 2018 2021 2025 Technology CRAM 0.032 0.064 0.064 0.128 NROM 4 8 16 32 Flash 64 128 256 512  In this particular case, the year 2025 is selected as the freeze date and appropriate device capacity is used.  The ITRS is predicting that by the year 20 25, CRAM-based devices will have a capacity of 128 Mbit per die; NROM will have 32 Gb per die. Flash will be available at 512 Gb per die [9 Table  5 highlights the number of die necessary of three discussed technologies to achi eve a recorder of specified capacity in the timeframe given Table 5 - Minimum Device Count by Technology to achieve a Data Recorder of Specified Capacity in the Year shown.  \(Example, a 30 Tb recorder being designed in the year 2020 would require 468,750 CRAM devices or 1,875 NROM devices, or 118 Flash devices  Therefore, a 130 Tb data recorder designed using devices predicted available in the year 2030, would require the following number of devices \226 not including any additional devices used for Error Detection and Correction \(EDAC\ or sparing and word control 200  CRAM: > 1 million devices Year Recorder Capacity CRAM 4Mb NROM 1Gb Flash 16Gb 720,000 2,880 180 64Mb 16Gb 256Gb 468,750 1,875 118 128Mb 32Gb 512Gb 1.02E+06 4,063 254 Required Not Reqiured Required EDAC Technology / Device Capacity /Chip Count 2010 2020 2030 2.88 Tb 30 Tb 130 Tb 


 12  200  NROM: approx 4060 devices 200  Flash: approx 256 devices By examination, it can be easily seen that developing a high capacity data recorder as pr oposed using CRAM technology is impractical Error Detection and Correction Codes  All technologies are subject to lo ss of information, be they the loss of a single bit or the loss of an entire chip, the inclusion of Error Detection and Correction is an appropriate action by any system designer Just by using EDAC, there is an associated bit-penalty ranging from a few percentile to over 25 per cent   The exact selection of most-appropriat e Error Correction codes is highly dependent upon error phenomena not only for each  rt ain aspects of the exact part being considered as well as the environment to be encountered [2  25  F o r t h e reco rde r  de scri be d bel o w a Reed-Solomon code was selected.  It is important to note that this may not be the prime candidate, but was chosen for known characteristics Selection of a more appropri ate EDAC code [2 w oul d  most assuredly, bring about a reduction in recorder mass and power One final, important, distinction between the two prime technologies is required The NROM devices analyzed for this paper have built-in an incredibly powerful error detection and correction machine, capable of detecting four bits in error in a single word, and correcting three bits per word [10  W i t h th is m e th od t h e Bit Error Rate is calculated by the manufacturer to be less than 1.18E 19  errors/bit-day \226 equivalent to 3 unrecoverable bit errors every 550 years for the entire recorder; therefore, the package numbers presented here do not include extra devices required for EDAC other than that provided by the chip itself Table 6 - HC-SSR Basic Features 200  Redundant SpaceWire interfaces 200  Redundant Power Converters 200  Redundant Controllers/Supervisors 200  Multi-plane Non-volatile storage 200  Error detection and correction 200  Device isolation to the EDAC Word  Figure 18 - HC-SSR Conceptual Block Diagram

The recorder features cross-coupled SpaceWire interfaces as well as redundancy down to the memory plane Cross-coupled controllers w ith shared memory ensure operation without the need to re-build memory allocation tables should a fault occur Recorder Summary  Using conservative packaging techniques, two recorder designs were developed: one using Flash memory and the other using NROM.  A summary of their characteristics is provided in the tables below.  A more detailed discussion of design and implementation follows Board Design  Figure 19 - One side of 8Tb Memory Slice using NROM Technology The NROM-based solution is presented as Figure 19.

The IO controller slice provides redundant SpaceWire interfaces and redundant interfaces to the backplane.  Alt hough there are two controllers shown there is, in this concept, a single set of Shared Memory which is common between both controllers One of the main functions of the active controller is to build and maintain a directory of memory sector-to-physical address translation tables.  Having the table stored in Shared Memory assures timely restart of the recorder function should it become necessary to activate and swap to the alternate controller Interfaces  The Data Recorder interfa ces with the Command Data Handling \(CDH\ubsystem via the standard SpaceWire interface 8 Utilizing conservative design techniques, a sustained Write speed of at least 200 Mbps into memory is guaranteed.   The recorder is capable of supporting simultaneous Writing and Reading of data subject to usual certain timing restrictions imposed by the memory devices themselves Standard 28 Volt bus power is applied to the SSR which features two power convert er units for redundancy Redundancy & Fault Tolerance The execution of good systems engineering practice is recommended and will, most likely result in a physical  enlargement of the SSR in one dimension.  This may consist of addition of spare memory to each memory slice, or the addition of one or more spare memory slices to the entire design With respect to Fault Tolerance, aside from the use of redundant interfaces and contro llers, described above, the HC-SSR is designed such that individual blocks of words as determined by EDAC boundaries can be tagged as Do Not Use.  An example of an EDAC word with embedded control bits is included as Figure 21  Figure 21 - EDAC Word Bit-Level Assignments File System The HC-SSR contains built in File Management system supervised by Interface/Controlle r ASICs.  File storage is compatible with the CCSDS File Delivery Protocol \(CFDP thereby reducing the need for processing and packetizing data externally   8 ESA Standard ECSS-E-50-12A 96 bits 26 -->||<-- 6 EDAC Ctl/Hdr/ID Data 


 15  The architecture permits random access to any EDAC word within the recorder. Simultaneous writing and reading is supported.  Memory is divisible into blocks with an unlimited number of blocks forming a Sector.   Each sector contains information that permits reconstruction of the File Structure independent of the CDH Sector Definition As unique Data Units are identified by the CDH host, the SSR commences placement of information in the first available memory location The information placed therein contains information identifying the Sector and relevant information with respect to data unit identification  Figure 22 - Sector & Data Unit Structure Each sector of information has contained within identification as to the next sector tag as well as the tag of the previous sector.  In this way, should the file structure need to be rebuilt, a scan of memory anywhere will reveal not only the type and source of information encountered but also the logical placement of a ll relevant information before and after this data block Consumables For Flash memory technology, the data is stored, and erased, by the imposition of high voltages onto the substrate and controlling gates.  Therefore, this technology is stressful to the device and is rated to 100,000 write or erase cycles NROM technology uses a different charge storage mechanism and is therefore not subject to write/erase degradation Stability Testing has shown commercial NROM devices to retain data up to 300 krads, a simple refreshment following exposure permits a likewise gain in radiation tolerance That is 300krads, refresh, 600 krads, etc [1   Flash devices are prone to damaging charge-trapping and therefore do not benefit by the refreshment scheme outlined above.  The users of Flash must take the surrounding radiation environment into consideration when declaring the number of write cycles a certain design can accommodate Chassis Dimensions and mass for the HC-SSR assume the chassis is manufactured in 100 mils aluminum,  One possible design is shown in Figure 23  Figure 23 \226 Packaging Concept \226 HC-SSR Power Worst case power estimation for the Flash unit is 6W and 30W for an NROM-based design 9 The power estimation includes both SpaceWire interfaces enabled and simultaneous read and write of information occurring Unused non-volatile memory devices are unpowered and the non-addressed memory contro ller ASICs are in a Deep Sleep mode 8  C ONCLUSION  A review of data storage technologies was presented and evidence presented to affirm the assertion known as 223Moore\222s Law\224 that storage capacity of a single element will increase every \(a pprox.\0 months A prognostication of data recorder capacity requirements for future JPL mission and programs has been made.  Based upon a past history spanning over thirty years, it is clearly evident that required capacity will progress at an exponential rate, effectively mimicking the rate provided in Moore\222s Law.  A new Axiom is coined:  A reasonable accurate prediction of data recorder volume and power can be made when based upon today\222s technology and today\222s data storage requirements   9 Power margin \(uncer tainty\cluded in these figures Header/Sector ID Next Previous Data Unit Header Data Data Sector   Data Data Unit End Flag Next Previous

He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
