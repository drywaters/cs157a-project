surface operations  It is estimated that the dust in the atmosphere prevented over 99.6 of direct sunlight from reaching the surface at the peak of the storm.  Data collected indicated that solar array energy output was reduced to approximately 15 of maximum  The reduction in insolation and energy output posed the greatest risk of ending the mission for both rovers at that time To maintain the health of the rovers the sequencing team modified the nominal planning strategy to reduce power 
consumption to levels matching solar array energy generation  Existing planning and sequencing tools were used in new ways to increase confidence in the modeled state of the rover, including the power state. This paper will discuss the process used to predict the state of the rover during the storm As the storm began to subside, the dust began to fall out of the atmosphere  Opportunity\325s arrays were cleaned by the wind blowing dust off of its solar arrays  Spirit\325s solar 1

 2  every Martian year a local storm will expand to a cover a very large area of the planet even encircling it  The Martian dust storm cycle and the mechanism that creates these large storms are not completely understood but modern spacecraft observations have helped with our understanding of this phenomenon [2, 3   Mars Global Surveyor \(MGS\ was orbiting Mars during the 1999 and 2001 dust storms.  MGS was able to estimate the atmospheric opacity with the Thermal Emission Spectrometer \(TES\ and Mars Orbiter Camera \(MOC\.  The fraction of the direct beam sunlight that reaches the planet\325s surface from the top of the atmosphere is defined as e T  which means T i.e tau can be used as a value of atmospheric opacity.  The maximum Tau measured by MGS was 2.13 12 transmission in 1999 and 5.0 in 2001 3 4    T h e  V i k i n g  L a n d e r  1   a t  2 2  3  N  L a t i t u d e   a n d  V i k i n g  Lander 2 at 47.7 N Latitude operated on the Martian surface for 3.3 and 1.9 Mars years, respectively.  There were two global dust storms during the Viking mission but the Tau was never measured to exceed 4.0 \(2% transmission\ in value 5   a l t h o u g h  r e c e n t  a n a l y s i s  o f  t h e  d a t a  h a s  i m p l i e d  that atmospheric opacity could have actually peaked as high as 8 0.03 transmission 6    N o t e   t h e  V i k i n g  l a n d e r s  were not solar powered, the dust storm did not interfere with their operation Sojourner the Mars Pathfinder rover operated on the Martian surface at 19.2 N Latitude from Ls 145 to Ls 185 Ls is the angle of the Mars-Sun line from the Mars-Sun line at the northern hemisphere vernal equinox. During that time it observed Tau values in only the 0.4 to 0.6 range [7   The MER-A Spirit 14.6 S Latitude and MERB Opportunity 1.9 S Latitude rovers landed on the Martian surface during January of 2004  Because of atmospheric opacity measurements from other spacecraft the MER mission\325s expectation was that the Tau could easily exceed 3.5 320 and possibly rise as high as 8  during any given Martian summer  Neither rover was designed to survive a sustained dust storm with a Tau above 5.0  This design trade was based on the prime mission duration for each vehicle of 90 sols   Based on observations from prior missions the most likely time for Martian dust storms is from Ls 145 to Ls 225 [2, 3    F o r  t h e  M E R  t e a m  d u r i n g  t h e  summer of 2007, it was known that the atmospheric opacity could increase but there was also an awareness that 1 the rovers had already experienced two Martian summers without a Tau higher than 2.0 \(see Figure 2\ and 2\ all of the Figure 1   Optical dept hs measured by Viking Landers [5   There are multiple values for each Ls due to overlapping Mars years VL1 and VL2 are the Viking 1 and 2 landers.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the impact the 2007 planet-encircling dust storm had on MER Opportunity, and on the several modifications to spacecraft ope rations that allowed it to survive 2  R ISKS P OSED TO THE M ISSION  The dust storm posed three distinct risks reduced power generation reduced ambient temperatures and instrument contamination.  The reduction in power and temperature are coupled as both are driven by the solar radiation reaching the surface at each rover\325s location  Instrument contamination is a function of the density of dust suspended in the local atmosphere Reduction of power generation directly affects the number and duration of science activities that can be conducted.  It also requires any drive activities to be shortened in both duration and subsequently in distance traveled The reduction in solar array output below the minimum consumption levels of the rover will lead to depletion of the batteries  Below a bus voltage of 24V the rover will automatically enter a low power fault mode.  This low bus voltage down from a nominal bus voltage of 32V indicates that a significant number of activities are being supported by battery power and that the solar arrays are not Figure 2   O ptical depths measured by the MER Opportunity rover through sol B/1200, a period prior to the 2007 dust storm.   There are multiple values for each Ls due to overlapping Mars years  


 4  producing enough power to charge the battery in addition to supporting activities  The Low power fault mode attempts to charge the battery until the bus voltage is increased to 27V Nominally the batteries would recharge prior to the wakeup timer set by the flight software when low power fault mode is initiated.  During the dust storm it was likely that any low power mode recharging would complete well after the last wake-up timer  In this event the rover would not reawake until a solar array wake up occurred by having more than 2.0A being generated by the solar arrays  In a prolonged dust storm the batteries would continue to deplete until they cannot provide sufficient power to operate the rover The reduction in solar flux reaching the surface also caused ambient daytime temperatures to drop to the level where heaters are required to maintain the temperature of the vehicle.  Conversely the dust in the atmosphere acted as an insulator allowing overnight low temperatures to be higher than expected  The latter effect was not expected to be as pronounced as it turned out to be.  Without the trapping of surface heat the thermal risk to the rovers would have been much greater The decrease in average ambient temperature compounds the power risk as heaters will be  needed initially to heat individual components and later all of the rover\325 s electronics  The Mini-Thermal Emission Spectrometer MiniTES automatically begins heating at an instrument temperature below \320 38 2 241 C.  The MiniTES heaters use 16W and have approximately a 50 duty cycle The batteries begin heating when their temperature is below 32019.2 241 C on Opportunity and 32019.0 241 C on Spirit  The battery heaters require 15.3W while in use  Finally the rover electronics module \(REM\ will begin heating at an internal temperature of -37.7 241 C.  The REM heaters use 90W Instrument contamination, while not a risk to the health and safety of the vehicle is a major risk to the mission  Only MiniTES, Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer \(APXS\, and Microscopic Imager \(MI\ on each rover were designed with coverings to prevent or minimize dust contamination  The doors covering the APXS have been left open since early in the mission to prevent having them seize shut  They were not closed on either vehicle during the dust storm Figure 3   Optical depths measured by the MER Op portunity rover through sol B/1 3 00, a period that includes the 2007 dust storm Chart includes Tau values that were estimated from the array energy output There are multiple values for each Ls due to overlapping Mars years  


 5  3  R ISK M INIMIZATION S TRATEGIES AND A CTIONS  Addressing Risks to the Mission Instrument contamination was the first to be addressed during the dust storm  Dust contamination would occur before power or thermal risks would be experienced To minimize the dust contamination risk to the science payload steps were taken to minimize each instrument\325s exposure to the atmosphere.  Of the 12 individual sensors on the vehicle only eight were designed to be continuously exposed to the environment  These eight sensors are the two panoramic cameras Pancams the two navigation cameras \(Navcams\, and the four hazard avoidance cameras Hazcams\.  The remaining instruments were each designed with coverings or doors to prevent dust contamination  The Hazcams were considered a low contamination risk The four Hazcams are located on the body of the rover below the rover solar arrays.  This resulted in the Hazcams only being exposed to blowing dust. Dust accumulation wa s not considered to be a serious risk to the Hazcams  The Hazcams are angled 45 241 and 35 241 below the horizon for the front and rear pairs respectively  These elevation angles cause dust that impacts the lens to fall away from the lens  The contamination risk to the Pancams and Navcams was considered somewhat high  Both pairs of cameras are located on a single camera bar at the top of the mast.  The pitch of the camera bar is adjusted to provide variable elevation pointing.  The camera bar is currently stowed 17 241  below the horizon instead of the original 90 241  below the horizon.  This preserves the ability to gather terrain images if the elevation actuator fails.  The 17 241 stow angle was not enough to ensure all dust that impacted the Navcams and Pancams would immediately fall away  Contamination of the optics was not significant enough to risk stowing the camera bar at a lower elevation angle  The turret containing the instruments and rock abrasion tool RAT on the IDD was rotated such that the APXS was fa cing the body of the rover  This action minimized the amount of dust that could be directly blown into the cavity on the instrument  The Mini-TES cover was in the closed position for the duration of the storm when no science was being conducted On Sol 1217 27 June 2008, Opportunity\325s Mini-TES began to show anomalous spectra when looking at the atmosphere and surface  Later investigations have determined that a layer of dust coated the elevation mirror.  As of this writing efforts are underway to remove the dust from the mirror  After the storm subsided, there were varying degrees of dust contamination on all exposed cameras  The Navcams and Pancams saw the most dust deposition  In the months following the dust storm wind erosion has reduced dust de posits on the camera lenses  Addressing Risks to the Vehicle The first technique used during the dust storm was to model power resources assuming rapidly increasing tau values The power initial conditions incons used by the team during normal planning contain the previous sols tau value Due to uncertainty of what the next sol\325s tau value it became necessary to evaluate the power model for various tau values The power engineer initially delivered the likely tau for the sol being planed.  The likely tau was the previous sol\325s tau plus the increase seen between two sols ago and the previous sol.  This likely tau would be used to model power production  The power engineer would then model other values of tau and determin the predicted solar array energy output in each case. This allowed worst-case scenarios to be modeled and evaluated  The Tactical Activity Planner TAP would initially model the delivered 322likely\323 tau input.  If upon evaluation the tactical team decides to review one of the alternate tau values the power engineer would deliver the new tau to the TAP for modeling  Using the likely and worst-case scenarios it was possible to adjust the rovers activity load to ensure a power positive plan  Final reports were generated using the most likely tau value The tau during the dust storm continued to rise  It was found that the power modeling tool could not accept a tau value greater than 5.00  This limitation was built into the tool as at the time of development it was thought that the rovers could not survive a tau value higher than 5.0  This was problematic for the team as power modeling for taus above five would not be possible.  As such the engineering team would have to make informed assumptions as to the actual solar array output and to keep load energies as low as possible During the peak of the storm power output from the solar arrays was reduced over 80%.  The minimum one-sol array energy for Opportunity dropped to 128Whrs  The energy needed to conduct one sol of operations was approximately 180Whrs.  Each sol with a load energy in excess of the array energy drew power from the batteries and reduced the battery state of charge  An operations strategy that minimized power consumption to prevent irrecoverable discharge of the batteries while maintaining commandability of the vehicle was needed  The plan that was settled upon was three sols in duration.  The sequence bundles would be uplinked and activated on the first sol The second sol contained no activities other than a commanded wakeup for 15 minutes  The third sol would have telemetry relayed to the Odyssey orbiter for relay to Earth  This strategy reduced the rover\325s single sol energy consumption to approximately 150Whrs per sol Fortunately the solar array energy output was not below 150Whrs/sol for more than a few sols.  The battery energy was not depleted.  Table 1 provides a comparison of a pre 


 6  dust storm three sol plan with a three sol plan at the height of the storm The REM temperatures on both rovers were significantly reduced as a byproduct of the reduced activity level  The power and thermal engineers estimated that the REM heaters would use a minimum of 200Whrs before the REM reached an acceptable temperature  To reduce unexpected power consumption, the REM heaters on both vehicles were disabled To prevent the REM from reaching too low of a temperature the internal temperature was maintained by increasing the awake duration each sol  The initial awake duration of 45 minutes was not able to reverse the cooling of the REM.  An awake duration of 1 hour did stabilize the REM temperature and required approximately 40Whrs The low power fault mode was also modified to minimize power consumption  The awake time for the low power fault mode was reduced to 30 minutes.  The low power fault communication windows were shortened to 20 minutes in duration and set to receive only.  This change eliminates the use of power for transmission  The transmission of telemetry direct to Earth can be initiated by a real time comma nd  As the storm began to weaken activity levels on both vehicles were increased while maintaining a positive power profile.  The REM heaters and low power fault states were reverted to their original settings after the storm had mostly dissipated 4  L ES SONS L EARNED FOR S PIRIT 325 S T HIRD M ARTIAN W INTER  Multi-sol limited activity planning developed during the dust storm formed the basis of the strategy to allow Spirit to survive its third Martian winter  Power levels were expected to drop to approximately 150Whr per sol and temperatures were expected to cause all survival heaters to be activated A strategy was developed where Spirit would only support UHF relay downlinks every fourth sol.  To further conserve power the UHF communication sessions were shortened from 15 minutes to 6 minutes Each plan would last three four or seven sols  The sequences for each plan would be uplinked via the high-gain antenna HGA two sols prior to the start of the plan Uplinking on the sol before plan kickoff was provided as a backup.  This planning strategy was only possible due to the confidence in the modeling tools acquired during the dust storms  Table 1 - Opportunity Pre-Dust Storm \(Sols 1152-1154 and Dust Storm \(Sols 1237-1239\ Three Sol Plans Sol 1152  245  X Band Uplink  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES Sky & Ground  245  Pancam 3x1 mosaic  245  Pancam of target Jaen  245  M iniTES stares at targets Badajos, Castellon Coruna, Rioja, & Jaen  245  Nap  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES sky & ground  245  UHF Downlink  245  APXS Argon measurement  245  Nap  245  Mini Deep Sleep  245  Nap  245  Pancam sky survey  245  Nap  245  Navcam bitty cloud  245  MiniTES sky and ground   Sol 1237  245  X Band Uplink  245  Nap  245  D eep Sleep  Sol 1153  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES sky & ground  245  Drive  245  Post drive imaging  245  Navcam 5x1  245  Post drive Pancam  245  Nap  245  UHF Downlink  245  Nap  245  Deep Sleep  245  Nap  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES sky & gound   Sol 1238  245  Nap  245  Deep Sleep  245  Nap   Sol 1154  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES sky & ground  245  MiniTES gro und stares  245  Pancam Tau  245  Nap  245  Pancam Tau  245  MiniTES sky & ground  245  UHF Downlink  245  Nap  245  Deep Sleep  245  Nap  245  Pancam Tau  245  Pancam sky spot  245  Navcam bitty cloud  245  MiniTES sky & ground  245  Nap  245  MiniTES sky and ground  Sol 1239  245  Nap  245  UHF Downlink  245  Nap  245  Deep Sleep  


 7  5  C ONCLUSION  A combination of historical data on tau values during planet encircling dust storms, combined with realtime observations from spacecraft orbiting Mars and the resourcefulness of the science and engineering teams led to the survival of both of the Mars Exploration Rovers.  The techniques and strategies developed have influenced operations of both vehicles as the mission continues.  The strategies developed during the dust storm were highly influential in the survival of the Spirit rover during its third Martian winter Both rovers continue to operate on the Martian surface Spirit is resuming more normal operations as spring approaches.  Opportunity is departing Victoria crater, which it entered immediately after the 2007 dust storm, to begin a trek towards Endeavor Crater 12km to the Southeast It is hoped that the lessons learned from the continued operation of these two rovers will provide valuable lessons that can be applied to future surface explorations of Mars and other planets and moons 6  A CKNOWLEDGEMENTS  The work described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in support of the continued operation of the Mars Exploration Rovers The authors would like to acknowledge Jake Matijevic, the MER Spacecraft/Rover Engineering Team Chief for his detailed notes kept during the dust storms as well as his expertise and contributions to operation of both rovers The authors thank and acknowledge Mark Lemmon professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M, and Brue Cantor Mars meteorologist at Malin Space Science Systems for his scientific insight and numerous technical discussions The authors would also like to acknowledge the entire MER team for their successful efforts that allowed both vehicles to survive the dust storm R EFERENCES  1   M a r t i n   L   J    P   B   J a m e s   A   D o l l f u s   K   I w a s a k i  a n d  J   D Beish Telescopic Observations  Visual Photographic Polarimetric, in Mars edited by H.

6.2 Results  Figure 2 shows the overall average results of the BIA maturity assessments of the Belgium and Dutch participants. From this graph, some differences are immediately clear, specifically for skills  governance and scope and architecture Figure 3 shows the results on a deeper level. Based upon these differences, the following analysis can be made  Communications maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.0 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.9 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants do not show a lot of difference, also on the level of the individual assessment items shown in Figure 3. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Value measurement maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 2.7 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.9 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants on this variable show some difference. On the more detailed level, a substantial difference is shown on the item Formal assessments reviews The direction of the difference, however, is opposite to the expectation. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Governance maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.8 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.4 On this variable of BIA maturity, the results show the expected difference that the Belgium participants score higher than the Dutch participants. On the more detailed level it becomes clear that especially the prioritization process is scored significantly different The expected difference is therefore confirmed  Partnership maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.2 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.2 The scores of the Belgium participants and of the Dutch participants on this variable are equal. The expected difference is therefore not confirmed  Scope & Architecture maturity  Average maturity of Belgium participants: 3.3 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 2.8 For this variable the expectation was undecided. The results show a remarkably higher score of the Belgium participants than of the Dutch participants. On the more detailed level this difference shows on all items  Skills maturity Average maturity of Belgium participants: 2.8 Average maturity of Dutch participants: 3.2 For this variable, the results show the expected difference that the Dutch participants score a higher maturity than the Belgium participants.

Conclusions and limitations  The conceptual analysis of the potential influence of national cultures on BIA maturity provides indications that this influence is indeed more than likely and that its influence is consistent over the different dimensions of culture. Our first empirical exploration provided support for the existence of differences in BIA maturity between countries. More specifically, the differences in scores regarding the alignment domains governance maturity and skills maturity could be explained by Hofstede s cultural differences studies, with governance maturity scoring higher in Belgium and skills maturity scoring better in the Netherlands. One a more detailed level, it was expected and confirmed that the portfolio management process received better in Belgium and that Ability to attract and retain and Change readiness clearly received better scores in the Netherlands Our study did not, however, confirm all expected results. The domains communications maturity  value measurement maturity and partnership maturity did not show the difference in scores that were expected. In fact, the scores showed no clear substantial at all. A potential explanation for this result could be the small sample size. Therefore, further study should be made, based on larger samples, to further explore and study the impact of cultural differences on business and IT alignment scores.

Automated Windowed Coefficient Trending Earlier we attempted to find explanatory models whose coefficients changed over time in a predictable way This would then let us predict future coefficient values for these models and apply these trended models towards future estimates The problem was that we were not able to find such stable models at least manually We automated our search for stable models by building a system we refer to as the Automated Coefficient Trend Search ACTS tool A patent is currently pending for the method implemented in this software Against the Far Out data set ACTS is designed to automatically permute fields run chronologically-windowed regressions with the chosen fields establish linear and nonlinear trends for the resulting coefficients and then use these trended coefficients to estimate a future set of data ACTS also automatically tries up to seven different transformations on any given dependant or independent variable The length of calibration windows and the increment between them are automatically varied ACTS establishes most promising coefficient trends and also rates the performance of predictions done using trended-coefficient models With so many parameters transformations windows length and intervals to evaluate ACTS needed to search a huge problem space Despite assembling a cluster of 8 computers to run ACTS if necessary for months the problem still required pruning Each run of ACTS was therefore restricted to producing models with a different number of variables between 3 and 15 We quickly found that the best models contained very few parameters due to over-fitting on wider models permitting us to pare down the problem Neural Netv 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 I  M The system produced literally thousands of forecasts for each project If the distribution of project costs and project costs estimates were known a confidence interval could be computed using the cost estimates and a method such as Bayesian model averaging used to integrate them 5 Not having a priori knowledge of this distribution we chose instead to use the inter-quartile range of the estimates that is we looked at whether the estimate fell between the first and third quartile of the estimates The top and bottom 25 were disregarded because there are always outliers and it was presumed the system could work well even when many of the individual estimates were not very good Given the very large number of estimates produced by the system literally thousands or tens of thousands depending on the settings we could afford to squander a few Results were best with only three variables per equation In eight out of 31 projects 26 of the projects the project's actual costs fell within the inter-quartile range of the forecasts of costs for that project produced by the ACTS models For 30 out of 31 projects the inter-quartile range of estimates was made up of over a thousand estimates while for the 3 1st project only 446 estimates were part of the inter-quartile range The significance of these numbers is revealed in the next paragraph When equations with four variables were used only one of the true project costs fell within the inter-quartile range of forecasts produced by ACTS When more than 4 variables were used none of the true project costs fell within the interquartile range From this we concluded that ACTS performed best when only 3 variables were included in each model Using more variables appears to produce over-fitted models Aork MRE By Lauch Month Chronologic 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 Launch Month Since 1960 Figure 10 Neural network magnitude of relative error sorted chronologically 11 space 


incapable of accurate forecasts Of course the wider the inter-quartile range of forecasts the more likely it is that the true forecast will fit within that range But how parsimonious is the range As figure 11 shows in about 55\2600 of the inter-quartile ranges created by ACTS the 3rd quartile of estimates is 50%0 larger than the Ist quartile of estimates For about 90\2600 of the ranges created the difference between the I't and 3rd quartile is less than 75\2600 and for 97\2600 of the projects the top of the range is 100 or less than the bottom of the range 45\2600 of the true project costs falling into the new range When the top and bottom of the range were changed by 50\2600 the range estimates encompassed 77\2600 of the true project costs In the end however we felt that the adjusted ranges were too wide for practical use Adaboosting using binomial logit classifiers Short for adaptive boosting the Adaboost algorithm 6 is a type of machine learning algorithm where a set of classifiers are adjusted to favor previous misclassifications These classifiers are actually other estimating algorithms Percentage of Time 3rd Quartile no more than XO/o Greater than 1st Quartile 120 100 80 60 40 20 0 25 50 75 100 Figure 11 Variation in ACTS-produced estimates measured between 3rd and 1st quartile Percentage of time True Cost Falls in Range Produced by ACTS 3 variable ersion 90 8070 60 5040 30 20 10 l 0 Interquartile  or10  or25  or50  or75 Figure 12 The effect of widening the estimating range measured by  of estimates now lying within Of the eight projects that fell within the average percentage difference between the 1st and 3rd quartile was 55 with median of 52 This indicated that the inter-quartile range might be too restrictive We therefore proceeded to widen the range of cost estimates for each project multiplying the ISt quartile estimate by 1 X%0 and the 3rd quartile estimate by 1  X using various Xs In each instance we compared actual project costs to estimates produced and determined how frequently the actual fell into the range of estimates Results are summarized in figure 12 When the top and bottom of the range were changed by 10 32 of the actual estimates fell within the new range Extending each of the range boundaries by 25 resulted in Adaboost works by iteratively weighting observations so that poorly classified ones are given more weight during the next iteration With the algorithm focused on improving estimates for exceptional cases it is somewhat more sensitive to noisy data and outliers though less likely to over fit We chose to test this approach due to the latter property The boosting algorithm seemed structured particularly for binary decisions though we are seeking to estimate a continuous variable cost We therefore staged the method by estimating cost bands so that the estimate for each band reverted to a binary decision The algorithm would separately estimate whether an observation was 12 


our evaluation method tested potential models using either ordinary least squares least absolute above or below X dollars then Y dollars then Z such that instead namely that we were examining a proportion rather X  Y  Z than a binary outcome but this was impractical to use and we judged that the problem was not strongly biased towards The boosting algorithm still required a classifier and model either context For a classifier we implemented binary logit78 a discrete Adaboost MRE By COST Lu was similar to ACTS but with 0 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 0.25 0 50 0 75 1 00 1 25 1 50 1 75 2 00 Cost Figure 13 Adaboost magnitude of relative error sorted by actual cost Adaboost MRE CHRONOLOGICALLY Year Figure 14 Adaboost magnitude of relative error sorted chronologically choice model specifically intended for a binary dependant variable is the cost above or below this point There may have been some support for using the probit model 7 This was done by a statistical programmer with output checked against the statistics program STATA 8 we obtained from this first stage system We also attempted to use OLS as a classifier but our experiments showed no significant effect from adding relatively orthogonal i.e unrelated models Since using more than one model did not make a difference boosting using OLS was little more than a single OLS model with estimates divvied up in bands no dynamic re-weighting of classifiers and thus no boosting effect to speak of To obtain models some changes and improvements and again put were discarded and resolved by the latter 13 Lu 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 0 0.50 0.75 1 00 1.25 1 50 1 75 2 00 error which better discounts outliers and weighted least squares The models which we built another windowed test system that our computing cluster to use trying to find good ones from were then used to bootstrap the binary logit method although coefficients a sea of potential transformations This time 


This exercise required a number of decisions about how many classifiers to use how many bands to estimate and how many variables should be used in the models All these choices were made empirically Models with 3 variables were marginally more accurate than those with 4 More models seemed generally better to a point so we used 99 models We also used 22 cost bands checking whether an estimate was above or below 12M 35M 44M and so on through 519M It is interesting to note that there was no data scarcity-induced limit on the number of bands we could have used since each was estimated using all observations lying above and below and not just between bands As with the neural network training was carried out using 52 missions from the 1960s through 1996 and testing occurred on 58 missions from 1996 through 2007 The trend in estimate deviation would again permit us to gauge whether predictive accuracy decayed over time Results are shown sorted by cost in figure 13 and chronologically in figure 14 Figure 13 shows that MREs are large and negative for missions at 56M actual mission cost and below Above this point results are mixed although not as poor as at the very low range There seems to be no degradation in predictive accuracy as projects increase in scale The correlation between estimates and actual values is approximately 0.66 Sorted chronologically in figure 14 no trend can be seen as estimates go farther out up to 11 years as was seen with the neural network Again this may have been due to the normalization process in which we mapped each variable to its percentage ranking based on future and past minimum and maximum values basically embedding the effect of time within the factors being input to the model It also may be due to a relatively stable era Weighted combinations of simple models A persistent problem in multivariate estimation methods which has been mentioned is that a model may be produced that over fits the observations used for calibration It would thus not be adequately generalized to estimate out of that sample Techniques such as jack-knifing and outlier removal can mitigate this We chose another approach developing models that were little more than simple rules of thumb and then combining these in a weighted manner so each would have a say in the estimate The weightings were formulated using Excel's Solver to minimize estimation error on a set observations lying 15 to 25 years before the test set We refer to this method as continuous boosting because as with the Adaboost method it too involves a mix of classifiers that are combined according to their performance against a set of test observations Unlike Adaboost which solves a binary problem the algorithms are here estimating on a continuous scale Also unlike Adaboost the models are re-weighted rather than the observations to maximize prediction Before presenting results it is worth noting that we ran a control test where all variables from the simple rules of thumb were combined into a single model and run on the same windows performance was nowhere near as good We chose the models by hand guided by the criteria that they should be relatively orthogonal rely on differing parameters so they could each contribute a unique influence to the combined result Figure 15 shows that MREs are mostly positive though for lower cost missions errors are regularly negative and large Continuous Boost MRE By COST M M 1.00 0.75 0.50 0.25 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75 2.00 Cost Figure 15 Continuous boosting magnitude of relative error sorted by actual cost 14 


CONCLUSIONS Given that this project was intended to estimate missions lying 10-15 years out we structured it differently than one intended to estimate contemporary projects A variety of conventional techniques were not used as we felt they would over fit training observations and thus not be suitable for prediction We also were not sure which approach would work so we tried many We heavily favored ensemble methods where models are combined because we surmised that any one model could not be guaranteed to have the best view of the future However a single neural network ultimately yielded the most competitive results Another finding was that methods built upon simple models such as with three variables generally did work best not surprisingly because they were less likely to over fit calibration data A graph of the three best methods is shown in figure 18 with estimates for the same missions sorted by cost For the neural network calibration occurred until just before the results shown for continuous boosting calibration occurred no more recently than 15 years prior to the results and for Adaboost calibration also occurred up until the results shown A graph sorted by year is not shown we think it instructive that no results seemed to degrade over time As mentioned but obvious from figure 17 the neural network performs best followed by Adaboost and then continuous boosting It is interesting to note that the three cases in which the neural network goes haywire and predicts too low also correspond to worst performances for the Adaboost method pointing to exceptional data points We will be further investigating these regularly errant results and other outliers which may result in estimating improvements ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This work was carried out under Small Business Innovation Research contract FS9453-05-C-0023 with the Air Force Research Lab The authors wish to gratefully acknowledge Judy Fennelly and later Ross Wainwright our technical points of contact at AFRL for their continuous support and encouragement Our contract officer Timothy Provencio also provided invaluable assistance Our critical seed stock of data was provided by Joseph Hamaker who previously was Director of NASA Headquarters Cost Analysis Division and now is Senior Cost Analyst with SAIC Ainsley Chong and Dale Martin USAF Ret also lent considerable assistance with data gathering APPENDIX A MISSIONS COLLECTED Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor Satellite Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorer Adeos Advanced Communications Technology Satellite Advanced Composition Explorer Alexis Amos-I AMSC-1 Anik El Anik E2 Applications Technology Satellite-I Applications Technology Satellite-2 Applications Technology Satellite-5 All MREs Lu 1.00 0.75 l 0.50l 0.25 l 0.00 0.25 0.50 0.75 1.00 1.25 1.50 1.75-2.00oi v 1   Cost o N X  X~~~~~Cl Figure 16 Comparison of estimating error for three best methods 15
