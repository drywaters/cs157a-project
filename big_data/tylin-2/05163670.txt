Among them, the observation of microorganism is a very important experimental approach of 
bioengineering. As the biological sensing chip technology becomes mature, it is even beneficial to the research. Most of the biological sensing chips for measuring and observation adopt different type of precise microscopes and the corresponding software. However, the size is very big and the cost is expensive Besides, the manufacturing processes and requirements of different biological sensing chips are different, different software are required for analysis. This limits the applying scope Therefore, we focus on manufacturing low-cost, small size and portable auto-focus digital microscope in this study. The autofocus technology is combined with microscope so that it is more convenient for the users to observe the biological sensing chip 
Different objects for observation have been considered in the design process. Therefore, the microscope has been designed for both standing inverted or upright. Observers can use the standing inverted microscope to observe the behavior and track of microorganism on biological sensing chip, such as cell separation chip. Besides, the standing upright microscope can be used to observe cell slides, such as animal or plant slides. In addition to the low cost and portability, the free focus technology also makes the focus concentrating on the target and it can link up with computer so that the observed data can be processed with different types of operation and analysis. This includes counting of cells and 
analysis of motion tracks so that the application of microscope would be wider Keywords  Microorganism behavior  Biological sensing chip  Microscope  Auto-focus  I   I NTRODUCTION  The cost of microscope for general microorganism behavior observation and biological sensing chip is too expensive and the portability is low. In addition, there is restriction on software. These cause the limitation on using the resources. Therefore, it has been decided to manufacture a set of low cost, multipurpose and portable basic model of 
Auto-focus Digital Microscopic Image Platform [1 2  I n  addition, the existing biological resource - paramecium has been used in the test so that the biological sensing experiment can be processed. This is the most important objective of this study. In the experiment of paramecium observation [3 4    m o s t of t h e pa ram eci u m  m u s t  be  i n j e ct e d  with different drugs in order to record large amount of primary data. It is not easy to get the drugs. Besides, the cost of general digital microscope is expensive or the size is too big. Thus, our objectives are to save the valuable paramecium resources and fully utilize the equipments in the 
laboratory for resources sharing. This study will develop a set low cost and small size Auto-focus Digital Microscopic Image Observation System. The network camera found in the market replaces the expensive CCD camera as the source of image capturing. Moreover, different lens, Z-axis automation device [5 h o m e m a d e l i ght i ng ci rc ui t a n d peripheral are used to make an auto-focus digital microscope It is then used to observe and record the behavior of paramecium for the computer to analyze the behaviors of the paramecium. Besides, according to the diverseness, the different types and meaningful algorithms are developed In addition, the dielectrophoretic cell-separation 
microchip and Hemocytometer provided by professor Zhang Xian Zhang from Institute of Biochemical Engineering in Cheng Kung University are used as the samples for observation. This shows the focus effect and the applicable scope of the Auto-focus Digital Microscopic Image Platform standing inverted II  METHODOLOGY  A  Hardware  The microscope used in this study is homemade autofocus digital microscope. The structure is divided into three parts: light source, Z-axis automation device and eyepiece. A photo of our lab-built prototype microscope is shown in Fig 
1. An inverted microscope is shown in Fig. 2 The bottom of platform is light source comprising a backlight unit and a driving circuit. For the light source at the bottom, the power circuit, high-luminance LED and light guiding plate are used for the light source. We use the 9V voltage transformer to supply the power. Through the voltage stabilizing IC 7805, the voltage is decreased to around 5V. The variable resistor is added so that the 1

 205\205\205\205\205\205\205\205\205\205\205\205. \(1 This formula describe how and where to build a virtual reverse image at the lens\222 one side when a real object is placed at another side. In the formula the distances from the object to the lens and from the lens to the image are S 1 and S 2 respectively, and f is the focal length. In the proposed system, we designed a custom Z-axis automation device to change distance between objective lens and image sensor make focus point lie on the sensor. We use different optical lens to achieve the requirement for observing different microorganism. Different lens have different focal length Therefore, there should be moving control on Z-axis. For the automation of Z-axis, the ball screw \(KR26, THK\ has been adopted to make a platform that moves vertically and the lens is put on the platform. Considering the load of the screw, we make use of aluminum plate 130 mm long\x 40  mm width\x 2 mm thick\ the platform. The drawtube is a hollow aluminum tube with 16 mm internal diameter\x 22  mm external diameter\x 120 mm long\The inner side of the hallow tube is processed with thread by CNC lathe thread pitch 0.75 mm threat depth 0.5 mm n order to fix the lens. The length of the drawtube with the lens is 170 mm  The stepper motor \(2 phase step PH268-22, VEXTA together with coupling \(JCFC-16, HIWIN\e used to drive the screw. Regarding the control of stepper motor, a homemade drive circuit and single chip ATMEGA8535 Atmel Corporation\ are used for the control. A photo of drive circuit is shown in Fig. 3 The manufacturing and design of digital camera and built-in camera mobile become mature gradually. Since this study is to observe micro-image, the high resolution is not necessary. Therefore, we can make use of network video camera commonly found in market as the image-capturing eyepiece. The WEICHI 130 millions of resolution network video camera has been adopted in this study. The system flow diagram is shown in Fig. 4  Figure1. Our lab-built upright microscope with web camera  Figure2.  An inverted microscope  Figure3.    A homemade drive circuit and single chip ATMEGA8535 \(Atmel Corporation\are used for the control brightness is adjustable. For the light source on the top, the small white light torch is put on the XY platform The objective lens is the most important component of the optical system in terms of the quality of the final image And there are many commercial objective lenses with several fixed magnifications ranging. We use commercial objective lens for one part of the proposed system. Because of the complementary metal\226oxide\226semiconductor image sensor only responds to input light received without the ability to tuning the imaging range, a lens is applied to focus the image on the sensor, necessitating the knowledge of the focus length of the used lens. The lens formula is shown in Equation \(1    fSS 111 21 2 


 Figure4.  The system flow diagram B  Software The MATLAB Simulink software \(Version 7.5.0.342\(R2007b\ The MathWorks lnc\ has been used to process image analysis and auto-focus algorithm in this study. Through the RS232, the control chip ATMEGA8535 can send the signal to control the rotation of stepper motor and the move of Z-axis. For the auto-focus algorithm, the image is processed by Discrete Cosine Transform \(DCT\[6   and the high frequency portion of the signal is captured in order to determine whether the image is properly focused The block diagram of the auto-focus algorithm is shown in Fig.5  Figure5.    The block diagram of the auto-focus algorithm III  R ESULTS  After the experimental platform is prepared, this system has been adopted to observe the paramecium and the dielectrophoretic \(Ningbo Hinotek Technology Co., Ltd china\l-separation microchip provided professor Zhang Xian Zhang from Institute of Biochemical Engineering in Cheng Kung University. This chip makes use of irregular alternating electric field to produce different asymmetrical electric polarization to microorganism so that the microorganism moves to the strong or weak electric field under the effect of electric field force. This achieves the separation of different microorganism. The size is 75 mm x 32 mm The standing upright microscope is used to observe the paramecium. The paramecium is put on the Hemocytometer for observation. There is a 0.25 mm x 0.25  mm grid on the Hemocytometer that is convenient for counting the magnification. Since paramecium moves very fast, the focus speed cannot catch up the tracing speed Therefore, the accurate focal length of the rapid moving object cannot be obtained. However, the fixed object can be focused accurately, such as the Hemocytometer. A photo of Hemocytometer focus result is shown in Fig. 6. A photo of Hemocytometer not focus result is shown in Fig. 7. For the observation of dielectrophoretic cell-separation microchip provided by professor Zhang Xian Zhang from Institute of Biochemical Engineering in Cheng Kung University\, it is focused on observing the channel that cells have to pass through. The width of the channel is around 0.01 mm and the standing inverted microscope is used for observation Since the channel is small, high magnification of lens must be used, such as the 10x lens of general microscope. The result of focus is satisfied. A photo of dielectrophoretic cellseparation microchip focus result is shown in Fig. 8. A photo of dielectrophoretic cell-separation microchip not focus result is shown in Fig. 9. At the beginning of the observation, the loaded slides ar e adjusted manually so it is not able to focus the rapid moving object accurately Therefore, in coordination with the tracking object algorithm, an automated XY platform has been made. It is convenient to adjust to the position of observation accurately and the automatic microscopic image system is made   Figure7. The Hemocytometer focus result and analyze frequency 3

The Hemocytometer not focus result and analyze frequency IV  DISCUSSION  In addition to the magnifying function of the microscope, the auto-focus function is added. The main objective is to focus rapidly and reduce manual error during the observation. The 30 millions - 130 millions resolution of network video camera found in the market is used to capture the images. During the paramecium behavior test the moving track and direction can be recorded to an AVI file storing in computer. Then the software such as MATLAB, VB, VC and LabVIEW is used for analysis to get the useful data, including the counts of cells. Besides the observation can be processed on the computer screen directly. This avoids the traditional microscope that is apt to make the eyes tired. The whole set of equipment is enough for primary observation. It is expected that the whole system will be designed to fully automated in the future so that the system can be applied more extensively A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This study is subsidized by research scheme of National Science Council \(NSC 96-2221-E-006-234-\.

shifted by  m This means that the calculation of  r c and r c could be simplified by shifting the symmetrical interval type-2 fuzzy set A  by  m to be symmetrical around a more convenient point like the origin as in 14  t o h a v e s A  as shown in Fig 4 In Fig 4 we have a symmetrical triangular interval type-2 fuzzy set A  which is centred around m and can be represented by the two points m+pl and m+pu and their symmetrical points around m mpl and m pu Soifwe shifted A  so that mê=0 and  m=-m we will have s A  with thebasepoints m-pu-m=-pu  m-pl-m=-pl m+pl-m=pl and m+pu-m=pu  If we then used Equations 16 and 17 to calculate rs c and rs c of the shifted type-2 set s A  thenfor A   r c  rs c  m  m c rs  and r c  rs c  m  m c rs   Fig.4 Shifting a symmetrical type-2 fuzzy set to the origin to facilitate computation In case of the shifted symmetrical triangular interval type2 fuzzy set s A  that is centred around the origin as shown in the left part of Fig.4 we will then have m=0  A LMF pl A UMF  pu and from Equation 15 by substituting p=0 s=0 and q=pu we get c HUMF  pu/3 similarly c HLMF pl/3 By substituting in Equations 16 and 17 rs c and rs c could be written as follows 1  33 rs pu pu pl pl pu pl c pl pu       18 22  66 rs pu pu pl pl pu pl c pl pl   19 As we shifted the type-2 set A  by m to form s A   therefore we have also to shift k o c max and q max by m to have q smax and k o cs max  therefore we can write rs c and rs c as follows rs c  3 pu pl   k o cs max 20 rs c  pl pl pu 6 2 2   q smax 21 By subtracting Equation 21 from 20 we have q smax k o cs max  D           1 2 3 pl pl pu pl pu 22 By adding Equations 21 to 20 we have q smax  k o cs max  S  pl pl pu 6 2 2   3 pl pu  23 From Equation 22 it could be seen that pl pl pu 6 2 2   D 3 pl pu  therefore from Equation 23 S D 3 pl pu   3 pl pu  D 3   2 pl pu  24 Therefore we can see from Equation 24 that pu-pl  2   3 D S  and thus we get 3  2 SD pu pl   25 Substituting in Equation 22 we get D 6   3 D S                1 2 2   3 pl pl pl D S  pl D S 8   3 2  26 Therefore pl can be written as pl D D S 8   3 2  From Equation 25 pu could be written as follows pu  pl D S   2   3           D D S D S 4 1 2   3  D D S D S 8  3    3   27 Substituting the values of S and D from Equations\(22 23  it follows that pl   8   3 max max 2 max max max max k o s k o s k o s cs q cs q cs q         2 3 max max 2 max k o s k o cs q cs  28 pu    8   3     3 max max max max max max max max max max k o s k o s k o s k o s k o s cs q cs q cs q cs q cs q            2  2  3 max max max max max k o s k o s k o cs q cs q cs   29 To obtain the base values for the type-2 fuzzy set A  we have to shift back by adding m to pl and pu so that we can have the symmetrical type-2 triangular fuzzy set as shown in Fig 3\(b IV E XPERIMENTS AND R ESULTS Due to the limited space this section will report only on one set of experiments that deals with the speed control of marine diesel engines The experiments were performed on a marine diesel engine testing platform which is designed to realistically reflect the characteristics and operating 152 2008 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2008 


conditions of the marine diesel engines with the ability to alter speed load inertia and torque The platform uses the noisy sensors and actuators used in the engine with the ability to introduce the same uncertainty levels faced in the real engines In the following experiments we will compare the developed type-2 FLCs against the different individual type-1 FLCs that were used under the various operation conditions Both the type-1 and type-2 FLCs will have two inputs which are the error  e  which is the difference between the process speed set-point and the current speed and the rate of change of error  d   Both the type-1 and the type-2 FLCs will have only one output which is Manipulating Variable  mv  which is corresponding to the electric output to the actuator Each input will be represented by two linguistic labels which are Low and High  The FLC output will be represented by four linguistic labels which are Negative Large NL Negative Small NS Positive Small PS and Positive Large PL  The type-2 FLCs will be constructed through the various type-1 FLCs used under the different operation conditions of 20 40 60 80 and 100 full operation load A Control Surface Analysis The control surface enables us to visualize the unknown input-output mapping function articulated by the FLC which will allow us to analyze the response of each controller Fig 5\(a and Fig 5\(b show the control surfaces for the type-1 FLCs that were tuned to handle 20  and 60  of full operation load respectively Note that the control surfaces of these type-1 FLCs are steep and non smooth and especially around the set point where e 0and d 0 consequently any small variation of e and d can cause considerable changes in mv which means that the type-1 FLCs are vulnerable to uncertainties Moreover the larger the variations in e and d due to the uncertainties which can be associated with the change of operation conditions the bigger will be the disturbances to mv which can cause instability and destruction of the engine Fig 6a shows the control surface formed by aggregating the 5 type-1 FLCs corresponding to the various loads 20 40 60 80 and 100 full operation load this surface still shows the steep non smooth characteristic of the individual type-1 FLCs however it is slightly smoother than the individual type-1 FLCs Hence the control performance improves in face of uncertainty when aggregating several type-1 FLCs According to Karnik et al 1  th e t y p e2 F LC ca n b e thought of as a collection of many different type-1 FLCs where each of these type-1 FLCs is embedded in the type-2 FLC So the crisp outputs of the type-2 FLC can be obtained by aggregating the outputs of all the embedded type-1 FLCs 12  I n t hi s w a y t h e c o n t r o l s u rf a c e o f t he t y p e 2 F L C u s i ng the Karnik-Mendel type Reduction shown in Fig 6b shows a very smooth response as it is in theory aggregating the outputs of the 5 type-1 FLCs corresponding to the various operation loads plus many more embedded type-1 FLCs This smooth response will consequently give a very good control performance that can handle the uncertainties and disturbances as near the set point where e 0and d 0 small variations in e and d will not cause significant changes to mv and the response goes on gradually and smoothly with no steep changes The smooth control surfaces associated with the type-2 FLC have been shown in other previous work 1  a b Fig 5 a Control surface type-1 FLC tuned to operate at 20  full load b Control surface type-1 FLC tuned to operate at 60  full load a b Fig 6 a Control surface of aggregated type-1 FLCs b Control surface of the developed type-2 FLC B Representative Control Experiments Although we have performed many control experiments however due to the limited space in this subsection we will present only representative set of control experiments In the following experiments a set point of 1000 rpm was chosen for the marine engine testing platform We mimicked the real operation of diesel engines where in each experiment the controllers were allowed to reach the setpoint and stabilise with no load after which we began to add different loads suddenly to mimic the uncertainties associated with change of operation and load conditions It is necessary for the diesel engine speed controller to be able to deal quickly with the uncertainties associated with a change of load producing minimum overshoot/undershoot as large disturbances can cause damage due to the large size and high speeds of the engines Fig.7 shows a type-1 FLC that was tuned to give a very good response at 20  full load After the type-1 FLC was started and stabilised at no load its nominal operation load 20  full load was applied and the FLC showed a very  2008 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2008 153 


small disturbance and settled quickly to its set point However as the FLC encountered larger disturbances that were associated with the change of operation conditions the type-1 FLC performance deteriorated and it produced high overshoots and undershoots and it required a much longer period to settle back to the set point Thus as discussed before a single type-1 FLC will not be able to handle all the uncertainties associated the change of operation conditions on its own and therefore we will need other type-1 FLCs designed for other loads to handle the faced uncertainties Fig 7 a Response of the 20 type-1 FLC to load changes a b Fig.8 a Comparison of the response of 20  type-1 FLC with the type-2 FLCs without changing the load b Comparison of the response of 20  type-1 FLC with the type-2 FLCs with 100  load addition Fig 8 shows a comparisons between the type-1 FLCs that were tuned for a specific load 20  full load and the developed type-2 FLC that use the Iterative Karnik-Mendel procedure referred to as Iterative type-2 FLC Fig.8 also shows the type-2 FLC that use the Wu-Mendel uncertainty bounds method referred to as the Bounds type-2 FLC 16 The Bounds type-2 FLC used the developed input and output type-2 fuzzy sets and we aimed to verify that the difference between the developed Iterative type-2 FLC and the Bounds type-2 FLC is very small This means that the suggested method in this paper could be used in conjunction with the Wu-Mendel uncertainty bounds method to give even a faster control performance Fig 8a shows comparisons that were conducted with no load changes from the nominal loads that the type-1 FLCs were tuned for 20  full load From these comparisons it is obvious that the performance of both the type-2 FLCs the Iterative and Bounds type-2 FLCs gave a slightly superior performance to the type-1 FLC where the type-2 FLCs had less settling time while producing less overshoots and undershoots This shows that even with no load disturbance the type-2 FLC outperformed the type-1 FLCs under the loads where the type-1 FLCs were tuned to be sub-optimal Note that the performances of the Iterative and Bounds type2FLCs are very close that it is very difficult to distinguish both performances from each other The power of the type-2 FLC will be further demonstrated when the FLC is introduced to high uncertainty levels as shown in Fig 8b in which the FLC is introduced to a high disturbance of adding 100  full load It is obvious that the type-2 FLCs produced a robust response as it handled the uncertainty and recovered quickly with a short settling time while producing smaller overshoots and undershoots compared to their type-1 counterparts The type-2 FLC had handled the uncertainties and produced a good performance using a single type-2 FLC while the type-1 FLCs need various controllers to handle these uncertainties Again note that the performance of the Iterative and Bounds type-2 FLCs is very close The same results applied to various load and operation conditions V C ONCLUSION In this paper we presented a novel method for generating the input and output type-2 fuzzy sets so that their FOUs can capture the faced uncertainties In the proposed method for each input to the type-2 FLC and for each linguistic label we generated a type-2 fuzzy set that embedded all the type-1 fuzzy sets used so far to represent this label at the different operation conditions While for each output of the type-2 FLC and for each linguistic label we generated a type-2 fuzzy set whose centroids embedded all the centroids of the type-1 fuzzy sets used so far to represent this label at the different operation conditions By doing this we generated a single type-2 FLC that tried to embed the different type-1 FLCs that were used as a group to handle the uncertainties under the various operation conditions In addition the type2 FLC embedded a large number of other embedded type-1 FLCs This will allow the type-2 FLC to handle the uncertainties through a large number of embedded type-1 FLCs to produce a smooth and robust control performance Through the control surface analysis and through control experiments we have shown that the developed type-2 FLC can handle the uncertainties associated with the change of operation to produce a robust and smooth control response The type-2 FLC can recover quickly from disturbances with short settling times and with minimum overshoots and undershoots thus outperforming the performance of the type1 FLCs It was noted also that the performances of the Iterative and Bounds type-2 FLCs are very close for the control application Hence the Wu-Mendel uncertainty bounds method can be used in conjunction with the suggested method and thus avoiding the use of the iterative Karnik-Mendel procedure Our following work will report on the extension of the suggested method to different input and output type-2 MF  154 2008 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems FUZZ 2008

execution Most of these approaches utilize some kind of state machinery for this Book and Gruhn present an approach to describe the dialogue by dialogue graphs that are enhanced state machines They present the formal semantics of the Dialogue Flow Notation DFN that provides constructs for the design of modular navigation models These dialogue graphs are on the same level as our composite statecharts describing all possible dialogue paths The dialogue graphs have to be speciìed by the UI designer whereas our composite statecharts are automatically generated from the high-level discourse model ConcurTaskTrees are a w ay of hierarchical task modeling where different temporal relations among tasks can be speciìed e.g enabling disabling concurrency order independence and suspend-resume Out of such task models the user interface can be created through several steps of model transformations CTT also allows the derivation of presentation units consisting of a set of tasks and their transitions but their transition graph is more abstract than our presentation unit state machine skipping detailed trigger events for the transitions Elkoutbi et al present an approach that generates a user interface prototype from scenarios Scenarios are enriched with UI information and are automatically transformed into UML statecharts which are then used for UI prototype generation In contrast to this approach we model classes of dialogues supporting a set of scenarios We are not aware of any approach that would generate the behavior of user interfaces automatically from a largely declarative high-level discourse model In addition to taking a communication-centric approach and modeling humanmachine communication in the form of discourses we generate user interfaces automatically including their behavior 8 Conclusion In this paper we address the issue of automatic generation of the behavior of a user interface from a high-level discourse model While the generation seems to be possible from a purely declarative model the complete behavioral operationalization is facilitated by introducing behavioral constructs into the otherwise declarative model We deìned procedural semantics for both the procedural and the declarative constructs of the discourse model using statecharts Based on these building blocks for operationalization we showed how composite statecharts for whole discourse trees can be generated These directly deìne all possible behaviors of a fully serialized user interface e.g using speech input and output In contrast for a graphical user interface with potentially inìnite screen size we showed a derivation of a nite-state machine from a composite statechart for deìning its behavior The behavior of multimodal interfaces can be deìned in the spectrum between these extremes In this way we have deìned how the behavior of user interfaces can be automatically generated from a largely declarative high-level discourse model Taking this together with generating structural UI models enables the automatic generation of user interfaces from such discourse models 9 Acknowledgements This research has been carried out in the CommRob project  http://www.commrob.eu  and is partially funded by the EU contract number IST-045441 under the 6th framework programme References  C Bogdan J F alb H Kaindl S Ka v aldjian R Popp H Horacek E Arnautovic and A Szep Generating an abstract user interface from a discourse model inspired by human communication In Proceedings of the 41th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences HICSS-41  Piscataway NJ USA 2008 IEEE Computer Society Press  M Book and V  Gruhn Modeling Web-based dialog o ws for automatic dialog control In Proceedings of the 19th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering ASEê04  pages 100Ö109 Washington DC USA 2004 IEEE Computer Society  M Elk outbi I Khriss and R K K eller  Automated prototyping of user interfaces based on UML scenarios Automated Software Engg  13\(1 2006  S Ka v aldjian C Bogdan J F alb and H Kaindl T ransforming discourse models to structural user interface models In Models in Software Engineering LNCS  volume 5002/2008 pages 77Ö88 Springer Berlin  Heidelberg 2008  S K ost Dynamically Generated Multi-Modal Application Interfaces  PhD thesis TU Dresden 2006  P  Luf f N Gilbert and D Frohlich Computers and Conversation  Academic Press 1990  W  C Mann and S Thompson Rhetorical Structure Theory Toward a functional theory of text organization In Text  pages 243Ö281 1988  G Mori F  P aterno and C Santoro Design and de v elopment of multidevice user interfaces through multiple logical descriptions IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering  30\(8 8 2004  J R Searle Speech Acts An Essay in the Philosophy of Language  Cambridge University Press Cambridge England 1969 Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 10 


 11 This model specifies that covariates act multiplicatively on time t r than on the hazar d function.  That is, we assume a baseline hazard function to exist and that the effects of the covariates are to alter the rate at which an individual proceeds along the time axis.  In other words, the covariates z accelerates or decelerates the time to failure Kalbfleisch and Prentice 2002, Lawless 2003  It should be pointed out that the distribution-based regression models for exponential and Weibull distributions in the previous section are th e special cases of both PHM and AFT.  This correspondence is not necessarily true for models based on other distribu tions. Indeed, two-parameter Weibull distribution has the uniq ue property that it is closed under both multiplication of fa ilure time and multiplication of the hazard function by an arbitrary nonzero constant Lawless 2003, Kalbfleisch & Prentice 2002, Klein Moeschberger 2003  2.6. Counting Process and Survival Analysis   In the previous sections, we introduced censoring and survival analysis models th at can handle the censored information; however, we did not discuss how the censored information is processed.  Accommodating and maximally utilizing the partial information from the censored observations is the most challenging and also the most rewarding task in survival anal ysis.  This also establishes survival analysis as a unique fiel d in mathematical statistics Early statistical inferences for censored data in survival analysis were dependent on asymptotic likelihood theory Severini 2000\ Cox \(1972, 1975\ proposed partial likelihood as an extension to classical maximum likelihood estimation in the context of hi s proportional hazards model as a major contribution. Asymptotic likelihood has been and still is the dominant theory for developing survival analysis inference and hypothesis testing methods \(Klein and Moeschberger 2003, Severini 2000\. There are many monographs and textbooks of survival analysis containing sufficient details for applying survival analysis \(Cox and Oakes 1984, Kalbfleisch and Prentice 1980, 2002, Lawless 1982, 2003, Klein and Moeschberger, 2003\. A problem with traditional asymptotic lik elihood theory is that the resulting procedures can become very complicated when handling more complex censoring mechanisms \(Klein Moeschberger 2003\. A more elegant but requiring rigorous measure-theoretic probability theo ry is the approach with counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theorems.  Indeed, this approach was used by Aalen 1975\ to set the rigorous mathematical foundation for survival analysis, and later further developed and summarized by Fleming and Harrington \(1991\, Andersen et al. \(1993\several research papers.  In reliability theory Aven and Jensen \(1999\ dem onstrated such an approach by developing a general failure model, which we briefly introduced in Section 1.2. However, the counting process and Martingale approach require measure theoretic treatments of probability and st ochastic processes, which is often not used in engineering or applied statistics.  A detailed introduction of the topic is obviously beyond the scope of this paper, and we only present a brief sketch of the most important concepts involved.  Readers are referred to the excellent monographs by Andersen et al. \(1993 Fleming and Harrington \(1991\ Aven and Jensen \(1999\ for comprehensive details, and Kal bfleisch and Prentice \(2002 Klein and Moeschberger \(2003\, Lawless \(2003\ for more applicationñoriented treatments The following discussion on this topic is drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  A counting stochastic process N  t  t 0 possesses the properties that N  0 ro and N  t   with probability one. The sample paths of N  t ht continuous and piecewise constant with jumps of size 1  step function In a right-censored sample, \(we assume only right censoring in this section N i  t  I  T i t  i   which keep the value 0 until individual i fails and then jump to 1  are counting processes. The accumulation of N i  t ocess     1 t N t N n i i is again a counting process, which counts the number of failures in the sample at or before time t   The counting process keeps track of the information on the occurrences of events,   for instance, the history information such as which individual was censored prior to time t and which individual died at or prior to time t as well as the covariates information This accumulated history information of the counting process at time t is termed filtration at time t denoted by F t For a given problem F t  rests on the observer of the counting process.  Thus, two observers with different recordings at different times will get different filtrations.  This is what Aven and Jensen 1999\ referred to as different information levels or the amount of actual available information about the state of a system may vary  If the failure times X i and censoring times C i  are independent,  then the probability of an event occurs at time t given the history just prior to t  F t\n be expressed as  t T if dt t h t C t X dt t C dt t X t P F dt t T t P i i i i i i r t i i r          1     t T if F dt t T t P i t i i r 0   1    51  Let dN  t be the change in the process N  t over a short time interval    t t t Ignoring the neglig ible chance of ties 1   t dN if a failure occurred and 0   t dN otherwise  Let Y  t denote the number of individuals with an observation time T i t Then the conditional expectation of dN  t   dt t h t Y F dt t C dt t X t with ns observatio of number E F t dN E t i i i t              52 


 12 The process  t  Y  t  h  t  is called the intensity process  of the counting process.  It is a stochastic process that is determined by the information contained in the history process F t via Y  t  Y  t  records the number of individuals experiencing the risk at a given time t   As it will become clear that   t is equivalent to the failure rate or hazard function in tr aditional reliability theory, but here it is treated as a stochastic process, the most general form one can assume for it. It is this generalization that encapsulates the power that counting stochastic process approach can offer to survival analysis  Let the cumulative intensity process H  t be defined as   t t ds s t H 0 0      53  It has the property that  E  N  t  F t  E  H  t  F t  H  t   54  This implies that filtration F t, is known, the value of Y  t  fixed and H  t es deterministic H  t is equivalent to the cumulative hazards in tr aditional reliability theory  A stochastic process with the property that its expectation at time t given history at time s < t is equal to its value at s is called a martingale That is M  t martingale if           t s s M F t M E s  55  It can be verified that the stochastic process         t H t N t M 56  is a martingale, and it is called the counting process martingale The increments of the counting process martingale have an expected value of zero, given its filtration F t That is  0      t F t dM E 57 The first part of the counting process martingale [Equation 56  N  t non-decreasing step function.  The second part H  t smooth process which is predictable in that its value at time t is fixed just prior to time t It is known as the compensator  of the counting process and is a random function. Therefore, the martingale can be considered as mean-zero noise and that is obtainable when one subtracts the smoothly varying compensator from the counting process  Another key component in the counting process and martingale theory for survival analysis is the notion of the predictable variation process of M  t oted by    t M It is defined as the compensator of process   2 t M  The term predictable variation process comes from the property that, for a martingale M  t it can be verified that the conditional variance of the increments of M  t  dM  t  h e inc r em ents of   t M That is          t M d F t dM Var t  58  To obtain      t F t dM Var  one needs the random variable N  t  variable with probability   t of having a jump of size 1 at time t The variance of N  t   t  1 t   since it follows b i nom ial distribution    Ignoring the ties in the censored data 2  t  is close to zero and Var  dM  t  F t    t  Y  t  h  t   This implies that the counting process N  t on the filtration F t behaves like a Poisson process with rate  t    Why do we need to convert the previous very intuitive concepts in survival analysis in to more abstract martingales The key is that many of the sta tistics in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of the basic martingales described above The stochastic integral equations are mathematically well structured and some standard mathematical techniques for studying them can be adopted  Here, let   t K be a predictable  process An example of a predictable process is the process   t Y Over the interval 0 to t the stochastic integral of su ch a process, with respect to a martingale, is denoted by     0 u dM u K t It turns out that such stochastic integrals them selves are martingales as a function of t and their predictable variation process can be found from the predictable variation process of the original martingale by           0 2 0 u M d u K u dM u K t t 59 The above discussion was drawn from Klein and Moeschberger \(2003 also provide examples of how the above process is applied. In the following, we briefly introduce one of their exampl es ó the derivation of the Nelson-Aalen cumulative hazard estimator  First, the model is formulated as           t dM dt t h t Y t dN  60  If   t Y is non-zero, then               t Y t dM t d t h t Y t dN 61  Let   t I be the indicator of whether   t Y  is positive and define 0/0 = 0, then integrating both sides of above \(61 One get 


 13                     0 0 0 u dM u Y u I u d u h u I u dN u Y u I t t t 62  The left side integral is the Nelson-Aalen estimator of H t           0  u dN u Y u I t H t 63  The second integral on the right side           0 u dM u Y u I t W t 64  is the stochastic integral of the predictable process      u Y u I with respect to a martingale, and hence is also a martingale  The first integral on the right side is a random quantity    t H   t du u h u I t H 0        65  For right-censored data it is equal to   t H  in the data range, if the stochastic uncertainty in the   t W is negligible Therefore, the statistic    t H is a nonparametric estimator of the random quantity    t H   We would like to mention one more advantage of the new approach, that is, the martingale central limit theorem.  The central limit theorem of martingales ensures certain convergence property and allows the derivations of confidence intervals for many st atistics.  In summary, most of the statistics developed with asymptotic likelihood theory in survival analysis can be derived as the stochastic integrals of some martingale.  The large sample properties of the statistics can be found by using the predictable variation process and martingale central limit theorem \(Klein and Moeschberger \(2003  2.7. Bayesian Survival Analysis  Like many other fields of statistics, survival analysis has also witnessed the rapid expansion of the Bayesian paradigm.  The introduction of the full-scale Bayesian paradigm is relative recent and occurred in the last decade however, the "invasion" has been thorough.  Until the recent publication of a monograph by Ibrahim, Chen and Sinhaet 2005\val anal ysis has been either missing or occupy at most one chapter in most survival analysis monographs and textbooks.  Ibrahim's et al. \(2005\ changed the landscape, with their comprehensive discussion of nearly every counterp arts of frequentist survival analysis from univariate to multivariate, from nonparametric, semiparametric to parametric models, from proportional to nonproportional hazards models, as well as the joint model of longitudinal and survival data.  It should be pointed out that Bayesian survival analysis has been studied for quite a while and can be traced back at least to the 1970s  A natural but fair question is what advantages the Bayesian approach can offer over the established frequentist survival analysis. Ibrahim et al 2005\entified two key advantages. First, survival models are generally very difficult to fit, due to the complex likelihood functions to accommodate censoring.  A Bayesi an approach may help by using the MCMC techniques and there is available software e.g., BUGS.  Second, the Bayesian paradigm can incorporate prior information in a natural way by using historical information, e.g., from clinical trials. The following discussion in this subsection draws from Ibrahim's et al. \(2005  The Bayesian paradigm is based on specifying a probability model for the observed data, given a vector of unknown parameters This leads to likelihood function L   D   Unlike in traditional statistics is treated as random and has a prior distribution denoted by   Inference concerning is then based on the posterior distribution which can be computed by Bayes theorem d D L D L D              66 where is the parameter space  The term    D is proportional to the likelihood    D L  which is the information from observed data, multiplied by the prior, which is quantified by   i.e          D L D 67 The denominator integral m  D s the normalizing constant of    D and often does not have an analytic closed form Therefore    D often has to be computed numerically The Gibbs sampler or other MCMC algorithms can be used to sample    D without knowing the normalizing constant m  D xist large amount of literature for solving the computational problems of m  D nd    D   Given that the general Bayesian algorithms for computing the posterior distributions should equally apply to Bayesian survival analysis, the specification or elicitation of informative prior needs much of the atte ntion.  In survival analysis with covariates such as Cox's proportional hazards model, the most popular choice of informative prior is the normal prior, and the most popular choice for noninformative is the uniform Non-informative prior is easy to use but they cannot be used in all applications, such as model selection or model comparison. Moreover, noninformative prior does not harness the real prior information. Therefore, res earch for informative prior specification is crucial for Bayesian survival analysis  


 14 Reliability estimation is influenced by the level of information available such as information on components or sub-systems. Bayesians approach is likely to provide such flexibility to accommodate various levels of information Graves and Hamada \(2005\roduced the YADAS a statistical modeling environment that implements the Bayesian hierarchical modeli ng via MCMC computation They showed the applications of YADES in reliability modeling and its flexibility in processing hierarchical information. Although this environment seems not designed with Bayesian surviv al analysis, similar package may be the direction if Bayesian survival analysis is applied to reliability modeling  2.8. Spatial Survival Analysis  To the best of our knowledge spatial survival analysis is an uncharted area, and there has been no spatial survival analysis reported with rigor ous mathematical treatment There are some applications of survival analysis to spatial data; however, they do not address the spatial process which in our opinion should be the essential aspect of any spatial survival analysis. To develop formal spatial survival analysis, one has to define the spatial process first  Recall, for survival analysis in the time domain, there is survival function   R t t T t S  Pr   68  where T is the random variable and S  t e cumulative probability that the lifetime will exceed time t In spatial domain, what is the counterpart of t One may wonder why do not we simply define the survival function in the spatial domain as   S  s  Pr S s  s R d  R > 0  69  where s is some metric for d-dimensional space R d and the space is restricted to the positive region S is the space to event measurement, e.g., the distance from some origin where we detect some point object.  The problem is that the metric itself is an attribute of space, rather than space itself Therefore, it appears to us that the basic entity for studying the space domain has to be broader than in the time domain This is probably why spatial process seems to be a more appropriate entity for studying  The following is a summary of descriptions of spatial processes and patterns, which intends to show the complexity of the issues involved.  It is not an attempt to define the similar survival function in spatial domain because we certainly unders tand the huge complexity involved. There are several monographs discussing the spatial process and patterns \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\.  The following discussion heavily draws from Cressie \(1993\ and Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  It appears that the most widely adopted definition for spatial process is proposed in Cressie \(1993\, which defines a spatial process Z  s in d-dimensions as    Z  s  s D R d  70  Here Z  s denotes the attributes we observe, which are space dependent. When d = 2 the space R 2 is a plane  The problem is how to define randomness in this process According to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005 Z  s an be thought of as located \(indexed\by spatial coordinates s  s 1  s 2  s n  the counterpart of time series Y  t  t   t 1  t 2  t n   indexed by time.  The spatial process is often called random field   To be more explicit, we denote Z  s  Z  s   to emphasize that Z is the outcome of a random experiment  A particular realization of produces a surface    s Z  Because the surface from whic h the samples are drawn is the result of the random experiment Z  s called a random function  One might ask what is a random experiment like in a spatial domain? Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\ offered an imaginary example briefly described below.  Imagine pouring sand from a bucket on to a desktop surface, and one is interested in measuring the depth of the poured sand at various locations, denoted as Z  s The sand distributes on the surface according to the laws of physics.  With enough resources and patience, one can develop a deterministic model to predict exactly how the sand grains are distributed on the desktop surface.  This is the same argument used to determine the head-tail coin flipping experiment, which is well accepted in statistical scie nce. The probabilistic coinflip model is more parsimonious than the deterministic model that rests on the exact \(perfect\but hardly feasible representation of a coin's physics. Similarly deterministically modeling the placement of sand grains is equally daunting.  However, th e issue here is not placement of sand as a random event, as Schabenberger and Gotway 2005\phasized.  The issue is that the sand was poured only once regardless how many locations one measures the depth of the sand.  With that setting, the challenge is how do we define and compute the expectation of the random function Z  s Would E  Z  s   s  make sense  Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005\further raised the questions: \(1\to what distribution is the expectation being computed? \(2\ if the random experiment of sand pouring can only be counted once, ho w can the expectation be the long-term average  According to the definition of expectation in traditional statistics, one should repeat the process of sand pouring many times and consider the probability distributions of all surfaces generated from the repetitions to compute the expectation of Z  s is complication is much more serious 


 15 than what we may often reali ze. Especially, in practice many spatial data is obtained from one time space sample only. There is not any independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  How is the enormous complexity in spatial statistics currently dealt with? The most commonly used simplification, which has also been vigorously criticized, is the stationarity assumption.  Opponents claim that stationarity often leads to erroneous inferences and conclusions.  Proponents counte r-argue that little progress can be made in the study of non-stationary process, without a good understanding of the stationary issues Schabenberger and Gotway 2005  The strict stationarity is a random field whose spatial distribution is invariant under translation of the coordination.  In other word s, the process repeats itself throughout its domain \(Schabenberger and Gotway 2005 There is also a second-order or weak\ of a random field  For random fields in the spatial domain, the model of Equation \(70  Z  s  s D R d  is still too general to allow statistical inference.  It can be decomposed into several sub-processes \(Cressie 1993             s s s W s s Z  D s  71  where  s  E  Z  is a deterministic mean structure called large-scale variation W  s is the zero-mean intrinsically stationary process, \(with second order derivative\nd it is called smooth small-scale variation   s is the zero-mean stationary process independent of W  s and is called microscale variation  s  is zero-mean white noise also called measurement error. This decomposition is not unique and is largely operational in nature \(Cressie 1993\he main task of a spatial algorithm is to determine the allocations of the large, small, and microscale components However, the form of the above equation is fixed Cressie 1993\, implying that it is not appropriate to sub-divide one or more of the items. Therefore, the key issue here is to obtain the deterministic  s  but in practice, especially with limited data, it is usually very difficult to get a unique  s   Alternative to the spatial domain decomposition approach the frequency domain methods or spectral analysis used in time series analysis can also be used in spatial statistics Again, one may refer to Schabenberger and Gotway \(2005  So, what are the imp lications of the general discussion on spatial process above to spatial survival analysis?  One point is clear, Equation \(69 S  s  Pr S s   s R d is simply too naive to be meaningful.  There seem, at least, four fundamental challenges when trying to develop survival analysis in space domain. \(1\ process is often multidimensional, while time pr ocess can always be treated as uni-dimensional in the sense that it can be represented as  Z  t  t R 1  The multidimensionality certainly introduces additional complications, but that is still not the only complication, perhaps not even the most significant 2\One of the fundamental complications is the frequent lack of independent replication in the sense of observing several independent realizations of the spatial process, as pointed out by Cressie \(1993\\(3\e superposition of \(1 and \(2\brings up even more complexity, since coordinates  s of each replication are a set of stochastic spatial process rather than a set of random variables. \(4\n if the modeling of the spatial process is separable from the time process, it is doubtful how useful the resulting model will be.  In time process modeling, if a population lives in a homogenous environment, the space can be condensed as a single point.  However, the freezing of time seems to leave out too much information, at least for survival analysis Since the traditional survival analysis is essentially a time process, therefore, it should be expanded to incorporate spatial coordinates into original survival function.  For example, when integrating space and time, one gets a spacetime process, such as          R t R D s t s Z d   where s is the spatial index \(coordinate t is time.  We may define the spatial-temporal survival function as   S  s  t  Pr T t  s D  72  where D is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidean space That is, the spatial-temporal survival function represents the cumulative probability that an individual will survive up to time T within hyperspace D which is a subset of the d dimensional Euclidian space.  One may define different scales for D or even divide D into a number of unit hyperspaces of measurement 1 unit  2.9. Survival Analysis and Artificial Neural Network   In the discussion on artificial neuron networks \(ANN Robert & Casella \(2004\noted, "Baring the biological vocabulary and the idealistic connection with actual neurons, the theory of neuron networks covers: \(1\odeling nonlinear relations between explanatory and dependent explained\ariables; \(2\mation of the parameters of these models based on a \(training\ sample."  Although Robert & Casella \(2004\ did not mentioned survival analysis, their notion indeed strike us in that the two points are also the essence of Cox s \(1972\roportional Hazards model  We argue that the dissimilarity might be superficial.  One of the most obvious differences is that ANN usually avoids probabilistic modeling, however, the ANN models can be analyzed and estimated from a statistical point of view, as demonstrated by Neal \(1999\, Ripley \(1994\, \(1996 Robert & Casella \(2004\What is more interesting is that the most hailed feature of ANN, i.e., the identifiability of model structure, if one review carefully, is very similar to the work done in survival anal ysis for the structure of the 


 16 Cox proportional hazards model. The multilayer ANN model, also known as back-propagation ANN model, is again very similar to the stratified proportional hazards model  There are at least two advantages of survival analysis over the ANN.  \(1\val analysis has a rigorous mathematical foundation. Counting stochastic processes and the Martingale central limit theory form the survival analysis models as stochastic integral s, which provide insight for analytic solutions. \(2\ ANN, simulation is usually necessary \(Robert & Casella \(2004\which is not the case in survival analysis  Our conjecture may explain a very interesting phenomenon Several studies have tried to integrate ANN with survival analysis.  As reviewed in the next section, few of the integrated survival analysis and ANN made significant difference in terms of model fittings, compared with the native survival analysis alone The indifference shows that both approaches do not complement each other.  If they are essentially different, the inte grated approach should produce some results that are signifi cantly different from the pure survival analysis alone, either positively or negatively Again, we emphasize that our discussion is still a pure conjecture at this stage   3   B RIEF C ASE R EVIEW OF S URVIVAL A NALYSIS A PPLICATIONS     3.1. Applications Found in IEEE Digital Library  In this section, we briefly review the papers found in the IEEE digital library w ith the keyword of survival analysis  search. The online search was conducted in the July of 2007, and we found about 40 papers in total. There were a few biomedical studies among the 40 survival-analysis papers published in IEEE publications. These are largely standard biomedical applications and we do not discuss these papers, for obvious reasons  Mazzuchi et al. \(1989\m ed to be the first to actively  advocate the use of Cox's \(1 972\ proportional hazards model \(PHM\in engineering re liability.  They quoted Cox's 1972\ original words industrial reliability studies and medical studies to show Cox's original motivation Mazzuchi et al \(1989 while this model had a significant impact on the biom edical field, it has received little attention in the reliability literature Nearly two decades after the introducti on paper of Mazzuchi et al 1989\ears that little significant changes have occurred in computer science and IEEE related engineering fields with regard to the proportional hazards models and survival analysis as a whole  Stillman et al. \(1995\used survival analysis to analyze the data for component maintenance and replacement programs Reineke et al. \(1998 ducted a similar study for determining the optimal maintenance by simulating a series system of four components Berzuini and Larizza \(1996 integrated time-series modeling with survival analysis for medical monitoring.  Kauffman and Wang \(2002\analyzed the Internet firm su rvival data from IPO \(initial public offer to business shutdown events, with survival analysis models  Among the 40 survival analysis papers, which we obtained from online search of the IEEE digital library, significant percentage is the integration of survival analysis with artificial neural networks \(ANN In many of these studies the objective was to utilize ANN to modeling fitting or parameter estimation for survival analysis.  The following is an incomplete list of the major ANN survival analysis integration papers found in IEEE digital library, Arsene et 2006 Eleuteri et al. \(2003\oa and Wong \(2001\,  Mani et al 1999\ The parameter estimation in survival analysis is particular complex due to the requirements for processing censored observations. Therefore, approach such as ANN and Bayesian statistics may be helpful to deal with the complexity. Indeed, Bayesian survival analysis has been expanded significantly in recent years \(Ibrahim, et al. 2005  We expect that evolutionary computing will be applied to survival analysis, in similar way to ANN and Bayesian approaches  With regard to the application of ANN to survival analysis we suggest three cautions: \(1\he integrated approach should preserve the capability to process censoring otherwise, survival analysis loses its most significant advantage. \(2\ Caution should be taken when the integrated approach changes model struct ure because most survival analysis models, such as Cox's proportional hazards models and accelerated failure time models, are already complex nonlinear models with built-in failure mechanisms.  The model over-fitting may cause model identifiability  problems, which could be very subtle and hard to resolve 3\he integrated approach does not produce significant improvement in terms of model fitting or other measurements, which seemed to be the case in majority of the ANN approach to survival analysis, then the extra complication should certainly be avoided. Even if there is improvement, one should still take caution with the censor handling and model identifiability issues previously mentioned in \(1\ and \(2  3.2. Selected Papers Found in MMR-2004  In the following, we briefly review a few survival analysis related studies presented in a recent International Conference on Mathematical Methods in Reliability, MMR 2004 \(Wilson et al. 2005  Pena and Slate \(2005\ddressed the dynamic reliability Both reliability and survival times are more realistically described with dynamic models. Dynamic models generally refer to the models that incorporate the impact of actions or interventions as well as thei r accumulative history, which 


 17 can be monitored \(Pena and Slate 2005\he complexity is obviously beyond simple regression models, since the dependence can play a crucial ro le. For example, in a loadsharing network system, failure of a node will increase the loads of other nodes and influences their failures  Duchesne \(2005\uggested incorporating usage accumulation information into the regression models in survival analysis.  To simplify the model building Duchesne \(2005\umes that the usage can be represented with a single time-dependent covariate.  Besides reviewing the hazard-based regression models, which are common in survival analysis, Duchesne 2005\viewed three classes of less commonly used regression models: models based on transfer functionals, models based on internal wear and the so-called collapsible models. The significance of these regression models is that they expand reliability modeling to two dimensions. One dimension is the calendar time and the other is the usage accumulation.  Jin \(2005\ reviewed the recent development in statisti cal inference for accelerated failure time \(AFT\odel and the linear transformation models that include Cox proportional hazards model and proportional odds models as special cases. Two approaches rank-based approach and l east-squares approach were reviewed in Jin \(2005\. Osbo rn \(2005\d a case study of utilizing the remote diagnostic data from embedded sensors to predict system aging or degradation.  This example should indicate the potential of survival analysis and competing risks analysis in the prognostic and health management PHM\ since the problem Osborn \(2005 addressed is very similar to PHM. The uses of embedded sensors to monitor the health of complex systems, such as power plants, automobile, medical equipment, and aircraft engine, are common. The main uses for these sensor data are real time assessment of th e system health and detection of the problems that need immediate attention.  Of interest is the utilization of those remote diagnostic data, in combination with historical reliability data, for modeling the system aging or degradation. The biggest challenge with this task is the proper transformation of wear  time The wear is not only influenced by internal \(temperature, oil pressures etc\xternal covariates ambient temperature, air pressure, etc\, but also different each time   4  S UMMARY AND P ERSPECTIVE   4.1. Summary  Despite the common foundation with traditional reliability theory, such as the same probability definitions for survival function  S  t  and reliability  R  t  i.e  S  t  R  t well as the hazards function the exact same term and definition are used in both fields\rvival analysis has not achieved similar success in the field of reliability as in biomedicine The applications of survival analysis seem still largely limited to the domain of biomedicine.  Even in the sister fields of biomedicine such as biology and ecology, few applications have been conducted \(Ma 1997, Ma and Bechinski 2008\ the engin eering fields, the Meeker and Escobar \(1998\ monograph, as well as the Klein and Goel 1992\ to be the most comprehensive treatments  In Section 2, we reviewed the essential concepts and models of survival analysis. In Section 3, we briefly reviewed some application cases of survival analysis in engineering reliability.  In computer science, survival analysis seems to be still largely unknown.  We believe that the potential of survival analysis in computer science is much broader than network and/or software reliability alone. Before suggesting a few research topics, we no te two additional points  First, in this article, we exclusively focused on univariate survival analysis. There are two other related fields: one is competing risks analysis and the other is multivariate survival analysis The relationship between multivariate survival analysis and survival analysis is similar to that between multivariate statistical analysis and mathematical statistics.  The difference is that the extension from univariate to multivariate in survival analysis has been much more difficult than the developm ent of multivariate analysis because of \(1\rvation cens oring, and \(2\pendency which is much more complex when multivariate normal distribution does not hold in survival data.  On the other hand, the two essential differences indeed make multivariate survival analysis unique and ex tremely useful for analyzing and modeling time-to-event data. In particular, the advantages of multivariate survival analysis in addressing the dependency issue are hardly matched by any other statistical method.  We discuss competing risks analysis and multivariate survival analysis in separate articles \(Ma and Krings 2008a, b, & c  The second point we wish to note is: if we are asked to point out the counterpart of survival analysis model in reliability theory, we would suggest the shock or damage model.   The shock model has an even longer history than survival analysis and the simplest shock model is the Poisson process model that leads to exponential failure rate model The basic assumption of the shock model is the notion that engineered systems endure some type of wear, fatigue or damage, which leads to the failure when the strengths exceed the tolerance limits of th e system \(Nakagawa 2006 There are extensive research papers on shock models in the probability theory literature, but relatively few monographs The monograph by Nakagawa \(2006\s to be the latest The shock model is often formulated as a Renewal stochastic process or point process with Martingale theory The rigorous mathematical derivation is very similar to that of survival analysis from counting stochastic processes  which we briefly outlined in section 2.6  It is beyond the scope of the paper to compare the shock model with survival analysis; however, we would like to make the two specific comments. \(1\Shock models are essentially the stochastic process model to capture the failure mechanism based on the damage induced on the system by shocks, and the resulting statistical models are 


 18 often the traditional reliability distribution models such as exponential and Weibull failure distributions.  Survival analysis does not depend on specific shock or damage Instead, it models the failure with abstract time-to-event random variables.  Less restrictive assumptions with survival analysis might be more useful for modeling software reliability where the notions of fatigue, wear and damage apparently do not apply.  \(2\hock models do not deal with information censoring, the trademark of failure time data.  \(3\ Shock models, perhaps due to mathematical complexity, have not been applied widely in engineering reliability yet.  In contrast, the applications of survival analysis in biomedical fields are much extensive.  While there have been about a dozen monographs on survival analysis available, few books on shock models have been published.  We believe that survival analysis and shock models are complementary, a nd both are very needed for reliability analysis, with shock model more focused on failure mechanisms and the survival analysis on data analysis and modeling  4.2. Perspective   Besides traditional industrial and hardware reliability fields we suggest that the following fields may benefit from survival analysis  Software reliability Survival analysis is not based on the assumptions of wear, fatigue, or damage, as in traditional reliability theory.  This seems close to software reliability paradigm. The single biggest challenge in applying above discussed approaches to softwa re systems is the requirement for a new metric that is able to replace the survival time variable in survival analysis. This "time" counterpart needs to be capable of characterizing the "vulnerability" of software components or the system, or the distance to the next failure event. In other words, this software metric should represent the metric-to-event, similar to time-toevent random variable in survival analysis.  We suggest that the Kolmogorov complexity \(Li and Vitanyi 1997\n be a promising candidate. Once the metric-to-event issue is resolved, survival analysis, both univariate and multivariate survival analysis can be applied in a relative straightforward manner. We suggest that the shared frailty models are most promising because we believ e latent behavior can be captured with the shared fra ilty \(Ma and Krings 2008b  There have been a few applications of univariate survival analysis in software reliability modeling, including examples in Andersen et al.'s \(1995\ classical monograph However, our opinion is that without the fundamental shift from time-to-event to new metric-to-event, the success will be very limited. In software engineering, there is an exception to our claim, which is the field of software test modeling, where time variable may be directly used in survival analysis modeling  Modeling Survivability of Computer Networks As described in Subsection 2.3, random censoring may be used to model network survivability.  This modeling scheme is particularly suitable for wireless sensor network, because 1\ of the population nature of wireless nodes and \(2\ the limited lifetime of the wireless nodes.  Survival analysis has been advanced by the needs in biomedical and public health research where population is th e basic unit of observation As stated early, a sensor networ k is analogically similar to a biological population. Furthermore, both organisms and wireless nodes are of limited lifetimes. A very desirable advantage of survival analysis is that one can develop a unified mathematical model for both the reliability and survivability of a wireless sensor network \(Krings and Ma 2006  Prognostic and Health Management in Military Logistics PHM involves extensive modeling analysis related to reliability, life predictions, failure analysis, burnin elimination and testing, quality control modeling, etc Survival analysis may provide very promising new tools Survival analysis should be able to provide alternatives to the currently used mathematical tools such as ANN, genetic algorithms, and Fuzzy logic.  The advantage of survival analysis over the other alternatives lies in its unique capability to handle information censoring.  In PHM and other logistics management modeling, information censoring is a near universal phenomenon. Survival analysis should provide new insights and modeling solutions   5  R EFERENCES   Aalen, O.
