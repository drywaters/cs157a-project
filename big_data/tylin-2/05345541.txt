HE lack of network connectivity in many regions around the world is an economic problem as well as a technological one Due to the low income levels and the low population densities of the rural regions the traditional options of fiber-optic networks or other wireless networks are ill suited for such environments The high infrastructure cost and the long period of time to deploy fiber-optic networks make these technologies economically less appealing and a very risky investment proposition The issues of spectrum licensing and interference at unlicensed ISM bands further limit radio technology Though the emerging license-free bands appear promising they still have certain bandwidth and range limitations For future short-range applications optical wireless communications present a viable and promising supplemental 
technology to radio wireless systems Free Space Optical FSO communication is also unaffected by electromagnetic interference and radio frequency interference which increasingly effect radio based communication systems  A broad review of the optical wireless field from early experiments through to today's high-performance systems has been provided in   The link design of an optical wireless link is presented in this paper Since high bandwidth links are not necessary in the rural regions as most of the applications are limited to messaging and voice therefore a modest data rate of 10 Mbps is chosen The components used to build the link are mentioned in the paper to substantiate the claim of the low cost However a detailed cost analysis has been avoided since the components may be available from the manufacturers for even lower prices when purchased in bulk The total cost

that most organizations do not ultimately need one key piece of intelligence as there is rarely a single decision that needs to be made.  Hence the revised knowledge pyramid is pyramidal in form as that provides a visual impact as to the relative amounts of data, information knowledge, and wisdom/intelligence but are flat topped, much like the Aztec and Mayan pyramids and not like the Egyptian pyramids \(note that this is being used to illustrate the point and not to imply that there is more merit to one style pyramid over another  5. Discussion  The revised knowledge pyramid recognizes Ackoff  d T u om i 21] an d f i n d s  bot h  w a n t i n g  A c k o ff 1 assumes data generates information which generates knowledge which generates wisdom.  Tuomi [21  believes all data and information is collected based on influence from existing knowledge and wisdom Ackoff s pyramid flows up, Tuomi s pyramid flows down and reality as observed and implemented in the revised knowledge pyramid recognizes that flow is in both directions.  Tuomi s  w r o n g i n t h i n k i ng t h a t  flow is only down the pyramid.  Basic research often times involves collecting data about something that we do not have knowledge or wisdom.  An example is physics research in the late 1800s.  Scientists did not understand nor did they have knowledge about atomic structure, subatomic particles, and radiation.  Data was collected an observed by scientists noting that photographic film was fogged when near certain materials.  This data was gathered and then put into context as information that said specific materials caused fogging.  Consideration of this information led to the formation of theories to explain why this happened, generating potential knowledge.  Analysis of this knowledge led to experiments designed to prove the correctness of this potential knowledge.  This example shows that both Ackoff d T u om i [21 are right and both are wrong.  Flow of creation is in both directions of the pyramid Another example bolstering this argument is the use of data mining to create information by discovering patterns in data.  Commonly called knowledge discovery, it is the analysis of these new found patterns, or information, and the application of context culture, and other knowledge that creates knowledge and the positioning of this knowledge into existing problem or competitive advantage contexts that creates actionable knowledge or intelligence.  In this example the predominant direction of creation flow is up the pyramid but it can also be argued that previous knowledge of business needs, processes, and behavior influenced the interpretation of discovered patterns into knowledge and intelligence so that creation flow is actually in both directions A final example is from engineering.  It is common for engineers to instrument everything they can when conducting testing, even if they are not sure of a purpose for the data.  A high pressure vessel destructive test from my past illustrates this.  The test called for burst testing a 2500 psi vessel pressure using water.  Standard instrumentation for measuring pressure and temperature were used plus video monitoring was added.  There was no real need for collecting video data other that it was thought it would be interesting to watch.  Since water, a noncompressible liquid, was being used as the pressuring medium it wasn t expected to be a violent failure violence in this case is represented by a very large very fast release of energy\ as it was expected that the vessel would crack and the water spill out or perhaps spray out.  The test team was very surprised when the test resulted in a spectacular release of energy.  The video data was what provided the story and it was interesting to see the test setup disintegrate during the first test and then to see that the test setup was surrounded by sand bags and other retaining walls for the second test.  The point of this example is that there are many situations in which we collect data for no real reason other than we can and it is later analysis of this data that results in the generation of unexpected information, knowledge, and intelligence  6. Conclusions  The revised knowledge pyramid is visually more complex and thus less satisfying as a visual model then the traditional knowledge pyramid but is more satisfying conceptually as it fits our perception of reality to a better degree than the traditional knowledge pyramid.  Is this the final model?  Probably not but it is a step in the right direction and a starting point for more detailed discussion on the knowledge pyramid Should we quit using the traditional knowledge pyramid?  Probably not, it has its use as a tool for introducing the concepts of data, information knowledge, and wisdom to beginning students However, it is recommended that the traditional knowledge pyramid be quickly followed by the revised knowledge pyramid as this is a better model for explaining what KM is and does and for how DIKW are created The revised knowledge pyramid also shows that BI CI, etc. are really not new applications but are manifestations of confusion caused by the traditional knowledge pyramid.  While it is expected that BI, CI etc. practitioners may not embrace that they are within Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5 


KM, the model does support the fusion of these initiatives into the KM discipline and KM researchers are encouraged to include these approaches in researching and applying KM Finally, this paper proposed to provide a set of what are hoped to be consensus working definitions of KM terms from the revised knowledge pyramid.  These terms are summarized below  Data basic, discrete, objective facts such as who what, when, where, about something Information data that is related to each other through a context such that it provides a useful story as an example, the linking of who, what, when, where data to describe a specific person at a specific time Knowledge information that has been culturally understood such that it explains the how and the why about something or provides insight and understanding into something Wisdom placing knowledge into a framework or nomological net that allows the knowledge to be applied to different and not necessarily intuitive situations Intelligence - specific actionable knowledge needed to make a specific decision in a specific context  Learning - the acquisition of DIWK that leads to a change in behavior or expectation within the individual or group that is doing the learning Organizational Learning - a quantifiable improvement in activities, increased available knowledge for decision-making, or sustainable competitive advantage.  An organization learns if through its processing of DIKW, its potential behaviors are change 5 6  1   Social networks - any formal or informal, direct or indirect methods used to transfer data, information knowledge and wisdom between users Filters KM processes that limit access and separate and capture that DIKW/I which is needed from that which is not  The implications of this paper are many.  KMS designers have a better understanding of how KM fits in the general DIKW world.  KMS can focus on strategy and strategy implementation through the design and implementation of KM filters.  This leads to the possibility of creating audit mechanisms that can validate that KM strategy has been properly implemented that is similar in nature to auditing security policy implementations in firewalls.  Another implication is a clearer understanding of the role of social networks in the creation and transfer of DIKW/I KMS designers will also be focused on providing technological support for these social networks and it clarifies that KMS is more than just knowledge storage and retrieval technologies, they also incorporate communication and collaboration technologies Another implication is a new focus on identifying specific actionable knowledge for focused decision making, or, as stated in the paper, generating intelligence.  A final implication is that KM should now be recognized as an integrated part of regular DIKW/I processing.  KMS designers should be focusing on integrating KM processes into regular work processes  7.

from the FPGA via UDP packets over a direct gigabit Ethern et connection to a PC running a Matlab acquisition program All seemed to work 002ne until we either decreased the decimation thus increasing the data rate over Ethernet or ran long acquisition sessions The ADC input was a sine wave coming from a function generator Looking at the data collected with Matlab we could see that points were being dropped from the sine wave that we fed into the ADC Checking the data rate over Ethernet with a packet sniffer it was observed that the peak rate was only 100 Mbps even though the bandwidth of the connection was 1Gbps But even at decimation rates that could be handled with a 100 Mbps throughput data points were being dropped sooner or later in the acquisition The reason for the lower-than-expected throughput is most likely a combination of the overhead of packetizing the data into UDP packets and computing checksums and the underlying implementation of the IP stack that we used in our system We relied on lwIP Lightweight TCP/IP Stack distributed by Xilinx and designed by Adam Dunkels Swedish Institute of Computer Science to pro vide the dri v ers necessary for UDP communication However as suggested by many user forums it may not run at its full potential on the embedded processor in Xilinx FPGAs Furthermore the receiving PC running a Matlab acquisition program can also be slowing down the communication causing the input rate into the AD7760 controller core FIFO to exceed the output rate Due to the issues experienced on longer acquisition runs using UDP over Ethernet to facilitate FPGA data of\003oad we decided to record a 002xed amount of digitized data directly to a compact 003ash card connected to the development board This method has the bene\002t of easing the load on the CPU as all it needs to do is read the AD7760 controller core FIFO and store that data into external RAM When a speci\002ed amount of data is present in external RAM the CPU stops data acquisition and writes the collected samples to the compact 003ash card Of course the drawback is that we no longer have a 223real-time\224 data acquisition system Furthermore the Xilinx drivers provided for accessing the compact 003ash card are very slow in writing data to a FAT 002lesystem Nevertheless with this method clean and long data captures became possible Synchronization was the last crucial point to check For an FTS synchronization between the signal beam and a reference channel are absolutely critical in order to obtain meaningful data To check for good synchronization in our dualchannel system we simply plotted the data acquired from both channels which comes from the same function generator against each other in order to observe a 1:1 ratio If the signals are not synchronized we would see various patterns or missing points in an otherwise diagonal line passing through the origin 5 M K IV D ATA A CQUISITION To ensure that the AD7760 meets all the requirements of the FTIR data acquisition we have recorded solar interferograms with an existing instrument the JPL MkIV spectrometer designed for stratospheric balloon observations of sunset and sunrise The MkIV optical laboratory includes a coelostat that brings sunlight to the spectrometer for ground-based tests and measurements This allowed us to perform an end-to-end test of our recording system including full veri\002cation of the synchronization between the two ADC channels one for the reference laser and one for the IR signal beam In our lab setup shown in Figure 8\(a we have connected the data acquisition system to the MkIV spectrometer Our FPGA development board Xilinx ML507 has enough I/O to accommodate collecting data from two AD7760 evaluation boards As shown in Figure 8\(b we connect these boards to the output of InSb and reference laser channels Control of the data acquisition process is administered via an RS232 link to a lab computer a acquisition system with the JPL MkIV spectrometer b chain setup showing FPGA and AD7760 boards F igure 8  MkIV data acquisition An interferometer produces an output in the form of a DC term plus AC modulation the signal never goes negative since the lowest possible value is that of total darkness at zero volts It is important to avoid AC coupling and preserve the DC term because the low frequency variations of this DC 8

The variables for the coverage of the products and processes were not included in this test because the overlap was computed using these two variables implying that there is a significant relation between the respective variables\his lends some support to proposition P2.4 stating that involvement of more users leads to greater overlap of applications. The proposition that older applications also exhibit a higher degree of overlap was not supported \(P1.4  A.2. Results from analyzing impacts of AA complexity  Impacts of interdependency-related AA complexity A Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 4\ealed a statistically significant difference in operations cost as well as maintenance cost across the three different interdependency-groups of applications. The more interdependent group \(i.e. applications with 3-7 or with 8 or more interfaces\igher median of operations \(Md=119,000 and 363,000 EUR respectively\ and maintenance costs \(Md=326,000 and 506,000 EUR respectively\ than the less interdependent group \(fewer than 3 interfaces applications \(Md=52,000 EUR operations costs and 64,000 EUR maintenance costs\. This supports the proposition \(P3.1\ that more interdependent applications also incur higher IT \(operations and maintenance\ts  Impacts of diversity-related AA complexity   Regarding OS-related diversity, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 5\howed no significant difference between the operations costs of more \(Md=93,890 n=105\d less diverse applications \(Md=131,540 n=27\09.5, z=-1.174, p=.24. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=166,400; n=121 vs Md=116,900; n =31\782, z=-.43; p=.668 To measure DBMS-related diversity, a MannWhitney U test was conducted \(Table 5\d revealed no significance difference in operations costs of more Md=129,985; n=85\d less diverse applications Md=154,777; n=16\5, z=-.237, p=.813. The same holds for maintenance costs \(Md=210,500 n=98 vs. Md=245,700; n=19\36, z=-.704 p=.481. Hence, the proposition \(P3.2\ that diversityrelated AA complexity leads to higher IT costs is not supported  Impacts of deviation-related AA complexity   Regarding deviation from the standard OS, a MannWhitney U test \(Table 6\revealed no significant difference between the maintenance costs and operations costs for standard-compliant \(Md=83,581 n=94 for operations cost and Md=148,300; n=113 for maintenance cost\nd non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=38 for operations cost and Md=166,400; n=39 for maintenance cost z=-1.921, p=.055 for operations cost and U=2116 z=-.371, p=.711 for maintenance cost Concerning deviation from the standard DBMS, a Mann-Whitney U test \(Table 6\ealed a significant difference between maintenance costs for standardcompliant \(Md=373,100; n=59\d non-standardcompliant applications \(Md=170,200; n=58 U=1303, z=-2.231, p=.026. It is remarkable that the non-compliant applications had lower maintenance costs than the compliant applications. The difference between operations costs for compliant Md=109,978; n=51\d non-compliant applications Md=180,147; n=50\s not significant, U=1196.5 z=-.533, p=.594 Thus, the proposition \(P3.3\at application that deviate from technology standards incur higher IT costs is not supported. In contrast, for DBMSstandard deviation, we observed significantly lower maintenance cost for non-compliant than for compliant applications  Impacts of overlap/redundancy-related AA complexity a Kruskal-Wallis test \(Table 7\ showed significant differences in operations costs across the applications with a low \(less than 34 overlaps Md=90,442; n=37\edium \(35-79 overlaps Md=55,770; n=56\ and high level of overlap/redundancy \(more than 80 overlaps Md=129,985; n=61 6.862, p=.032. It is striking to see that the applications with medium overlaps have a lower median operations cost than those with a low or high-level of overlap, implying a non-linear U-shape relation between overlap and operations cost. Interestingly, the same holds true for maintenance cost. Applications with a low degree of overlap exhibited a median maintenance cost of 96,600 \(n=59\, those with a medium level of overlap incurred a median of 81,300 \(n=58\d highly overlapping applications a median of 248,700 \(n=67 9.791, p=.007.

He is considered JPL\222s memory technology expert with projects ranging from hand-woven core memory \(for another employer\o high capacity solid state designs.  He managed the development of NASA\222s first Solid State Recorder, a DRAM-based 2 Gb design currently in use by the Cassini mission to Satu rn and the Chandra X-Ray observatory in Earth Orbit.  Karl was the founder, and seven-time chair of the IEEE NonVolatile Memory Technology Symposium, NVMTS, deciding that the various symposia conducted until then were too focused on one technology.  Karl is a Senior IEEE member and is active in the Nuclear and Plasma Scie nce Society, the Electron Device Society and the Aerospace Electronic Systems Society Karl is also an active member of SAE Karl thanks his wonderful wife of 28 years, Janet, for raising a spectacular family: three sons, Justin, Jeremy Jonathan.  Karl\222s passion is trains and is developing a model railroad based upon a four-day rail journey across Australia\222s Northern Outback
