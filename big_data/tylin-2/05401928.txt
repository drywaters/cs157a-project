 The Systematic Errors in the Random Coincidence Estimation Using a Delayed Window Yuxuan Zhang Member, IEEE Hongdi Li Member, IEEE Shitao Liu Member, IEEE Shaohui An Chao Wang Member, IEEE Hossain Baghaei Member  IEEE Rocio Ramirez, Wai-Hoi Wong Member, IEEE  Abstract With the advance of new technology, PET systems nowadays have much higher sensitivities than before with the adoption of faster scintillators, faster electronics, larger solid angle detectors and full 3D data collection mode. All of these lead to the increasing of the random coincidences that will affect the image quality. Accurate random correction is important for the quantitative imaging in PET applications. Delayed window 
method is widely used for random coincidences estimation However, this method is not mathematically accurate. The difference between the delayed window randoms and the prompt window randoms can be significant under certain conditions. We studied the details of these differences using Monte Carlo simulations since this is the only way to separate the real random events from the true and scattered events. Three phantoms are used in the study, including the NEMA1994 20-cm long phantom NEMA2001 70-cm long phantom and a 10-cm long, 1-cm diameter small cylinder phantom. The PET system used in this study is a 12-module LYSO camera with 20-cm axial FOV and 54-cm ring diameter to simulate a brain PET system. Two policies for the multiple events handling are used: reject-allmultiples, and take-all-goods. Random rates and NECR as the function of activities from prompt window and delayed window are obtained. The simulation results show that 1\The take-allgoods policy will underestimate the randoms rate and the rejectall-multiples will overestimate the randoms, which results overestimation of NECR for take-all-goods policy and 
underestimation of NECR for reject-all-multiples policy; 2\The discrepancy is more significant for smaller phantom than bigger phantom. This study demonstrates the intrinsic discrepancy for random coincidence estimation by the delayed window method When the phantom is relatively small compare to the FOV dimension of the PET system, the discrepancy is big enough to produce non-negligible errors  I  I NTRODUCTION  More and more PET cameras are using faster scintillator such as LSO or LYSO crystal instead of the slow material of BGO They also employ the faster electronics and larger area detectors and collect data in full 3D mode. All of these new advances helped to increase the sensitivity of the PET cameras thus introduced higher single event rates and then lead to higher random coincidences. In order to get good quantitative reconstruction results, the random coincidences should be correctly subtracted from the collected data. Since we cannot 
tell whether an individual coincidence event is a random event or not, we have to use other methods for the estimation of the randoms. The most popular method for random estimation is the delayed window method, which is widely used in the PET systems. However, is this method really able to provide the correct estimation on the real random rate? In this study, we are trying to find the answer for this question II  T HEORY  For a PET system with a single gamma ray source instead of a positron source, such as the 137 Cs isotope, the real random coincidence rate can be estimated by the equation below  2 ij i j RSS   1 where 
S i and S j are the singles rates of two detectors i and j  and 2  is the coincidence window. In this case, all the single events are independent or non-correlated events When a positron source is used, the single events from each detector have two possibilities: 1\ma photon that came from the same positron-electron annihilation is escaped from the system without been detected; or 2 other gamma photon is also detected by another detector. Here we use the symbols of S i 0 and C ij representing these two types of single rates in case 1 and 2 respectively. Therefore, the 
single rates for PET system detectors can be expressed as  00  i i ij j j ij SS CS S C    2 here S i0 and S j0 are the rates for non-correlated events and C ij  is the rate of the correlated events or coincidence. With 2\ rate from the prompt window with the positron source is     00 2 00 0 0 4 events 2 events 3 events 
2 2 2   ij i j iij jij i j ij i j ij RSS SC S C SS CS S C                      3 There are three terms on the right side of the equation \(3 first term is the random coincidence from two non-correlated singles; the second term is the random coincidence with one correlated pair and one non-correlated single event; the third term has two true coincidence pairs. If there are more than two events within the coincidence window, we call those coincidences as Multiple 
 Each PET system has its own policy about how to handle the Multiples. The two most simple and popular policies are: 1 reject all coincidence events if it is a Multiple; or 2\all valid pairs if those pairs fulfill other criteria such as the energy thresholds or the geometry limitation etc. With policy 1, the second and the third terms in equation \(3\will be rejected, thus the random rate will be   00 2 reject all multiples i j RSS     4 2009 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record M13-339 9781-4244-3962-1/09/$25.00 ©2009 IEEE 3897 


 and with policy 2, we can get one random coincidence from each Multiple in the second term in equation \(3 random coincidences from the third term in that equation, if we reject the coincidences of two singles coming from the same detector. Therefore, the random rate in this case is 2 00 0 0 2\(\2 take all goods i j ij i j ij RSSCSSC   012       5 When the delayed window method is used to estimate the random rate, the single events from different detector channels have different delay, therefore the correlated single events in C ij cannot fall into the coincidence window, and the random rate with the delayed window is   2 00 0 0 2 events 2 events 2 events 2   delayed window i j ij i j ij RSSCSSC               6 where all three items on the right side of the equation are the two-events coincidences Obviously the coincidence rate obtained from delaywindow method in equation \(6\ the real random rates from the prompt window in equation \(5\and \(4 There are systematic errors for the delayed window estimation The estimation is always smaller than the real one if the TakeAll-Goods policy is used and is greater if the Reject-AllMultiples policy is used. This systematic error is less significant and can be ignored only if the true coincidence rate C ij is much smaller compared to the single rates S i   when   delayed window take all goods reject all multiples ij i j RR RCSS     7 The discussions above are based on two detector channels only. In a real PET system, there are many channels in the coincidence sorter, so there are also Multiples involving three or more modules/channels. The estimation of the randoms in a whole PET system might be more complicated than the simple discussions here. However, the systematic error in the delayed window estimation still exists In PET data processing, the estimated randoms are subtracted from the prompt window rate to reduce the noise from randoms and to increase the SNR for the images. NECR is the main index in review of the performance of a PET system. Therefore the biased estimation on the randoms will substantially affect the accuracy of the NECR   2  p romt delayed window True NECR True Scattered Random    8 III  M ETHOD  In reality, the randoms from the prompt window are always mixed with the true and scattered coincidences; which cannot be distinguished from each other. In order to find out the true random rate from the prompt window to compare with the delayed window, we use Monte Carlo simulation to generate the raw data. Since we can always record all the reaction histories of each photon, we can tell whether two singles are coming from the same particle or not so we can distinguish the randoms from true coincidences A  Date generation The raw data is generated by the Monte Carlo simulation software GATE 1 ROOT 2 coincidences, scattered coincidences, random coincidences from prompt window, and the random coincidences from delayed window are sorted from the simulation output B  PET system specifications The PET system in this study is a 12-module LSO PET camera with 540-mm ring diameter and 200-mm axial FOV for brain scan. The length of the detector is 18 mm. There are two 30-mm thick lead shielding on both sides of the detector ring. The energy cut window is 340 to 750 keV, and the coincidence window \(2  is 6 ns. Two policies for Multiples are implemented in the coincidence sorted: take-all-goods and reject-all-multiples. No deadtime or bandwidth limit is simulated for the coincidence sorter C  Phantoms Three cylinder phantoms with different diameter and length filled with uniform distributed 18 F activity are simulated: 1\, L=20 cm; 2 NEMA2001, D=20 cm, L=70 cm; 3\all cylinder, D=1 cm L=10 cm IV  R ESULTS AND DISCUSSION  Fig. 1 is the random coincidence rates as the activities with the NEMA2001 phantom. From the curves in the plot, we can see that all random rates are not equal and the relationship between them is take all goods delayed window reject all multiples RR R    015\015  6 The corresponded NECR results in each case are shown in Fig. 2, where we can see that with take-all-goods policy the random rate is underestimated therefore the NECR is overestimated; and on the contrary, with reject-all-multiples  policy the random rate is overestimated and then the NECR is underestimated Fig. 3 and Fig 4 show the similar NECR curves with two other phantoms. More over, the differences between the curves become greater when the phantoms become smaller.

 order to compare the differences, we calculated the ratios of the random rates from prompt window to the delayed window and the average ratios of all cases are shown in Table I. The numbers are calculated using the data from 3 mCi to 10 mCi The data from low activities are excluded to avoid the errors from the poor statistics. From Table I, we can see that when the phantom size becomes bigger, the difference between the delayed window random estimation and the prompt window random becomes smaller, no matter what kind coincidence policy is used. This conclusion can explained by the fact that for a bigger phantom, the singles rate will be relatively higher compared to the true coincidence rate, which according to equation \(7\atic error will be less significant and the three random rates will become closer  T ABLE I  A VERAGE RATIOS OF THE PROMPT RANDOM RATES TO DELAYED RANDOM RATES   Small Cylinder Phantom NEMA1994 Phantom NEMA2001 Phantom Reject-all-multiples 0.56  0.01 0.86  0.02 0.88  0.03 Take-all-goods 1.40  0.07 1.26  0.07 1.12  0.05  Though the simulation in this study is done with the geometry of a brain PET; however, the conclusion can be applied to any PET system including the human-body PET or small animal PET system. For those small animal PET camera with very high sensitivity \(~10 coincidence C ij to the single rates S i is very high, therefore the error of the random estimation by delayed window will be more serious  V  C ONCLUSION  Using delayed window method for random coincidences estimation in PET imaging has the systematic error. The multiple event policy of the coincidence sorter also has significant effect on the random rate correction. With take-allgoods policy, the random rate will be underestimated and results in overestimating NECR; while with reject-allmultiples policy, the random rate will be overestimated and results in underestimating NECR. The smaller the phantom is the greater the error will be. This problem is less serious for human whole-body PET system but more serious for large acceptance angle, high sensitivity system such as the small animal PET or brain PET cameras R EFERENCES    S.

  cost variables. Another units ontology may provide semantics associated with units such as tons. Thus, in a nutshell, the problem domain ontology along with other auxiliary domain ontologies together forms a library of relevant ontologies to provide semantics to the models   Figure 1. Model Representation Abstractions  Model representation can be viewed at three levels of abstraction. Level 1 indicates the highest level of abstraction, where the goal of representation is to denote a particular modeling paradigm in terms of its fundamental constructs and relationships among them. The overall notion is similar to meta-modeling that gives information about the feasible structure of a particular model schema or instance. We have focused on using Structured Modeling \(SM th e m o del repres e n t ation paradigm   Thus, model representation at level 1 provides the concepts and relationships that be used to represent both the model schemas and model instances, from a structural viewpoint. We have built two ontologies using OWL to capture the concepts and relationships in SM for representing model schemas and model instances respectively \(refer Figure 2 The next lower level of abstraction is level 2, where the goal is to represent a particular model schema independent of its data, such that various sets of data values may be used to instantiate this model at the lowest level of abstraction, i.e. at level 3. For example, an optimization model for a transportation problem in the supply chain domain may be represented in a dataindependent manner at level 2. Level 2 essentially is an instantiation of level 1 model schema structure ontology in the context of the domain knowledge. This implies linking it with classes in the problem domain ontologies such as supply chain ontology or other relevant ontologies such as currency \(for cost variables\. Thus level 2 captures semantics, both in terms of the model structure and problem domain semantics. This provides meaningful information that can be queried and extracted for various model management functions such as model selection and model composition, as discussed in Section 6   Figure 2.

For example, an optimization model for a transportation problem in the supply chain domain may be instantiated with a particular data set where the parameter values needed to solve the Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 4 


  problem are clearly provided. Model solvers can then use this model instance to provide results for the transformation problem for the given data set  4.2. Semantic representation of services We use OWL-S  33 f o r p r o v id in g se m a n tics to  models, encapsulated as executable web services in the proposed architecture. OWL-S is an OWL-based Web Service Ontology language, whose objective is to provide a vocabulary for encoding rich semantic web service descriptions. Service descriptions may be provided using OWL-S that mainly consists of three interrelated subontologies for the top-level concept Service, namely ServiceProfile, ServiceModel, and ServiceGrounding The service model \(relevant in the context of MM provides essentially a process model specification to describe how the service works in other words, how the client may interact with the service\in the form of Inputs Outputs, Preconditions, and Results \(typically called IOPR model\, which may be used for service seeking composing service descriptions, coordinating and monitoring of service executions. The Result concept allows a mechanism to specify several mutually exclusive results with corresponding outputs and possible effects using the inCondition, withOutput, and hasEffect properties\ process can be one of the three types atomic \(single interaction\, composite \(combination of processes with some workflow control structure\, or simple \(service abstraction The IOPR model can be specified in any appropriate representation language. We have chosen to use SWRL as the representation of choice, given the amenability of this rule-based representation for sequential composition of services T h e P r econ d ition s i n Co n d itions an d  Effects are represented using logical formulae in SWRL expressed over the Input and Output, which are essentially SWRL variables. The Parameter class is an intermediate class between these concepts, and is associated with a hasParameterType property. While the parameter type may be either a class or an XML schema datatype, in order to provide semantically richer descriptions of models \(e.g., a GenusName concept is much richer than, say, a string datatype\we take the stance of declaring Inputs and Outputs as concepts from the problem domain ontology or any other relevant ontology. Thus, the conditions expressed in terms of inputs and outputs will also be expressed will also be in terms of the relevant domain ontologies, and as a result have appropriate representation level \(as discussed in Section 4.1 In order to ensure decidability, we restrict the SWRL rules to be DL-Saf allo w i ng th e SW R L ru le to  bind only to known individuals in an ontology. This check is performed by the rule engine, thus assuring that the services selected based on this reasoning can indeed be executed. Certain other guidelines required for ease of reasoning are mentioned in   5. Proposed Model Management Architecture  Figure 3 shows the proposed model management architecture based on semantic web technologies. At the core of the architecture is the semantic representation of models/services. Executable models are denoted as model web services, which are described semantically using OWL-S and SWRL, as discussed in Section 4.2 Additionally, models may also be represented using either markup languages such as SMML e r f o rm at s such as GAMS, LINGO or MATLAB, which can be semantically represented in the form of structured model ontology, as discussed in Section 4.1. These semantic representations of models or services use the terminology from relevant domain knowledge ontologies Representative model preprocessing and execution services are shown on the right side of Figure 3, with which the user may interact through a front end. In turn these services leverage semantic processing services such as semantic web rule service and ontology reasoning service. UML component symbol is used to identify executable services. The arrows denote service requests and not the information exchange occurring. Now, we discuss the interactions among various components of the architecture In cases where models exist in SMML format, the ontology mapper service a y be i n v o k e d t o  convert the XML representation to a semantic representation based on the SM ontology. In cases where models exist in other formats such as GAMS, the model translator service may be invoked to translate the model into an SMML format, which in turn can be mapped to the SM ontology using the ontology mapper service SMML models may be queried directly using mechanisms such as XQuery, while the ontology representations can may be queried using SQWRL \(refer Section 6.1\ to provide semantically richer results. In cases where only executable models in the form of web services exist, the modeler may annotate them using the semantic annotation service to conduct further reasoning Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 5

Since explicit structural information will be missing from their representations only limited reasoning about such models may be done e.g., querying based on structural information may not be done\ch selection of relevant models is done by the model selection service using the semantic processing services. The ontology reasoning service reasons about the OWL ontologies to create inferences such as subsumption based on description logic. Ontology reasoners such as Pe a r e u s ed f o r th is s e rv ice. T h e  semantic web rule service is a rule engine \(e.g., Bossam  at reas on s bas e d o n t h e S W RL ru le s  T h e m odel  execution services are discussed as application scenarios in Section 6 In a nutshell, the proposed architecture leverages semantic representations of models and their execution counterparts, i.e., model web services along with reasoning services to support model management functionalities  6. Example Application Scenarios  In the discussion below, two types of potential application scenarios are presented to illustrate the ideas discussed earlier. Each of these scenarios have been prototypically tested for feasibility  6.1. Model selection Decision makers often need to select an appropriate model for the task at hand based on a number of factors such as the model-task compatibility, data requirements for candidate models, and last but not least execution behavior of candidate models. Here, we draw our attention to model-task compatibility, which can be judged by decision makers based on the results obtained by querying a semantic model base for relevant concepts The model ontology repository consists of structured model ontologies \(transformed from SMML\d also the corresponding service descriptions of those models. The structured model ontologies in turn refer to particular Proceedings of the 42nd Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2009 6 


  domain ontologies. For example, a demand forecasting model in a production environment will refer to terminology using one or more manufacturing domain ontologies. SQWRL queries written in terms of the structured model ontology terms can enable semantic querying of models Shown below is a sample query using SQWRL  Genus\(?g g, ?l sqwrl:select\(?g,?l  This query will return pairs of genera and their structured model levels. The sqwrl prefix is used to denote SQWRL operators. Implicit in this query is the information that the genus could belong to any one of the finer genus types primitive, compound, attribute, function, and test represented as subclasses of the class genus. Semantic querying of a model base thus allows one to obtain information without knowing the detailed syntactic structure of the model base. In other words, semantic queries support retrieval of both explicit and implicit information based on syntactic and semantic information in a knowledge base. The declarative approach allows user to specify what information is needed without posing the burden of knowing how the information is actually represented. These declarative SQWRL queries can then be reasoned using rule engines such as Jess or Bossom, to find the result of the query. This is supported by the semantic web rule service in the proposed architecture  6.2. Model composition Model composition is the problem of generating a sequence of models from a library of available models in response to a particular decision-making situation. Model composition focuses on assembling models together at a functional level [16, 41 rath er th an at a stru ct u r al  level. Only few research proposals attempt to address model composition in distributed settings [7, 48 Using the semantic description of web services in terms of OWL-S and SWRL-based IOPR model \(refer Section 4.2\ the knowledge base and a model composition request specified as a SWRL atom, the composer service invokes the semantic web rule service to find if a feasible SWRL rule path exists, and generating all possible such paths. The semantic web rule service is essentially a forward rule chaining rule engine, Bossam  h ic h reas ons bas e d on th e S W RL D L S a f e rules It  can be noted that besides the horn clause based rule base the inference is also based on the relevant description logic-based domain ontologies. This type of composition is suitable for models in which the process model consists of only atomic processes Alternatively, the composition service may be based on Hierarchical Task Network \(HTN\ning techniques as discusse h is com pos i tion ca n be m o re  amenable to OWL-S composite services involving various workflow control constructs e v e r, in t h is case   an intermediate task of transforming the SWRL rules in OWL-S IOPE models to SHOP2 planner amenable operators and methods needs to be performed  7. Discussion and concluding remarks  Analogous to data, this paper acknowledges decision models as an organizational resource that need to be managed, shared and reused. Distributed and heterogeneous information technology infrastructure imposes specific challenges that must be addressed in unique and novel ways. In that regard, the paper proposes an architecture that enables model management function in a distributed setting. The architecture is unique with respect to: \(1\ is truly distributed in the sense that model repositories as well as model management functions are distributed. \(2\plicitly leverages semantic web technologies such as OWL, OWL-S, and SWRL to facilitate model management function such as model selection and model composition The complexity of the technical landscape and the diversity of modeling paradigms represent significant challenges and opportunities for extending this research For example, much of the research in ontological engineering comes to bear in the context of model management. Of specific relevance is ontology development and ontology integration for desperate models. Other areas include the role of SWRL in ontology query as well as composition. The latter may include comparing and contrasting SWRL to other composition approaches such as HTN planning techniques as well as exploring areas of complementarities. Moreover, the suitability of the proposed approach to various types of models is something to consider. While structured modeling provided an underlying conceptual foundation for representing the details of mathematical models structured modeling has its limitations and may not be suitable for all types of models. Last but not least, the complexity of developing ontology-based representation of models will need to be further explored if this research is to transition to practice  8. References  1 E.

 10 However, the method proposed in this paper is able to improve the tracking performance. In roll, yaw and pitch axes, the attitude commands of aircraft have rapid and precise responses. Besides, usi ng in-flight C.G. estimation the approach can be seen to quickly adapt to the changing dynamics of the aircraft, a nd the coupling influence among three axes is effectively restrained In conclusion, the proposed de sign method in this paper could provide consistent pe rformance under varying C.G locations. Furthermore, compared with the conventional gain-scheduling method which requires huge design workload, this approach would effectively reduce the design complexity and make the design process clear and easy to implement 5  C ONCLUSION  This paper focuses on mode ling and attitude control of aircraft with C.G. variations First, a 6-DoF flight dynamics model of aircraft with C.G. vari ations is derived in order to account for the effect of the C.G. offset. After that, a synthesis approach based on i n-flight estimation of C.G position and inverse dynami cs is proposed to provide consistent performance under va rying C.G. locations. The simulation results demons trate good control performance and effectiveness of this approach A CKNOWLEDGMENTS  This research work is supported by the China Aviation Science Fund program \221Integrate d Vehicle Management System Concept and Architecture Research for Advanced Aircraft\222 \(No.20060718001 R EFERENCES  1] AGARD, \223Integrated Vehi cle Management Systems,\224 North Atlantic Treaty Organization REPORT 343, 1996  Watson M  D. and Johnson S.B 223A Theory of Vehicle Management Systems,\224 2007 IEEE Aerospace Conference Proceedings, March 3-10, 2007   A.Hay r e and T.Dull, \223The ATF YF-23 Vehicle Management System,\224 Ae rospace Design Conference Irvine, CA, 1992  B.Hill and R.W a tts, \223Suit Study\227The Im pact of VMS in Subsystem Integration,\224 Ae rospace Design Conference Irvine, CA, 1992  Huber B  223C enter of Gravity C ontrol on Airbus Aircraft Fuel, Range and Loading,\224 The 47th Annual Conference  of the Society of Allied Weight Engineers, Plymouth Michigan, May 23-25, 1988   Nhan Nguy en etc, \223Dy n am ics and Adaptive C ontrol for Stability Recovery of Damage d Asymmetric Aircraft,\224 AIAA Guidance, Navigation a nd Control Conference and Exhibit, Keystone, Colorado, 2006   Ostroff A J and B acon B J, \223Force and M o m e nt Approach for Achievable Dynamics Using Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion,\224 AIAA Guidance Navigation and Control Conference and Exhibit, Portland, OR, 1999  Liu Jiarun and Shen Gongz hang, \223Attitude Control Based on Inverse Dynamics and Online Parameter Identification,\224 Journal of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics 31\(2  Wu Sentang and Fei Yuhua Flight Control System Beijing: Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics Press, 2005  R obert C  Nelson and Gu Junxiao\(translator Stability and Automatic C ontrol, Beijing: National Defense Industry Press, 2008   B a rton J.B acon and Irene M  Gregory 223General Equations of Motion for a Damaged Asymmetric Aircraft,\224 AIAA Atmosphe ric Flight Mechanics Conference and Exhibit, Hilton Head, Carolina, 2007  o she Idan, Gil Iosilevskii and Sergey Nazarov 223InFlight Weight and Balance Identification Using Neural Networks,\224 AIAA Guidance Navigation and Control Conference and Exhibit, Austin, Texas, 2003  Li Yuany u an and Zhang Lifeng, \223Application of Adaptive Weighted Fusion Algorithm of Multi-sensor Data,\224 Automation & Instrumentation 2, 10-13, 2008  Aircraft Design M a nual Beijing: Aviation Industry Press, 2005  M a them atics M a nual, B e iji ng: Higher Education Press 2002 B IOGRAPHY  Jing Zhang is a PhD student in the Department of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, China.

  18 We plan to shift the file search and accessibility aspect outside of the IDL/Matlab/C++ code thereby treating it more as a processing \223engine\224. SciFlo\222s geoRegionQuery service can be used as a generic temporal and spatial search that returns a list of matching file URLs \(local file paths if the files are located on the same system geoRegionQuery service relies on a populated MySQL databases containing the list of indexed data files. We then also plan to leverage SciFlo\222s data crawler to index our staged merged NEWS Level 2 data products Improving Access to the A-Train Data Collection Currently, the NEWS task collects the various A-Train data products for merging using a mixture of manual downloading via SFTP and automated shell scripts. This semi-manual process can be automated into a serviceoriented architecture that can automatically access and download the various Level 2 instrument data from their respective data archive center. This will be simplified if more data centers support OPeNDAP, which will aid in data access. OPeNDAP will also allow us to selectively only download the measured properties of interest to the NEWS community for hydrology studies. Additionally OpenSearch, an open method using the REST-based service interface to perform searches can be made available to our staged A-Train data. Our various services such as averaging and subsetting can be modified to perform the OpenSearch to determine the location of the corresponding spatially and temporally relevant data to process. This exposed data via OpenSearch can also be made available as a search service for other external entities interested in our data as well Atom Service Casting We may explore Atom Service Casting to advertise our Web Services. Various services can be easily aggregated to create a catalog of services th at are published in RSS/Atom syndication feeds. This allows clients interested in accessing and using our data services to easily discover and find our WSDL URLs. Essentially, Atom Service Casting may be viewed as a more human-friendly approach to UDDI R EFERENCES   NASA and Energy and W a t e r cy cl e St udy NEW S website: http://www.nasa-news.org  R odgers, C  D., and B  J.
