This algorithm can reduce the data base I /Operation time, improve mining efficiency Keywords-data mining; association rule; frequent itemset Apriorialgorithm I  I NTRODUCTION  The birth of data mining technology met peopleís requirements. Data mining, also known as Knowledge Discovery from the database, it can extract implicit, people do not know in advance, but is potentially useful information and knowledge from a lot of incomplete, noisy, fuzzy, and random data in practical application. The occurrence of data mining provided a powerful means to automatically and intelligently transform the massive amounts of data into useful knowledge, which facilitates the erection of bridge between data and knowledge Association rule mining as an important branch of data mining is one of the most important and widely used data mining methods, also an important issue for this paper to be discussed  T h e c o nc e p t t o a s s o c i a t i o n r u l e s wa s  pr op os e d  first by Agrawalet al. in 1993, when analyzing the market basket problem, to discover interesting collection or related links between items among large amounts of data. For example, by digging market basket data, obtained the ì90 of customers buying the bread and butter, at the same time will buy milk so then find the buying patterns of customers in the sale of goods, making retailers better understand customer buying psychology, habits, and carry out targeted marketing, production scheduling, ultimately enable retailers to get better returns. Although the association rule is a demand a risen from the rapid development of the retail industry, but its application depends not only on the retail Currently, the association rule mining technique widely used in addition to banking, insurance, e-commerce and other commercial areas, people took it to expand the application to privacy protection, Web data mining, teaching management etc., reflecting the great development potential and application prospects. With the continuous expansion of application fields, to continue the research of association rule mining has important theoretical and practical value, so is a useful attempt II  D ATA M INING  From the point of view of data application, improved from low-level database query to decision support systems and further development of advanced applications such as predictive analytics. From a business perspective, data mining is to achieve deeper analysis on a large number of enterprise data according to the established enterprise business goals, the aim is to discover the unknown, hidden potential rules and convert them into corresponding model thus supporting business decision support activities Data mining is defined broadly as a process to extract implicit, people do not know in advance, but is potentially useful information and knowledge from a lot of noisy uncertain, stored in various forms or incomplete large data sets; in a narrow sense, data mining is the process to extract useful knowledge from the data set with specific form A  Data Mining Process Data mining process is generally composed by several major phases such as mining objects determination, data preparation, data mining, structural analysis expression and mining applicatio Da t a  m i ni ng c a n be de s c ri be d a s a  repetition of these stages, particularly shown in figure 1   Mining objects determination  Data integration  Data selection  Data preprocessing  Data conversion Data preparation   Data mining  Select data mining algorithm Data mining   Results evaluation and knowledge consolidation  Results presentation Results presentation and application   Figure 1  Data mining process 


Mining objects determination, in principle, data mining can be performed on any type of information storage. This includes relational databases, data warehouses, transactional databases, advanced database systems, and expanded files The advanced database systems include object-oriented and object-relational databases; da tabases for special applications such as spatial database, time series database, text database and multimedia database Data preparation phase can be further divided into four steps: data integration, data selection, data preprocessing and data conversion. In these, data integration is to process multiple files or the data in multiple data base running environments, solve the semantic ambiguity, deal with the missing data, and clean data io n is to searc h  and select the relevant data for data mining goals, including conversion of data in different formats, and aggregation of data in different sectors. Data preprocessing is data cleaning and enrichment work. Important data in the database is accurate, and unimportant data may be contaminated Preprocessing is to overcome th e limitations of current data mining tools, and an important work of data conversion is to encode data. Different values of the database fields attributes\ to be converted into digital form will facilitate the search Data mining, at this stage the actual mining operations namely by the use of machine learning, statistical analysis and other methods to find useful patterns or knowledge from the database, including data mining method selection, data mining algorithm selection, and data mining Results analysis presentation and mining applications including results expression, to intuitively express the mining results as far as possible, let it easy for users to understand and use; results evaluation, to select and evaluate the useful part of mining results, and then find the acceptable results knowledge consolidation, to ga ther the extracted information to the execution system, understand the role of such information or evidence it B  Data Mining System Structure Although data mining regarded as a basic step of data base knowledge discovery process is more scientific, but in the industry, the media and the database research field directly as a data base knowledge discovery is more prevalent. Therefore, data mining has a broader concept: it is a process to extract interesting knowledge from a lot of data stored in databases, data warehouses or other information warehouses. Based on this view, a typical data mining system may consist of the following main components shown in figure 2 It is noted that data mining technology from the outset oriented applications. It is no t only simple search, queries and call for specific database, but also micro and macro statistics, analysis, synthesis and reasoning for these data, to guide for solving practical problems, attempt to find interrelation between events, even use the existing data to predict future events. As a result, increase people on data applications, from the low-level end query operations to decision support for business decision-makers at all levels This demand-driven force is more powerful than database query   User application interface Model assessment Mining engine Knowledge base   Data cleaning filtering Data integration   Application layer Logic layer Data layer  Figure 2  Data mining system structure III  A SSOCIATIONRULE D ATA M INING AND I MPROVED A LGORITHM  In the knowledge models data mining discovered association rule model is very important one, also the most active branch. Association rule indicates correlation between groups of objects in the database. Association rule mining is to discover the interesting or relevant connection between a large numbers of data items, the association rule problem was proposed by R. Agrawalet 1993, immediately attracted wide attentio M a ny re s e a r c h e r s ha d i n de p t h re s e a r c h  on it, then improved and expanded the initial association rules mining algorithm. Meanwhile, the association rule mining has been applied to the database in many other fields and achieved good excavation effect A  Definition of Association Rule Association rule mining is to illustrate by using formal description, has common sense, in particular: let 12     m Iii i  be consist of m different items. Given a transaction database D in which each transaction T is a set of items in I that is TI each T has a unique identifier If the item set is that XI and XT then the transaction T contains the item set X Association rule is an implication like XY in which XI  YI and XY Y If the association rule XY is established there should be also the following two flag parameters support S namely the transaction database D should have at least  S transactions include all the items in X and Y  Confidence C namely at least  C transactions including X contains Y In XY  X is known as former member Y as after member, and X  Y both can composed by the conjunctive expression 


For convenience, the value from 0% to 100% commonly used, rather than 0 to 1 to express the support and confidence. And the minimum support threshold, the smallest confidence threshold is generally set by the domain experts. Collection of items called item set, the item set including k items called k item set [5 A ll th e larg e ite m sets denoted by L in which 1 k i i LL i L and k is the length of the longest item set. The frequency of item sets is the number of item sets included in transaction database D also known as frequency or support counting. Item sets meeting minimum support min Sup means that the frequency of item sets is greater than or equal with the product of min Sup and the total number of transactions in D If the item sets meet minimum support, then it will be called frequent item sets B  Steps of Association Rule Mining Association rule mining is to identify the association rules in the transaction database D to meet a user-specified minimum support and minimum confidence; the entire mining process can be decomposed into two steps specifically shown in figure 3   Data set  Search for frequent item sets  Association rules generation   Association rule sets    Figure 3  Steps of association rule mining First to find the item set with all the transaction supports greater than the minimum support. The support of an item set is the number of transaction co ntaining this set. The item set with minimum support called frequent item sets, others are non-frequent item sets. That is, to identify the item set with support greater than a given support threshold The second step, generate strong association rules based on frequent item sets finding. That is, generate the association rules with support and confidence greater than or equal to the prior given support threshold and confidence threshold C  Performance Analysis of Association Rule Mining Algorithm At present, there are many frequent item sets generation algorithms, and when generating frequent k item sets these algorithms will scan each transaction of the database for statistics of the support of k item sets, and according to the determined minimum support find all frequent k item sets at the first k iteration [6 H o w e v e r, b e cau se that th e size of the databases usually very large, so the above method consumes too much time. Therefore, to seek effective generation algorithm is a key issue. In fact, in the whole execution process of association rule mining the first subissue is the core, and the second is relatively simple Apriori rule is the basic rule of frequent set needed by Boolean association rule mining and generation; also a very influential association rule mining rule Apriori algorithm is an itera tive algorithm called search layer by layer, the role of k item set is to search the first 1 k item set. At first, find a collection of frequent 1-item sets, as 1 L The role of 1 L is to find the collection 2 L of 2item sets, and 2 L to find 3 L so to repeat it, until no frequent k item set. This way, to find each k L needs scanning the database. An important nature of Apriori is to improve the efficiency of frequent item sets produced layer by layer which is used to compress the se arch space, the core part of Apriori algorithm as follows 1  LL 2 k  While 1 k L  k N apriori_gen 1 k L  min Sup  For each transactions tD  t N subset k N  t  For each candidates t nN  n     min   kk L n N n count Sup   k   Return kk L kk L k k  Since the rules are generated by the frequent set, each rule will automatically satisfy the minimum support. So, the rule generated by the above algorithm is what we hope to get Apriori algorithm has two fatal performance flaws: the first is a lot of I/O space-time overhead in multiples cans of transaction D item sets. For each k cycle, each element of the candidate set k N must first be veri fied whether joined k L by scanning the entire transaction set D so there will be a huge I/O space-time overhead. The other drawback is that may produce very large candid ate sets. Generating the first k candidate set k N from 1 k L is exponential growth, so resulting in so many candidate sets for execution time and memory space will be a challenge [7 IV  O PTIMIZATION OF A SSOCIATION R ULEMINING A LGORITHM  Apriori algorithm, although its implementation process is relatively simple, but each generation of candidate set containing different number of items needs to scan the transaction database D when the candidate set larger, spacetime overhead of Apriori algorithm becomes relatively large 


in addition, the data in the transaction database is still increasing, after each increase in data, Apriori algorithm should recalculate the frequent item sets and generate association rules, so the previously generated frequent item sets and association rules already have no use, which is not conducive to quickly and efficiently find association rules Even, if the size of the transaction database exceeds the memory capacity, Apriori algorithm can no longer be used The first step of improved algorithm is to simply account the frequency of the item sets containing a certain factor, to determine the frequent one-dimension item set, while generating set  1 N In the first k step, there are two stages first, with function apriori_gen, through the frequent item set 1 k L generated in 1 k step, to generate a candidate set k N at the same time generate set  k N and then search it to calculate the support of k N  In the improved algorithm, the basic idea of looking for the largest item set is that it requires the data set multi-step process. The first step, simply account the frequency of the item sets containing a certain factor, to identify those having support not less than the minimum, that is, one-dimensional frequent item set. From the second step cycle processing until no frequent item set generated. Cycle process: in the first k step, according to the 1 k dimension frequent item set generated in the first 1 k step, to generate k dimension frequent item set, and then search set  k N to get the support of the candidate item set, finally compared with the minimum support, thus finding the k dimensional item set. Set  k N is defined as: the form of each member in the set is  id k Ts each k s is a potentially frequent k dimension item set which is identified as id T When 1 k   1 N and database D are consistent. And when 1 k   k N is generated by the algorithm, the members of  k N and transaction T are consistent. If a transaction does not include any candidate k dimension item set  k N will not have a directory of it, so the directory number of  k N will be less than the number of database transactions, especially for k with large values. In addition, for k with large values each directory less than the corresponding transaction because a transaction hardly containing a candidate Conversely, for k with very small values, each directory more than the corresponding transaction, because that a directory in  k N contains all the candidate k dimension item sets in the transaction The advantage of this algorithm is that only in the first scan using transaction database D calculates the support of candidate frequent item sets, in other scans using the last scanned candidate transaction database  D to calculate. In the last several scans  D is much smaller than D which reduces the I/O operation time, thereby increasing the efficiency of the algorithm V  C ONCLUSION  With the development of information technology, data mining technology has obtained widespread concern, which prompted the scientific community more in-depth study of this technology. Data mining technology has many research fields, in which association rule mining is one of the important research directions, the in-depth study on it not only has important theoretical significance, but also has a very important application value. Association rule mining algorithms are the main contents of the study, and many efficient association rule mining algorithms have been proposed. In this paper, through the study of existing association rule mining algorithm, starting from database size reduction, an improved association rule data mining algorithm is proposed. It can greatly enhance the time efficiency of frequent item finding algorithm, especially when a large number of data item set, its superiority is particularly prominent  R EFERENCES  1  Jiawei Han, Hong Cheng, Dong Xin Xifeng Yan.

the shufﬂe phase and 2 to minimize local mining load Recall that high shufﬂing cost and local mining load are incurred by redundant transactions In what follows we formally state the design goal of Fidoop-DP Let the input data for a MapReduce job be a set of transactions D f t 1 t 2   t n g and function DBPart  D  C partitions D into a set of chunks C f C 1 C 2   C p g  Correspondingly map tasks M f m 1 m 2  m p g and reduce tasks R f r 1 r 2  r q g are running on a cluster We denote a set of intermediate key-value pairs produced by the mappers as I f G 1 D 1      G m D m   in which D i represents the collection of transactions belonging to group G i  Intuitively we have output  m i 004 I and input  r i 004 I  where output  m i  and input  r i  respectively represent a set of intermediate pairs produced by map task m i and a set of intermediate pairs assigned to reduce task r i  After Map tasks are completed the shufﬂe phase applies the default partitioning function to assign intermediate key-value pairs to reduce tasks according to the keys i.e G i f output  m i   In this process if intermediate key-value pair   G i D i   is partitioned into a reducer running on a remote node then intermediate data shufﬂing will take place Let S  G i  and T  G i  be a source node and a target node respectively We have p i  1 S  G i  6  T  G i  0  Otherwise 002  1  where p i is set to 0 when the intermediate pair is produced on a local node running the corresponding reduce task otherwise p i is set to 1  The design goal of FiDoop-DP is to partition transactions in a way to minimize the data transfer cost Applying 1 we formally express the design goal as Minimize X m i  1 D i 005 p i   2  4D ATA P ARTITIONING FIM is a multi-stage parallel process where redundant transactions transmission and redundant mining tasks occur in the second MapReduce job Recall that see Section 3.1 it is a grand challenge to avoid these downsides by using traditional grouping strategies and default partitioning function And transferring redundant transactions is a main reason behind high network load and redundant mining cost To solve this problem we propose to partition transactions by considering correlations among transactions and items prior to the parallel mining process That is transactions with a great similarity are partitioned into one partition in order to prevent the transactions from being repeatedly transmitted to remote nodes We adopt the Voronoi diagram-based data partitioning technique which is conducive to maintaining data proximity especially for multi-dimensional data Therefore when the second MapReduce job is launched a new Voronoi diagram-based data partitioning strategy is deployed to minimize unnecessary redundant transaction transmissions Voronoi diagram is a way of dividing a space into a number of regions A set of points referred to as pivots or seeds is speciﬁed beforehand For each pivot there is a corresponding region consisting of all objects closer to it than to the other pivots The regions are called Voronoi cells The idea of Voronoi diagram-based partitioning can be formally described as follows Given a dataset D  Voronoi diagrambased partitioning selects k objects as pivots donated p 1 p 2   p k  Then all objects of D are split into k disjoint partitions donated C 1 C 2   C k  where each object is assigned to the partition with its closest pivot In this way the entire data space is split into k cells Incorporating the characteristic of FIM we adopt the similarity as the distance metric between transaction and pivot or between two transactions in Voronoi diagram see Section 4.1 for details In addition Voronoi diagram-based partitioning relies on a way of selecting a set of pivots Thus in what follows we investigate distance measure and pivotselection strategies followed by partitioning strategies 4.1 Distance Metric Recall that to optimize FIM a good partitioning strategy should cluster similar data objects to the same partition Similarity is a metric to quantitatively measure the correlation strength between two objects To capture the characteristics of transactions we adopt the Jaccard similarity as a distance metric Jaccard similarity is a statistic commonly used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample data objects A high Jaccard similarity value indicates that two data sets are very close to each other in terms of distance In order to quantify the distance among transactions we model each transaction in a database as a set Then the distance among transactions is measured using the Jaccard similarity among these sets The Jaccard similarity of two sets A and B is deﬁned as J  A  B  j A  B j j A  B j   3  Obviously J  A B  is a number ranging between 0 and 1  it is 0 when the two sets are disjoint 1 when they are identical and strictly between 0 and 1 otherwise That is the distance between two sets is close when their Jaccard index is closer to 1  if there is a large distance between the two sets their Jaccard index is closer to 0 4.2 K-means Selection of Pivots Intuitively selecting pivots directly affects the uniformity coefﬁcient of the remaining ob jects for voronoi diagrambased partitioning In particular we employ the Kmeans-based selection strategy see t o c ho ose p ivo t s And the pivot selecting process is conducted as a data preprocessing phase K-means is a popular algorithm for clustering analysis in data mining K-means clustering aims to partition n objects into k clusters 21 That is given a set of objects  x 1 x 2 x n   where each object is a d-dimensional real vector k-means clustering partitions the n objects into k  k 006 n  sets C  C 1 C 2 C k  in which each object belongs to a cluster with the nearest mean The clustering results can be applied to partition the data space into Voronoi cells To reduce the computational cost of k-means we perform sampling on the transaction database before running the k-means algorithm It is worth mentioning that the selection of initial pivots a.k.a seeds plays a critical role in XUN ET AL FIDOOP-DP DATA PARTITIONING IN FREQUENT ITEMSET MINING ON

clustering performance Thus k-means an extension of k-means is adopted to conduct pivots selection After the k data clusters are generated we choose the center point of each cluster as a pivot for the Voronoi diagram-based data partitioning 4.3 Partitioning Strategies Upon the selection of pivots we calculate the distances from the rest of the objects to these pivots to determine a partition to which each object belongs We develop the LSH-based strategy to implement a novel grouping and partitioning process prior to which MinHash is employed as a foundation for LSH 4.3.1 MinHash MinHash offers a quick solution to estimate how similar two sets are MinHas h is increasi ngly becoming a popula r solution for large-scale clustering problems MinHash replaces large sets by much smaller representations called signatures composed of minhash of the characteristic matrix i.e a matrix representation of data sets Then MinHash computes an expected similarity of two data sets based on the signatures Thus these two phases are detailed below First a characteristic matrix is created from transactions and items in a database Given a transaction database D f t 1 t 2   t n g  which contains m items We create an m byn characteristic matrix M  where columns represent transactions rows denote items of the universal item set Given item r i.e a row in the matrix and transaction c i.e a column in the matrix we set the value in position  r c  to 1 if item r is a member in transaction c  otherwise the value of  r c  is set to 0 Second a signature matrix is constructed using the characteristic matrix obtained in the above step Let h be a hash function mapping members of any set to distinct integers Given a set T f x 1   x n g  we deﬁne hmin  T  to be T s member x  whose hash value i.e h  x   is the minimal one among all the hash values of the members in T  Thus we have hmin  T  x where h  x  Min n i  1  h  x i    4  We randomly permute for the rst time the rows of the characteristic matrix For each column e.g c i representing a transaction we compute the column’s hash value hmin  c i  using 4 Then the value in position  1 i  of the signature matrix is set to hmin  c i   Next we permute the rows of the characteristic matrix for a second time to determine the value in position  2 i   1 006 i 006 n  We repeatedly perform the above steps to obtain the value in position  j i   where j denotes the j th permutation as well as the j th row in the signature matrix i indicates the i th column in the signature matrix Finally it is necessary to collect multiple e.g l  independent MinHash values for each column in M to form an l 005 n signatures matrix M 0  We make use of the signature matrix to calculate the similarity of any pair of two transactions Though MinHash is widely applied to estimate the similarity of any pair of two sets the number of pairs in a large database D is likely to be very big If we decide to conduct thorough pair-wise comparisons the computing cost would be unsustainable 4.3.2 LSH-Based Partitioning Locality sensitive hashing or LSH boosts the performance of MinHash by avoiding the comparisons of a large number of element pairs 2  2 5  Un lik e Min Has h re pea ted ly ev al ua ting an excessive number of pairs LSH scans all the transactions once to identify all the pairs that are likely to be similar We adopt LSH to map transactions in the feature space to a number of buckets in a way that similar transactions are likely to be mapped into the same buckets More formally the locality sensitive Hash function family is deﬁned as follows For Hash family H  if any two points p and q satisfy the following conditions then H is called  R c P 1 P 2  sensitive 1 If k p 003 q k\006 R  then Pr H  h  p  h  q  007 P 1  2 If k p 003 q k\006 cR  then Pr H  h  p  h  q  006 P 2  A family is interesting when P 1 P 2  The above condition 1 ensures two similar points are mapped into the same buckets with a high probability condition 2 guarantees two d points are less likely to be mapped into the same buckets LSH has to make use of the MinHash signature matrix obtained in 4.3.1 i.e M 0  Given the l 005 n signature matrix M 0  we design an effective way of choosing the hash family by dividing the signature matrix into b bands consisting of r rows where b 005 r  l  For each band there is a hash function that takes the r integers the portion of one column within that band as a vector which is placed into a hash bucket It relies on the use of a family of locality preserving hash functions creating several hash tables that similar items with high probability are more likely to be hashed into the same bucket than dissimilar items From the way of establishing Hash Table we obtain that the time complexity of lookup is O\(1 5I MPLEMENTATION D ETAILS In this section we present the implementation details of LSH-based FiDoop-DP running on Hadoop clusters Please refer to Fig 2 for FiDoop-DP’s processing ow which consists of four steps i.e one sequential-computing step and three parallel MapReduce jobs see Section 2.3 Speciﬁcally before launching the FiDoop-DP process a preprocessing phase is performed in a master node to select a set of k pivots which serve as an input of the second MapReduce job that is responsible for the Voronoi diagram-based partitioning see Section 4.2 In the rst MapReduce job each mapper sequentially reads each transaction from its local input split on a data node to generate local 1-itemsets Next global 1-itemsets are produced by a speciﬁc reducer which merges local 1-itemsets sharing the same key i.e item name The output of these reducers include the global frequent 1-itemsets along with their counts The second step sorts these global frequent 1-itemsets in a decreasing order of frequency the sorted frequent 1-itemsets are saved in a cache named FList  which becomes an input of the second MapReduce job in FiDoop-DP The second MapReduce job applies a second-round scanning on the database to repartition database to form a complete dataset for item groups in the map phase Each reducer conducts local FP-Growth based on the partitions to generate all frequent patterns 106 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS VOL 28 NO 1 JANUARY 2017 


The last MapReduce job aggregates the second MapReduce job’s output i.e all the frequent patterns to generate the nal frequent patterns for each item For example the output of the second MapReduce job includes three frequent patterns namely abc adc and bdc Using these three frequent patterns as an input the third MapReduce job creates the nal results for each item as a abc,adc b abc,bdc c abc,adc,bdc and d adc,bdc We pay attention to the second MapReduce job and the reason is three-fold First at the heart of FiDoop-DP is the construction of all frequent patterns which is implemented in the second MapReduce job Second this MapReduce job is more complicated and comprehensive than the rst and the third ones Third this job plays a vital role in achieving high performance of FiDoop-DP To optimize the performance of Pfp we make an improvement in the second MapReduce job by incorporating the Voronoi diagram-based partitioning idea In what follows we elaborate the algorithm for the second MapReduce job Given a set of k pivots  p 1 p 2   p k  selected in the preprocessing step we perform item grouping and data partitioning using statistical data collected for each partition Algorithm 1 is an LSH-based approach that integrates the item grouping see Step 3 and partitioning processes see Steps 4-20 In Algorithm 1 each mapper takes transactions as an input in the format of Pair h LongWritableoffset Textrecord i see Step 1 The mappers concurrently load FList to lter infrequent items of each transaction see Step 2 Meanwhile FList is divided into Q groups i.e GLists  by determining similarity among items and the given pivots  P 1 P 2   P k  each GList consists of Gid and the collection of items in the group see Step 3 Then each record including the pivots  P 1 P 2   P k  T i is transformed into a set followed by applying the minhash function to generate a column c i of signatures matrix see Steps 4-12 and algorithm 2 LSH is carried out using the above signature matrix M 0  l 005 n  see Steps 13-16 M 0 is divided into b bands each of which contains r rows where b 005 r  l  Then these bands are hashed to a number of hash buckets each hash bucket contains similar transactions see Step 15 Below we show the rationale behind applying LSH to determine similarity among transactions Given two transactions e.g T 1 and T 2  if there exists at least a pair of bands e.g b 1 2 T 1 and b 2 2 T 2  such that bands b 1 and b 2 are hashed into the same bucket then transactions T 1 and T 2 are considered similar see Step 17 Assume the similarity between two columns denoted as c 1 c 2  of a signature matrix is p  then the probability that c 1 and c 2 are exactly the same in a band is p r  the probability that c 1 and c 2 are completely different with respect to all the b bands is 1 003 s r  We show that if selecting appropriate values of b and r  transactions with a great similarity are mapped into one bucket with a very high probability If a band of T i shares the same bucket with a band of P j  we assign T i to the partition labelled as P j  We donate such an assignment in form of a pair Pair h P j T i i  see Steps 1819 At the end of the map tasks GLists are checked to guarantee the data completeness Steps 21-24 Finally the mappers emit Pair h P i T i i to be shufﬂed and combined for the second job’s reducers and reducers conduct local

on items contained in each item group When the number of pivots increases the entire database is split into a ner granularity and the number of partitions increase correspondingly Such a ne granularity leads to a reduction in distance computation among transactions On the other hand when the pivot number k continues growing the number of transactions mapped into one hash bucket signiﬁcantly increases thereby leading to a large candidate-object set and high shufﬂing cost see Figs 3b and 3c Consequently the overall execution time is optimized when k is 60 for both algorithms see Fig 3a 6.2 Minimum Support Recall that minimum support plays an important role in mining frequent itemsets We increase minimum support thresholds from 0.0005 to 0.0025 percent with an increment of 0.0005 percent to evaluate the impact of minimum support on FiDoop-DP The other parameters are the same as those for the previous experiments Fig 4a shows that the execution times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp decrease when the minimum support is increasing Intuitively a small minimum support leads to an increasing number of frequent 1-itemsets and transactions which have to be scanned and transmitted Table 2 illustrates the size of frequent 1-itemsets stored in FList and the number of nal output records of the two parallel solutions under various minimum-support values Fig 4a reveals that regardless of the minimum-support value FiDoop-DP is superior to Pfp in terms of running time Two reasons make this performance trend expected First FiDoop-DP optimizes the partitioning process by placing transactions with a high similarity into one group rather than randomly and evenly grouping the transaction Fig 4b conﬁrms that FiDoop-DP’s shufﬂing cost is signiﬁcantly lower than that of Pfp thanks to optimal data partitions offered by FiDoop-DP Second this grouping strategy in FiDoop-DP minimizes the number of transactions for each GList under the premise of data completeness which leads to reducing mining load for each Reducer The grouping strategy of FiDoop-DP introduces computing overhead including signature-matrix calculation and hashing each band into a bucket Nevertheless such small overhead is offset by the performance gains in the shufﬂing and reduce phases Fig 4a also shows that the performance improvement of FiDoop-DP over Pfp is widened when the minimum support increases This performance gap between FiDoop-DP and Pfp is reasonable because pushing minimum support up in FiDoop-DP lters out an increased number of frequent 1-itemsets which in turn shortens the transaction partitioning cost Small transactions simplify the correlation analysis among the transactions thus small transactions are less likely to have a large number of duplications in their partitions As a result the number of duplicated transactions to be transmitted among the partitions is signiﬁcantly reduced which allows FiDoop-DP to deliver better performance than Pfp 6.3 Data Characteristic In this group of experiments we respectively evaluate the impact of dimensionality and data correlation on the performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp by changing the parameters in the process of generating the datasets using the IBM Quest Market-Basket Synthetic Data Generator 6.3.1 Dimensionality The average transaction length directly determines the dimensions of a test data We conﬁgure the average transaction length to 10 40 60 and 85 to generate T10I4D 130 blocks T40I10D 128 blocks T60I10D 135 blocks T85I10D 133 blocks datasets respectively In this experiment we measure the impacts of dimensions on the performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp on the 8-node Hadoop cluster The experimental results plotted in Fig 5a clearly indicate that an increasing number of dimensions signiﬁcantly raises the running times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp This is because increasing the number of dimensions increases the number of groups thus the amount of data transmission sharply goes up as seen in Fig 5b The performance improvements of FiDoop-DP over Pfp is diminishing when the dimensionality increases from 10 to 85 For example FiDoop-DP offers an improvement of 29.4 percent when the dimensionality is set to 10 the improvement drops to 5.2 percent when the number of dimensions becomes 85 In what follows we argue that FiDoop-DP is inherently losing the power of reducing the number of redundant transactions in high-dimensional data When a dataset has a low dimensionality FiDoop-DP tends to build partitions Fig 4 Impact of minimum support on FiDoop-DP and Pfp TABLE 2 The Size of FList and the Number of Final Output Records Under Various Minimum-Support Values minsupport 0.0005 0.001 0.0015 0.002 0.0025 FList 14.69k 11.6k 9.71k 6.89k 5.51k OutRecords 745 588 465 348 278 XUN ET AL FIDOOP-DP DATA PARTITIONING IN FREQUENT ITEMSET MINING ON HADOOP CLUSTERS 109 


each of which has distinct characteristics compared with the other partitions Such distinct features among the partitions allow FiDoop-DP to efﬁciently reduce the number of redundant transactions In contrast a dataset with high dimensionality has a long average transaction length therefore data partitions produced by FiDoop-DP have no distinct discrepancy Redundant transactions are likely to be formed for partitions that lack distinct characteristics Consequently the beneﬁt offered by FiDoop-DP for highdimensional datasets becomes insigniﬁcant 6.3.2 Data Correlation We set the correlation among transactions i.e corr to 0.15 0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 0.65 and 0.75 to measure the impacts of data correlation on the performance of the two algorithms on the 8-node Hadoop cluster The Number of Pivots is set to 60 see also Section 6.1 The experimental results plotted in Fig 5c clearly indicate that FiDoop-DP is more sensitive to data correlation than Pfp This performance trend motivates us to investigate the correlation-related data partition strategy Pfp conducts default data partition based on equal-size item group without taking into account the characteristics of the datasets However FiDoop-DP judiciously groups items with high correlation into one group and clustering similar transactions together In this way the number of redundant transactions kept on multiple nodes is substantially reduced Consequently FiDoop-DP is conducive to cutting back both data transmission trafﬁc and computing load As can be seen from Fig 5c there is an optimum balance point for data correlation degree to tune FiDoop-DP performance e.g 0.35 in Fig 5c If data correlation is too small Fidoop-DP will degenerate into random partition schema On the contrary it is difﬁcult to divide items into relatively independent groups when data correlation is high meaning that an excessive number of duplicated transactions have to be transferred to multiple nodes Thus a high data correlation leads to redundant transactions formed for partitions thereby increasing network and computing loads 6.4 Speedup Now we are positioned to evaluate the speedup performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp by increasing the number of data nodes in our Hadoop cluster from 4 to 24 The T40I10D 128 blocks dataset is applied to drive the speedup analysis of the these algorithms Fig 6 reveals the speedups of FiDoop-DP a nd Pfp as a function of the number of data nodes The experimental results illustrated in Fig 6a show that the speedups of FiDoop-DP and Pfp linearly scale up with the increasing number of data nodes Such a speedup trend can be attributed to the fact that increasing the number of data nodes under a xed input data size inevitably 1 reduces the amount of itemsets being handled by each node and 2 increases communication overhead among mappers and reducers Fig 6a shows that FiDoop-DP is better than Pfp in terms of the speedup efﬁciency For instance the FiDoop-DP improves the speedup efﬁciency of Pfp by up to 11.2 percent with an average of 6.1 percent This trend suggests FiDoopDP improves the speedup efﬁciency of Pfp in large-scale The speedup efﬁciencies drop when the Hadoop cluster scales up For example the speedup efﬁciencies of FiDoopDP and Pfp on the 4-node cluster are 0.970 and 0.995 respectively These two speedup efﬁciencies become 0.746 and 0.800 on the 24-node cluster Such a speedup-efﬁciency trend is driven by the cost of shufﬂing intermediate results which sharply goes up when the number of data nodes scales up Although the overall computing capacity is improved by increasing the number of nodes the cost of synchronization and communication among data nodes tends to offset the gain in computing capacity For example the results plotted in Fig 6b conﬁrm that the shufﬂing cost Fig 5 Impacts of data characteristics on FiDoop-DP and Pfp Fig 6 The speedup performance and shufﬂing cost of FiDoop-DP and Pfp 110 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS VOL 28 NO 1 JANUARY 2017 


is linearly increasing when computing nodes are scaled from 4 to 24 Furthermore the shufﬂing cost of Pfp is larger than that of FiDoop-DP 6.5 Scalability In this group of experiments we evaluate the scalability of FiDoop-DP and Pfp when the size of input dataset dramatically grows Fig 7 shows the running times of the algorithms when we scale up the size of the T40I10D data series Figs 7a and 7b demonstrate the performance of FiDoop-DP processing various datasets on 8-node and 24-node clusters respectively Fig 7 clearly reveals that the overall execution times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp go up when the input data size is sharply enlarged The parallel mining process is slowed down by the excessive data amount that has to be scanned twice The increased dataset size leads to long scanning time Interestingly FiDoop-DP exhibits a better scalability than Pfp Recall that see also from Algorithm 1 the second MapReduce job compresses an initial transaction database into a signature matrix which is dealt by the subsequent process The compress ratio is high when the input data size is large thereby shortening the subsequent processing time Furthermore Fidoop-DP lowers the network trafﬁc induced by the random grouping strategy in Pfp In summary the scalability of FiDoop-DP is higher than that of Pfp when it comes to parallel mining of an enormous amount of data 7R ELATED W ORK 7.1 Data Partitioning in MapReduce Partitioning in databases has been widely studied for both single system servers e.g and distributed storage systems e.g BigTable PNUTS[31 The existing approaches typically produce possible ranges or hash partitions which are then evaluated using heuristics and cost models These schemes offer limited support for OLTP workloads or query analysis in the context of the popular MapReduce programming model In this study we focus on the data partitioning issue in MapReduce High scalability is one of the most important design goals for MapReduce applications Unfortunately the partitioning techniques in existing MapReduce platforms e.g Hadoop are in their infancy leading to serious performance problems Recently a handful of data partitioning schemes have been proposed in the MapReduce platforms Xie et al  developed a data placement management mechanism for heterogeneous Hadoop clusters Their mechanism partitions data fragments to nodes in accordance to the nodes processing speed measured by computing ratios In addition Xie et al  designed a data redistribution algorithm in HDFS to address the data-skew issue imposed by dynamic data insertions and deletions CoHadoop is a H a d oop s lightweight extension which is designed to identify relateddataﬁlesfollowedbyamodiﬁeddataplacement policy to co-locate copies of those related les in the same server CoHadoop considers the relevance among les that is CoHadoop is an optimization of HaDoop for multiple les A key assumption of the MapReduce programming model is that mappers are completely independent of one another Vernica et al  broke such an assumption by introducing an asynchronous communication channel among mappers T his c hannel e nables the m appers to see global states managed in metadata Such situationaware mappers SAMs can enable MapReduce to exibly partition the inputs Apart from this adaptive sampling and partitioning were proposed to produce balanced partitions for the reducers by sampling mapper outputs and making use of obtained statistics Graph and hypergraph partitioning have been used to guide data partitioning in parallel computing Graph-based partitioning schemes capture data relationships For example Ke et al applied a graphic-execution-plan graph EPG to perform cost estimation and optimization by analyzing various properties of both data and computation Their estimation module coupled with the cost model estimate the runtime cost of each vertex in an EPG which represents the overall runtime cost a data partitioning plan is determined by a cost optimization module Liroz-Gistau et al proposed the MR-Part technique which partitions all input tuples producing the same intermediate key co-located in the same chunk Such a partitioning approach minimizes data transmission among mappers and reducers in the shufﬂe phase The approach captures the relationships between input tuples and intermediate keys by monitoring the execution of representative workload Then based on these relationships their approach applies a min-cut k-way graph partitioning algorithm thereby partitioning and assigning the tuples to appropriate fragments by modeling the workload with a hyper graph In doing so subsequent MapReduce jobs take full advantage of data locality in the reduce phase Their partitioning strategy suffers from adverse initialization overhead Fig 7 The scalability of FiDoop-DP and Pfp when the size of input dataset increases XUN ET AL FIDOOP-DP DATA PARTITIONING IN FREQUENT ITEMSET MINING ON HADOOP CLUSTERS 111 


7.2 Application-Aware Data Partitioning Various efﬁcient data partitioning strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of parallel computing systems For example Kirsten et al  developed two general partitioning strategies for generating entity match tasks to avoid memory bottlenecks and load imbalances Taking into account the characteristics of input data Aridhi et al proposed a novel density-based data partitioning technique for approximate large-scale frequent subgraph mining to balance computational load among a collection of machines Kotoulas et al built a data distribution mechanism based on clustering in elastic regions Traditional term-based partitioning has limited scalability due to the existence of very skewed frequency distributions among terms Load-balanced distributed clustering across networks and local clustering are introduced to improve the chance that triples with a same key are collocated These selforganizing approaches need no data analysis or upfront parameter adjustments in a priori Lu et al studied k nearest neighbor join using MapReduce in which a data partitioning approach was designed to reduce both shufﬂing and computational costs In Lu’s study objects are divided into partitions using a Voronoi diagram with carefully selected pivots Then data partitions i.e Voronoi cells are clustered into groups only if distances between them are restricted by a speciﬁc bound In this way their approach can answer the k-nearest-neighbour join queries by simply checking object pairs within each group FIM for data-intensive applications over computing clusters has received a growing attention efﬁcient data partitioning strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of parallel FIM algorithms A MapReducebased Apriori algorithm is designed to incorporate a new dynamic partitioning and distributing data method to improve mining performance This method divides input data into relatively small splits to provide exibility for improved load-balance performance Moreover the master node doesn’t distribute all the data once rather the rest data are distributed based on dynamically changing workload and computing capability weight of each node Similarly Jumbo adopted a dynamic partition assignment technology enabling each task to process more than one partition Thus these partitions can be dynamically reassigned to different tasks to improve the load balancing performance of Pfp Uthayopas et al  investigated I/O and execution scheduling strategies to balance data processing load thereby enhancing the utilization of a multi-core cluster system supporting association-rule mining In order to pick a winning strategy in terms of data-blocks assignment Uthayopas et al incorporated three basic placement policies namely the round robin range and random placement Their approach ignores data characteristics during the course of mining association rules 8F URTHER D ISCUSSIONS In this study we investigated the data partitioning issues in parallel FIM We focused on MapReduce-based parallel FPtree algorithms in particular we studied how to partition and distribute a large dataset across data nodes of a Hadoop cluster to reduce network and computing loads We argue that the general idea of FiDoop-DP proposed in this study can be extended to other FIM algorithms like Apriori running on Hadoop clusters Apriori-based parallel FIM algorithms can be classiﬁed into two camps namely count distribution and data distribution  For the count distribution camp each node in a cluster calculates local support counts of all candidate itemsets Then the global support counts of the candidates are computed by exchanging the local support counts For the data distribution camp each node only keeps the support counts of a subset of all candidates Each node is responsible for delivering its local database partition to all the other processors to compute support counts In general the data distribution schemes have higher communication overhead than the count distribution ones whereas the data distribution schemes have lower synchronization overhead than its competitor Regardless of the count distribution or data distribution approaches the communication and synchronization cost induce adverse impacts on the performance of parallel mining algorithms The basic idea of Fidoop-DP—grouping highly relevant transactions into a partition allows the parallel algorithms to exploit correlations among transactions in database to cut communication and synchronization overhead among Hadoop nodes 9C ONCLUSIONS A ND F UTURE W ORK To mitigate high communication and reduce computing cost in MapReduce-based FIM algorithms we developed FiDoop-DP which exploits correlation among transactions to partition a large dataset across data nodes in a Hadoop cluster FiDoop-DP is able to 1 partition transactions with high similarity together and 2 group highly correlated frequent items into a list One of the salient features of FiDoopDP lies in its capability of lowering network trafﬁc and computing load through reducing the number of redundant transactions which are transmitted among Hadoop nodes FiDoop-DP applies the Voronoi diagram-based data partitioning technique to accomplish data partition in which LSH is incorporated to offer an analysis of correlation among transactions At the heart of FiDoop-DP is the second MapReduce job which 1 partitions a large database to form a complete dataset for item groups and 2 conducts FP-Growth processing in parallel on local partitions to generate all frequent patterns Our experimental results reveal that FiDoop-DP signiﬁcantly improves the FIM performance of the existing Pfp solution by up to 31 percent with an average of 18 percent We introduced in this study a similarity metric to facilitate data-aware partitioning As a future research direction we will apply this metric to investigate advanced loadbalancing strategies on a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster In one of our earlier studies see for details we addressed the data-placement issue in heterogeneous Hadoop clusters where data are placed across nodes in a way that each node has a balanced data processing load Our data placement scheme can balance the amount of data stored in heterogeneous nodes to achieve improved data-processing performance Such a scheme implemented at the level of Hadoop distributed le system HDFS is unaware of correlations among application data To further improve load balancing 112 IEEE
