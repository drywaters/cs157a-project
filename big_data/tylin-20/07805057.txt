en-US A novel Approach for mining frequent itemsets AprioriMin en-US  en-US Houda Essalmi, Mohamed El Far, Mohammed El Mohajir, Mohamed Chahhou en-US LIMS Laboratory, Faculty of Sciences Dhar Mahraz en-US Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University, Fez, Morocco en-US Essalmi.houda@gmail.com en-US  en-US Simohamed.elfar@gmail.com en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US Abstract T he step of mining frequent itemsets in database is the essential step and most expensive in the process of mining association rules in data mining task, many algorithms of mining frequent itemsets have been proposed to improve the performance of Apriori Algorithm In this paper we have introduced an optimization in the phase of generation pruning of candidates by a new strategy for the calculation of frequent itemsets based on approximate values of supports exact the itemsets We have evaluated our algorithm AprioriMin against three popular frequent itemsets mining algorithms - Apriori and FP growth, Close using two data sets with a variety of minimum support en-US Keywords  Frequent itemsets  Support  Pruning of candidates  Performance en-US I   I NTRODUCTION  en-US Association rules mining is one of the most important and well research-conducted techniques of Data Mining, with goal of discovering the relevant knowledge Association rules are used to identify relationships among a set of items in database trying to find interesting itemsets. An Itemset is frequent if the subsets in a collection of sets of items occur frequently The step of mining frequent itemsets in database is the essential step and most expensive in the process of mining association rules then the researchers concentrated in the generation of frequent itemsets which represent the main cost of treatment en-US Apriori Algorithm is the most classical algorithm for mining frequent itemsets proposed by Agrwal [1  ve rifyi ng  if  an itemsets is frequent. Any superset containing this itemsets can be frequent but the most criticized drawback of this algorithm is scanning the databases more times frequently Many variant algorithms are proposed to improve Apriori including DIC 2   Partit io n  3  and Sapling  T he se  algorithms have different techniques and is used for mining frequent itemsets. During the mining of frequent itemsets with Ap riori much frequent itemsets have the same support This observation that is exploited by the Algorithm Close [5  w hich  is based on the pruning of the closed itemsets lattice in order to find frequent itemsets. The FP-growth [6  f re quent patt ern growth was also the improvement of Apriori Algorithm which was employed to mine the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth without using generation of candidate item sets en-US Research works in the area of developing algorithms for mining frequent itemsets are several; the goal of which being to find interesting patterns from datasets W e can mention some works Bhandari et al 7  ha ve  ind ic at ed s ome weaknesses of Apriori Algorithm T he  main limitation is wasting time in holding vast number of candidate sets with much frequent itemsets and space for scanning the whole database Predrag and Savo 8  ha ve  sugg e ste d a  ne w procedure for large itemsets generation which is a modification of the Apriori Algorithm To implement it, they have used the structural pattern composite of a candidate hash tree. The authors in [9  ha ve  pro vid e d an e ff ic ie nt a naly sis of frequent pattern mining by comprehensive survey of some algorithms, which exist in literature for the mining of frequent patterns Additionally they have described a performance analysis of the approaches and algorithms for mining frequent pattern The researchers in  10   ha ve pr opose d a n a dapt ive implementation case study of Apriori Algorithm for a retail scenario in a cloud environment. It aims at resolving the time consuming problem for retail transactional databases by using the approach of mining the frequent itemsets en-US The algorithms of frequent itemsets proceed iteratively by level in each iteration. A  is  built and pruned later In this paper we present a novel approach for mining frequent itemsets based on approximate values of exact supports of the itemsets We call the new algorithm the AprioriMin Algorithm ; it's an improvement of Apriori Algorithm in the phase of generation pruning of the candidates en-US The rest of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents our approach of mining frequent itemsets The methodology of the proposed work is given in section 3.The empirical evaluations of our algorithm are described in section 4.Finally we will finish by a conclusion en-US II  APPROACH  OF  FREQUENT  ITEMSETS en-US The problem of mining frequent itemsets relies on global measures such as Support and requires an access to data processing  Many algorithms of mining frequent itemsets have been proposed in the literature These algorithms scan all itemsets iteratively and by levels at each level k a set of candidate Itemsets of size k is generated by joining frequent Itemsets discovered during the previous iteration However this step is very expensive due to the exponential size of the 978-1-5090-0751-6/16/$31.00 ©2016 IEEE 286 


en-US search space and the large number of scans of the entire database This scan is necessary to estimate the supports of itemsets en-US The principal basis of algorithms of mining frequent ite msets is iterative and consists of  repeating the following actions en-US Use \(k-1\-Itemsets to generate the k-itemsets candidates en-US Scan transactions to calculate Supports candidates en-US The generation phase of the candidates in the algorithms of search frequent itemsets decomposes into two sub-phases Construction the list of candidate itemsets and the pruning of  th  Our approach consists modifying the phase of the generation-pruning itemsets of Apriori Algorithm and it introduc es  a new method for generating candidate itemsets which is based on the concept of SupportMin en-US We know that a k-Itemsets Y cannot be frequent if least one of its subsets is not frequent. Thus, we notice that for a KItemsets Y, it is enough to identify k 1 subset of Y which has the smallest value of support to deduce if Y is frequent or not. This value represents the minimal value of support which can take K-Itemsets Y; we have called it SupportMin of the kItemset Y. Therefore, we have introduced a new technique for mining frequent itemsets based on the SupportMin  On the one hand we use this value  SupportMin in the pruning step of itemsets candidates to determine if a k-itemset cannot be frequent On the other hand we exploit the  SupportMin for mining frequent itemsets not based on the metric support that requires access to the database but on  SupportMin which gives an approximate value of the real Support which is deduced from the properties of Itemsets without access to the database en-US A  Techniques of SupportMin en-US Let D be a set of database of n transactions and hold as an example of D the 3- Itemset xyz Consider that  T xyz  all the transactions of D which contain the triplet of items \(x, z\ and Card \(T xyz the cardinality of the set T xyz  en-US Thus we have the Support of the 3-Itemset xyz: support \(xyz Card Txyz n. The 3-Itemset xyz has three subsets of size 2 xy xz yz either T xy  T xz   T yz  the D transaction sets containing these subsets with the respective cardinalities Card T xy Card \(T xz Card \(T yz nd the following Supports en-US Support xy Card T xy  Support xz Card T xz n Support \(yz\ = Card \(T yz  en-US The set  T xyz  is a subset of T xy   all instances of items containing the triplet x y and z contain necessarily the couple of items \(x, y en-US On the other hand all the transactions containing the couple of items x y   necessarily contain the items Z and thus  contain necessarily the triplet of items x y  and z\. Therefore ,Card\(T xyz  T xy and by association n positive\: Card\(T xyz   T xy and thus Support   en-US Consequently, we know that the support of the subset xy is  superior or equal to the support of the superset xyz support xyz  Support  xy  Similarly the subsets xz and yz the supports of xz and yz are superior or equal to the Support of the superset xyz en-US Both the 3-Itemset xyz and the 2-Itemsets xy xz yz are subset of xyz. They have the following relation s  en-US Support xyz  Support xy i Support xyz  Support xz ii Support xyz  Support yz iii en-US By i\\(ii\and \(iii\e deduce the following relationship Support xyz   Support xy Support xz Support yz  a.1 en-US This minimum represents the minimal value of support that the superset Y can get en-US We suggest calling this value SupportMin  Thus the SupportMin  of 3-itemset xyz is defined as follows SupportMin xyz  min Supp xy Supp XZ Supp yz a.2 en-US The SupportMin  Of a k-Itemset Y gives us an estimation of the value of the Support Itemset Y Its value is deduced from the minimum of its k-1 subsets found in the previous iteration and thus no access to the database is necessary for the calculation of this value en-US This notion of  SupportMin  is used for mining frequent itemsets particularly for generation-pruning phase of itemsets candidates To sum up from the already mentioned that a.1 and \(a.2\have got a relation \(a.3   en-US Support \(xyz SupportMin  \(xyz\     \(a.3 en-US By analyzing the relation a.3 it is obvious that if SupportMin  of  the 3-Itemset xyz is inferior than the threshold of Support minsup   then we can deduce that the support of xyz is inferior to minsup and consequently, the 3-Itemset xyz is not frequent   if  SupportMin    xyz  minsup then support xyz  minsup.   \(a.4 en-US According to the relation \(a.4\an Itemset X is not frequent if its SupportMin is inferior to  the threshold of support SupportMin  \(X minsup => support\(X   en-US The utility of  SupportMin   lies in the fact that the calculation of its value does not require access to data sources but can be simply deducted from the previous iteration and that  SupportMi n is used for pruning the candidates en-US However the calculation of  SupportMin   itemsets candidates is interesting only for Itemsets of size upper or equal to 3 \(3-Itemsets or more\- 1it emset has no subsets. - 2Itemsets have exactly two subsets of size 1 each 2-itemset candidate is generated from two frequent 1-itemsets and there is no need to use  SupportMin   for the pruning because necessarily the minimum of the supports of its subsets is greater or equal to minsup 978-1-5090-0751-6/16/$31.00 ©2016 IEEE 287 


en-US B  Calculation of Frequent K-Itemsets\(K 3  en-US Following the iterative principle of mining frequent itemsets algorithm, we generate Itemsets candidate of a level k and we calculate their values by SupportMin and we consider that a k-Itemsets is approximately frequent. If its  SupportMin is greater than the threshold of support exact When the calculation of  SupportMin of Itemsets of the level k is completed we eliminate Itemsets having  SupportMin lower than minsup \(pruning by the SupportMin  The Itemsets which are not eliminated are used to generate Itemset of the level k+1 en-US However the use of  Su pportMin for the search the frequent Itemsets generates certain non-frequent Itemsets as being frequent Itemsets because SupportMin gives an approximation of the real Support of Itemset A validation phase is necessary to calculate the exact Supports of frequent itemsets and to eliminate the Itemsets which are not frequent that occur in  the pruning phase Two cases occur when the Support Min is superior to minsup  Case 1 : Minsup Support \(Y SupportMin  Y en-US The Y itemset is frequent; therefore it must calculate its exact support that will be used for the generation of association rules   Case 2 : Support \(Y Minsup SupportMin  Y en-US The itemset Y is not frequent, but it is generated; and it must be eliminated from all frequent itemsets en-US At the end of calculation of all the frequent k-Itemsets by using SupportMin , a validation phase is performed. Thus, one scan of the database is needed to refine all the set of frequent itemsets calculated In this case the number of accesses to data sources is reduced en-US III  METHODOLOGY en-US Frequent Item sets are generated using the proposed Algorithm AprioriMin The methodology of the proposed work is given in fig 1  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US Fig 1.

Mining Frequent Itemsets for the given datasets en-US IV  EXPERIMENTAL  EVALUATION en-US To evaluate the performance of AprioriMin we have taken two sets of data T10I4D100K and T25I10D10K\.These data sets have downloaded from 11 12  T he  c ha r a c t e r i s t i c s of  s e l e c te d da t a  s e t s  a r e  s ho w n  in the table 1  en-US TABLE I  DATA  CHARACTERISTICS en-US Datasets  en-US Items  en-US Transaction  en-US T10I4D100K  en-US 10  en-US 100,000  en-US T25I10D10k  en-US 25  en-US 9,219  en-US  en-US The result is performed using Intel\256 Core\(TM i7 CPU wi th the speed of 2.80GHZ with 4G of RAM running Windows 7.

en-US The computation speed of AprioriMin with other Algorithms Apriori FP growth and Close Algorithms are shown in the above chart, it shows the running time of the four algorithms on T10I4D100K and T25I10D10k  data with different minimum support represented by percentage of the total transactions A look at the charts reveals the higher execution speed of AprioriMin stands stark contrast with other algorithms Apriori Algorithm runs in general faster than Close with some exceptions at some minimum support The running time of Apriori algorithm is better than FP-growth as well While AprioriMin is better than Apriori AprioriMin Algorithm runs almost two times faster than FP-growth and Close  onsider that we have a threshold of support minimized two graphs figure 4 an d figure 5 below are employed to display the performance comparison en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  en-US  Fig 4.

Frequent itemsets mining performance for T25I10D10k data \(2 en-US  en-US Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the performance of the algorithms on each of the data sets T10I4D100K and T25I10D10k for varying minimal support thresholds For very low support thresholds FP-growth clearly outperforms all other algorithms. On the other hand, Apriori runs extremely sl ow  Under small minimum support FP-growth runs faster than AprioriMin but under large minimum support, FP-growth runs slower than AprioriMin. Another remarkable result is that AprioriMin performs better than Close and Apriori for the 2 data sets. Finally, we conducted an experiment to evaluate the frequent itemsets mining performance of the four algorithms As the figures shown, our AprioriMin exhibited the best in run time while the other algorithms are the least performant when we have a large minimum support en-US V  CONCLUSIONS en-US A variety of efficient Apriori Algorithm exists for mining frequent itemsets. This paper presents a new algorithm named AprioriMin Algorithm which mines the frequent itemsets This algorithm aims at introducing a new strategy for the cal culation of frequent itemsets to prune phase of frequent itemsets This technique decreases the execution time when the support threshold increases for AprioriMin Algorithm Apriori and Close algorithms take more time via comparison with AprioriMin and FP-growth algorithms for the same datasets when the support threshold decreases en-US  en-US R EFERENCES  en-US  1  Agrawal R  Srikant R 1994 September Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

Two phase algorithm does not save the utility of the itemset computed but the FHM and HUI miner computes and saves the utility of each itemset and the values are discarded after the computation of high utility itemsets. These calcul ated values can be stored for the computation of high utility ite msets whenever there is an insertion and modification in the database thereby decreasing the repetitive computation. Future research can be carried by utilizing the computed utility of itemset in insertion and modification transaction database.

LI et al  PRIVACY-PRESERVING-OUTSOURCED ASSOCIATION RULE MINING ON VERTICALLY PARTITIONED DATABASES 1859 the publication of this seminal work a number of privacypreserving association rule mining or frequent itemset mining solutions have been published in the literature see 11   1 3   28]Ð[31 The most relevant work is the privacy-preserving association rule mining solution presented in I n t hi s s ol ut i on a d at a owner known as the master is responsible for the mining The other data owners known as slaves insert ctitious transactions to their respectiv e datasets and send the datasets to the master Each data owner will also send his set of real transactions IDs to a semi-trusted third-party server The third-party server is assumed not to be colluding with any data owner but it cannot be trusted to hold the raw data The master generates association rule candidates from the joint database containing ctitious data For each rule candidate X  Y  the master sends the ID lists of the transactions containing X  Y and the transactions containing X to the third-party server The server veriÞes if the rule is qualiÞed or not Similar to our solutions a semi-trusted third-party is utilized for the mining However unlike our solutions a data owner i.e the master does the majority of the computational work Therefore we can hardly say that such a solution is an outsourced mining solution Though ctitious data are added in datasets to lower data usability the master is able to learn signiÞcant information about other data owners raw data from the received datasets In cont rast our solutions do not leak such information as we do not rely on one particular data owner to undertake the computations and we also encrypt the datasets All existing solutions with the exception of  d o not utilize a third-party server to server to compute the mining result Some solutions  13 us e a s y mmet r i c encryption to compute the supports of itemsets while other solutions 28]Ð[30 us e a s ecure s cal ar product p rot o col  a s et intersection cardinality protocol or a secret sharing scheme to perform these computations A majority of these solutions expose exact supports to all data owners resulting in the leakage of information about the data owners raw data  The only exception is one of s s o l u t i ons  I n  13 t here are two privacy-preserving solutions for frequent itemset mining The rst solution exposes exact supports which is not desirable The second solution does not expose exact supports However association rules cannot be mined based on the result of second solution because conÞdences cannot be computed without the exact supports In addition this solutionÕs method cannot be used to mine association rules because securely computing conÞdence is more complicated than computing support In comparison with this solution our frequent itemset mining solutionÕs computational complexity is signiÞcantly lower Our solutions do not expose exact supports or conÞdences to data owners Different from existing solutions based on homomorphic encryption we use symmetric homomorphic encryption instead of asymmetric homomorphic encryption and the manner in which we use homomorphic encryption also differs from existing solutions In our approach we use homomorphic encryption to create ERVs and build our secure outsourced comparison scheme B Privacy-Preserving Outsour ced Association Rule Mining and Frequent Itemset Mining Privacy-preserving outsourced frequent itemset mining and association rule mining have been studied in the setting of a single data owner  19]Ð[21 I n e xi s t i n g s ol ut i ons  the data owner outsources thei r data and the mining task to the cloud but at the same time wish to keep the raw data secret from the cloud Generally data items in the database are encrypted using a substitution cipher prior to outsourcing Reference  propos ed a s ol ut i o n t o c ount er frequency analysis attack on substitution cipher However a later work demons t r at ed t h at 19 s s o l u t i o n i s not s ecure Giannotti et al proposed a solution based on k anonymity frequency   21 T o c ount er frequenc y a nal y s i s a t t ack the data owner inserts ctitious transactions in the encrypted database to conceal the item frequency After inserting the ctitious transactions any item in the encrypted database will share the same frequency with at least k  1 other items The data owner sends the encrypted database of both the real and ctitious transactions to the cloud The cloud runs a classic frequent itemset mining algorithm and returns the result frequent itemsets and their supports to the data owner The data owner revises these itemsets supports by subtracting them with these itemsets corresponding occurrence counts in the ctitious transactions respectively Finally the data owner decrypts the received itemsets with the revised supports higher than the frequency threshold an d generates association rules based on found frequent itemsets Our solutions use their techniques to conceal the raw data from the cloud and mitigate frequency analysis attack that can be undertaken by the cloud Using these techniques alone however is not sufÞcient to protect data privacy in the vertically partitioned database setting To cancel out ctitious transactions both 21 an d  1 6  require the data owner to count itemset occurrences in ctitious transactions In the vertically partitioned database setting data owners are unable to perform such calculation using the techniques described in and  16 I n our s o l u t i ons  the cloud rather than the data owners cancels out ctitious transactions in a privacy-preserving manner and the underlying techniques are our homomorphic encryption secure comparison and ciphertext tag schemes Another recent work  propos ed a p ri v a c y pres e rving outsourced association rule mining solution based on predicate encryption This solution is resilient to chosen-plaintext attacks on encrypted items but it is vulnerable to frequency analysis attacks Applying this solution to vertically partitioned databases will also result in the leakage of the exact supports to data owners In this paper our adversary model is different We assume the cloud has knowledge of the item frequencies instead of chosen plaintext-ciphertext pairs and our solutions are resilient to frequency analysis attacks C Other Related Work Other than the settings of vertically partitioned databases and cloud/third-party-aided mining privacy-preserving frequent itemset mining and association rule mining have

ferent i a l privacy  T hes e s e t t i ngs are b e yond t h e s cope of t h i s paper  IX C ONCLUDING R EMARKS In this paper we proposed a privacy-preserving outsourced frequent itemset mining solution for vertically partitioned databases This allows the data owners to outsource mining task on their joint data in a privacy-preserving manner privacypreserving manner Based on this solution we built a privacypreserving outsourced association rule partitioned databases Our solutions protect data ownerÕs raw data from other data owners and the cloud Our solutions also ensure the privacy of the mining results from the cloud Compared with most existing solutions our solutions leak less information about the data owners raw data Our evaluation has also demonstrated that our solutions are very efÞci ent therefore our solutions are suitable to be used by data owners wishing to outsource their databases to the cloud but require a high level of privacy without compromising on performance To realize our solutions an efÞcient homomorphic encryption scheme and a secure outsourced comparison scheme were presented in this paper Both schemes have potential usage in other secure computation applications such as secure data aggregation beyond the data mining solutions described in this paper Demonstrating the u tility of the p roposed homomorphic encryption scheme and outsourced comparison scheme in other settings will be the focus of future research A PPENDIX I NSERTING F ICTITIOUS T RANSACTIONS  s A LGORITHM  An algorithm to counter frequency analysis attacks on the outsourced database encrypted with a substitution cipher was proposed in F or the purpos e o f c oncealing t he item frequency this algorithm inserts ctitious transactions in the database to be oursourced The goal is to ensure that each item share the same frequency with at least k  1 items The algorithm is summarized as follows also see  Firstly the data owner scans the database to count each individual itemÕs support  Secondly the data owner groups items considering the supports and co-occurrence of items The data owner sorts items in decreasing order of support Starting from the rst of the sorted item list i.e the item with the highest support the data owner assigns every k adjacent items to a new created group If there are less than k unassigned items remaining these items will be assigned to the last created group The data owner swaps items from different groups to ensure that all items in the same group do not occur together in the same transaction  Thirdly for each item in each group the data owner calculates the difference between the itemÕs support and the highest support in the group The difference is deÞned as the noise of the item  Fourthly to achieve k anonymity frequency the data owner generates ctitious transactions based on the result of the third step The number of an itemÕs occurrences in the ctitious transactions is equal to its noise calculated in the third step After inserting the ctitious transactions all items in the same group share the same support A CKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank Quach Vinh Thanh the Associate
