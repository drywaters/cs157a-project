Most of the recent proposed algorithms focussed on parallelizing the workload using large number of machine in distributed computational environment like MapReduce framework A few of them are actually capable to determine the appropriate number of required computing computers considering workload balancing and execution efficiency But internally not capable to determine exact number of required iteration for any large size datasets in advance to find out the frequent item-set based on iterative sampling. In this paper, we propose an improved and compact algorithm \(ICA\for finding frequent item-set in minimal time using distributed computational environment It is also capable of determining the exact number of internal iteration required for any large size datasets whether data is in structured or unstructured format Ke ywords Frequent Item-set Mining Big Data MapReduce Distributed Computational Environment  I  INTRODUCTION en-IN Frequent item-set mining is one of the most important techniques to find out frequent item-sets in data mining 1  Industries use the extracted frequent item-sets in decision making or setting policies For example a retail-sector company is interested to know customer buying habits in particular area to sell out their product. Here, frequent itemse t mining helps the company to know customer buying habits On the other hand even government of nations use the frequent item-set technique to extract useful information that further help to provide better services to people Frequent item-set mining is the part of frequent pattern  mining where frequent pattern represents those subsequences and sub-graphs which are occurred many times frequently in a given data sets. Traditional data mining tools fails to extract frequent item-sets when the size of transactional database is too large to compute In Big Data era, we need a new approach to compute frequent item-sets where data-sets consist of millions of records  Researchers proposed various approach to deal with Big Data challenges but all these approaches suffers from synchronization work load balancing and fault-tolerance problem [3  To ove rco m e this prob le m  Ma pRed uce m od e l  come into existence originally proposed by Google   This MapReduce model supports parallelization of tasks under Hadoop architecture   To scale frequent item-sets mining to large size data sets we propose an Improved and Compact ICA algorithm This algorithm supports parallelization and can be implemented on Hadoop architecture using MapReduce programming model. The working of this algorithm includes breaking of large size data-sets into manageable data chunks which are executed on the different machines in distributed computational environment The concept of sampling the whole data sets into manageable data chunks reduces the space complexity because it is easier to compute small data set effectively at single node instead of loading and scanning or computing the whole data set at once and also reduces the time complexity by supporting parallelization of tasks and sub-tasks execution Mapper function on each individual node or machine receives these data chunks and generates the output in accordance with local minimum support Further reducer function aggregates all the values and eliminates those values which  do not support the global minimum threshold or support before generating the final set of frequent item-sets as an output

Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper  II   BACKGROUND STUDY A.  Apache Hadoop and its Key Features Hadoop is an open source software framework used to develop data processing applications which are executed in a distributed computing environment where large data sets are distributed across clusters of commodity nodes or computers Some key features of Hadoop are given as follows  en-IN  Suitable for Big Data Analysis using less network bandwidth en-IN  Hadoop platform provides scalability means Hadoop clusters can be scaled to any extent by adding additional cluster nodes with ease en-IN  Fault Tolerance that makes the whole system reliable en-IN  B.  Components of Hadoop Apache Hadoop includes the various components such as Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS MapReduce HBASE HCatalog Pig Hive Oozie ZooKeeper Kafka and Mahout. The core parts of Hadoop platform are \(HDFS and MapReduce. \(i\HDFS: In Hadoop, HDFS provide large data storing capacity, which is used by compiled version of program written in a high level computer language 6  HDFS takes care of stored data by creating multiple copies of the data blocks and increases the reliability by distributing them on various nodes in a cluster ii MapReduce MapReduce is a computational model for coding the applications which are executed on Hadoop platform 7  To handle data effectively at large scale MapReduce programs are designed to run in parallel on large clusters of computation nodes in a distributed computational environment C.   MapReduce as a Programming Model en-IN MapReduce programming model comes under generic processing model that used to address the general application problems  MapReduce programs can be seen in two phases, Map phase and Reduce phase which consist of Map function and Reduce function respectively and input to each function are key-value pairs Fig 1 shows the logical data flow in MapReduce First data are loaded into HDFS in blocks and then distributed to the data nodes by input split method  Inpu t data pa sses from  var iou s  ste ps  befo r e generating final output which is summarised as follows  1\Input Splits: Input to a MapReduce job divides fixed size pieces named as input splits which is consumed by a single map  2 Mapping In this process data in each split is delivered to mapping function to generate output values   3 Shuffling  After consumption of output values of mapping phase it consolidates the relevant records from Mapping phase to output values  4 Reducing This phase aggregates values from Shuffling phase and generate a single output value Final output or result values are stored in HDFS and this result is replicated to the configuration Users read the result from the HDFS. Advantages of MapReduce are as follows: \(i\It Reduces network communication cost by supporting data locality  ii It supports scalability that enables it to adjust resources dynamically during job execution iii It is also capable enough to handle failure at execution time having fault tolerance strategy in distributed computational environment. Furthermore, it also capable to handle data for heterogeneous system means it is possible to analyse data stored at different nodes using MapRedue programm ing model Fig 1 is given to show the logical data-flow in MapReduce programming model en-IN  Fig. 1. Logical data-flow in MapReduce programming model  III  METHODOLOGY en-IN    We propose an improved and compact \(ICA\ algorithm that mainly targets to extract frequent item-sets. In general the complexity of algorithm to find the frequent item-set is

As a solution of this problem, ICA divides the whole records into sample records and extracts item-sets  The new complexity is given as: O\(\(yN 1 b\yN     The proposed ICA Mapper algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1   Input  Set of Transactions D Other intermediates or values        MapperClass do  extends Mapper<Object, Text, Text, IntWritable IntWritable one = new IntWritable\(1 Text word = new Text while \(count <nitem\ { count=count+1 for \(i=0;i<\(list.size\(\-1\i items = new StringTokenizer\(list.get\(i for I 1 to T do   without replacement Perform frequent item set extraction on      selected ones to X   A.  Evaluate Method  To filter out non-informative item-sets we implement two methods having name Mapper and Reducer as given in algorithm 1 and 2 Mapper method performs nothing but sends all local frequent patterns whereas Reducer aggregates all the local frequent item-sets and calculates their frequency in terms of whole data sets. For those that fail to reach the global supporting threshold, Reducer prune s them and keeps the rest ones as the final output en-IN   en-IN The proposed ICA Reducer algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 2   Reducer class do  Reduce \(Text key, Iterable<IntWritable> values Context context\ws IOException, InterruptedException int sum = 0 for \(IntWritableval : values\{ sum += val.get   result.set\(sum if sum> a context.write\(key, result    The proposed ICA algorithm having iterative sampling method replaces the one pass algorithm which finds outs all frequent item-sets at once This algorithm can be implemented in parallel using MapReduce model because each iteration process is independent in it B  Or ganisation of Work MapReduce programming model works on Hadoop platform where job is divided into tasks Mainly there are two types of tasks named as Map task which has the responsibility of splitting and mapping of data and Reduce tasks which is responsible for shuffling and reducing of data There are two types of entities which controls the complete execution of Map tasks and Reduce task named as en-IN  Job-tracker it is responsible for complete execution of submitted job and acts like a master 9  en-IN  Multiple Task Trakers they are responsible for performing the job for each and every job assigned for execution in the system A job-tracker is present in Namenode and a number of task-trackers reside on Datanode [10   en-IN  en-IN Hadoop architecture divides the job into number of tasks which runs on multiple Datanodes in distributed environment. Job-tracker coordinates the different  activities by managing and scheduling different tasks to execute on data nodes. Further, executions of these individual tasks are 


 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation \(ICCCA2016   16   en-IN managed by task-tracker which resides on each and every Datanode In addition Job-tracker receives the progress report to task-trackers. Apart from that, task-tracker has the  tracker to notify him of current state of the system Hence job-tracker keeps status of overall progress of each job In case of task failure, job-tracker reschedules the jobs or tasks on different task-tracker  IV IMPLEMENTATION A.  Data Sets Synthetic retail data-sets are used here that is originally generated by using synthetic IBM data generator B.  Experiment en-IN ICA algorithm is implemented using MapReduce model to evaluate its performance with parallel processes This experiment is performed on Hadoop version 2.6 using MapReduce programming model that supports the parallelization Tableau tool is used here to visualize the output of frequent item-sets mining originally resides in the Hadoop file Distributed System \(HDFS\Whole experiment is performed using 4 Giga Bytes internal RAM and Core 2 Duo processor. First and foremost it is important to code the whole algorithm in terms of map and reduce function  These two functions take the input in key-value pairs and also produced the output in key-value terms 12  A jar file which consisting of three class file named as Mapper class Reducer class and Main class is executed on MapReduce model which supports the fault-tolerance under the hood of Hadoop architecture Apart from that input file transactional data set\is stored in Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS\which is responsible for making replica of the original data HDFS is also responsible to divide the whole datasets into manageable data chucks sample data sets and send them to others nodes in distributed computational environment 13  Each and every nodes consisting of Mapper receive the data chunks or sample data in terms of key value Here Mapper reads the input in accordance with local minimum support and assigned value 1 after tokenization to the keyword that occurs first time Mapper function generates the output in terms of k ey value on each and every node. These Mapper output is passed to combiner function where shuffle sort is used to shuffle all the key-values A new key-value form is generated after combining the values and these values is further aggregated by reducer function Reducer also checks the occurring frequency of each and individual item-sets to the global minimum support values If the occurring frequency of an item-sets is equal to or greater than the global minimum support item-set with its occurring frequency is sent to HDFS \(storage unit\otherwise it is eliminated. This method of pruning is repeated with each and every data-sets and final result is stored in HDFS. It is also important to know final output is generated only when all the reducer which are running on different nodes are completed their respective jobs. Frequent 1-itemsets L 1 is finally obtained by merging the output of all reducers To generate frequent k-item-sets L k each Mapper reads frequent item-sets L k-1 from previous iteration and produces candidate item-sets C k  from L k-1  A candidate item-set in C k  is chosen as key and assigned a value 1 if it is present in the transaction assigned to the Mapper. Consequently, now we get \(key, value\pair where key is k item-sets and value is 1 and all the remaining procedures are the same as generation of L 1    C.  Experimental Result and Analysis  en-IN We have implemented ICA algorithm to find frequent item-sets on Hadoop architecture \(version 2.6\ using Ubunt u Linux\operating system. In Hadoop architecture both input data as well as output data is stored in HDFS Hence final   that has the basic functionality to copy a file from HDFS to local file system 14  For visualization purpose Tableau tool is used here and various outputs with different graphica l interface is given from fig 2 to 5 All these output are generated using different set of retail database as an input with minimum support threshold Fig 2 shows the occurrence frequency of data set along x-axis under the parameter F2 and various transactional item-sets along the y-axis under the parameter F1 All the output records are generated only after surpassing the minimum support threshold value that is 7 and already set in algorithm. On the other hand records which do not satisfy the minimum threshold value are discarded from the record by reducer function before generating the final output. Therefore all the final data-set which are present in final record have the value 1 under the title number of records and given in fig. 2 along with parameter F2 Fig 3 visualize the number of frequent item-sets which support the minimum threshold value and saved in HDFS as a final  individual record that is reflected by value 1 along the y-axis It is also possible to visualize the output record with another angle as shown by fig 4 All the parameters meaning for fig 4 is same as described for fig. 2  Fig. 5 shows the total number of input  th ousand and parameter F1 and F2 both have the same  meaning as discussed, before. For example a horizontal  dark  line in between 600k and 800k is showing the three different item-sets under the parameter F1 and occurrence frequency of these item-sets together is 64 as reflected by parameter

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE ENHANCEMENT In this paper w e have proposed ICA algorithm to handle two big data issues in frequent item-sets mining 1 Efficiency large size of data restricts exhaustive search or complex data structures from practical use 2 Space Complexity the massive intermediate and outputted itemsets bring outof memory or data overflow problems for many stateof art approaches We have validated and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach on transactional data-set under Hadoop architecture  Future enhancement can be carried out in two dimensions to enhance the performance of ICA algorithm. One dimension leads to  modification in joining and pruning steps of existing algorithm to enable it to support pipelining or use of alternative ICA like algorithms which are free from the problem of multiple times scanning of  database Second dimension of enhancement leads to use of advanced  MapReduce framework such as  i 2 MapReduce model which supports incremental problem based algorithm to enhance the overall throughput of system  REFERENCES 1  C Borgelt Frequent item set mining Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery vol. 2, pp. 437-456 2012  2  P Zikopoulos and C Eaton Understanding big data Analytics for enterprise class hadoop and streaming data  McGraw-Hill Osborne Media, 2011 3  J Manyika  et al  Big data The next frontier for innovation competition, and productivity," 2011 4  J Xie  et al  Improving mapreduce performance through data placement in heterogeneous hadoop clusters in Parallel  Distributed Processing, Workshops and Phd Forum \(IPDPSW\ 2010 IEEE International Symposium on 2010, pp. 19  5  A Thusoo  et al  Hive-a petabyte scale data warehouse using hadoop," in Data Engineering \(ICDE\, 2010 IEEE 26th International Conference on 2010, pp. 996-1005 6  T White Hadoop The definitive guide   O'Reilly Media Inc 2012  7  J J.

iteration 3 and iteration 4 respectively. From results we can easily find out different possible cliques. An itemset of size 3 is frequent only if its all three nodes having an edge between them and an itemset of size 4 will be frequent if all four nodes have an edge between each other and so on. Therefore, max cliques possible for a set of nodes can be classified as a community. For example, graph 1 have 2 communities ABCD and EFG A large dataset of BMS web n al yzed by usi n g Flink based Apriori to find communities \(Figure 10 dataset contain many months click-stream data from two famous e-commerce web sites. Each transaction of these datasets is a web session consisting of all the products detail pages viewed in that particular session. Here every product page can be seen as a node of graph and a community will represent products pages which are traversed together. Flink based Apriori takes few minutes to analyze such a huge dataset with 77,532 transactions. The 2nd iteration is one of the most time and space consum ing iteration for distributed Apriori algorithm due to generation of a huge candidate set for singletone frequent items. For example, for 10 4 frequent singletons, it will generate nearly 10 8 candidate pairs. To map such a huge number of candidate pairs for every transaction is very time consuming. To gain further insite, it will be interesting to explore more datasets  VI  C ONCLUSION  A Flink based distributed Apriori is implemented to mine frequent patterns from huge graphs and large datasets. It uses basic Apriori theorem that an itemset is frequent only if all its non-empty sunset are frequent It is implemented on Apache Flink platform which provides it highly parallel and distributed computing environmen t. Flink is best suited for Apriori because Apache Flink ha ve native support for iterative computation and Apriori is iterative algorithm. Flink's pipelined architecture allow us to start a new iteration of Apriori as soon as partial results of earlier iteration are present. Delta iteration functionality of Flink makes Apriori highly parallel and effective algorithm for huge datasets Apriori is used to find co mmunities in huge graphs. In Summary, we have presented an implementation of Apriori on Flink and tested it with different datasets. We showed that Flink based Apriori is capable of handling huge graphs and large transactional datasets easily R EFERENCES  1  Anna L. Buczak and Christopher M.

    Fig. 8. Comparative Analysis Classification Algorithms V  CONCLUSION Associative Classification techniques are used to make better decision in critical situations. The proposed associative classification called as Classification of microarray gene expression data using associative classification and gene expression intervals used to clas sify the gene expression with gene intervals in affected gene expression. The experimental results are carried out by using the gene expression of breast cancer. The associative classification on gene expression data obtained the best prediction and accuracy of the classification result. The proposed algorithm was tested with two class and multi class data sets. The classification algorithm was compared with the classical classification algorithms such as Linear Discriminant Analysis, SVM, and Decision Tree. After the comparison of traditional classification algorithms, as per the view of possible error rates the Associative Classification algorithm is best for biological data. The results of this work are used to drug designer for cancer diseases. The proposed algorithm works on gene expression data. In future, it will be implemented on hadoop and big data mining for biological data VI  R EFERENCES  1   Morgan Kaufmann Publishers Elsevier 2002 2   Second Edition PicasetOy Helsinki, 2005 3  Nagata, K., Washio, T., Kawahara, Y. and Unami, A  prediction from toxicogenomic data based on class association rule  ELSEVIER journal Toxicology Reports, vol.41, no.10 pp. 1133-1142, 2014 4  Garcia, S., Luengo, J., S·ez, J.

on items contained in each item group When the number of pivots increases the entire database is split into a ner granularity and the number of partitions increase correspondingly Such a ne granularity leads to a reduction in distance computation among transactions On the other hand when the pivot number k continues growing the number of transactions mapped into one hash bucket signiﬁcantly increases thereby leading to a large candidate-object set and high shufﬂing cost see Figs 3b and 3c Consequently the overall execution time is optimized when k is 60 for both algorithms see Fig 3a 6.2 Minimum Support Recall that minimum support plays an important role in mining frequent itemsets We increase minimum support thresholds from 0.0005 to 0.0025 percent with an increment of 0.0005 percent to evaluate the impact of minimum support on FiDoop-DP The other parameters are the same as those for the previous experiments Fig 4a shows that the execution times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp decrease when the minimum support is increasing Intuitively a small minimum support leads to an increasing number of frequent 1-itemsets and transactions which have to be scanned and transmitted Table 2 illustrates the size of frequent 1-itemsets stored in FList and the number of nal output records of the two parallel solutions under various minimum-support values Fig 4a reveals that regardless of the minimum-support value FiDoop-DP is superior to Pfp in terms of running time Two reasons make this performance trend expected First FiDoop-DP optimizes the partitioning process by placing transactions with a high similarity into one group rather than randomly and evenly grouping the transaction Fig 4b conﬁrms that FiDoop-DP’s shufﬂing cost is signiﬁcantly lower than that of Pfp thanks to optimal data partitions offered by FiDoop-DP Second this grouping strategy in FiDoop-DP minimizes the number of transactions for each GList under the premise of data completeness which leads to reducing mining load for each Reducer The grouping strategy of FiDoop-DP introduces computing overhead including signature-matrix calculation and hashing each band into a bucket Nevertheless such small overhead is offset by the performance gains in the shufﬂing and reduce phases Fig 4a also shows that the performance improvement of FiDoop-DP over Pfp is widened when the minimum support increases This performance gap between FiDoop-DP and Pfp is reasonable because pushing minimum support up in FiDoop-DP lters out an increased number of frequent 1-itemsets which in turn shortens the transaction partitioning cost Small transactions simplify the correlation analysis among the transactions thus small transactions are less likely to have a large number of duplications in their partitions As a result the number of duplicated transactions to be transmitted among the partitions is signiﬁcantly reduced which allows FiDoop-DP to deliver better performance than Pfp 6.3 Data Characteristic In this group of experiments we respectively evaluate the impact of dimensionality and data correlation on the performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp by changing the parameters in the process of generating the datasets using the IBM Quest Market-Basket Synthetic Data Generator 6.3.1 Dimensionality The average transaction length directly determines the dimensions of a test data We conﬁgure the average transaction length to 10 40 60 and 85 to generate T10I4D 130 blocks T40I10D 128 blocks T60I10D 135 blocks T85I10D 133 blocks datasets respectively In this experiment we measure the impacts of dimensions on the performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp on the 8-node Hadoop cluster The experimental results plotted in Fig 5a clearly indicate that an increasing number of dimensions signiﬁcantly raises the running times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp This is because increasing the number of dimensions increases the number of groups thus the amount of data transmission sharply goes up as seen in Fig 5b The performance improvements of FiDoop-DP over Pfp is diminishing when the dimensionality increases from 10 to 85 For example FiDoop-DP offers an improvement of 29.4 percent when the dimensionality is set to 10 the improvement drops to 5.2 percent when the number of dimensions becomes 85 In what follows we argue that FiDoop-DP is inherently losing the power of reducing the number of redundant transactions in high-dimensional data When a dataset has a low dimensionality FiDoop-DP tends to build partitions Fig 4 Impact of minimum support on FiDoop-DP and Pfp TABLE 2 The Size of FList and the Number of Final Output Records Under Various Minimum-Support Values minsupport 0.0005 0.001 0.0015 0.002 0.0025 FList 14.69k 11.6k 9.71k 6.89k 5.51k OutRecords 745 588 465 348 278 XUN ET AL FIDOOP-DP DATA PARTITIONING IN FREQUENT ITEMSET MINING ON HADOOP CLUSTERS 109 


each of which has distinct characteristics compared with the other partitions Such distinct features among the partitions allow FiDoop-DP to efﬁciently reduce the number of redundant transactions In contrast a dataset with high dimensionality has a long average transaction length therefore data partitions produced by FiDoop-DP have no distinct discrepancy Redundant transactions are likely to be formed for partitions that lack distinct characteristics Consequently the beneﬁt offered by FiDoop-DP for highdimensional datasets becomes insigniﬁcant 6.3.2 Data Correlation We set the correlation among transactions i.e corr to 0.15 0.25 0.35 0.45 0.55 0.65 and 0.75 to measure the impacts of data correlation on the performance of the two algorithms on the 8-node Hadoop cluster The Number of Pivots is set to 60 see also Section 6.1 The experimental results plotted in Fig 5c clearly indicate that FiDoop-DP is more sensitive to data correlation than Pfp This performance trend motivates us to investigate the correlation-related data partition strategy Pfp conducts default data partition based on equal-size item group without taking into account the characteristics of the datasets However FiDoop-DP judiciously groups items with high correlation into one group and clustering similar transactions together In this way the number of redundant transactions kept on multiple nodes is substantially reduced Consequently FiDoop-DP is conducive to cutting back both data transmission trafﬁc and computing load As can be seen from Fig 5c there is an optimum balance point for data correlation degree to tune FiDoop-DP performance e.g 0.35 in Fig 5c If data correlation is too small Fidoop-DP will degenerate into random partition schema On the contrary it is difﬁcult to divide items into relatively independent groups when data correlation is high meaning that an excessive number of duplicated transactions have to be transferred to multiple nodes Thus a high data correlation leads to redundant transactions formed for partitions thereby increasing network and computing loads 6.4 Speedup Now we are positioned to evaluate the speedup performance of FiDoop-DP and Pfp by increasing the number of data nodes in our Hadoop cluster from 4 to 24 The T40I10D 128 blocks dataset is applied to drive the speedup analysis of the these algorithms Fig 6 reveals the speedups of FiDoop-DP a nd Pfp as a function of the number of data nodes The experimental results illustrated in Fig 6a show that the speedups of FiDoop-DP and Pfp linearly scale up with the increasing number of data nodes Such a speedup trend can be attributed to the fact that increasing the number of data nodes under a xed input data size inevitably 1 reduces the amount of itemsets being handled by each node and 2 increases communication overhead among mappers and reducers Fig 6a shows that FiDoop-DP is better than Pfp in terms of the speedup efﬁciency For instance the FiDoop-DP improves the speedup efﬁciency of Pfp by up to 11.2 percent with an average of 6.1 percent This trend suggests FiDoopDP improves the speedup efﬁciency of Pfp in large-scale The speedup efﬁciencies drop when the Hadoop cluster scales up For example the speedup efﬁciencies of FiDoopDP and Pfp on the 4-node cluster are 0.970 and 0.995 respectively These two speedup efﬁciencies become 0.746 and 0.800 on the 24-node cluster Such a speedup-efﬁciency trend is driven by the cost of shufﬂing intermediate results which sharply goes up when the number of data nodes scales up Although the overall computing capacity is improved by increasing the number of nodes the cost of synchronization and communication among data nodes tends to offset the gain in computing capacity For example the results plotted in Fig 6b conﬁrm that the shufﬂing cost Fig 5 Impacts of data characteristics on FiDoop-DP and Pfp Fig 6 The speedup performance and shufﬂing cost of FiDoop-DP and Pfp 110 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEMS VOL 28 NO 1 JANUARY 2017 


is linearly increasing when computing nodes are scaled from 4 to 24 Furthermore the shufﬂing cost of Pfp is larger than that of FiDoop-DP 6.5 Scalability In this group of experiments we evaluate the scalability of FiDoop-DP and Pfp when the size of input dataset dramatically grows Fig 7 shows the running times of the algorithms when we scale up the size of the T40I10D data series Figs 7a and 7b demonstrate the performance of FiDoop-DP processing various datasets on 8-node and 24-node clusters respectively Fig 7 clearly reveals that the overall execution times of FiDoop-DP and Pfp go up when the input data size is sharply enlarged The parallel mining process is slowed down by the excessive data amount that has to be scanned twice The increased dataset size leads to long scanning time Interestingly FiDoop-DP exhibits a better scalability than Pfp Recall that see also from Algorithm 1 the second MapReduce job compresses an initial transaction database into a signature matrix which is dealt by the subsequent process The compress ratio is high when the input data size is large thereby shortening the subsequent processing time Furthermore Fidoop-DP lowers the network trafﬁc induced by the random grouping strategy in Pfp In summary the scalability of FiDoop-DP is higher than that of Pfp when it comes to parallel mining of an enormous amount of data 7R ELATED W ORK 7.1 Data Partitioning in MapReduce Partitioning in databases has been widely studied for both single system servers e.g and distributed storage systems e.g BigTable PNUTS[31 The existing approaches typically produce possible ranges or hash partitions which are then evaluated using heuristics and cost models These schemes offer limited support for OLTP workloads or query analysis in the context of the popular MapReduce programming model In this study we focus on the data partitioning issue in MapReduce High scalability is one of the most important design goals for MapReduce applications Unfortunately the partitioning techniques in existing MapReduce platforms e.g Hadoop are in their infancy leading to serious performance problems Recently a handful of data partitioning schemes have been proposed in the MapReduce platforms Xie et al  developed a data placement management mechanism for heterogeneous Hadoop clusters Their mechanism partitions data fragments to nodes in accordance to the nodes processing speed measured by computing ratios In addition Xie et al  designed a data redistribution algorithm in HDFS to address the data-skew issue imposed by dynamic data insertions and deletions CoHadoop is a H a d oop s lightweight extension which is designed to identify relateddataﬁlesfollowedbyamodiﬁeddataplacement policy to co-locate copies of those related les in the same server CoHadoop considers the relevance among les that is CoHadoop is an optimization of HaDoop for multiple les A key assumption of the MapReduce programming model is that mappers are completely independent of one another Vernica et al  broke such an assumption by introducing an asynchronous communication channel among mappers T his c hannel e nables the m appers to see global states managed in metadata Such situationaware mappers SAMs can enable MapReduce to exibly partition the inputs Apart from this adaptive sampling and partitioning were proposed to produce balanced partitions for the reducers by sampling mapper outputs and making use of obtained statistics Graph and hypergraph partitioning have been used to guide data partitioning in parallel computing Graph-based partitioning schemes capture data relationships For example Ke et al applied a graphic-execution-plan graph EPG to perform cost estimation and optimization by analyzing various properties of both data and computation Their estimation module coupled with the cost model estimate the runtime cost of each vertex in an EPG which represents the overall runtime cost a data partitioning plan is determined by a cost optimization module Liroz-Gistau et al proposed the MR-Part technique which partitions all input tuples producing the same intermediate key co-located in the same chunk Such a partitioning approach minimizes data transmission among mappers and reducers in the shufﬂe phase The approach captures the relationships between input tuples and intermediate keys by monitoring the execution of representative workload Then based on these relationships their approach applies a min-cut k-way graph partitioning algorithm thereby partitioning and assigning the tuples to appropriate fragments by modeling the workload with a hyper graph In doing so subsequent MapReduce jobs take full advantage of data locality in the reduce phase Their partitioning strategy suffers from adverse initialization overhead Fig 7 The scalability of FiDoop-DP and Pfp when the size of input dataset increases XUN ET AL FIDOOP-DP DATA PARTITIONING IN FREQUENT ITEMSET MINING ON HADOOP CLUSTERS 111 


7.2 Application-Aware Data Partitioning Various efﬁcient data partitioning strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of parallel computing systems For example Kirsten et al  developed two general partitioning strategies for generating entity match tasks to avoid memory bottlenecks and load imbalances Taking into account the characteristics of input data Aridhi et al proposed a novel density-based data partitioning technique for approximate large-scale frequent subgraph mining to balance computational load among a collection of machines Kotoulas et al built a data distribution mechanism based on clustering in elastic regions Traditional term-based partitioning has limited scalability due to the existence of very skewed frequency distributions among terms Load-balanced distributed clustering across networks and local clustering are introduced to improve the chance that triples with a same key are collocated These selforganizing approaches need no data analysis or upfront parameter adjustments in a priori Lu et al studied k nearest neighbor join using MapReduce in which a data partitioning approach was designed to reduce both shufﬂing and computational costs In Lu’s study objects are divided into partitions using a Voronoi diagram with carefully selected pivots Then data partitions i.e Voronoi cells are clustered into groups only if distances between them are restricted by a speciﬁc bound In this way their approach can answer the k-nearest-neighbour join queries by simply checking object pairs within each group FIM for data-intensive applications over computing clusters has received a growing attention efﬁcient data partitioning strategies have been proposed to improve the performance of parallel FIM algorithms A MapReducebased Apriori algorithm is designed to incorporate a new dynamic partitioning and distributing data method to improve mining performance This method divides input data into relatively small splits to provide exibility for improved load-balance performance Moreover the master node doesn’t distribute all the data once rather the rest data are distributed based on dynamically changing workload and computing capability weight of each node Similarly Jumbo adopted a dynamic partition assignment technology enabling each task to process more than one partition Thus these partitions can be dynamically reassigned to different tasks to improve the load balancing performance of Pfp Uthayopas et al  investigated I/O and execution scheduling strategies to balance data processing load thereby enhancing the utilization of a multi-core cluster system supporting association-rule mining In order to pick a winning strategy in terms of data-blocks assignment Uthayopas et al incorporated three basic placement policies namely the round robin range and random placement Their approach ignores data characteristics during the course of mining association rules 8F URTHER D ISCUSSIONS In this study we investigated the data partitioning issues in parallel FIM We focused on MapReduce-based parallel FPtree algorithms in particular we studied how to partition and distribute a large dataset across data nodes of a Hadoop cluster to reduce network and computing loads We argue that the general idea of FiDoop-DP proposed in this study can be extended to other FIM algorithms like Apriori running on Hadoop clusters Apriori-based parallel FIM algorithms can be classiﬁed into two camps namely count distribution and data distribution  For the count distribution camp each node in a cluster calculates local support counts of all candidate itemsets Then the global support counts of the candidates are computed by exchanging the local support counts For the data distribution camp each node only keeps the support counts of a subset of all candidates Each node is responsible for delivering its local database partition to all the other processors to compute support counts In general the data distribution schemes have higher communication overhead than the count distribution ones whereas the data distribution schemes have lower synchronization overhead than its competitor Regardless of the count distribution or data distribution approaches the communication and synchronization cost induce adverse impacts on the performance of parallel mining algorithms The basic idea of Fidoop-DP—grouping highly relevant transactions into a partition allows the parallel algorithms to exploit correlations among transactions in database to cut communication and synchronization overhead among Hadoop nodes 9C ONCLUSIONS A ND F UTURE W ORK To mitigate high communication and reduce computing cost in MapReduce-based FIM algorithms we developed FiDoop-DP which exploits correlation among transactions to partition a large dataset across data nodes in a Hadoop cluster FiDoop-DP is able to 1 partition transactions with high similarity together and 2 group highly correlated frequent items into a list One of the salient features of FiDoopDP lies in its capability of lowering network trafﬁc and computing load through reducing the number of redundant transactions which are transmitted among Hadoop nodes FiDoop-DP applies the Voronoi diagram-based data partitioning technique to accomplish data partition in which LSH is incorporated to offer an analysis of correlation among transactions At the heart of FiDoop-DP is the second MapReduce job which 1 partitions a large database to form a complete dataset for item groups and 2 conducts FP-Growth processing in parallel on local partitions to generate all frequent patterns Our experimental results reveal that FiDoop-DP signiﬁcantly improves the FIM performance of the existing Pfp solution by up to 31 percent with an average of 18 percent We introduced in this study a similarity metric to facilitate data-aware partitioning As a future research direction we will apply this metric to investigate advanced loadbalancing strategies on a heterogeneous Hadoop cluster In one of our earlier studies see for details we addressed the data-placement issue in heterogeneous Hadoop clusters where data are placed across nodes in a way that each node has a balanced data processing load Our data placement scheme can balance the amount of data stored in heterogeneous nodes to achieve improved data-processing performance Such a scheme implemented at the level of Hadoop distributed le system HDFS is unaware of correlations among application data To further improve load balancing 112 IEEE
