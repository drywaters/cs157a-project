Smart city applications can be constructed on this platform, and full support including platform operation and maintenance, will be provided These servic es are divided into three areas 11 safety and disas ter prevention uses the 4G network to transmit live video for disaster prevention and to broadcast announcements; a decision-making assistant uses big data statistics analysis and case research to offer planning recommendations; and, with convenient services, the system solves the prob lem of the inconveniences that rural populations face. In the latter case, for example, a smart vil lage might be served by the village chief through mobile devices, instant messaging, and uploaded reactions to city government initiatives 46  Application Platform Architecture With applica tions and the mobile Web as the service entrance the system provides intelligent classrooms and an interactive teaching platform, with big data ana lytics to facilitate analysis of the learning process to enhance learning. Multiple digital learning services provide countrywide tutoring, univer sity studies, and a lifelong education for different learning populations, such as K12. The learning services provide online video learning, quality teaching programs, and live learning. Most of the services are smoothly delivered via 4G technol ogy. At the same time, users\222 learning processes are recorded, and, through big data analysis, rec ommendations are given to users equipment, facilitates community care by clinical staff, and allows multiple staff members to simul taneously discuss professional care Because of the diverse requirements for smart cities, a powerful and effec tive platform is needed that supports the requirements of a smart city\222s various applications 12 In a smart city ecosystem, telecom operators assume the role of providing primary con struction, maintenance, and opera tion. Through unified specification information, openness, and applica tion interfaces, urban information service platform applications can be integrated, sharing data between ap plications and industries. Through the application service platform, integrated in frastructure, and underlying capabilities, which carry national urban intelligent applications multiple value-added services can be provided As Figure 4 shows, a complete smart city appli cation and services platform includes three main layers: basic resources, a development platform and application services. Smart city applications will be constructed on this platform, and full support, including platform operation and main tenance, will be provided 13 This layer is constructed according to the unified hardware specifications and system architecture to provide services to the development platform layer. It consists of virtual machines \(VMs\, stor age devices, networks, security protection de vices, a resource pool, and other components providing the resource requirements of the up per layers, storage, switching, security, and other basic functions 14 The shared repository in this layer is used mainly to capture the various fields of data to be stored. The computing platform provides virtual servers, networks, storage space and value-added services, such as VMs, virtual networks, and security protection. Furthermore the platform has a high degree of elasticity and can install its own application software, which is required to construct the environment Smart mobile learning services Intelligent governance services 


The system calcu lates the CPU load of all physical machines, re sulting in standard deviation values. The bigger this value is, the more discrete the representa tive is\227that is, the greater the CPU load unbal ance. At this point, Virtuoso proposes a VM migration operation to achieve load balancing The user interface is an integrated management portal that provides maintenance and operation staff to customers; it constitutes the entrance API. It can manage large numbers of virtual com puting resources and related hardware devices such as physical servers, VMs, storage, and net work equipment, to improve management ef fectiveness. It provides the following functions hierarchical authority management mechanism automatic deployment of virtualization platform capabilities, and complete API support User Interface Figure 5  computer.org   Resource Optimization Application CHT Virtuoso System manager User API OAM portal VM management Quality assurance Resource allocation Network security VM Server storage Virtual switch app OS app OS app OS app OS app OS Virtual switch Virtual switch Auto deploy Data backup Event alarm Energy saving User portal Applications Cabinet Server Storage Network Virtuoso system architecture. The Virtuoso cloud management system configures, manages, and monitors various entities within the cloud center The Virtuoso System Development Platform Layer Application Service Layer Overcommit provision This layer provides the development and operating environment for upperlayer services, such as Web server utili ty, database management, and software components. It requires a common framework for core technology con struction and the provision of open in terfaces and connection mechanisms cloud computing resources, large data analysis and exploration tools, infor mation security, and other common component modules. By reusing sys tem component modules, the comple tion of customized solutions can be accelerated. This layer also includes a variety of application services offer ing standardized tools and environ ments. The application development environment helps developers by providing tools to enhance the quality and quantity of application de velopment and shorten the development cycle This layer includes a variety of smart developments providing friendly urban applications, slotting management, monitoring, billing, and other func tions. The application management platform pro vides application services related to management functions on the smart city cloud platform, in cluding user, partner, product, promotion, service billing, and subscriber management; statistical analysis; application monitoring; and other related functions. System developers, administrators, and maintenance and operation personnel can perform the required services in this management function Finally, resource usage, billing, processing, and other data sheets are shown via statistical reporting 47 ITPro The key to achieving an application service plat form for a smart city is a stable and resilient virtu al infrastructure resource management system 15  In Taiwan\222s smart city plan, Chunghwa Telecom will provide the cloud service platform, Virtuoso a self-developing system for configuring, manag ing, and monitoring various entities within the cloud center. Management information system MIS\anagers can take advantage of a stan dardized API to operate and manage resources the surveillance applications reached by VM ser vices, automatic extensions, and other tasks. The architecture of Virtuoso is shown in Figure 5. Its main features are as follows Resource scheduling, management, and optimi zation are the core values of virtualization tech nology. Virtuoso provides the following features The total VM specifica tions can exceed the limit of the physical ma chine\222s resources. For example, the CPU uses Dynamic resource scheduling 


IT Pro I T I N SMAR T C ITI E S Without inter rupting services, the VM can be moved to an other physical machine. Virtuoso\222s advanced features can manage the dynamic extension of resources and provide cross-cluster or instant migration across storage devices and transfer processes without interruption This feature allows the CPU, memory, and hard disk space of VMs to be dynamically expanded or reduced Virtual Machine Management July/August 2016 When the VM\222s CPU, mem ory usage, disk read/write traffic, or network traffic are too high or too low, the VM is auto matically increased or reduced on demand s mentioned, Taiwan has two primary reasons for developing smart cities: to uncover new growth opportunities for Taiwan\222s ICT and to tap into the global market for smart living technologies. To achieve smart city life and fulfill traffic management, safety environmental protection, and intelligent service This function sup ports copying a VM and setting correct param eters after initialization to avoid duplication of a VM\222s information, which affects its stability Autoscaling function Availability Management Performance Monitoring and Energy Management A 48  Memory overcommit Convenient template build and conversion processes  Users can convert their own VM as a tem plate for the templates that are to be loaded subsequently Dynamic scale up and down Dynamic provisioning Dynamic migration mechanism a time division mechanism and average disper sion for all VMs of the same host. The over commit ratio has no upper limit This function uses bal loon memory technology, giving VMs a basic amount, and collects idle memory according to different weights dynamically allocated to the VM. The overcommit ratio may be 1:4 Using storage space manage ment technology, this feature allows temporary excessive VM storage space utilization. Using all the storage space without prior reservations can increase storage space utilization The VM is dynamically transferred to adjust the configuration best suited to the physical machine\222s performance and then reaches the resource load balancing that optimizes and enhances the efficiency of resource utilization The system can immediately detect the operat ing status of each physical machine. When the physical machine fails, the services running on the failed machine can be rebooted on another functioning physical machine to reduce the out age time of the VM application services. Systems with high availability are designed to ensure un interrupted virtualization service management According to the safety design, the external sys tem must have an account at a particular access API. Through safety certification, the risk of sys tem intrusion is significantly reduced The Virtuoso managing functions include all life-cycle management needs, such as startup shutdown, forced boot, reboot, forced reopening pause, resume, and delete snapshot functions The following features are also included Virtuoso provides real-time and historical moni toring, and basic functions. The main functions include a reliable snapshot and restore mecha nism, storage connection monitoring, space us age forecasting, virtual disk access restriction management, and disaster recovery capabilities Network management supports the following complicated functions: virtual LAN access and management capabilities, virtual network card management, network traffic monitoring, VM security isolation, network card binding, VM network card IP/MAC tamper-proof capabilities and VM network card access control Virtuoso provides instant performance moni toring, historical effectiveness reports, and a physical machine power-blackouts-control mechanism. It also includes physical machine and VM real-time performance, utilization, and effi cacy monitoring, and provides historical reports  according to a variety of time intervals. Finally the power blackouts policy supports power man agement settings to save energy Thin provisioning Storage and Backup Management Network Management VM information initialization

Zhiqiong Wang et al Distributed and Weighted Extreme Learning Machine for Imbalanced Big Data Learning 171 classes the optimization effect is still good Finally we investigate the impact of imbalance ratio As shown in Fig 8a with the increasing imbalance ratio the training times of the ELM 003   DW-ELM and IDW-ELM algorithms are basically stable and the training time of the IDW-ELM algorithm is always lower than that of the DW-ELM algorithm Also the training time of the ELM 003  algorithm is lower than that of the IDW-ELM algorithm The variation in speedup ratio of changing the imbalance ratio of the training records is shown in Fig 8b and the speedup ratio remains stable Increasing the imbalance ratio did not produce any substantial effects on the calculation process of the MapReduce job so the training time is relatively stable Since the training time of the IDW-ELM algorithm is less than that of the DWELM algorithm this further veri\002es the validity of the improved algorithm From the results of the six groups the training time of the ELM 003  algorithm is less than that of the DWFig 8 The impact of the imbalance ratio on 050a\051 time and 050b\051 speedup ratio ELM algorithm in each group of experiments The reason is because in the DW-ELM algorithm training process the number of samples in each category needed to be 002rst counted that is calculate the diagonal elements of the weight matrix W in the Map phase then the H T H and H T T matrices were calculated in the MapReduce calculation while only H T H and H T T matrices needed to be counted in the Map phase of the ELM 003  algorithm However the G-mean value of the ELM 003  algorithm in managing the unbalanced data was signi\002cantly lower than that of the DW-ELM algorithm which apparently was not applicable to the imbalance BD learning 5 Conclusion Neither the WELM nor the DELM algorithms manage the imbalanced big training data ef\002ciently since they only consider either the 223big\224 or the 223imbalanced\224 aspect of imbalanced big training data and not both In this study we proposed a DW-ELM algorithm based on the MapReduce framework The DW-ELM algorithm makes full use of the parallel computing ability of the MapReduce framework and realizes ef\002cient learning of imbalanced BD Speci\002cally through analyzing the characteristics of the WELM algorithm we found that the matrix multiplication operators 050i.e H T WH and H T WT 051 within the WELM algorithm are decomposable Then we transformed the corresponding matrix multiplication operators into summation forms which suited the MapReduce framework well and proposed a DWELM algorithm to calculate the matrix multiplications using two MapReduce jobs Furthermore an IDWELM algorithm which only uses one MapReduce job to complete the tasks was proposed to improve the performance of the DW-ELM algorithm Finally in the cluster environment we performed a detailed validation of the performance of the DW-ELM and IDW-ELM algorithms with various experimental settings The experimental results show that the DW-ELM and IDWELM algorithms can learn imbalanced BD ef\002ciently Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 050Nos 61402089 61472069 and 61501101\051 the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 050Nos N161904001 N161602003 and N150408001\051 the Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province 050No
