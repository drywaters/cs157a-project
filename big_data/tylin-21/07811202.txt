S K Sharma X Wang Live Data Analytics With Collaborative Edge and Cloud Processing in Wireless IoT Networks  Based on the above discussion we highlight some of the interesting research topics below 017 Characterization of system resources  In the proposed framework it is important to identify all the involved communication caching and computing resources and then derive link/system capacity or any other suitable metrics by considering all these resources into account in order to provide the overall characterization of the system 017 Adaptive optimization problems  Some examples include latency minimization under the constraints of computational rate transmit power minimization under the constraints of computational rate precoding matrices/beamforming vector optimization under the constraints of computational rate and the optimization of processing power under the constraints of latency bandwidth and transmit power 017 Performance tradeoffs  In the considered framework several performance tradeoffs such as caching gain and memory size/cache content size computing and communication delays can be investigated 017 Joint optimization of system resources  Suitable joint optimization solutions can be investigated under the proposed framework in order to jointly optimize the caching 050cache size\051 computing resources 050processor speed memory size computational rate/power\051 and communication resources 050bandwidth transmit power energy latency etc.\051 Besides suitable multi-objective optimization solutions can be de v eloped in order to address con\035icting objectives in designing a wireless IoT network E AUTONOMOUS DEVICE COLLABORATIONS IN WIRELESS IoT NETWORKS Device to Device 050D2D\051 communication has got importance in various practical scenarios and plays an important role in the proposed edge-cloud coordinated framework in Fig 3 The increasing context-aware applications require location awareness and discovery functionalities and need to communicate with other neighboring nodes Also D2D plays an important role in enabling the sharing of resources such as contents applications processing power and spectrum among spatially-closed resource-constrained nodes in order to enhance the overall system performance In addition D2D communication is of vital importance to form emergency communication network in disaster scenarios such as earthquake or hurricane In such disaster scenarios D2D communications has to take care of various aspects such as unpredictability limited resources in disaster areas and dynamically varying environment In wireless IoT networks involving different types of things/objects such as home appliances body area sensors smart-phones and environmental monitoring sensors a series of communication is required to realize the process of creating collecting and sharing information among nearby devices Due to their heterogeneous capabilities de vices can help each other with the help of suitable collaborative strategies among them 050for example in a smart home home audio lighting bulbs and alarming systems can collaborate to indicate the emergency level\051 Similar to human social network in connecting users via Internet one device can be connected with other devices based on its social relationships with them thus leading to the concept of social IoT By exploring the social relations of the devices device collaboration can be initiated without human intervention The heterogeneity and the diversity of the connected smart devices impose challenges in handling interoperability among IoT devices During the operation phase there arise several challenges such as how to maintain seamless connections among the devices how to attach a new device to the network how to rediscover a device in the network how to form a collaborative cluster and which device to disconnect in case of faulty conditions and security threats By grouping correlative devices under the same collaborative cluster ef\034cient management strategies can be employed at the IoT gateway in order to control them and also to enable device collaborations In this direction the key issues to be considered are to understand the social relations among the devices to classify de vices based on a suitable basis to track the location of the devices/inhabitants and to design effective device collaborative strategies based on the inferred information with the aim of enhancing the zerocon\034guration index of device interaction In the following we highlight some of the interesting research topics and issues under this theme 017 De\034nition of social relationships  Several aspects such as how to assign social relations among IoT devices and what kind of device social relations can be extracted from human social relations are important to investigated under the considered joint edge-cloud collaborative platform 017 Device attachment and discovery schemes  It is essential to develop suitable policies to admit a new device to the existing IoT network and the ways to discover a device in the shortest possible path to minimize the latency as well as energy consumption 017 Techniques for device classi\034cation and collaborative cluster formation  Various research questions such as what is the best classi\034cation basis how many devices should be grouped in a network how to support a large number of heterogeneous group/cluster of devices how to synchronize different clusters and how to choose a cluster head dynamically in time varying channel conditions need to be addressed in the proposed framework 017 Performance analysis  Balancing the tradeoff between local device interactions and maintaining stable global system state in the considered distributed system is one of the important aspects to be considered Besides suitable incentive-based device participation approaches can be investigated to enhance the participation of IoT devices in sharing their communication computing and storage resources VOLUME 5 2017 4631 


S K Sharma X Wang Live Data Analytics With Collaborative Edge and Cloud Processing in Wireless IoT Networks  F DATA-DRIVEN EVENT MONITORING AND EVENT-DRIVEN SERVICE PROVISIONING IN WIRELESS IoT NETWORKS In the considered cloud-edge collaborative framework various features of big data can be utilized in order to monitor the events which may be periodic or random in nature Based on the global view of the network and historical data cloud can implement suitable prediction techniques to forecast future events and to provide this information to the edge computing units in order to better utilize the network resources Moreover in order to support device interactions in IoT networks with the minimal human intervention energy ef\034ciency computational ef\034ciency and spectral ef\034ciency are important issues to be considered One of the promising approaches to tackle these issues is event triggering which enables communication/computing action to take place only when a particular event or a sequence of events happens With this approach resource utilization ef\034ciency can be signi\034cantly improved since communication circuits can be put into the sleep mode and the computing burden is reduced during the non-occurrence of events The 034rst step in data-driven event monitoring is to de\034ne a suitable behavior model which captures the normal behavior of the considered IoT system After a behavior model is identi\034ed a suitable even detection technique can be employed The even detection techniques can be broadly categorized into sample-based and stream-based The 034rst cate gory of techniques is based on individual samples to detect events while the second category relies on the 035ow of data samples Besides the service provisioning of IoT is signi\034cantly different than from the traditional services which are mainly targeted for human-machine interactions and the difference mainly lies in the fact that IoT services need to deal with the seamless interactions with the real-world The heterogeneous IoT environment requires distributed processing of the large-scale sensing information collected by the IoT nodes which need to combined and shared among different entities In this regard it is important to dynamically adapt the services based on the instantaneous changes in the physical environment We highlight some of the interesting research problems and directions under this research topic below 017 Behavior modeling techniques  Several aspects such as de\034nition of suitable reference models methods to cope up with unpredictable system characteristics exploitation of differential states in the system state and advanced learning methods can be studied under the proposed framework 017 Event detection techniques  Suitable sample and stream-based mechanisms and statistical approaches such as eigenvalue distributions and PCA can be investigated for the considered framework 017 Event handling methods  In order to handle events in the proposed framework various clustering techniques event classi\034ers data-driven methods such as regression expectation maximization and linear support vector machines inference methods such as fuzzy logic and heuristic reasoning and data fusion techniques can be investigated 017 On-demand information sharing  Several aspects such as resource sharing models interactions with application layer parameters on-demand information dissemination models environmental awareness and information fusion techniques require further research 017 Adaptation and validation of event triggering  In practice the events can be spontaneous and may have recurrent patterns and are of dynamic nature How to adapt the operation of the network based on various states of the event such as early sign and intermediate state is another key issue to be considered After acquiring information about the event how to validate the credibility of that information is another important challenge G SOFTWARE DEFINED NETWORKING AND VIRTUALIZATION IN WIRELESS IoT NETWORKS In the existing networks the main problems are vendorspeci\034c interfaces and software associated with hardware complex and expensive network operation and the tight coupling of data and control planes Besides the netw ork cannot dynamically adapt based on the network conditions To address the aforementioned issues the emerging concept of SDN 43 can be emplo yed Besides virtualization technology can be used to form a virtual network on the top of the existing networks which shields the user from the underlying hardware and becomes adaptable to diverse technologies and protocols However in contrast to the traditional virtualized wired networks radio resource abstraction and isolation in wireless networks is challenging due to time-varying channel broadcast nature mobility and heterogeneous access technologies In heterogeneous IoT en vironment dynamic resource discovery and the sharing of available resources can enable the creation of effective virtual networks However one of the critical challenges is the ef\034cient management of the physical resources allocated to virtual networks How often resource discovery and allocation need to be performed is also another challenge to be addressed Besides mapping of the physical resources to the logical resources in order to embed a virtual network on the existing physical networks in an effective way is another key aspect to be investigated The creation of a virtual network requires effective interactions among the involved entities at different hierarchical levels of the wireless IoT network This requires the need of de\034ning suitable interfaces as well as proper control signalling which can be adaptable among heterogeneous wireless access technologies For control signalling mechanisms such as IP-based signalling and dedicated channel assignment can be investigated considering both network overload and delay Besides naming the devices with logical identi\034ers mapping between physical and logical addresses slicing device attachment and dynamic routing of the device 4632 VOLUME 5 2017

research aspect is to e xamine the possibility of employing various levels of slicing such as spectrum-level slicing network-level slicing and 035ow-level slicing in the wireless IoT networks In addition investigating suitable admission control policies in order to control the admission of incoming users/devices while guaranteeing the QoS of the existing users/devices is another aspect to be considered Based on the above discussion some research directions under this topic are provided below 017 Formation of virtualized edge-cloud collaborative network  The design of a uni\034ed logical network in the proposed framework include various aspects such as network topology and interfaces de\034nition networks/devices discovery/routing mapping between physical and logical resources naming assignment of unique logical identi\034ers to the devices and device attachment strategies/admission control policies for future devices/nodes/users 017 Wireless virtualization technologies  It is an interesting future research direction to investigate suitable radio resource abstraction isolation and slicing techniques under various practical constraints such as time-varying channel mobility and heterogeneous access technologies in the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework 017 Adaptive con\034guration of system parameters  Some important research challenges in the proposed framework are to dynamically con\034gure a large number of system parameters such as carrier frequency bandwidth computing power cache size and transmission power to estimate the time-varying wireless channels i.e loads and to dynamically characterize the communication links in terms of stability delay rate loss and collision It is interesting to investigate the application of SDN to overcome these challenges 017 Control signalling design  Another key challenge is how to design control signalling under the constraints of delay and communication bandwidth overhead Several questions such as whether it is better to provide a dedicated radio channel or to employ a shared channel for control signalling how to support the scalability of the devices how to make signalling reliable in the case of device mobility and device failure during D2D communication need to be investigated in future works H SECURITY/PRIVACY ENHANCEMENT IN WIRELESS IoT NETWORKS Another main challenge is how to provide secured connections to the massive number of heterogeneous IoT devices having different levels of processing capabilities During the processing of big data generated from massive IoT environment the security threat may arise in any of the data processing phases including data acquisition information 034ltering data integration representation modeling processing and interpretation In our proposed framework the cloud centre can guide the processing of edge nodes by utilizing the available history information as well as the network-wide intelligence towards achieving secured 035ow of information in the aforementioned phases The existing modular design practices for wireless communications are leading to vulnerable wireless IoT networks due to the transparent air interface and weak security protection mechanisms Also the decentralized characteristics of wireless IoT networks long sleeping windows of IoT sensors and the needs for collaborative communications to support D2D communications over heterogeneous networks pose signi\034cant challenges to the traditional wireless security provisioning techniques For example in IoT-based healthcare environment the delegation of both storage and computation to the untrusted party can bring serious security and privacy issues and it is crucial to maintain the security and privacy of the every patient's data Since the cloud centre has a global view of the network as well as the history information this knowledge can be exploited in taking decision on which nodes are unreliable and need to be disconnected from the network In the IoT environment involving heterogeneous sensors having different levels of processing capabilities and also different mobility levels existing cloud computing security mechanisms like sophisticated access control and encryption methods may not be suf\034cient to prevent illegitimate and unauthorized access to the data In this context there is a strong need to investigate suitable physical layer and cross-layer techniques such as dynamic link adaptation and adaptive medium access scheduling to enhance the data 035ow security in the proposed edge-cloud coordinated platform In contrast to the traditional scenarios there is a high probability of privacy loss in IoT enabled systems due to several factors such as location-based services increased interaction with smart devices and less awareness on the user side In this regard there is a strong need to investigate privacy preserving mechanisms in IoT-enabled wireless networks Moreover in the proposed cloud-edge collaborative platform the distributed edge units may be more vulnerable to attacks since they do not have a global view of the network and have less resources to protect themselves In this regard cloud can assist edge-side units in implementing security measures in practical scenarios with the help of its global intelligence in identifying attacks/threats Furthermore in the proposed platform edge computing units can act as controllers and aggregators for privacy sensitive data before sending data to the cloud and they may also act as the proxies of resourceconstrained IoT devices in order to handle their security functions Based on the above discussion the following speci\034c research directions can be considered under this theme 017 Security enhancement with joint edge-cloud processing  Several research questions such as how to perform cloud-side computations on the encrypted IoT data without revealing any privacy/secrets to the cloud service VOLUME 5 2017 4633 


S K Sharma X Wang Live Data Analytics With Collaborative Edge and Cloud Processing in Wireless IoT Networks  providers how to ensure that data is not corrupted in the edge processing units while in transit to the cloud centre and how to of\035oad tasks/programs from the edge to cloud in a secured manner need to be addressed 017 Access control and cooperative data aggregation schemes  In the proposed platform suitable cloudassisted encryption techniques energy-ef\034cient data scrambling techniques and cooperative data aggregation schemes can be investigated under the constraints of latency and communication bandwidth In the cooperative schemes various aspects such as how the nodes negotiate for a shared key and what are different ways in which cloud can assist nodes in devising these cooperative policies under the constraints of communication bandwidth and computational rate need to be investigated 017 Privacy preservation techniques  In the proposed cloud-assisted platform it is important to investigate suitable privacy preserving data clustering differential privacy mechanisms and Pseudonymizing techniques in order to preserve the privacy of the end-users 017 Trustworthiness of IoT systems  Various aspects such as how to measure the trustworthiness of an IoT sensor/aggregator node how to identify that the source of the data is a desired sensor device but not a robot or a malicious device need to be investigated under the proposed framework VI CONCLUSIONS Cloud computing and edge computing are considered as two emerging paradigms in handling the massive amount of distributed data generated by IoT devices However these paradigms have their own advantages and disadvantages Cloud computing provides a centralized pool of storage and computing resources and has a global view of the network but it is not suitable for applications demanding low latency realtime operation and high QoS On the other hand edge computing is suitable for the applications which need real-time treatment mobility support and location/context awareness but does not usually have suf\034cient computing and storage resources Taking these aspects into consideration this paper has proposed a novel framework of collaborative edge-cloud processing for enabling live data analytics in wireless IoT networks The basic features key enablers and the challenges of big data analytics in wireless IoT networks have been described and the main distinctions between cloud and edge processing have been presented Furthermore potential key enablers for the proposed collaborative edge-cloud computing framework have been identi\034ed and the associated key challenges have been presented in order to foster future research activities in this domain Finally it is worthy to mention that the proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework can be exploited as an important platform for wireless networks to achieve various objectives such as dynamic spectrum management energy-ef\034cient caching and of\035oading closed-loop latency minimization adaptive optimization of computing communication and caching resources even-driven resource allocation and
