S Din et al  Cluster-Based Data Fusion Technique to Analyze Big Data  devices it is dif\034cult to recharge or replace the batteries Hence limited energy in wireless ad-hoc and sensor network is a critical constraint in surviving network for a longer period Network lifetime is one of the important features for evaluating the performance of wireless ad-hoc and sensor network Typically network lifetime is resolute by residual energy of the network thus one of the main challenges in wireless ad-hoc and sensor network is the ef\034cient re-use of the battery 050energy of the device\051 For the above-mentioned constraints a clustering technique is one of the solutions to cope with energy conservation in wireless ad-hoc and sensor network In the clustering technique a set of devices is grouped together in a geographical region After grouping a cluster head is selected based on some certain algorithms   in which the selected node is called a cluster head whereas rest of the nodes are called member nodes Cluster head acquires data from its member nodes and aggregates it Then it forwards the data to the neighboring cluster heads at the base station via direct hop or multi-hop Routing data in clusters are divided into two broad categories i.e intracluster 050within the same cluster\051 and inter-cluster 050within clusters\051 data transmission Such layout of the cluster reduces a signi\034cant amount of energy in the network Wireless ad-hoc and sensor network is composed of hundreds or even thousands of nodes communicating with each other Such densely deployed nature of the network consumes more energy in exchanging data with the unstable additive load and excruciating faults Various algorithms for selecting nodes as a cluster head and member nodes the inter-communication and cluster head play a vital role in facilitating network in surviving for a longer period of time It is known as 035at architecture based network In 035at architecture based network there is a uniformity in all nodes i.e structure and composition of a node are homogeneous Thus the y lack conserv ation techniques that may be supported by themselves Apparently in cluster architecture based network the high energy node that is appropriately localized cluster head acts as a gateway which plays an important role in solving various issues Cluster architecture based network is considered to be energy ef\034cient network by route discovery data aggregation fault tolerance and end-to-end nature Furthermore cluster architecture based network shows substantial advantages over 035at architecture based network which are as follows 017 It is minimizing transmission power 017 Helps in balancing the nodes energy as well as data load 017 The overhead is reduced due to incorporating a topological technique that results in survivability of a network for a longer period of time 017 It minimizes collisions by reducing extensive hop-byhop communication 017 It reduces the size of the cluster head 017 It extends the lifetime survivability of the nodes Having said that cluster contains cluster head as well as member nodes where cluster head communicates with FIGURE 1 Cluster Formation and their challenges member nodes within a cluster as delineated in Figure 1 In the given 034gure the deployment region is divided into x and y coordinate plane Based on some clustering algorithms the nodes are grouped together to form a cluster The cluster head aggregates the data and then disseminate it toward the base station using multi-hop communication Apart from the traditional clustering technique sometimes it may also happen that due to limited energy of a sensor node deployments of sensor nodes are inhospitable Also sometimes leakage of energy from cluster heads may cause more damage to the network Thus affecting the survivability of a network is in danger which drastically minimizes the network lifetime Recon\034guration of clusters or cluster head selection in the network may be a useful remedy to overcome the said constraints In this case the cluster head will stop collecting and disseminate data Apart from that re-clustering may cause additional overhead resulting in a delay in the network and limited node energy Having such knowledge of survivability issues in wireless ad-hoc and sensor network this paper presents a novel technique for enhancing network lifetime by proposing clustering based routing technique At 034rst a group of sensor nodes forms a cluster referred to as setup phase Furthermore the formation of the cluster and selecting the boundaries of a cluster is made in steady phase And 034nally the routing phase is used to disseminate the data from the cluster head toward the base station The proposed scheme introduced a new synergistic mating technique of communication architecture that tackles both 035at and clustered network The proposed approach encompasses direct and multi-hop routing making the network ef\034cient in energy consumption The multi-hop communication is based on route discovery from source to destination Also rotation of cluster head and re-assignment of forwarding nodes is already been premeditated in the design phase of the communication architecture for wireless ad-hoc and sensor network A RESEARCH CONTRIBUTION The main contribution of this paper is as follows At 034rst we present a hierarchical framework for integrating clustering algorithm with routing technique 5070 VOLUME 5 2017 


S Din et al  Cluster-Based Data Fusion Technique to Analyze Big Data  The framework 034rst internments the scalable features of clustering technique which helps in the extension of network commodities Moreover the incorporation of relay/gateway nodes in the architecture provides the direct one-hop communication and thus eliminating the chances of multihop communication toward wireless ad-hoc and sensor network Consequently prolonging the network lifetime On the basis of proposed architecture the nodes in the network are grouped together forming a cluster We then propose optimized routing technique that solves the void problem The proposed optimization algorithm facilitates the deployed nodes to achieve survivable network We conduct the extensive simulation 050and performed mathematically\051 and statistical analysis by considering the simulated scenario of wireless ad-hoc and sensor network From the results and discussion we show that the proposed scheme is feasible for wireless ad-hoc and sensor network which handles high data rates in an ef\034cient and reliable way B RESEARCH MOTIVATION Wireless sensor and ad-hoc network bridge the gap between the physical and virtual world It is evolving to be an enabling technology due to intensi\034cation in sensing processing and communicating information at a very low cost Due to identical nature of the nodes involved in the network the major design objective is to assure a certain network lifetime 050referred to as data gathering cycles\051 and to ensure that all the devices involved in the communication expire at the same time One of the main advantages of these sensors is to work unattended which is the ideal situation at inaccessible areas Apparently wireless sensor and the ad-hoc network are facing an increase in the equipment of handling multifaceted functions such as network processing information fusion data aggregation requiring these sensors to use signi\034cantly less energy which helps in increasing the survivability of a network Nodes involved in these networks are less tolerant towards energy conservation since they have limited transmission range processing capabilities and communication bandwidth Therefore one of the useful remedy to cope with such constraints is the clustering technique where they select cluster head among the nodes The cluster head is used for gathering information in their vicinity and disseminate it toward the sink Moreover rotation of cluster also enhances the node's lifetime In this paper while aiming for a sustainable reliable communication that leads to the survivability of a network we focus on selecting cluster head and routing technique Specifically we propose a system architecture that exploits selection of cluster head in a wireless ad-hoc and sensor network which is a novel paradigm for enhancing the network lifetime The selection of cluster head is based on two different clustering layers i.e 034rst clustering layer and second clustering layer Moreover different parameters are also considered that helps in selecting the cluster head i.e residual energy the distance among various nodes and the position of the node After selecting cluster head there is a need to route the data toward sink node To achieve this direct hop and multihop communication scenarios are considered that ef\034ciently disseminate the data toward sink or base station To the best of our knowledge this work is the 034rst that exploits the realization of the survivability of wireless ad-hoc and sensor network by considering clustering and routing together We hope and believe that this work will be useful for the healthcare systems and will provide stateof-the-art guidance for research vis-\340-vis wireless ad-hoc and sensor network Eventually future directions and open challenges are discussed regarding clustering and routing techniques C ORGANIZATION The rest of the paper is organized as follow Section 2 brie\035y describes the latest background and related work Section 3 describes the network architecture Moreover Communication Model Traf\034c Model Energy Model the proposed scheme based on data fusion model is also presented in this section Section 4 comprises extensive simulations mathematical and statistical analysis of the proposed scheme And Finally Section 5 offers a conclusion II BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK There are various routing protocols for wireless sensor network Among them LEACH has been proposed that acts as a pioneer in the said 034eld In the literature v arious works are proposed that are close to LEACH  W ith extensions to LEACH same methods of distributed clustering techniques are used in the previously proposed scheme There are various algorithms that deal with the techniques above 15 16 An upgraded architecture of LEACH is proposed to reduce the energy consumption in wireless sensor networks based on clustering technique where CH is responsible for transmitting data to the clusters They replaced the direct hop with multiple hops to save the amount of energy as compared to LEACH However in this scheme cluster head 050CH\051 may die or crash because of the heavy load of data on CH To avoid such circumstances a method is used in which main CH hand over the responsibility to a vice-CH The vice-CH care for whole architecture and do protection from any disordered condition of the network The hierarchical clustering algorithm technique is proposed in which the network lifetime can be increased by using cited algorithm One of the f amous hierarchical clustered routing algorithms is Energy Ef\034cient Level Based Clustering Routing Protocol 050EELBCRP\051 proposed to maximize the network life by reducing the energy depletion in which the number of dead nodes is minimized In this netw ork the n numbers of sensor nodes are deployed randomly to make a cluster network Its author has assumed that there is a 034xed base station situated in the center of deployed sensor network with 034xed identical and limited sensor nodes for energy carrying Data is sent to the base station through middle nodes by adjusting the dynamic power Once the node VOLUME 5 2017 5071 


S Din et al  Cluster-Based Data Fusion Technique to Analyze Big Data  deployment is done the base station transmits a level-1 data with lowest energy power All the receiving sensor nodes put their level as 1 In the next step the base station transmits a level-2 signal data with intensi\034ed power level Likewise apart from the level-1 all the recipient nodes keep their level as level-2 For all nodes coverage the base station sends a continuous signal to another opposite side of the base station to express the level up to edges nodes and give them the same level Then for calculating the distance from the base station on the received signal strength base station broadcast a hello message with the higher and lower limit information i.e upper limit 050 U i 051 of level i and lower limit 050 L i of level i\051 of each level An improved version of LEACH protocol is proposed known as Energy Ef\034cient Extended LEACH 050EEE LEACH\051 protocol The y introduced Master Cluster Heads along with Cluster Heads and decreased the distance between nodes by creating multilevel clustering technique in enhanced LEACH protocol As a result if the number of clusters is higher it minimizes the communication distance and increases the energy ef\034ciency of the protocol The performance of EEE-LEACH is better than simple LEACH protocol A Centralized Cluster Designing 050CCD\051 version of LEACH is proposed in which base station decides the selection of cluster head and optimal cluster k Nearly all protocol related to CCD use the same policy Central point i.e the base station decides the cluster head using high energy  As in BCDCP 36 it reduced the load distrib uted for computation and obtain the parameter values over low energy nodes for computation Few algorithms from the literature are discussed in the following paragraphs These algorithms are based on centralized cluster designing approach C-LEACH 050Centralized 025 low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy\051 presents centralized decision-making scheme for selection of cluster head C-LEA CH disseminates the cluster heads all through the network The performance of C-LEACH is very good regarding energy consumption and load balancing All the sensor nodes are responsible for sending the current location and residual energy to the sink node The current location can be found by the global positioning system 050GPS\051 Energy load should be equally distributed to all the nodes in the network for making better cluster size Moreover sink node computes the average energy of the node The nodes having low energy level than average level cannot elect cluster head in the cluster election process For discovering the k cluster to resolve is NP-hard base station use simulated annealing algorithm to 034nd clusters For homogenous large scale wireless sensor network two algorithms are proposed in One is for dynamic cluster designing i.e energy-ef\034cient and dynamic clustering 050EEDC\051 Another algorithm is for multi-hop routing algorithms that are related to clustered architecture i.e energy-ef\034cient and power-aware 050EEPA\051 algorithm In the network each node checks the received signal power from nearing nodes By detecting the received signal power all the nodes evaluate alive nodes in real time Afterward the optimum probability is calculated to make a cluster head Thus energy consumption can be decreased that is used in intra-cluster and inter-cluster dissemination Hence in this manner the highest node energy is chosen as cluster head in which the minimum battery power is denoted by B min  B min is considered suf\034cient to assume a node as an active node Moreover designed clusters have uneven cluster size while the CMS associated TPO the cluster depend on CH and computed by received signal strength indicator 050RSSI\051 A technique is given that uses the same approach of cluster formation and updating their proposed scheme i.e threshold-based load balancing protocol for energy ef\034cient routing 050TLPER\051 protocol Information of the number of the nodes in the network and geographic location is sent to the base station 050BS\051 by deployed network nodes BS selects a CH on the basis of highest node density BS informs all the network nodes about the decision that CHs have been selected CHs broadcast their status with RSSI message After receiving the RSSI message of cluster head all nodes make a decision to be a member of the network as a non-cluster head node Assistant cluster head 050ACH\051 is selected among all the cluster member nodes with maximum energy level ACH divide the burden of CH by using load balance threshold 050LBT\051 approach and helps the CH rotation for energy ef\034ciency by using the role transfer threshold 050RTT\051 scheme III NETWORK ARCHITECTURE With a view to balance battery power of a node for surviving for a longer period of time is achieved by ef\034cient data traf\034c management In most of the research work modeling of data traf\034c is used to achieve energy ef\034cient network Having such knowledge of data traf\034c modeling the proposed scheme is powered by ef\034cient clustering and routing technique In the proposed network architecture four different methods are used to enhance the survivability of a network through node deployment cluster formation member node selection criteria and routing technique Energy hole problem is tackle by clustering and rotation of clustering technique Whereas the void problem is tackled by the routing algorithm The basic idea of the tasks above is to reduce the complexity of both clustering and routing algorithm which helps in enhancing the survivability of the network The following sub-sections delineates the proposed network architecture Assumptions 017 For the sake of simplicity we have assumed that sensors have same battery information memory capacity However the cluster head is assumed to have more battery power as well as memory space 017 We also assumed that for routing the data Ad-hoc on Demand Distance Vector Routing protocol is used which ef\034ciently delivered the data to the destination 017 Sensors nodes are considered to be heterogeneous since they have the capabilities of sensing heterogeneous data such as temperature body temperatures and user's activities 5072 VOLUME 5 2017 


S Din et al  Cluster-Based Data Fusion Technique to Analyze Big Data  017 Finally the nodes know each other location information and all nodes having 034xed radio transmission A ROLE OF SENSOR NODE AND CLUSTER HEAD In our proposed network architecture the role of the sensor nodes is to sense the outer stimuli process the data whereas cluster heads are used for computations as well as communication In a given scenario sensor nodes are responsible for sensing data forward it to cluster head and after performing processing cluster head forward it to the base station using routing technique Moreover 035ooding process is handled by cluster heads cluster head 035oods the control signals 050cluster head joining request route request\051 and also 034nd the energy ef\034cient path toward the base station Hence sensor nodes are free from computation and 034nding the optimal path toward the base station Such technique helps the network to operate for a longer period of time and also provide survivability factor to the network Also the energy level of each cluster head is kept high since they have to perform many activities as compared to other sensors The role of each sensor is mentioned in Table 1 TABLE 1 Role of Deployed Nodes B HIERARCHICAL NODE PLACEMENT SCENARIO While considering the energy hole problem in a network there is a need to deploy the nodes in a way so that nodes near to the base station do not expire quickly To avoid energy hole problem we deployed nodes in a hierarchical way where each sensor node send their data to the cluster head The cluster head forwards that data toward their neighboring cluster head 050which is near to base station\051 The cluster head near to base station may die quickly since they are busy through their communication cycle To solve this problem the rotation of cluster head is performed after a speci\034c interval For instance if the energy of the cluster head is reduced from the speci\034c threshold the job of the cluster is assigned to neighboring node 050a node which is closer to cluster head\051 Then the newly become node will start performing the job of the cluster head as shown in Figure 2 For implementation we assumed that the next contestant node should be nearer to the cluster head C SYSTEM MODEL Based on the above system scenario the network consisting of n number of sensor nodes as well as a cluster head 050CH\051 Let us consider R D 050 CH 1  CH 2  CH 3    CH n 051 are set of FIGURE 2 Random selection of Cluster head and dead cluster heads cluster head nodes S D 050 SN 1  SN 2  SN 3     SN n 051 is the set of source nodes whereas D D 050 DN 1  DN 2  DN 3  DN n 051 is the set of destination nodes We have assumed that to avoid orthogonal signals OFDMA are available in the network to avoid interference D COMMUNICATION MODEL To evaluate system model the power transmission calculation has been made using source and relay node denoted by W s i and W D j  where W represents power s represents source node and d represents destination node If a node i transmit data to node j with the power of W then we can have the signal to noise ratio 050SNR\051 015 ij at the target node as 015 ij D W i  N o k i  j k 013 0501\051 In Eq 0501\051 N o is the white noise k i  j k 013 is the Euclidean distance between nodes i nodes j whereas 013 is considered as path loss Also in the given scenario the source or destination nodes either transmit or receive data with the help of CH Therefore to calculate the data rate between the source and destination we have used the following equation C D 050 s i  d i 051 D B Log 2 0501 C 015 s i  d i 051  0502\051 In the Eq 0502\051 B represents the available bandwidth To transmit data from source to destination the source and destination pair can either use amplify-and-forward or decode-andforward communication mode For our proposed scenario we have adopted the technique of decode-and-forward As a result of that the source node broadcasts data for the destination node The neighboring nodes as well as CH also receives the same copy of data Afterward the CH decode the data 034rst and then transmits the data toward the destination E TRAFFIC MODEL For our proposed system architecture we assumed that data generated by i th source node follows the Poison Distribution System having mean rate of 016 i  Similarly the traf\034c load is based on general distribution with the mean traf\034c load of T i  Therefore the total amount of traf\034c load being generated VOLUME 5 2017 5073 


S Din et al  Cluster-Based Data Fusion Technique to Analyze Big Data  between source and destination via p-AGW is 0 i  j D 016 i  T i  026 i  j  C DF 050 SN i  DN i  CH i 051 0503\051 where 026 i  j represents the indicator function C DF represents decode-and-forward In case if 026 i  j D 1 then the i th source and destination pair will transmit via j th number of CH Hence the traf\034c load 050 T i 051 in the j th number of CH will be calculated as 016 j D X i 2 s 0 i  j 0504\051 where 016 j represents the time when CH is busy Moreover CH acts as a relay node between source and destination node based on the round robin mode Afterw ard the CH comprehends the M/G/1 processing sharing queue F or instance if we increase the number of CH and assign it to multiple source and destination nodes then the overall effect on the transmission will be drastically increased which can be calculated as C eff 050 SN i  DN i  GW i 051 D C DF 050 SN i  DN i  CH i 051\0501 000 016 j 051  0505\051 F ENERGY MODEL In a given scenario an assumption has been made that each node receives and transmit the data packet with equal battery power Therefore the energy used by each node autonomously depends on the Euclidean distance between nodes i nodes j As a result energy consumed by each node is calculated as E D R b C T b 0506\051 In the above equation E represents the amount of energy consumed by a node R b represents receiving bits and T b represents transmitted bits These two parameters are used to calculate the total amount of data being received by a node Also they are used during simulation results in order to calculate energy consumption as well as delay in a network In order to calculate total amount of data being collected by medical sensors in one cycle c we have D c T D D c R C S D 0507\051 where S D represents the total amount of data being collected by a node in one cycle Cycle represents one complete round of data transmission by each node in a cluster started from node I to node n Moreover nodes forward their data in multi-hop manner via CH Therefore Eq 0508\051 describes the relationship between all the nodes and the overall summation of hops in a network X k n D 1 D c R D X k n H CH 002 Z  0508\051 where H p 000 AGW represents source to destination H p 000 AGW D 0 if a sender is itself a CH And Z represents any node in a cluster This equation is used to calculate overall number of hops from source to destination It is used to 034nd out the total transmission delay in a network such that if the number of nodes increases the effect will be on total transmission delay as well as energy consumption However in the proposed scheme the feature of scalability helps the network to maintain the transmission delay as well as energy consumption per node Finally total energy consumption can be calculated as the overall sum of hops from all the CH W D X k n D 1 W n D X k n D 1 E 050 D c R C S D 051  0509\051 where W n represents the energy consumption of node i per cycle By calculating total energy consumption of a network the network is divided into various clusters where each cluster has cluster head that is used to aggregate the data All the nodes send their respective data to the cluster head via hopby-hop manner thus minimizing the total amount of energy being used by each sensor IV PROPOSED SCHEME The majority of the clustering algorithm are based on three phases i.e setup phase steady phase and routing phase Setup phase is related to the design of cluster where the communication process starts with cluster formation Usually this phase is referred to of\035ine or passive phase since all the control packets are broadcasted in this phase and no data is transmitted Moreover steady and routing phase comes in an operational or active phase where data is in the network for aggregation as well as routing The proposed solution is explained in the above context in the subsequent sections A SELF-ORGANIZING The nodes are deployed either randomly or uniformly switching on their transceivers they start broadcasting control packet to show their existence The neighboring nodes receive their broadcast message and set up their neighboring table Setup of neighboring table helps the node to calculate link quality and other necessary calculations that help them in making future decisions Initially the energy level of all the sensor nodes is equal The self-organizing capability is widely exploited by exchanging node's information such as location energy level etc The proposed scheme set up neighboring table at each deployed node by just placing adjacent count in it rather than all the info of neighboring nodes Such mechanism saves energy Figure 3 shows a typical example self-organizing mechanism for our proposed scheme B FLAT LAYER DESIGN One of the main issues that usually occurs in multi-hop routing communication is frequent depletion of node's energy which is the neighbor of the base station Likewise in the clustered network where nodes are close to the base station are receiving data from different sources Such nodes are busy in communication throughout the communication period Moreover a signi\034cant amount of energy is also

S Din et al  Cluster-Based Data Fusion Technique to Analyze Big Data  FIGURE 3 Self-organizing cluster scenario as LEACH V-LEACH and TL-LEACH follows the similar fashion of communication Hence these techniques are facing a signi\034cant amount of energy depletion which is sometimes not suitable for the network Moreover frequent cluster formation also facing the same problem to the network To cope with these constraints the proposed scheme gives suitable solutions regarding clustering and routing In the proposed scheme 050shown in Algorithm 1\051 the nodes that are close to base station performed direct communication 050one-hop communication\051 and remained unclustered whereas the nodes that are one-hop away from the base station perform multi-hop communication and remain the cluster part This technique is termed as a 035at layer as shown in Figure 4  Algorithm 1 Function of Flat Layer  BS BC Msg 050 setup init 051 R 050 B T x 051 D 100m Set Node 050 R x 051 D Node L 1 Node L 1 BC Ctr n i Set TRX of Node L 1 D Sleepmode for speci\034c time limit If Node 050 R x 051  2 Node L 1 Pckt D Received Set Node 050 R x 051 D Node L 2 End if  FIGURE 4 First flat layer of proposed scheme The nodes that are deployed in 035at layer are termed as First Layer Nodes 050 Node L 1 051 Moreover the subsequent layers are mode on the basis of the node's transmission range 050previous layer\051 The transmission range of MICAz node in outer environment is 75-100m whereas an indoor environment is 20-30m The netw ork clustering is started from 2nd layer till the network boundary in which the cluster heads are selected by decision making nodes of the 1st layer 050discussed in later section\051 This technique not only helps the energy consumption but also reduces the load on the neighboring nodes 050in term of load balancing\051 Both the factors i.e saving energy as well as load balancing on nodes results in increasing the network lifetime C DESIGN OF CLUSTERING LAYER When it comes to centralized clustering technique all the nodes in the network required to broadcast the decision metric information to the base station Such technique consumes a lot of energy Moreover this technique is also inappropriate for large scale network where direct hop communication is harmful to data transmission 050e.g distance between nodes is high\051 Therefore to avoid such problem the only solution that cope-up with such constraints is to transmit decision metric information toward base station using multi-hop communication In such scenario the overall energy consumption is directly proportional to the size of the network We have used below notations in our explanation Apparently distributed clustering technique involves internode communication to elect/select the cluster head and its members In this method the inter-node communication messaging is equal to the multiple of n nodes Therefore the size of the cluster is sometimes not 034xed Hence it is dif\034cult to manage Having such drawbacks the proposed scheme using multi-layered probabilistic clustering algorithm ef\034caciously solved the problems offered by centralized and distributed clustering technique In the proposed technique the neighboring node that prefers one node over another in order to select various positions 050such as decision making and cluster head\051 at several steps where decision-making node 050those nodes that are used for selecting cluster head from the consequent layers\051 and packet ID and post\034x counter 050such as packet ID is used for grouping the nodes which prefer one node over another for selecting cluster head\051 are the major factors in the design of cluster Furthermore the 2nd layer nodes 050 Node L 2 051 elect those nodes which is surrounded by maximum number of nodes 050i.e where density of the nodes is high\051 as a decision making node 050i.e Node 050 dm 051 051 i.e Cnt n i  Cnt n k 8 i and k D 1  2  3     k where k belongs to similar group Such technique helps in minimizing the energy consumption during the design of clusters which results in increasing network lifetime as shown in Figure 5 The nodes involve in 2nd layer 050 Node L 2 051 interchange the information of their density to Node 050 dm 051  so that they may take part in the computation of becoming cluster head These nodes turn-on their transceiver by using time division multiple access 050TDMA\051 technique The 034rst node in Node L 2 want to interchange their node density information to Node 050 dm 051  it is assigned by sequence number 050 Pkt 050 Seq _ no 051 051 along with the VOLUME 5 2017 5075

S Din et al  Cluster-Based Data Fusion Technique to Analyze Big Data  since the area is divided into two different layers By dividing they are minimizing the distance by grouping the nodes Hence they can easily deliver the data via short which results in dropping less number of packets as shown in Figure 12 FIGURE 12 A number of packets broadcasted during formation of cluster FIGURE 13 Number of cluster formation To conclude our simulation we have further extended our simulation scenario toward the formation of cluster heads If we consider a large scale and medium scale network some the cluster will be increasing in large scale network since the node density is very high Apparently due to less number of nodes 050i.e 100 nodes\051 in medium scale network there will be a minimum number of clusters formation occurs as shown in Figure 13 In this 034gure the proposed scheme has dominant over the rest of competing algorithms since the cluster formation is based on the density of the nodes Also in the competing algorithms the formation of the cluster is not on the basis of node density Thus it results in congestion on the network which ultimately results in decreasing the lifetime of the network The results can be in Figure 14 if we have medium scale network 050comprises of 100 nodes\051 the energy consumption of the proposed scheme during formation of the cluster is very less as compared to the rest of competing algorithms A HADOOP-BASED IMPLEMENTATION OF DATA FUSION MODEL The main purpose of the proposed scheme is to enhance the ef\034ciency of the proposed scheme using data fusion FIGURE 14 Total energy consumption during formation of cluster model based on Hadoop system To validate the system we consider some example scenarios These example scenarios help us in implementing our proposed architecture For this purpose this section provides the details about the analyzing datasets of various sizes the tools we use for the analysis and the implementation of the proposed algorithm on Hadoop system B DATASETS TOOLS AND IMPLEMENTATION ENVIRONMENT In this describe the detailed description about the data sets we used for our analysis Please note that the datasets that are used for analysis are only to check the system performance of the proposed system based on Hadoop Datasets are related to the healthcare system which comprises Glucose level of the patients ECG temperature and various other activities We developed and test the proposed fusion algorithm to enhance the processing ef\034ciency using Big Data on corei5 3.20GHz 002 4 UBUNTU 14.04 local machine with Hadoop single node setup having 4GB RAM and Gallium 0.4 on AMD OLAND graphics Analyze function is used to break down the data into smaller chunks so that interested feature shall be detected in an ef\034cient way Initially data is arranged in a 034xed size cell called block and in each block there are various statistical parameters are associated with it Hence if the data block does not meet the threshold value then it means that the block does not contain any of the interested features Moreover if the interested parameter is found in the data block then the anomalies as well as false-positive are minimized by exploiting mean difference comparison The difference is calculated between mean values of the interested region and the whole block by 050 j  X _RDC 000 N X _B j 051 Moreover the pixel value for each interested region is denorted by 050\050NP_RDC\051 These parameters are mapped with the different threshold in order to minimize false-positive in the data sets as shown in Figure 15 The combination of results is made at each cluster head Since the data is divided for each parallel processing performing the algorithm mentioned above at each level Now we need to combine the results which are being generated VOLUME 5 2017 5079
