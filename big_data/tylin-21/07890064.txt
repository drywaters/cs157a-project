The proposed heuristic algorithm is based on our original concept, known as ìWorst Schedule Length \(WSL It derives the lower bound of the total execution time of the cluster for each processor using WSL, then the processor which contributes to minimize WSL is chos en as an assignment target Task clustering is then performed to get minimal response time i.e., minimal schedule length\. We show that our proposed method has advantages over existing conventional approaches through the evaluation results Keywords  Big Data, Distributed Processing, Fast Fourier Transform, Task Graph I I NTRODUCTION Distributed processing is indispensable when dealing with large scale of data like big data Especially in cases of heterogeneous distributed systems with various processing speed and communication bandwidth it is necessary to assign multiple tasks to multiple proc essors adequately Assuming a job is expressed as DAG \(Directed Acyclic Graph it is necessary to develop a task clustering algorithm to assign multiple processors to multiple tasks. DAG is a directed graph where nodes represent tasks and directed edges represent the dependency among tasks. Assigning tasks in DAG to processers to minimize the response time is known as NPcomplete problem  and several heuristic algorithms have already been proposed such as HEFT \(Heterogeneous Earliest Finish Time   H o w e v er these a re not eff icie n t  f o r j obs t h at transfer large amounts of data In this paper, the evaluation result of the task clustering heuris algorithm proposed for data intensive jobs on heterogeneous distributed systems is shown. The proposed heuristic algorithm is based on our original concept, known as Worst Schedule Length \(WSL We derive the lower bound of the cluster size assigned to ea ch processor using WSL, then the processor which contributes to minimize WSL is chosen as an assignment target. Then the task clustering is performed to get minimal response time \(i.e., minimal schedule length\. We show that our proposal has advantages over existing conventional approaches through the evaluation results II A SSUMED M ODEL A Job Model We assume that a job is expressed as a directed acyclic graph \(DAG\which is known as a workflow type job G S cls  V s E s V s cls Fig 1 is the DAG, where V is the set of tasks E is the set of edges \(data communications among tasks\nd V s cls is the set of task clusters including one or more tasks by s task clustering steps Figure 1 Example of Job Model [3 This means that G S cls has V s nclustered tasks and  V V s cls for s = 0. The i-th task is denoted as n s i and let 94 ISBN 978-89-968650-9-4 ICACT2017 Februar y 19 ~ 22, 2017 


w  n s i  be the size of n s i i.e w  n s i  is the sum of unit times for processing by the reference processor. We define data dependency and direction of data transfer from n s i to n s j as e i,j  where c  e i,j  is the sum of unit times for transferring data from n s i to n s j over the reference communication link One constraint imposed by a DAG is that a task cannot start execution until all data from its predecessor tasks arrive pred  n s i e set of immediate predecessors of n s i and suc  n s i  is the set of immediate successors of n s i If pred  n s i    n s i is called START task, and if suc  n i    n s i is called END task. If there are one or more path form n s i to n s j we denote such a relation as n s i n s j  B System Model We assume each computer in the system model isconnected to others with various processing speeds and communication bandwidths. Data transfer time within one computer is supposed to be negligible C Task Clustering Task clustering is to merge task s into a cluster to localize data transfer and tasks in a clu ster are assigned to the same PE processing element Also by localization of data transfer c  e i,j  i.e., data transfer time becomes zero in the cluster Procedure of task clustering is as follows Let cls  i  be the i-th cluster in V s cls If n s i is included in cls  i  after the s 1\th task merging step, we formulate one task merging step as cls s 1  i  cls s U  n s k  Task clustering is finished when a certain criterion is satisfied otherwise the process mentioned above is repeated III.M INIMIZING W ORST S CHEDULE L ENGTH MWSL A Worst Schedule Length\(WSL WSL is the maximum execution path length, in case  each task is executed as late as possible in a PE, provided that there is no data waiting time for each task once the PE starts execution. That is, WSL is a value determined for each task that is assigned to the PE so that if it is assigned minimized WSL it can be shown that the actual lower bound and the upper bound of the schedule length becomes smaller  Table 1 shows notations for deriving WSL WSL  M  G s cls  is the maximum of LV s  cls s  i which corresponds to the maximum of level  n s i here n s i cls s  i  level  n s i s the maximum time duration from the START task to the END task in case n s i is scheduled as late as possible.

Figure 2 State after 4 task merging [3 B Algorithm MWSL consists of the following 2 phases  1\Phase-1  We define as a lower bound of the execution time at a task cluster At first we identify the path generating WSL by using virtual PE with the maximum processing speed and maximum communication bandwidth we shall call virtual PE We derive the upper bound of the WSL for each clustering step. Such upper bo und of WSL is a function of  processing speed and communication bandwidth of PE Next we choose a PE minimizing the upper bound of WSL from PEs that have not been assigned to clusters then differentiate the upper bound of the WSL with respect to and get the minimum value of the upper bound of WSL Figure 3 Try to minimize WSL [3  2\Phase-2 In MWSL, two clusters are merged into a new task cluster in order to reduce WSL. The first one is called "pivot", and the other is called as "target t  f i rst a task cluster, which dominates WSL is selected as pivot. Then a task cluster, by which WSL reduction is achieved by merging it with pivot, is selecte d as a target. This merging step is repeated until execution time of the new cluster exceeds the opt   Phases 1 and 2 are repeated until all tasks are merged into clusters and assigned to PEs IV.E VALUATION R ESULT A Evaluation Method We compare the proposed algorithm with HEFT by using specific jobs We chose FFT \(Fast Fourier Transform\ as the exemplary job. Next we generated FFT DAG and implemented it using a simulation program The maximum to minimum ratio in terms of processing speed and communication bandwidth are set to 10, respectively. Then we derived the response time by averaging 100 DAGs for the comparison. As for the characteris tic of each DAG, we varied CCR \(Communication to Computation Ratio\ging from 1 5, and 10. CCR in this simulation is derived by the averaged data transfer time to the av eraged processing time i.e CCR=1 means transferred data is the same as processing tasks CCR=10 is in the case of transferred data is 10 times of processing tasks B DAG of FFT In the simulation we define Butterfly Computation as one task. Therefore, the FFT DAG generates N 2 logN tasks, where N is the matrix size 5 Figure 4 The DAG of FFT in the case of N 8 If the matrix size of the FFT DAG is 8, this DAG generates 12 tasks. Moreover each task executes the same operation, so that execution time of each task is the same if the assigned processor has the same processing speed C Simulation Results The simulation of FFT has been performed in the case that N  128 and N  256 Table 1 shows the result in case that N 128 and N =256, and Table 2 shows the data showing Table 1 as a ratio of MWSL Fig.5 sh ows the result of simulation in case that N  128 and Fig.6 shows in case that N  256 96 ISBN 978-89-968650-9-4 ICACT2017 Februar y 19 ~ 22, 2017
