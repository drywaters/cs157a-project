170 Tsinghua Science and Technology April 2017 22\0502\051 160\226173 Fig 6 The impact of the number of records on 050a\051 time and 050b\051 speedup ratio of training records on the speedup ratio is shown in Fig 6b Although the speedup ratio does not achieve a linear change but the speedup ratio of the ELM 003  algorithm is slightly higher than that of the DW-ELM and IDW-ELM algorithms Increasing the number of records means that the numbers of Mapper and Reducer which need to be launched increase On the other hand it increases the number of corresponding locally accumulated summation of U and V that need to be transmitted leading to increased transmission time of the intermediate results Therefore the training times of the DW-ELM and IDW-ELM algorithms increase with the increasing number of training records In addition the training time of the IDW-ELM algorithm is less than that of the DW-ELM algorithm which further veri\002es the validity of the improved algorithm Next we investigate the impact of the number of classes As shown in Fig 7a along with the increasing number of classes the training times of the ELM 003  and DW-ELM algorithms are basically stable while Fig 7 The impact of the number of classes on 050a\051 time and 050b\051 speedup ratio the training time of the IDW-ELM algorithm is slightly increased and it is always less than the training time of the DW-ELM algorithm The in\003uence of changing the number of classes on speedup ratio is shown in Fig 7b and the speedup ratio remains stable The number of classes increases which only increases the number of statistical values in the 002rst MapReduce job and subsequently the number of input values in the second MapReduce job of the DW-ELM algorithm which has limited impact on the overall training time so the training time is relatively stable However the increase in the number of classes makes the number of output intermediate results of the Mapper class in the IDWELM algorithm increase and to a certain extent this leads to the transmission time of the intermediate results to increase so the training time increases slightly In addition the training time of the IDW-ELM algorithm is less than that of the DW-ELM algorithm which means that although the effects of the improved algorithm decrease slightly with the increase in the number of 


Zhiqiong Wang et al Distributed and Weighted Extreme Learning Machine for Imbalanced Big Data Learning 171 classes the optimization effect is still good Finally we investigate the impact of imbalance ratio As shown in Fig 8a with the increasing imbalance ratio the training times of the ELM 003   DW-ELM and IDW-ELM algorithms are basically stable and the training time of the IDW-ELM algorithm is always lower than that of the DW-ELM algorithm Also the training time of the ELM 003  algorithm is lower than that of the IDW-ELM algorithm The variation in speedup ratio of changing the imbalance ratio of the training records is shown in Fig 8b and the speedup ratio remains stable Increasing the imbalance ratio did not produce any substantial effects on the calculation process of the MapReduce job so the training time is relatively stable Since the training time of the IDW-ELM algorithm is less than that of the DWELM algorithm this further veri\002es the validity of the improved algorithm From the results of the six groups the training time of the ELM 003  algorithm is less than that of the DWFig 8 The impact of the imbalance ratio on 050a\051 time and 050b\051 speedup ratio ELM algorithm in each group of experiments The reason is because in the DW-ELM algorithm training process the number of samples in each category needed to be 002rst counted that is calculate the diagonal elements of the weight matrix W in the Map phase then the H T H and H T T matrices were calculated in the MapReduce calculation while only H T H and H T T matrices needed to be counted in the Map phase of the ELM 003  algorithm However the G-mean value of the ELM 003  algorithm in managing the unbalanced data was signi\002cantly lower than that of the DW-ELM algorithm which apparently was not applicable to the imbalance BD learning 5 Conclusion Neither the WELM nor the DELM algorithms manage the imbalanced big training data ef\002ciently since they only consider either the 223big\224 or the 223imbalanced\224 aspect of imbalanced big training data and not both In this study we proposed a DW-ELM algorithm based on the MapReduce framework The DW-ELM algorithm makes full use of the parallel computing ability of the MapReduce framework and realizes ef\002cient learning of imbalanced BD Speci\002cally through analyzing the characteristics of the WELM algorithm we found that the matrix multiplication operators 050i.e H T WH and H T WT 051 within the WELM algorithm are decomposable Then we transformed the corresponding matrix multiplication operators into summation forms which suited the MapReduce framework well and proposed a DWELM algorithm to calculate the matrix multiplications using two MapReduce jobs Furthermore an IDWELM algorithm which only uses one MapReduce job to complete the tasks was proposed to improve the performance of the DW-ELM algorithm Finally in the cluster environment we performed a detailed validation of the performance of the DW-ELM and IDW-ELM algorithms with various experimental settings The experimental results show that the DW-ELM and IDWELM algorithms can learn imbalanced BD ef\002ciently Acknowledgment This research was partially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China 050Nos 61402089 61472069 and 61501101\051 the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities 050Nos N161904001 N161602003 and N150408001\051 the Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province 050No
