M Marjani et al  Big IoT Data Analytics Architecture Opportunities and Open Research Challenges  communication of the Internet and various webs The upper layer concerns big data analytics where a large amount of data received from sensors are stored in the cloud and accessed through big data analytics applications These applications contain API management and a dashboard to help in the interaction with the processing engine A novel meta-model-based approach for integrating IoT architecture objects is proposed The concept is semiautomatically federated into a holistic digital enterprise architecture environment The main objective is to provide an adequate decision support for complex business architecture management with the development of assessment systems and IT environment Thus architectural decisions for IoT are closely connected with code implementation to allow users to understand the integration of enterprise architecture management with IoT IV USE CASES This section presents a number of use cases for big IoT data analytics Although the use cases are relevant to IoT applications the choices have been guided for the ones that are most commonly used in IoT applications and for the amount of data that can be generated for analytics A SMART METERING Smart metering is one of the IoT application use cases that generates a large amount of data from different sources such as smart grids tank levels and water 035ows and silos stock calculation in which processing takes a long time even on a dedicated and powerful machine A smart meter is a device that electronically records consumption of electric energy data between the meter and the control system Collecting and analyzing smart meter data in IoT environment assist the decision maker in predicting electricity consumption Furthermore the analytics of a smart meter can also be used to forecast demands to prevent crises and satisfy strategic objectives through speci\034c pricing plans Thus utility companies must be capable of high-volume data management and advanced analytics designed to transform data into actionable insights B SMART TRANSPORTATION A smart transportation system is an IoT-based use case that aims to support the smart city concept A smart transportation system intends to deploy powerful and advanced communication technologies for the management of smart cities Traditional transportation systems which are based on image processing are affected by weather conditions such as heavy rains and thick fog Consequently the captured image may not be clearly visible The design of an e-plate system using RFID technology provides a good solution for intelligent monitoring tracking and identi\034cation of vehicles Moreover introducing IoT into vehicular technologies will enable traf\034c congestion management to exhibit signi\034cantly better performance than the existing infrastructure This technology can improve existing traf\034c systems in which vehicles can effectively communicate with one another in a systematic manner without human intervention Satellite navigation systems and sensors can also be applied in trucks ships and airplanes in real time The routing of these vehicles can be optimized by using the bulk of available public data such as traf\034c jams road conditions delivery addresses weather conditions and locations of re\034lling stations For example in case of runtime address change the updated information 050route cost\051 can be optimized recalculated and passed on to drivers in real time Sensors incorporated into these vehicles can also provide real-time information to measure engine health determine whether equipment requires maintenance and predict errors C SMART SUPPLY CHAINS Embedded sensor technologies can communicate bidirectionally and provide remote accessibility to over 1 million elevators worldwide The captured data are used by onand off-site technicians to run diagnostics and repair options to make appropriate decisions which result in increased machine uptime and enhanced customer service Ultimately big IoT data analytics allows a supply chain to execute decisions and control the external environment IoT-enabled factory equipment will be able to communicate within data parameters 050i.e machine utilization temperature\051 and optimize performance by changing equipment settings or process work\035ow In-transit visibility is another use case that will play a vital role in future supply chains in the presence of IoT infrastructure Key technologies used by intransit visibility are RFIDs and cloud-based Global Positioning System 050GPS\051 which provide location identity and other tracking information These data will be the backbone of supply chains supported by IoT technologies The information gathered by equipment will provide detailed visibility of an item shipped from a manufacturer to a retailer Data collected via RFID and GPS technologies will allow supply chain managers to enhance automated shipment and accurate delivery information by predicting time of arrival Similarly managers will be able to monitor other information such as temperature control which can affect the quality of in-transit products D SMART AGRICULTURE Smart agriculture is a bene\034cial use case in big IoT data analytics Sensors are the actors in the smart agriculture use case They are installed in 034elds to obtain data on moisture level of soil trunk diameter of plants microclimate condition and humidity level as well as to forecast weather Sensors transmit obtained data using network and communication devices These data pass through an IoT gateway and the Internet to reach the analytics layer shown in Table 1 The analytics layer processes the data obtained from the sensor network to issue commands Automatic climate control according to harvesting requirements timely and controlled irrigation and humidity control for fungus prevention are 5254 VOLUME 5 2017

M Marjani et al  Big IoT Data Analytics Architecture Opportunities and Open Research Challenges  decisions have to be made with regard to ethical factors such as what to use how to use and why use generated big IoT data Another security risk associated with IoT data is the heterogeneity of the types of devices used and the nature of generated data such as raw devices data types and communication protocols These devices can have different sizes and shapes outside the network and are designed to communicate with cooperative applications Thus to authenticate these devices an IoT system should assign a non-repudiable identi\034cation system to each device Moreover enterprises should maintain a meta-repository of these connected devices for auditing purposes This heterogeneous IoT architecture is new to security professionals and thus results in increased security risks Consequently any attack in this scenario compromises system security and disconnects interconnected devices In the context of big IoT data security and privacy are the key challenges in processing and storing huge amounts of data Moreover to perform critical operations and host private data these systems highly rely on third party services and infrastructure Therefore an exponential growth in data rate causes dif\034culty in securing each and every portion of critical data As previously discussed existing security solutions 050Karim 2016 86\051 are no long applicable to providing complete security in big IoT data scenarios Existing algorithms are not designed for the dynamic observation of data and thus are not effectively applied Legacy data security solutions are speci\034cally designed for static data sets whereas current data requirements are changing dynamically 050Lafuente 2015\051 Thus deploying these security solutions is dif\034cult for dynamically increasing data In addition legislative and regulatory issues should be considered while signing SLAs With regard to data generated through IoT the following security problems can emerge 050a\051 timely updates dif\034culty in keeping systems up to date 050b\051 incident management identifying suspicious traf\034c patterns among legitimate ones and possible failure to capture unidenti\034able incidents 050c\051 interoperability proprietary and vendorspeci\034c procedures will pose dif\034culties in 034nding hidden or zero day attacks 050d\051 and protocol convergence although IPv6 is currently compatible with the latest speci\034cations this protocol has yet to be fully deployed Therefore the application of security rules over IPv4 may not be applicable to protecting IPv6 At present no answer can address these challenges and manage the security and privacy of interconnected devices However the following guidelines can overcome these adversities 050a\051 First a true open ecosystem with standard APIs is necessary to avoid interoperability and reliability problems 050b\051 Second devices must be well protected while communicating with peers 050c\051 Third devices should be hardcoded with the best security practices to protect against common security and privacy threats B DATA MINING Data mining methods provide ef\034cient and best-\034tting predictive or descriptive solutions for big data that can also be generalized for new data The e v olution of big IoT data and cloud computing platforms has brought the challenges of data exploration and information extraction Ho we v er  for the overall big IoT data architecture Figure 5 presents the primary challenges related to processing and data mining Exhaustive data reads/writes The high-volume highvelocity and high-variety qualities of big IoT data challenge exploration integration heterogeneous communication and extraction processes The size and heterogeneity of data impose new data mining requirements and diversity in data sources also poses a challenge  Furthermore compared with small data sets large data sets comprise more abnormalities and ambiguities that require additional preprocessing steps such as cleansing reduction and transmission 83 Another issue lies in the e xtraction of e xact and knowledgeable information from the large volumes of diverse data Consequently obtaining accurate information from complex data requires analyzing data properties and 034nding association among different data points Researchers have introduced parallel and sequential programming models and proposed different algorithms to minimize query response time while dealing with big data FIGURE 5 Big data mining issues in IoT VOLUME 5 2017 5257 


M Marjani et al  Big IoT Data Analytics Architecture Opportunities and Open Research Challenges  Moreover researchers have selected existing data mining algorithms in different manners to 050a\051 improve single source knowledge discovery 050b\051 implement data mining methods for multi-source platforms and 050c\051 study and analyze dynamic data mining methods and stream data Hence parallel k means algorithm and parallel association rule mining methods are introduced Ho we v er  the need to de vise algorithms remains to provide compatibility with the latest parallel architectures Moreover synchronization issues may occur in parallel computing while information is exchanged within different data mining methods This bottleneck of data mining methods has become an open issue in big IoT data analytics that should be addressed C VISUALIZATION Visualization is an important entity in big data analytics particularly when dealing with IoT systems where data are generated enormously Furthermore conducting data visualization is dif\034cult because of the large size and high dimension of big data This situation shows underlying trends and a complete picture of parsed data Therefore big data analytics and visualization should work seamlessly to obtain the best results from IoT applications in big data However visualization in the case of heterogeneous and diverse data 050unstructured structured and semi-structured\051 is a challenging task Designing visualization solution that is compatible with advanced big data indexing frameworks is a dif\034cult task Similarly response time is a desirable factor in big IoT data analytics Consequently cloud computing architectures supported with rich GUI facilities can be deployed to obtain better insights into big IoT data trends Different dimensionality reduction methods have been introduced as a result of complex and high-dimensional big IoT data 88 Ho we v er  these methods are unsuitable for all types of presented data Similarly when 034negrained dimensions are visualized effectively the probability to identify observable correlations patterns and outliners is high Moreo v er  data should be k ept locally to obtain usable information ef\034ciently because of power and bandwidth constraints In addition visualization software should run with the concept of reference locality to achieve ef\034cient outcome in an IoT environment Given that the amount of big IoT data is increasing rapidly the requirement of enormous parallelization is a challenging task in visualization Thus to decompose a problem into manageable independent tasks to enforce concurrent execution of queries is a challenge for parallel visualization algorithms At present most big data visualization tools used for IoT exhibit poor performance results in terms of functionality scalability and response time To provide effective uncertainty-aware visualization during the visual analytics process avoiding uncertainty imposes a considerable challenge Furthermore se v eral important issues are addressed such as 050a\051 visual noise most data set objects are closely related to one another and thus users may perceive different results of the same type 050b\051 information loss applying reduction methods to visible data sets can cause information loss 050c\051 large image observation data visualization tools have inherent problems with respect to aspect ratio devise resolution and physical perception limits 050d\051 frequently changing image users will not notice rapid data changes in an output and 050e\051 high performance requirements high performance requirements are imposed because data are generated dynamically in an IoT environment Moreover methods supported by advanced analytics enable interactive graphics on laptops desktops or mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets Real-time analytics is another consideration highlighted in IoT architectures Several guidelines on visualization in big data are presented such as 050a\051 data aw areness i.e appropriate domain expertise 050b\051 data quality cleaning data using information management or data governance policies 050c\051 meaningful results data clustering is used to provide high-level abstraction such that the visibility of smaller groups of data is possible and 050d\051 outliers should be removed from the data or treated as a separate entity Reference suggested that visualization should adhere to the following guidelines 050a\051 the system should provide special attention to metadata 050b\051 visualization software should be interactive and should require maximum user involvement and 050c\051 tools should be built based on the dynamic nature of the generated data D INTEGRATION Integration refers to having a uniform view of different formats Data integration provides a single view of the data arriving from different sources and combines the view of data Data inte gration includes all processes in v olv ed in collecting data from different sources as well as in storing and providing data with a uni\034ed view For each moment different forms of data are continuously generated by social media IoT and other communication and telecommunication approaches The produced data can be categorized into three groups 050a\051 structured data such as data stored in traditional database systems including tables with rows and columns 050b\051 semi-structured such as HTML XML and Json 034les and 050c\051 unstructured data such as videos audios and images Good data offer good information however this relationship is only achieved through data integration Inte grating diverse data types is a complex task in merging different systems or applications Ov erlapping the same data increasing performance and scalability and enabling realtime data access are among the challenges associated with data integration that should be addressed in the future Another challenge is to adjust structures in semi-structured and unstructured data before integrating and analyzing these types of data Information such as entities and relationships can be extracted from textual data by using available technologies in the eras of text mining machine learning natural processing and information extraction However new technologies should be developed to extract images videos and other information from other non-text 5258 VOLUME 5

extractors on the same text Hence managing and integrating different extraction results from a certain data source require other techniques VII CONCLUSION The growth rate of data production has increased drastically over the past years with the proliferation of smart and sensor devices The interaction between IoT and big data is currently at a stage where processing transforming and analyzing large amounts of data at a high frequency are necessary We conducted this survey in the context of big IoT data analytics First we explored recent analytics solutions The relationship
