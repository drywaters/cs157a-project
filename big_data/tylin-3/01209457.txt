Deriving Fuzzy Discretization from Interval Discretization Hisao Ishibuchi and Takashi Yamamoto Department of Industrial Engineering Osaka Prefecture University 1-1 Gakuen-cho Sakai Osaka 599-8531 Japan hisaoi yama Abstract  We examine two methods for deriving fuzzy discretization from interval discretization for classification problems One method uses linear membership functions with trapezoidal shape The other extends them to piecewise linear functions In both methods we use a control parameter that specifies the overlap grade between adjacent membership functions The overlap grade can he viewed as the fuzzification grade of interval discretization Through computer simulations we examine three 
interval discretization methods from which fuzzy discretization is derived equal width intervals equal frequency intervals and minimum entropy intervals We extract fuzzy rules for wine data and sonar data with many continuous attributes Simulation results show that the classification ability of fuzzy rules is improved in some cases and degraded in other cases by the increase in the fuzzification grade I INTRODUCTION When our knowledge extraction task involves numerical data with continuous attributes each attribute is usually discretized into intervals  11 2 Interval discretization has been used for handling continuous attributes in many machine learning techniques such as decision trees 31, [41 In some situations human knowledge is exactly based on interval discretization 
of continuous attributes For example the domain of our ages is\222divided into two intervals by the threshold age 20 in the following knowledge 223People under 20 are not allowed to smoke.\224 In other situations the discretization into intervals is not appropriate for describing human knowledge For example we usually use linguistic terms for dividing our ages into some categories e.g young middle-aged and old Such a linguistic term cannot be appropriately represented by an interval because there is no clear boundary between linguistic terms A mathematical framework for representing linguistic terms is fuzzy logic Fuzzy logic is a convenient tool for handling continuous attributes in 
a human understandable manner Many approaches have been proposed for extracting interpretable knowledge in a form of linguistic rules from numerical data e.g 5l-[Sl Those studies usually assume that a set of linguistic terms is given for each attribute That is it is assumed that each attribute has already been partitioned into some linguistic terms In real-world applications fuzzy discretization is not always available Our idea in this paper is to utilize interval discretization methods investigated in many studies 11-[4 for generating fuzzy discretization We use fuzzy rules of the following type for pattern classification problems with n attributes 9 Rule 
R If xI is Aql and  and x is A then Class C with CF 1 where R is the label of the qth fuzzy rule x  xI  xn is an n-dimensional pattern vector A is an antecedent fuzzy set for the ith attribute Cq is a class label and CF is a rule weight The consequent class Cy and the rule weight CFq are specified from training patterns in a heuristic manner 9 ll The fuzzy rule R can be viewed as a fuzzy association rule A 
s Cy where A is the antecedent fuzzy vector A  Aq1  Aqn The confidence and support of fuzzy association rules are calculated by extending their standard definitions I21 to the case of fuzzy discretization SI 13 In this paper we show how fuzzy discretization can be derived from interval discretization We examine two methods for deriving fuzzy discretization One is based on linear membership functions with trapezoidal shape 13 14 The other extends them to piecewise linear functions In both methods we use a control parameter that specifies the overlap grade between adjacent membership functions The overlap grade can he viewed as the fuzzification grade of interval discretization Interval 
discretization is a special case of fuzzy discretization where the overlap grade is zero This paper is organized as follows In Section 11 we briefly describe a heuristic method for determining the consequent class and the rule weight of each fuzzy rule Then we explain some advantages of fuzzy discretization in Section 111 Two methods for deriving fuzzy discretization from interval discretization are explained in Section IV In Section V we examine the effect of the fuzzification of interval rules through computer simulations on wine data and sonar data using various values of the overlap grade Finally Section VI concludes this

On the other hand there is no overlap in the case of interval discretization. This difference is illustrated in Fig 1 where 14 training pattems are given in the two-dimensional pattem space O 11 The pattem space is divided into 25 regions We assume that each region has a single rule In Fig 1 a with fuzzy discretization 22 fuzzy rules in the shaded cells are compatible with at least one training pattem This means that those rules can be generated from the training pattems On the other hand only nine rules are compatible with at least one training pattern in the case of interval discretization in Fig 1 b 750 The IEEE International Conlerence on Fuzzy Systems 


Class 1 0 Class 2 10 00  I a Fuzzy discretization 1.0 0.0 MS'M IML  AHIH,H;A b Interval discretization Fig 1 Generated rules from the given training patterns As shown in Fig I much more fuzzy rules can be generated from a small number of training patterns than the case of interval discretization This characteristic feature has a large effect on the classification ability of rules when only a small number of training patterns are available in the pattern space with fine discretization Another advantage of fuzzy discretization is that more training patterns are involved in the generation of each fuzzy rule than the case of inferval discretization Let us consider the rule M M Cq in Fig 1 In the case of interval discretization the consequent class C is determined as Class 2 by the three training patterns in the small square at the center of Fig 1 b On the other hand the consequent class C is determined as Class 1 from the five training patterns in the dotted square at the center of Fig 1 a in the case of fuzzy discretization As shown in this example more training patterns are involved in the determination of the consequent class of each fuzzy rule than the corresponding interval rule This may help fuzzy rules to avoid the overfitting to training patterns B Advantages in Classification Phase Characteristic features of fuzzy discretization in the classification phase stem from the fact that multiple fuzzy rules overlap with one another in the pattern space. In general each fuzzy rule covers a much larger region than the corresponding interval rule For example the fuzzy rule M M  Cq covers the large dotted square at the center of Fig 1 a while the corresponding interval rule covers the smaller square at the center of Fig 1 b The difference in the size of covered regions between fuzzy and interval rules leads to the difference in their classification ability Better results are usually obtained from fuzzy discretization than interval discretization when only a small number of long rules are used in a high-dimensional pattern space with fine discretization The classification boundary is determined by the rule weight of each fuzzy rule in addition to its antecedent fuzzy sets in the case of fuzzy discretization IO l I On the other hand the classification boundary is determined by the threshold values i.e lower and upper limits of each interval in the case of interval discretization This suggests that the use of fuzzy discretization may improve the classification ability of rules ugh rule weights when interval discretization is not fine-tuned IV DERIVING FUZZY DISCRETIZATION Let us assume that the domain interval O 11 of an attribute is divided into K intervals I 12  IK Each interval Ij is denoted by its lower limit Ij and upper limit U as Ij  Ij,uj where 1 0 uK I and uj 1,+1 for j 1,2  K  1 Our task is to derive K fuzzy sets A A  AKJ from the given K intervals \(i.e to derive fuzzy discretization from interval discretization A Fuzzy Discretimtion with Linear Membership Functions First we briefly describe a specification method of linear membership functions with trapezoidal shape which are extended to piecewise linear functions in the next subsection As shown in Fig 2 we denote each trapezoidal membership function A by its four parameters as A aj bj cj dj a I b cj  4 j I 1 4 1 Ij+l I I Fig 2 Trapezoidal membership function of the luzzy set A 751 The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 


The fuzzy discretization A A  A is derived from the interval discretization I I  1 based on the following constraint conditions see Fig 2 a Membership functions are linear b The sum of neighboring membership functions is 1 c Crossing points of neighboring membership functions coincide with the threshold values in the interval discretization d The membership function of each intermediate fuzzy set i.e A  A  AK  is 1 at the midpoint of the corresponding interval The membership function of the smallest i.e left-most fuzzy set AI is 1 at the lower bound of the domain interval O I The membership function of the largest i.e., right-most fuzzy set A is 1 at the upper hound of the domain interval O I It should be noted that these constraint conditions do not uniquely determine the fuzzy discretization Al A  A  Fig 3 b is an example of partially fuzzified discretization while Fig 3 a shows fully fuzzified discretization Fully fuzzified discretization is obtained by maximizing the overlap grade between adjacent membership functions under the four constraint conditions see 131  141 for details We denote the overlap grade i.e fuzzification grade by F where F  1 and F  0 mean the maximum overlap and no overlap respectively.

That is N rules with the largest values of this criterion were selected for each class The heuristic rule selection was independently performed for each value of the overlap grade F Thus different rules might he selected for different values of F As we have already mentioned in Section 111 fuzzy discretization has several advantages when the pattern space is divided into small regions i.e when the granularity of the discretization is fine In our computer simulations we simultaneously used four different granularities i.e K  2.3 43 This means that some antecedent fuzzy sets of different size overlap with one another even when the overlap grade F was very small The use of such multiple partitions with different granularities decreased the superiority of fuzzy discretization over interval discretization The use of all training patterns for generating interval and fuzzy rules also decreased the superiority of fuzzy discretization Moreover interval discretization was specified from training patterns using heuristic criteria i.e equal width equal frequency and minimum entropy while fuzzy discretization was not generated from training patterns Thus the simulation conditions somewhat favor interval discretization As shown in 14 the superiority of fuzzy discretization can be easily demonstrated if we use tine discretization and a small number of training pattems In this paper we examine the effect of the fuzzification of interval rules on their classification ability using the above-mentioned conditions that somewhat favor interval discretization E Simulation Results We report simulation results for the cases of N  1 i.e only a single rule was selected for each class\and N 2 i.e only two rules were selected for each class Eleven values of the overlap grade F were examined F  0.0 0.1  1.0 Simulation results on the wine data are summarized in Fig 6 for N  1 and Fig 7 for N  2 On the other hand simulation results on the sonar data are summarized in Fig 8 for N  1 and Fig 9 for N  2 When F  0.0 the best results were obtained by minimum entropy intervals on the average i.e., the left-most triangles in Figs 6-9 The main drawback of this discretization method is long computation time The worst results were obtained by the discretization with equal width intervals \(i.e the left-most squares which requires the least computation time On the other hand when we fuzzified interval discretization i.e F O  good results were not always obtained by fuzzy discretization generated from minimum entropy intervals For example the best results were obtained from equal frequency intervals in Fig 6 when F  1.0 i.e the right-most circles This suggests the possibility that good results can be obtained without spending long computation time on discretization when we use fuzzy discretization The fuzzification of interval discretization improved the classification rates in many cases in our computer simulations on the wine data in Fig 6 and Fig 7 On the other hand the fuzzification degraded the classification rates in many cases for the sonar data in Fig 8 and Fig 9 753 The IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems

ear The speedup is 1.65 for the 2-node system indicating some degree of parallelization overhead mainly due to the interprocess communication to exchange the support count information The speedup is 3.76 for the 4-node system but the increasing rate of the speedup is 2.27 as the number of nodes is doubled from 2 to 4 As the number of nodes is doubled from 4 to 8 the increasing rate of the speedup is higher than linear again which indicates that PMIHP is quite scalable Number of Processors Time \(seconds 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 1 2 4 8 Figure 6 Total execution time of PMIHP to nd frequent 3-itemsets in 1,427 documents minsup  0.15 Number of Processors Speedup    0 2 4 6 8 2 4 8 Figure 7 Speedup of PMIHP minsup  0.15 The PMIHP algorithm has two main data mining activities counting the support of local candidate itemsets in the corresponding local database and counting the support of global candidate itemsets in multiple local databases These two activities are interleaved during the mining as the global support counting is invoked when the number of identiﬁed global candidate itemsets exceeds a certain number at each processing node which was set to 20,000 in our experiments To measure this global support counting time we reconﬁgured PMIHP to defer the global support counting of the global candidate itemsets at each node and synchronized the nodes before the start of the global support counting phase Figure 8 shows the global support counting time of the mining process with the logest run time among all the mining processes executed on different processing nodes Moreover we used the wall clock time to measure this global counting time hence it is an upper bound of the actual global support counting time of all the mining processes Comparing Figures 6 and 8 we can see that the 2-node case has a much longer global support counting phase than 4-node and 8-node cases The portion of the global support counting phase for the 2-node case is about 8 of the total execution time but it is about 4 for the 4-node case and about 3 for the 8-node case Thus the impact of the global support counting time on the overall speedup is very small and it is reduced further as the number of processing nodes increases Number of Processors Time \(seconds 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 2 4 8 Figure 8 Global support counting time to nd frequent 3-itemsets Since our processing environment does not provide the statistics for job accounting exact CPU time measurement was not feasible So we measured the average execution of a processing node using the wall clock time Figure 9 shows the average execution time of a node in the 1-node 2-node 4-node and 8-node conﬁgurations We can see that the 2-node case requires signiﬁcantly less average execution time per node than the 1-node case and as the number of processing nodes increases further the average execution time per node deceases more than linearly This result is completely consistent with the observed speedup values and also indicates that increased efﬁciency is behind the performance gain Since the identical PMIHP algorithm was executed on all of our system conﬁgurations the differences in execution time must be associated with some workload differences Figure 10 shows the average number of candidate 0-7695-2132-0/04/$17.00 \(C Proceedings of the 18th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium \(IPDPSê04

Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
