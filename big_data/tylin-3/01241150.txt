Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Using OLAP-Based Association Rules Mining Mehmet KAYA      Reda ALHAJJ Dept of Computer Engineering F\365rat University, 23119 Elaz\365 000 Turkey kaya@firatu.edu ADSA Lab, Department of Computer Science University of Calgary Calgary, Alberta, Canada ucalgary.ca Abstract In this paper we propose a novel mu ltiagent learning approach, which is based on online analytical processing OLAP\ data mining. First, we describe a data cube OLAP architecture which facilitates effective storage and processing of the state information reported by agents. This way, the action of the other agent, even not in the visual environment of 
the agent under consideration, can simply be estimated by data cube. Then, we present a new action selection model which is also based on association rules mining. Finally, we generalize ning multiple-levels association rules from the pr oposed data cube Experiments conducted on a well-known pursuit domain show the effectiveness of the proposed learning approach 1. Introduction One approach to model multiagent learning is to augment the state of each agent with the information about other existing agents [7 H o we v e r  a s the numbe r o f a g e n ts in a  multiagent environment increases, the state space of each agent grows exponentially. This way, even simple multiagent 
learning problems become computationally intractable by standard reinforcement learning approaches Although Q-learning is the most widely used method in multiagent learning, it has some drawbacks, including modeling other learning agents present in the domain as part riencing some stateaction pairs much less than others during the learning phase To overcome these problems, in this paper we propose a novel multiagent learning approach that integrates OLAP based data mining into the learning process OLAP mining integrates online analytical processing with data mining in a way that substantially enhances the power and flexibility of data mining and makes mining an interesting exploratory process  The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The necessary background on Q-learning, association rules mining and OLAP is provided in Section 2. A variant of the 
pursuit problem is described in Section 3. The proposed OLAP mining based multiagent learning approach is presented in Section 4. The conducted experiments and the results achieved are discussed in Section 5. Summary and conclusions are included in Section 6 2. Background Information In this section, we provide an overview of the three basic concepts utilized in this paper, namely, Q-learning association rules mining and OLAP technology First, Q-Learning is an incremental reinforcement learning method that can be used online and does not need a model for its application. The Q-learning algorithm stores the expected inforcement value associated with each state-action pair in a look-up table. An agent selects its action based on an action-value function, called Q-function, which is updated rience. So, consider action 
a and state s  the Q-function of action a in state s is formally defined as   max 1 365\365 Aa asQrasQasQ 365 001 212 002 003 003 where 003 0 004\003 and 002 0 004\002\004 1\ denote learning rate and discount parameter, respectively; and  ll asQ is the value of action a l in state s l  Second, association rules form an important class of regularities that exist in databases rma lly giv e n  a  set of items I ation rule is a correlation of the form X 005 
Y where I Y X 006  U and 007   YX I The intended meaning of X 005 Y is that a given transaction T 006 I which contains items in X is likely to contain items in Y as well A rule X 005 Y is generally rated according to several criteria none of which should fall below a certain \(user-defined shold. In common use are the following measures where D X   T 001 D  X 006 T denotes transactions present in database D and contain items in X 
and D X is its cardinality A measure of support defines the absolute number or the proportion of transactions present in D and contain YX U   sup YX DYX U 005 or     sup D D YX YX U 005  The confidence is the proportion of correct applications of the rule    X YX D D YX conf U 005 Third, OLAP provides users with the flexibility to view data from different perspectives, and data cube is the most popular data structure for OLAP. A cube is a data organization similar to a multidimensional array of values. It represents 
measures over several dimensions. Each dimension of the cube contains 1  i A values, where  i A is the number of distinct values at dimension i A The first  i A rows represent the distinct values of i A Each cell in these rows stores the count value generated from relations between the dimensions. The \223+1\224 term in the above formula represents a Proceedings of the IEEE/WIC International Conf erence on Intelligent Agent Technology \(IAT\22203 0-7695-1931-8/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE 


special \223Total\224 value in which each cell stores the aggregation value of the previous rows. These aggregation values show one of the essential features of cube structure  a\    \(b Figure 1 a\ A sample initial position in 15x15 pursuit domain    b\ A sample goal state 3. The Problem Domain Samples of the multiagent environment considered in this paper are shown in Figure 1. It is a variant of the well-known pursuit domain and has the following characteristics. First, it is fully dynamic, partially observable, non-deterministic and has a homogeneous structure. Second, two hunter agents and a prey agent exist in a 15 327 15 grid world; the initial position of each agent is determined randomly. Third, at each time ns staying at the current position or moving from the current position north, south, west, or east. More than one hunter agent can share the same cell. However, a hunter agent cannot share a cell with the prey. Also, an agent is not allowed to move off the environment. The latter two moves are considered illegal and any agent that tries an illegal move is not allowed to move. Further, hunters are learning agents and the prey agent selects its own action randomly or based on a particular strategy such as Manhattan-distance measure Finally, the prey is captured when the two hunter agents are positioned at two sides of the prey. Then, the prey and the two hunter agents are relocated at new random positions in the grid world and the next trial starts sed Multiagent Learning 4.1 Internal Model Association Rules Mining from the Proposed Data Cube In our work described in this paper, as a given agent executes an action, we also consider actions of the other agent. For to hold the actions of the other hunter agent. This database is built using OLAP architecture. It is represented using the data cube shown in Figure 2, which has three dimensions to represent the internal model of a hunter agent. While two dimensions of this cube deal with the states of a hunter and the prey in the visual environment b the third dimension b Visual depth is assumed 3, unless otherwise specified represents the action space of the other hunter With reference to the cube shown in Figure 2, as long as a hunter agent observes new states, the learning process continues and the observed action of the other agent in the corresponding state is updated. So, each cell stores the count rved action. Finally, in order to explicitly express the dependency of the other agent\222s action, the hunter\222s Q-function is adj usted as follows Consider a hunter h 1 which tries to estimate the action of an agent h 2 The corresponding Q-function is represented as   other self aasQ where s is the state that hunter h 1 rve  selfself Aa 001 and  otherother Aa 001 spectively, actions of h 1 and h 2 here self A and other A represent sets of all the possible actions for h 1 and h 2 spectively. Accordingly, the action other a is a hidden and major variable in selecting the action self a In this study, the action other a is estimated based on the association rules extracted from the constructed data cube. If one hunter observes the other hunter in its visual environment, then the association rule other as 005 is easily mined from observations of the other hunter\222s past actions On the other hand, if one hunter could not perceive the other hunter, a prediction is done based on the following proposition in order to estimate the direction of the action of r agent D 3  3  3  2  3  3  No t A v a ila b l e Not Available 1 other a 2 other a 3 other a 4 other a 5 other a   Hunter Prey Action Both Not Available co u n t 2 count 1 count 3 count 3 tal Count 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000 000\000\000 000\000\000 000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 C 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 000\000\000\000 3, -3 3, -2 3, 3 Figure 2 The proposed data cube To satisfy data mining requirements as mentioned in Section 2, at the beginning of the learning process, the user specifies a minimum support value for action count as count3 in Figure 2. If the count value of a state reaches this minimum support value, then it is assumed that the hunter agent under consideration estimates the action of the st confidence value. If a state is not experienced sufficiently, then the agent under consideration estimates the action of the other agent with r of occurrences of a state-action pair is less than the user specified minimum confidence value, then this action is not actions exceeding the minimum confidence value in a state, then the Proceedings of the IEEE/WIC International Conf erence on Intelligent Agent Technology \(IAT\22203 0-7695-1931-8/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

The dimensions of the data cube are specified as the state information and the actions of both hunters. The mining process developed for this purpose is described next in Algorithm 1 Algorithm 1 Mining Based Multiagent Learning The proposed mining based learning process involves the following steps 1 The hunter agent under consideration observes the current state s and estimates other a based on the association rules extracted from the data cube. As mentioned in Section 4.1 nces of s is greater than the minimum support value, then other a with the highest rwise other a lected by considering every action of the other hunter, say a i which exceeds the minimum confidence value in s based on the value of  sap i  2 The action self a is selected according to the estimated other a  s association rules mining process, if the count of a stateother a pair is greater than or equal to the specified minimum support value, then it is assumed that the relevant state and other a rienced sufficiently In this case, the hunter agent under consideration selects the action with the highest confidence value 3 If the stateother a rienced sufficiently, the agent selects its action based on the value of  sap i in a way similar to the \223otherwise\224 part of step 1 4 The hunter under consideration executes the action self a lected either in step 2 or in step 3 5 Simultaneously, the other hunter executes the action  other a  6 The environment changes to a new state s 1  7 The hunter under consideration r ward r from the environment and updates the data cube 8 If s 1 satisfies a terminal condition, then terminate the current trial. Otherwise ss 005 1 and go back to step 1 4.3 Mining Multiple-Levels Association Rules from the Data Cube Experiments showed that at the end of the learning process rienced sufficiently, and some are never visited, depending on the escaping policy followed by the prey. Recall that an agent selects its own action based on the information obtained from the es, this information is not sufficient to mine association rules. To overcome this, the information is generalized from a low level to a higher level We decided to use reduced minimum support at lower levels In general, most of the work done on OLAP mining consider reduced minimum support across levels, where lower levels of abstraction use smaller minimum support in the mining  5. Experimental Results We conducted some experiments to evaluate our approach i.e., to test the effectiveness of learning by extracting association rules that correlate states and actions. Further, in mpare it with the standard Q-learning approach, abbreviated as SQL concentrated on testing changes in the main factors that affect the proposed learning process, namely minimum support minimum confidence and visual depth. All the experiments have been conducted on a Pentium III 1.4GHz CPU with 512 MB of memory and running Windows 2000. Further, in all the experiments, the learning process consists of a series of trials and each reported result is the average value over 10 distinct runs. Each trial begins with a single prey and two hunter agents placed at random positions inside the domain and ends when either the prey is captured or at 2000 time steps. Upon capturing the prey, individual hunters immediately r ward of 100. Finally, we used the following parameters in the Q-learning process: learning rate 003 0.8, discount factor 002 0.9, the initial value of the Qfunction is 0.1, and the visual depth of the agents is set to 3 rwise   0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 12000 14000 Trials Time steps to capture the prey  MinSup3K MinSup5K MinSup7K  SQL  Figure 3 Learning curves of the hunter agents when the prey escapes randomly rst two experiments, the prey follows random escaping policy.

our approach over SQL, it can be easily seen that the learning curve when the minimum support value was set to 5K labeled MinSup5K in Figure 8\ converges to the near optimal solution faster than the curve labeled MinSup7K Finally, it can also be easily observed from Figure 8 that the hunter agent almost learned nothing when the minimum support value was set to 3K    0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 0 2500 5000 7500 10000 12500 15000 Trials T i m e s t ep s t o cap t u r e t h e p r ey  MinSup5K MinSup7K MinSup9K  SQL  Figure 4 Learning curves of the hunter agents when the prey escapes using Manhattan-distance In the second experiment, the escaping policy of the prey is Manhattan-distance to the located hunter. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 4. Comparing this with the results of the previous two experiments, it can be easily  it is enough to select the minimum support value as 7K because the hunter and it is unnecessary to increase the minimum support value. Here note that at convergence time the difference in the number of steps and trials between our approach and SQL are larger than those of the first experiment. This situation shows that our approach gives better results in more complex domains 0 250 500 750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000 0 2500 5000 7500 10000 12500 15000 T rials T i m e s t ep s  t o cap t u r e t h e p r ey talCount 100K\(7K talCount 150K\(9K talCount 150K\(7K Figure 5 Learning curves of the hunter agents with generalized states to the multiple levels case, while the prey escapes using Manhattan-distance. In this experiment, our goal is to generalize a state that has been experienced enough compared to other states. In such a case l and decides on the best action. Here, if the total count reaches the pre-determined threshold value and the minimum support value of the current state is below the threshold, then the agent goes up to a higher level in order to get more detailed information from the environment. The results of this experiment for two different total count values and two different minimum support values are plotted in Figure 5 which also considers generalizing only states of the other hunter agent 6. Summary and Conclusions In this paper, we proposed a novel multiagent reinforcement learning approach based on association rules mining in an OLAP architecture. To achieve this, we defined a data cube for holding all the environment related information obtained by agents. Using the constructed data cube, we estimated the action of the other hunter agent, even when it is not in the visual environment. Also, we proposed a method to generalize states that were not experienced sufficiently. In addition, we presented a new action selection method in order for the agents to take the most appropriate action. Experimental results showed that the proposed learning approach could be used more effectively to achieve high quality optimal solutions. As a result, we can state that the proposed data cube and association rules mining based learning algorithms work well for multiagent domains Currently, we are investigating the possibility of applying our methods to problems that require continuous state space and to develop and improve different corresponding algorithms REFERENCES 1  O  A b u l F  P o la t a n d R  A l h a jj, \223 M u ltia g e n t re in f o rc e m e n t learning using function approximation,\224 IEEE TSMC 2000 2  C  C  A g g a r w al and P  S  Y u  223A N e w appr o a c h t o o n l i n e generation of association rules,\224 IEEE TKDE Vol.13, No.4 pp.527-540, 2001 3  R   A g ra w a l a n d R  S r ik a n t. \223 F a s t a l g o r ith m s f o r m i n i n g  association rules\224 Proc. of VLDB pp.487-499, 1994 4  S  C h audhur i and U  D a y a l  223A n o v e r v i e w o f dat a warehousing and OLAP technology\224 ACM SIGMOD Record Vol.26, pp.65-74, 1997 5 J  H a n a n d Y  F u 223 M in in g m u ltip le l e v e l a s s o c i a tio n  ru le s  in large databases,\224 IEEE TKDE pp.798804, 1999 6  M  K a y a  and R  A l haj j  223R ei nf o r c e m e nt l ear ni ng i n  multiagent systems: A modular fuzzy approach with internal model capabilities,\224 Proc. of IEEE ICTAI 2002 7 M  L  L ittm a n 223 M a r k o v g a m e s a s  a  f r a m e w o r k  f o r m u lti agent reinforcement learning,\224 Proc. of ICML, pp.157-163 1994 8 Y  N a g a y u k i S  I s h ii a n d K  D o y a 223 M u ltia g e n t reinforcement learning: an approach based on the other agent\222s internal model,\224 Proc. of IEEE ICMAS pp.215221, 2000 9 T  W  Sandho l m and R  H  C r i t e s 223Mu lti agent reinforcement learning in the Iterated Prisoner\222s Dilemma,\224 Biosystems Vol.37, pp.147-166, 1995 10 M  T a n  223 M u ltia g e n t re in f o rc e m e n t le a r n i n g   in d e p e n d e n t  vs. cooperative agents,\224 Proc. of ICML pp.330-337, 1993 Proceedings of the IEEE/WIC International Conf erence on Intelligent Agent Technology \(IAT\22203 0-7695-1931-8/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

This is due to  the fact that the number of rules corresponding to two consecutive guesses of minimum supports lie outside of the desired range. One is smaller than Nmi, and the other is greater than Nmm. To resolve this problem, step size must be refined in fixed step approach. However, no such problem occurs for the proposed Secant-based approach 5 Conclusion Adaptive-support association rules are constrained association rules with application to collaborative recommendation systems. In this work, we have proposed an eficient data-mining algorithm for the discovery of adaptive-support association rules. Simulation results have demonstrated that its performance is more efficient than the fixed step size approach adopted in [7]. However our implementations d o  not generate frequent itemsets and association rules simultaneously as in [7].

In actual cases the top ranked terms are selected as topic descriptors 3.3 Extracting Highly Informative Terms In our third experiment we began with just a simple question or a phrase. This phrase was fed into the Google search engine. The query results were analyzed by the AR algorithm, and the highest ranked terms were collected for further use. We then used the highest ranked terms to expand the original query and refine the search. The following table holds the query phrases, the AR algorithm highest ranked terms, the revised search phrase and it's first retrieved web page Table 5.  Using the AR Algorithm to Extract Highly Informative Terms \(The extracted terms are used for query expansion Original Query Phrase AR Highest Ranked Phrases Revised Query Phrase Topic of the First Retrieved Page  Sleep and appet-ite depressed mood anxiety disorder Sleep and appetite Depressed mood anxiety disorder Informatio nal Reports on Depression and Stress What is the origin of the human race racial evolution ancient scientific What is the origin of the human race racial evolution ancient scientific The Races of Humanity What is the furthest star in the solar system orbiting asteroid gravitational pluto What is the furthest star in the solar system orbiting asteroid gravitational Pluto HubbleSite All FAQs for Solar System Hitchc-ock movies marnie lodger vertigo psycho Hitchcock movies marnie lodger vertigo psycho Auteur theory of Alfred Hitchcock Once again the AR algorithm extracted terms that served as descriptors and could be used for farther query expansion. We chose to expand the query phrase by simply adding the first four terms extracted by the AR algorithm A different approach would have been to give the user the list of extracted terms. The user would then be able to select from the list the most suitable terms to be added to the original query phrase Note that the question "what is the furthest star in the solar system?" was not stated properly, since the users meant to find the furthest Planet and not Star. The AR algorithm was able to find the term, "Pluto" \(the fourth of the ranked terms\ despite this "mistake". Furthermore, very common terms such as "who", "what", "is" are ignored by the Google search engine. Thus, for example, the query what is the furthest star in the solar system", translated to only four terms "furthest, star, solar, and system 3.4 Discussion This chapter presented three different approaches for validation of the AR algorithm. First - the "Free Associations Turing Test" confronts the question whether the AR algorithm can "imitate" human associations. The second - analyzing proxy logs deals with the question whether the AR algorithm can extract human-interest topics from the user's surfing history. And finally, the third part deals with the question whether the AR algorithm can help the user to better express his thoughts and reach valuable information more efficiently While the answer to the first question is based on a solid statistical base \(we compared ten association rules measures, 100 seed terms, 70 different questionnaires and 900 people who answered the different questionnaires\e latter two were based on much smaller samples. Thus the conclusions were qualitative rather than quantitative. Still we believe that the potential for creating a user profile or using the AR algorithm to extract highly informative phrases has been shown 4 Concluding Remarks The AR algorithm that extracts highly informative phrases was shown capable of both "imitating" humans by creating human-like associations and giving highly informative descriptors of Internet pages. The extracted descriptors were used to reveal the user current interest topics and to supply query expansion terms. The algorithm complexity is low, and can be performed in near real-time The success of the algorithm raises the question whether actual human thinking processes are performed similarly The algorithm is rather robust and can be employed for various usages, or to even use other asymmetrical association measures as links between concepts. One of the most promising usages we forecast for this algorithm is user conceptual modeling and prediction. By using the AR algorithm to extract concepts and associations from the pages the user visits, an analysis of "flow" in a conceptual graph can show trends and determine the probability for the user to reach certain concepts within his current surfing session. In future work we intend to identify common properties for similar users, and define a profiling technique based on the random walk algorithm Many other interesting challenges are still waiting to be addressed in the web search algorithms area.

9 Here are some observations and explanations on the results 1\The total time of our comparison includes the time to write the association rules to a file; Bit-AssocRule is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the various Apriori algorithms \(64-221 times faster\he test data set, the big the time difference between the BitAssocRule and the various Apriori algorithms. We havent compared our algorithm with some of the other association rule algorithms such as VIPER  13,24] \(CHARM and CL OSE are base d on the closed frequent itemsets concept\d on their published comparison results with Apriori, our BitAssocRule is very competitive compared to them and a direct comparison will be conducted and reported in the near future 2\e or litter longer time than the various Apriori algorithms in constructing the 1-itemsets because of the extra cost of building the bitmaps for the 1-itemsets. But after the 1-itsemtset is done, Bit-AssocRule is significant faster than the Apriori algorithms in constructing large frequent itemsets because it only uses the fast bit operations \(AND COUNT and SHIFT\nd doesnt need to test the subsets of the newly candidate 3\aps of the frequent items, and the bitmap storage \(uncompressed less than the original data set \(1/2 to 1/4 of the original data size The main reasons that Bit-AssocRule algorithm is significant faster than Apriori and its variations are 1\ocRule adopts the divide-and-conquer strategy, the transaction is decompose into vertical bitmap format and leads to focused search of smaller domain There is no repeated scan of entire database in BitAssocRule 2\snt follow the traditional candidate-generate-and test approach, thus saves significant amount of time to test the candidates 3\basic operations are bit Count and bit And operations, which are extremely faster than the pattern search and matching operations used in Apriori and its variations 5. Conclusion The contributions of this paper are in two aspects:  we extend the application domains of bitmap techniques and introduce the bitmap techniques for complex DSS query optimization and association algorithm. We present a bitmap based query optimization algorithm to optimize complex query with multiple table join based on outer join operations and push the outer join operations from the data flow level to the bitmap level and achieve significant performance gain.   We introduce a novel algorithm to calculate the foundset for those tables involved in the prejoin table by using prejoin_bitmap_indexes and integrate this algorithm into the current commercial data flow based query engine seamlessly. Our query optimization can achieve an order of magnitude faster than conventional query engine Secondly we introduce the bitmap technique to the data mining procedure and develop a bitmap-based algorithm Bit-AssocRule to find association rules. Our BitAssocRule avoids the time-consuming table scan to find and prune the itemsets, all the operations of finding large itemsets from the datasets are the fast bit operations. The experimental result of our Bit-AssocRule algorithm with Apriori and AprioirHybrid algorithms shows Bit-AssocRule is2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster. This research indicates that bitmap technique can greatly enhance the performance for decision support queries and finding association rule, and bitmap techniques are very promising for the decision support query optimization and DM applications Bitmap technique is only one way to improve the performance of complex DSS queries and DM algorithm Parallelism is another crucial factor to improve the performance of DSS and data mining.  We are currently working on paralleling the bitmap-based algorithms and hope to report our findings in the near future 6. References  Agrawal R.

Related work The most similar to the representations based on generalized disjunctive sets is the NDR representation which consists of all frequent non-derivable itemsets [7 8], and the representations based on ?-free sets [7, 9]. It was shown in [8], that for each non-empty itemset Z, one can derive the lower bound \(l\(Z u\(Z on sup\(Z from the fact that sup\(Z Non-derivable itemsets are those for which u\(Z Z gt; 0. If u\(Z Z sup\(Z supersets Y of a derivable itemset are also derivable and u\(Y Y Y such that neither sup\(Z Z Z Z It was proved in [7, 8] that u\(Z Z  u\(Z?{a Z?{a for |Z| ? 1 This important result was used in [7, 8] to determine the upper bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets namely: non-derivable itemsets are not longer than log2|D|? + 1 Hence, the bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets is identical to the bound on the length of generalized disjunction-free sets \(please see Theorem 3.2 It has been proved in [7] that ?-free sets are a subset of non-derivable itemsets, so their length is also bounded by ?log2|D|? + 1 There is a claim in [7, 9] that the generalized disjunction-free sets equal the ?-free sets. This claim however, is not correct, which we will prove by the example beneath. Table 4 contains all generalized disjunction-free sets. Among them, there is {fh}, the support of which equals 0. The support bounds for {fh are found as follows \(please, see [7] for the details  sup\({fh f h   sup\({fh f  sup\({fh h  sup\({fh Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Hence, l\({fh fh fh sup\({fh free, is not a ?-free set Since the families of the generalized disjunction-free sets and ?-free sets may differ, finding the relationship between them or between the generalized disjunction-free sets and non-derivable itemsets remains a challenge 8. Conclusions The representations based on generalized disjunctionfree sets belong to the most concise ones among all lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In 


lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
