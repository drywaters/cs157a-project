Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 MINING FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES USING PARTIAL SUPPORT LI-JUN XU KANGLIN XIE Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai JiaoTong University, Shanghai, 200030,China E-MAIL lijunxu@sjtu.edu.cn xie-kl@cs.sjtu.edu.cn Abstract The paper presents a new approach of mining fuzzy association rules Most existing methods need to perform multiple scans of the database to get frequent itemsets and work poorly if the data 
are densely populated and duplicated Our approach only needs one scan to build the fuzzy P-tree which is a variant of a set enumeration tree. The tree is stored with partial fuzzy support values of candidate itemsets, which facilitate the calculation of total fuzzy support values We describe the implementation of our algorithm derived from Apriori algorithm The fuzzy P-tree can be combined with many existing methods and significantly improve their efficiency Keywords Fuzzy Association Rules Fuzzy P-tree; Linguistic Terms 1 Introduction Mining association rules 
which may lead to previously unknown and interesting information is an important field of data mining An association rule is defined as the form A-B where A and B are both sets of attributes We always use two measures to evaluate the interestingness of an association rule. The support value for the rule is the number of database records which consist of A U B The confidence value for the rule is the ratio of the support value for AUB and the support value for A If an itemset satisfies support threshold, it 
is called as frequent If an association rule satisfies both support threshold and confidence threshold the association rule is considered interesting The problem of mining association rules was initially derived from supermarket basket data So early research is mainly focused on Boolean association rules At that time people often concern whether an item is available in a transaction or not and neglect related quantitative information However quantity is also a very important aspect of information So people start to investigate quantitative association rules As quantitative attributes always contain 
a lot of distinct values and the support value for one particular value is quite low people have to discretize quantitative attributes But it may lead to sharp boundary between intervals and thus affect the correctness of final results So the apply of hzzy set theory has become a common idea due to its simplicity and similarity to human reasoning. Hong puts forward an algorithm that integrate fuzzy concept with Apriori algorithm to find fuzzy association rules Chan and Au 41[51 make use of adjusted difference and fuzzy set to discover association rules without user-defined support threshold and confidence threshold 
But existing methods of mining fuzzy association rule are similar to classical Apriori The common characteristic of these methods is that they require multiple scans of the database G Goulboume and his co-workers[21 propose a new algorithm using a special tree data structure P-tree His algorithm only need one database scan to built the tree and interim results are calculated and stored in the tree As these interim results, partial support values, can be used to calculate the support count of candidate itemsets extra database scan is 
unnecessary This algorithm outperforms Apriori algorithm and even FP-tree Algorithm 16 But his method is defined on binary data and cannot be used to discover kzy association rules We extend his method to mining fuzzy association rules and propose our implementation based on his method 2 Related Work Enlightened by the idea of set-enumeration tree G Goulboume and his co-workers 21 develop a special tree structure P-tree which can be constructed by a single database scan Every node of the tree consists 
of two aspects of information: one itemset and the corresponding partial support value used for subsequent processing For any candidate itemset, the calculation of the total support can be worked out just by traversing the tree and thus the extra scan of the database is not required any longer The P-tree is a variant of a set-enumeration tree The itemsets are stored according to their lexicographic order with a related incidence count In order to avoid the potentially exponential scale of the tree nodes can be added 0-7803-7865-2/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE 113 


Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 dynamically with the scan of database to include necessary nodes Figure 1 shows the tree of set I I={a b c Suppose that the database of the tree comprises exactly one instance of 7 possible itemsets of three attributes In this tree, each subtree contains all the superset of the root node which following the root node in lexicographic order Figure 1 The P-tree for set a b c PA is defined as the number of records whose content is identical to the itemset A TA is defined as the total support value for the itemset A QA is define as the support value for subsets which contain the itemset A and follow the itemset A in lexicographic order. Its value is equal to the incidence count of corresponding node in the P-tree The following equation can be concluded TA=QA C PB  v B 113 A B precedes A in lexicographic order  Generally the computation required is significantly reduced because partial support values of candidate itemsets have already been worked out in the procedure of constructing the tree 3 Preliminaries We now summarize fuzzy association rule methodology as follows Note that we borrow some definition in 4 Given a set of records D each of which contains a set of attributes 1=\(1,,12 I where I 1 i<n can be a quantitative attribute or a categorical attribute For every record d of D dom\(i\denotes the domain of the attribute I A set of linguistic terms are defined based on the dom\(i L j=1,2  m is the linguistic terms of the attribute I m denotes the total count of the linguistic terms of the attribute I L is represented by a fuzzy set whose membership function is U U,J dom\(i If the attribute I is quantitative the linguistic terms of it is defined as follows i Lij lJJ\(V Lom\(i  v E dom\(i if dom\(i\is discrete Ug\(v Lom\(i  v E dom\(i  if dom\(i is continuous If the attribute I is categorical, dom\(i SjSm m denotes the attribute has rq different values The definition of the linguistic terms of it is defined as follows Vij Whether the attribute is quantitative or categorical, we can use one uniform representation, a set of linguistic terms to describe the data using the above definitions Any record can be transformed to a set of pairs <linguistic term, value each of which consists of one linguistic term and its corresponding membership value An illustrative example In this example we show how to transform a relational database to its fuzzy representation The database is shown in Table 1 Table 1 A Sample Database Sex I Age I Salary I 50 5000 Let us first consider the categorical attributes Sex which is defined as follows 1 1 Sex Male   Female   A4 F For the remaining attributes age and salary their membership functions are defined in Figure 2 1 Young Middle-aged Old 20 40 60 The Age Attribute 114

The algorithm scans the database row by row from the first record to the last one On each iteration the row is turned into its fuzzy representation the fuzzy data iS split into proper subsets and the subsets with its fuzzy support values are inserted into the tree. If one itemset is already represented by one node in the tree, its support value is added to the support value of the node. Otherwise a new node is created for this itemset and inserted into the appropriate position in the tree Dummy nodes are inserted to preserve the tree structure and prevent the tree from forming a linked list As the building the fuzzy P-tree is similar to the building the P-tree except the differences we discussed above we don\222t want to repeat the algorithm here It is discussed in detail in PI 


Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Wan 2-5 November 2003 5  Computing Total Support Apriori-TFP follows the Apriori methodology of performing repeated scans in each of which the support values of candidate itemsets of the same size are calculated The result is stored in a second-enumeration tree the T-tree which is arranged in the opposite order to that of the P-tree For candidate itemsets, the total support values can be carried out just by walking the P-tree once In order to avoid creating too many nodes of T-tree it is built level by level and pruned itemsets which are not frequent at the end of every scan We can take advantage of this algorithm to calculate fuzzy support values based on fuzzy P-tree We notice one problem of Apriori-TFP algorithm that the P-tree is static in the course of this algorithm. Whatever the support threshold is large we still have to traverse the whole tree In other words the P-tree may contain many unnecessary nodes in some cases If we can prune these nodes and add their support values to other nodes we not only decrease the number of nodes but also reduce the height of the tree The number of pruned node is decreased as the increase of the size of candidate itemsets We may significantly improve the efficiency only through pruning singleton itemsets that are not frequent. For example, if we prune all nodes contain element 221a\222 in the Figure 1 the tree only leave 3 nodes We modify the fuzzy version of Apriori-TFP algorithm to prune nodes after the first scan of the Fuzzy P-Tree in fact the improvement also apply to P-tree In order to distinguish our algorithm with Apriori-TFP algorithm we use the term Apriori-TFP-PN Apriori-TFP with Pruning Nodes to denote our algorithm We make good use of the structure of the Fuzzy P-tree to reorganize the tree when we prune nodes. The node contains any singleton itemset that is not frequent was separated from the fuzzy P-tree with its subtree. Its original position is replaced by its sibling node or set to null. If the unattached tree still contains a different singleton itemset that is not frequent after eliminating the previous itemset, we need continue the last operation until the tree doesn\222t contain any itemset that is not frequent Then we begin to merge unattached trees with the fuzzy P-tree The nodes of unattached trees are processed in preorder traversal The location of inserted nodes is located by traversing the fuzzy P-tree according to preorder traversal We summarize all possible instances as four cases below where m denotes the node of unattached tree under consideration Case I An identical node n exists in the fuzzy P-tree 1 FS \(n\\(n m 2.Compare the direct child node of m with the subtree of n and the next sibling node of m with the sibling nodes of n Case I1 m is a parent of existing node n 1 Set n with its subtree on the child branch of m 2.Set m as the new root node, or the child node or the sibling node of the previously investigated node according to actual information, FS\(m  FS\(m  FS\(n 3.Compare the direct child node of m in the unattached tree with the nodes of the current subtree of m and the next sibling node of m with the current sibling nodes of m Case I11 m is a sibling of existing node n 0 If m and n have a common leading substring S that is not equal the parent node of n 1 Create a dummy node k for S 2.Set k as the new root node or the child node or the sibling node of the previously investigated node according to actual information, FS\(k  FS\(m  FS \(n 3.Set m and n as the child nodes of k 4.Compare the next sibling node of m in the 0 Else 1.Set n as the new root node, or the child node or the sibling node of the previously investigated node according to actual information 2.Compare the next sibling node of m in the unattached tree with the current sibling nodes of m Case IV m is a new and unique child of current node n If m is not the unique child, it should be processed as previous cases unattached tree with the current sibling nodes of m 1 Set m as the child node of n 2.Compare the next sibling node of m with the current sibling node of n This algorithm is similar to the algorithm of the building of P-tree to some extent. Note that we don\222t need to traverse the tree from the root node every time when merging unattached trees After one node is inserted, the location of its child nodes and sibling nodes can be located based on previous search. In some cases the node and its subtree can be merged once and we don\222t need process nodes one by one for example, Case 111 So the average time complexity is linear to the number of the nodes of the tree It is obvious that the algorithm doesn\222t change the original characteristic of the tree We still can calculate support values through traversing the tree after pruning nodes 6 Experimental Results In order to evaluate the algorithm we have described above we have compared Apriori-TFP-PN algorithm with two algorithms, Apriori \(founded on a hash tree and Apriori-TFP The comparison is based on our own 116 


Proceedings of the Second International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics Xi 2-5 November 2003 implementation of these algorithms which are unoptimizable programs We use a real-life database with about 50,000 records It has seven attributes four are quantitative and three are categorical There are 25 linguistic terms in total after transformation We have compared their execution time for five different support thresholds. The result is shown in Figure 3  Apriori zn I Apriori-TF Apriori-TFP-PN J D Support Value  Figure 3 Comparisons of three algorithms Both Apriori-TFP and Apriori-TFP-PN outperform our implementation of Apriori This also verifies the experimental results in We notice our algorithm need less time than Apriori-TFP in some cases When the support threshold is relatively large or small, the difference between them is not obvious After analysis we think the phenomenon is based on two reasons On one hand the algorithm may prune a small quantity of nodes because most singleton itemsets are frequent with a small threshold On the other hand it doesn't need multiple scans because the size of the largest frequent itemset is small with a big one But it is known that we will discover too much meaningless association rules with a small threshold and lose useful information with a high threshold So even in some cases our algorithm doesn't show clear advantage, it is still a positive improvement on Apriori-TFP algorithm As we use memory-resident data in the experiment we believe our algorithm will work better if the data cannot be retained in main memory 7 Conclusion We present an algorithm for computing fuzzy support value using a variant of a set-enumeration tree that is stored with partial support values The tree is built by one database scan The fuzzy support value of any candidate itemset can be worked out just by traversing the tree Most existing methods of mining fuzzy association rules can take advantage of this data structure to improve their performance As the P-tree \(or Fuzzy Pdree\has a simple structure and is an compressed representation of source data to some extent it normally requires far less storage space than source data HoweverFit still may create an exponential storage requirement when source data is densely populated and thus the tree-is not possible to completely be retained in main memory Coenen and his co-workers 13 recommend partitioning the tree to several subtrees and every subtree may b_e retained in main memory. As candidate subsets may belofig to different subtrees we still cannot avoid multiple U0 operations in this way We put forward a new algorithm that may prune a large quantity of nodes and the P-tree can be memory-resident after the first traverse of the tree References R Agrawal R Srikant Fast Algorithm for Mining Association Rules Proc of 20 VLDB Conference Santiago, pp.487-499 1994 G Goulbourne F Coenen P Leng Algorithm for Computing Association Rules using a Partial-Support Tree.

For instance if label  c2  of item \(A, a test data that has  c2  as its class, then the case will be considered a hit, and 5/15 will be assigned to the case 5. Experimental Results We investigated our approach against 19 different datasets from [20] as well as a different datasets for forecasting the behaviour of an optimisation heuristic within a hyperheuristic framework [5, 16]. Stratified tenfold cross-validation was used to derive the classifiers and error rates in the experiments. Cross-validation is a standard evaluation measure for calculating error rate on data in machine learning. Three popular classification techniques a decision tree rule \(PART CBA have been compared to MMAC in terms of classification accuracy, in order to evaluate the predictive power of the proposed method The choice of such learning methods is based on the different strategies they use to generate the rules. Since the chosen techniques are only suitable for traditional classification problems where there is only one class assigned to each training instance, we therefore used classification accuracy derived by only the top-label evaluation measure for fair comparison All experiments were conducted on a Pentium IV 1.6 GH PC.  The experiments of PART and RIPPER were conducted using the Weka software system [20]. Weka stands for Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis. It is an open java source code for the machine teaching community that includes implementations of different methods for several different data mining tasks such as classification, clustering, association rule and regression. CBA experiments were conducted using a VC++ implementation version provided by [19]. Finally MMAC was implemented using Java We have evaluated 19 selected datasets from Weka data collection [20], in which, a few of them \(6 reduced by ignoring their integer and/or real attributes Several tests using ten-fold cross-validation have been performed to ensure that the removal of any real/integer attributes from some of the datasets does not significantly affect the classification accuracy. To do so we only considered datasets where the error rate was not more than 6% worse than the error rate obtained on the same dataset before the removal of any real/integer attributes.  Thus, the ignored attributes do not impact on the error rate too significantly Many studies have shown that the support threshold plays a major role in the overall classification accuracy of the set of rules produced by existing associative classification techniques [9, 12]. Moreover, the support value has a larger impact on the number of rules produced in the classifier and the processing time and storage needed during the algorithm rules discovery and generation. From our experiments, we noticed that the support rates that ranged between 2% to 5% usually achieve the best balance between accuracy rates and the size of the resulted classifiers. Moreover, the classifiers derived when the support was set to 2% and 3 achieved high accuracy, and most often better than that of decision trees rule \(PART the MinSupp was set to 3% in the experiments. The confidence threshold, on the other hand, is less complex and does not have a large effect on the behaviour of any associative classification method as support value, and thus it has been set to 30

Our algorithm outperforms the rule learning methods in terms of accuracy rate, and the won-loss-tied records of MMAC against PART, RIPPER and CBA 13-6-0, 15-4-0 and 154-0, respectively The evaluation measures of MMAC have been compared on 9 solution runs produced by the Peckish hyperheuristic [5] with regard to accuracy, and number of rules produced. Figures 3a and 3b represent the relative prediction accuracy that indicates the difference of the classification accuracy of MMAC evaluation measures with respect to those derived by CBA and PART, respectively. In other words, how much better or worse MMAC measures perform with respect to CBA and PART learning methods. The relative prediction accuracy numbers shown in Figures 3a and 3b are conducted using the formula PART PARTMMAC Accuracy AccuracyAccuracy  and CBA CBAMMAC Accuracy AccuracyAccuracy  respectively. After analysing the charts, we found out that there is consistency between the top-label and label-weight measures, since both of them consider only one class in the prediction. The top-label takes into account the topranked class, and the label-weight considers only the weight for the predicted class that matches the test case Thus, both of these evaluation measures are applicable to traditional single-class classification problems. On the other hand, the any-label measure considers any class in the set of the predicted classes as a hit whenever it matches the predicted class regardless of its weight or rank. Is should be noted that, the relative accuracy of MMAC evaluation methods against dataset number 8 in Figure 3a and 3b, is negative since CBA and PART 


Figure 3a and 3b, is negative since CBA and PART achieved a higher classification rate against this particular dataset A comparison of the knowledge representation produced by our method, PART and CBA has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the set of rules derived. Figure 4 represents the classifiers generated form the hyperheuristic datasets. Analysis of the rules sets indicated that MMAC derives a few more rules than PART and CBA for the majority of the datasets. In particular, the proposed method produced more rules than PART and CBA on 8 and 7 datasets, respectively. A possible reason for extracting more rules is based on the recursive learning phase that MMAC employs to discover more hidden information that most of the associative classification techniques discard, since they only extract the highest confidence rule for each frequent item that survives MinConf Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 6. Conclusions A new approach for multi-class, and multi-label classification has been proposed that has many distinguishing features over traditional and associative classification methods in that it \(1 that contain rules with multiple labels, \(2 evaluation measures for evaluating accuracy rate, \(3 employs a new method of discovering the rules that require only one scan over the training data, \(4 introduces a ranking technique which prunes redundant rules, and ensures only high effective ones are used for classification, and \(5 discovery and rules generation in one phase to conserve less storage and runtime. Performance studies on 19 datasets from Weka data collection and 9 hyperheuristic scheduling runs indicated that our proposed approach is effective, consistent and has a higher classification rate than the-state-of-the-art decision tree rule \(PART and RIPPER algorithms. In further work, we anticipate extending the method to treat continuous data and creating a hyperheuristic approach to learn  on the fly   which low-level heuristic method is the most effective References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00 © 2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
