We present a conceptual network model for the organization of courseware and the related information Using the hierarchy and akociation rules of the concepts we organize components and courseware episodes as a multi-layer howledge network which has a reasonable classijkation and discloses the complicated interdependent relations among the knowledge Kth retrieval based on concept and association among concepts people can manage and 
develop courseware and lead the course for self-organizing and stu 1 Introduction CAI courseware has gained a rapid development in recent years However in comparison with the rapid expansion and development of knowledge there are still highly demands on courseware which require courseware can adapt its schemes and contents according to teaching requirements Recently the technology of building a network component database has been introduced 
l 21 Each component consists of teaching materials and modes of statement Courseware combined with an adaptive network components editor platform has great convenience in fully using of WWW educational resource But the organization of teaching materials and the choice of model of statement are challenge tasks and still rely on expert\222s personal style of instruction 
and the specific syllabus On one hand there is no sufficient suggestion on how to organize the teaching materials for educator to design a course On the other hand a guide on system and structure of knowledge is needed to satisfy with the varied demands of students 3 It is doubtless that a flexible knowledge association system should be introduced In this paper, we present a new architecture to organize 
courseware based on the knowledge conceptual network 6 The framework of system is made up of knowledge described by conceptual network, teaching material associated with knowledge rule and pattem of information Conceptual network shows the interdependent relationships among the concepts Teaching information consists of episodic courseware that uses concept as it basic unit and related material Each piece of information links a certain 
concept in conceptual network Thus the information is formed into a knowledge network The paper is organized as follows Section 2 briefly introduces the conceptual network Section 3 discusses the organization of courseware episodes based on the conceptual network. CAI Courseware Architecture and push engine of course are provided in Section 4 and conclude the paper in Section 5 2 Conceptual Network \(CN 
Conceptual network CN is used to model and expresses the inherent relationship among objective things concepts Through concepts and conceptual relations it describes human\222s natural understanding of the laws of the world Conceptual network can be defined as a 5-tuple N{C A B D Kr where C 0-7803-7925-X/03/$17.00 02003 IEEE 1288 


denotes the concept words set, A denotes the attributes sets B denotes the behavior set D is the documents set which describes the concept in a multimedia form Kr describes the knowledge units Fig 1 shows a node Knowledge relevancy Figure 1 The node model of concept relations among conceptual 222s component structure CN is a very complex knowledge system For courseware we only discuss some relevant techniques in CN Concept node design and ID Each concept \(word should be given an ID and each concept is associated with name and synonymy set ID is a unique number to represent a concept A concept may have several synonymy terms which are recorded in the synonymy set but they all map to the identical ID Each concept may have generalization, intension and extension as well as the regulations When define the intention of concept we should centralize them Using the visible hierarchical relation we can make a compact structure and deal the knowledge with categorizing Attribute and behavior of concept Attributes characterize the inherent feature of a concept Behaviors show the outside features The general features can be abstracted and formed a higher level of concept that may posses more extension or general meanings Both attributes and behaviors serve as the foundation of classification for the concept Presentation of a concept A concept may be presented with variable types of media forms such as text image video hyperlink and U\200U etc All these presentations can be used as the original material in the information service Concept relevancy As a concept may involve many concepts a concept representation could be very complex. They have different function in a conceptual graph and they play different roles in the knowledge sentence All the relevance forms a network links thus the conceptual network expresses some kind of knowledge with complex associations among the concepts Structure of the conceptual network For the preciseness representation and flexible management of a conceptual network the concept is applied with a tree structure We first build a backbone tree and then based on this tree we add concept nodes and associations links among the nodes In this way complex conceptual combination boils down to clear structure without losing precise meanings and representations The backbone tree is expanded according to hierarchy of knowledge system. There are several kinds of affiliation in classification method that may be used to expand a node in higher layer 0 Common  special The child node is 223a-kind-of\222 its parent This relation shows difference on attribute behave goal mode effect etc Entire-part The parent is composed of some parts such as components elements and steps of scheme or process The child node has 223a-part-of 224 relation between higher layer and lower layer 0 Class-instance Using the 223is-an-instance\224 relation we can derive an embodiment conceptual node from a generic abstract node 0 1289 


in application Recombination The child nodes derived from parent by 223a-kind-of\222 mode can recombined 0 3 Courseware episodes organization There are very complicated relationships among concepts. The CN treat these relationships as two kinds one is subordinated from the view of inheritance and combination of class the other is dependence, from the view of entire presentation of knowledge General speaking the concept tree shows the subordinated relationships which are detail 223A Kind of\222 223A part of\222 223A classified in Instance of\222 and become new child node It consists of some attributes or other in branches but only one in same character However multi-parent is very common in oriented object The concept has also multi-inherited and can has more than one parent concept As concerned as the problem we decided the concept from which current concept inherited the main attribute is direct parent node, while the concept whose auxiliary attributes are inherited are limited node By this way the subordinated relationships are clear and definite Fig2 shows the example of 223Function pointer\224 Figure 2 Associated limited multi-parent relationship The more common and complicated relationships among the concepts are the association when certain action occurs which we call dependence association based on role he set composed of several concepts according to certain rule, represents certain knowledge that described the effect made by one object act another object when, where and under other condition The concepts parted in the combination act respective role and are called role concepts. The fig3 shows that among the concept 223write file\224 and other role concepts I Figure 3 role dependence association relationship I 4 Courseware Architecture and Navigation i-hw the CN provide its knowledge for the learners after it has been organized well An engine for navigation should be designed for the learners The engine has four basic functions 1 synthesis of web presentation Web page synthesis combines one or several conceptual courseware episodes to a multi-frame web page Both the combination of page and the link of knowledge are 1290 


processed according to the concept\222s association rules The hierarchy and association in the CN are the base of the concept\222s association rules According to the difference of priority among sub-concept sibling concept, parent-coneept and associated concepts there are four learning modes: deep mode extensive mode generalization mode and association mode As for the unknown knowledge a previous mode is suggested while in review the rest two modes are suitable The different learning modes have different synthesis strategy of web page The layout of a web page is guided by the pattern of web constitutes, such as CSS style the learners are free to choose his favorite web layout Figure 4 shows the architecture of a courseware generating system based on conceptual network In lines of CN and the conceptual tree, the system is able to generate courseware episodes which interpret knowledge from CN with association rules and provide instances of knowledge with multimedia presentations Those information units may serve as the basic elements to form the web page and present in the web for learning. Generating web-presentation can be done through mark-up languages such as HTMLKML based on knowledge and database for convenience of information retrieval Thus the modification on the file of knowledge is shifted to the modification of web page Giving the file name and index number of all the episodes of courseware are assembled by the knowledge system. Hyperlinks of reference knowledge about certain pieces of knowledge are also included in courseware episodes conceptual 222 network 1 manager nodes database 4 association rules 1 pageeditor  I Figure 4 The model of courseware building system based on conceptual network  2 of course The push of learning course is for the beginners For example in 223C based on four factors teaching strategy hierarchy Programming Language\224 the 223pointer\224 is a structure in the CN, knowledge association in the CN sub-concept of 223data type\224 but 223pointer\224 and the study history record of the learners should not be studied immediately after 223data type\224 has been studied, because \223pointer\224 is a very important and difficult part and is studied only if the preliminary knowledge has been Teaching strategy. The learning of each course shall have its own order the system should also present the course by the order especial 1291 


studied. According to the teaching strategy, the 223pointer\224 node at the navigating tree is disable when the learners are studying the \223data type\224 Hierarchy and association in the CN. General speaking according to the weight in navigating there is one descending order list sub-concepts, sibling concepts parent concept and associated concepts.\222The sub-concepts can lead the learners to lengthwise deep study the details the sibling nodes can extend the scope while the parent node can generalize all the studied Knowledge association The other concepts related to this concept are listed in its 223Kr\224 fields The concepts act the roles such as limit action object effect way place etc in the composition of knowledge 0 The history study record of learners The learners\222 ability and weakness in the study can be known from the history record By analyzing the study history the system can have a better personalizing service 3 Navigation with conceptual network This procedure consists of formulation of the knowledge on several databases in Fig 4 With the starting concept i.e the concept to\2216e learnt we apply the association and analysis rules in the corresponding databases The leamer system thus can be implemented through navigation functions and can be linked with courseware episodes At the same time, routing through the dynamic concepts the paths are recorded for conceptual diflksion and dynamic conceptual navigation The routes for the visiting concepts are also recorded As a result the concepts episodes and visiting routes in the CN are presented by home-page generating rules Thus the system as integration can help a learner to study the related association contents In this way multi-concept information auto-adaptive retrieval is realized More specifically let C be the nodes that have been learnt visited and a set of association functions applied on C be R then the association nodes to C can be defined as follows Child nodes mode A specialization\the parent nodes mode B induction the sibling nodes mode C extension and the nodes that link to C through R mode D E Using child node for example a learner may derive learning knowledge by using deep first or width-fist search in the CN Thus vertical or horizontal knowledge associations are established It can be seen that the parent-son nodes form the vertical learning process and the sibling nodes forms the horizontal study process. However, the real learning process must be a hybrid of vertical horizontal and other learning rules in the CN rather than only in the tree With vertical learning process concepts and knowledge may be studied form level by level Once the knowledge has been learnt in one level, that is all the sibling nodes have been leamt to generalize the concept and recommend a set of parent nodes that are suitable to the learns would be possible We also setup the learning priority by where Nb is the number of sibling nodes Nrb is the number of learnt sibling. The priority of related nodes is determined by k  N,.JNp where Np is the number of node that link to R ER Nrp is the number of learnt nodes 4 Dynamic creation of conceptual baseline k  N,.d!b Keywords and conceptual baseline When learners type a keyword just like using in search engine the system will consider this word as an object that the user may be interested in Through the term-concept mapping of conceptual network and finding the concept\222s corresponding node in CN documents of conceptual description and association function of related knowledge will be brought forth to the learner. If there is more 1292 


than one concepts mapping to a keyword, the system can provide all of them or give a prompt for the user to decide which path to learn Thus we called the path as the conceptual baseline Multi-keywords and conceptual baseline. That learners may enter several keywords at the same time, which indicates that the users may have interest in leaming a series of objects so some key words may be inter-related. Using the keyword-concept mapping approach through association rules a leamer may navigate many concepts through these given concepts Consequently the corresponding web page generation should take into consideration of the 223shortest\224 relation paths among the multiple keywords \(concepts Not fully like in the Internet navigation in a courseware requests learners concentrating on one piece of knowledge and needn\222t much correlated information Therefore the compacted conceptual baseline is more suitable than conceptual network in courseware design For a node with multi-level of paternity it is better to treat the higher nodes as a domain restriction or context The main descriptions of knowledge will be focused on child node For example 223computer\224, \223keyboard\224 can be comprehended as 223the keyboard of computer\224 While 223musical instrument\224 224keyboard\224 is thought as 223the keyboard of musical instrument\224 such as keyboard of piano 0 5 Conclusions 222 Organizing CAI courseware with conceptual network has the advantage of traceable conceptual paths and association rules With our system it is possible to organize the pedagogical knowledge and conceptual association adaptively by guessing leamerk intentions indicate a reasonable direction for further study so as to implement so called 223intelligent instruction system\224 The further work of the system is to record individual history trace\information and data after learner logins into study so that leamers can be elicited to go over related important contents during in new study phase even if they need review The problem can be solved by design of adaptive reasonable refresh factor for different leamers in CN, which will surely enhance the intelligence of the system References Li Jiahou Form Courseware to New Devolpent of CAI in Integrableware: A China Education Joumal Vo1.27 No.2 p171\(195\1999 Ljubomir Jerinic The concept of action knowledge for component based model for intelligent tutoring ICCE\22298 proceeding 1998 Huang Zhongyao Conceive of component base on internet, China Education Vo1.164 no.9 p41\(44 2000 Hu Ningjing,Xie Shenquan Knowledge relation Partition in domain knowledge base on ICAI courseware Computer Technology and Automation Vol 19 No. 1 p46\(48 2000.3 Iadh Ounis Organizing Conceptual Graphs for Fast Knowledge Retrieval 10 Intemational Conference on Tools with Intelligent IEEE Sowa J F Conceptual Structures information processing in mind and machine Addison-Wesley Reading, Massachusetts, 1983 7803-5214-9 P120\( 128 1293 


tition, Pi, is processed, new partial frequent 2-itemsets may be added into C2, with their starting partition and partial counts being recorded. Furthermore, the old itemsets in C2 are checked if they are continually frequent from its starting partition to Pi. If a candidate 2-itemset is no longer partially frequent, this itemset is removed from C2. After all partitions have been processed, the set of candidate 2-itemsets, C2, which is close to the set of frequent 2-itemsets, is obtained Based on C2, all candidate k-itemsets, k &gt;= 3, are generated. Finally, one database scan is applied to calculate the supports of all candidate itemsets and frequent itemsets are determined. Fuzzy temporal association rules can then be formed from the discovered frequent itemsets 3.3. An Example We give an example for illustration. Consider the database D, shown in Table 1, which contains 9 transactions and is segmented into three partitions, P1, P2 and P3, each containing 3 transactions. Let the support and con?dence thresholds be 40% and 75%, respectively. Assume that the queried fuzzy calendar is the fuzzy calendar c1 given in Section 2, i.e., c1 represents \(\(in themiddle of amonth and at the end of a year or \(at the end of a week and at the beginning of a year The membership function of c1 is shown in Eq.\(6 sume that  mm  ey  ew , and  by are the membership functions shown in Figure 1 Firstly, we calculate the weights w1, w2, and w3 for partitions P1, P2, and P3, respectively.

The weighted count threshold for P1 is 0.4  3  0.67 = 0.804. The accumulative weighted count threshold for P1 is also 0.804 Among all the possible combinations of 2-itemsets in P1, only AD, AE, DE, and DF have accumulative weighted counts greater than or equal to 0.804. Therefore, these 2-itemsets, together with their accumulative weighted counts \(count starting partitions \(start

The accumulative weighted count threshold from partition P1 to partition P2 is 0.804 + 0.804 = 1.608. We ?nd that 5 new 2-itemsets, AB, AF , BE, BF , and EF in P2 have weighted counts greater than m2, so they are added to C2. Furthermore, the old itemsets AD, AE, DE, and DF have their accumulative weighted counts greater than 1.608. Therefore, they are retained in C2.

All new 2-itemsets generated in P3 have weighted counts less than 0.643. The itemsets generated in P1 all have accumulative weighted counts greater than 2.25 and the itemsets generated in P2, except BE, have accumulative weighted counts greater than 1.45, so they are retained in C2 and BE is deleted from C2. The resulting candidate 2-itemsets after processing P3 are shown in the right part of Table 3 Therefore, we have C2 = {AB,AD,AE,AF,BF,DE,DF,EF C3 = {ABF,ADE,ADF,AEF,DEF C4 = {ADEF Ck = ?, k ? 5 By scanning D once, we have the sets of frequent kitemsets, Lk, k ? 2, of D along with their counts to be L2 = {\(AD, 3.61 AE, 3.21 AF, 3.61 BF, 3.21 DE, 2.54 DF, 3.61 EF, 2.54 L3 = {\(ADE, 2.54 ADF, 2.94 AEF, 2.54 Lk = ?, k ? 4 and L = L2?L3. The association rules can then be obtained from the frequent itemsets in L 4. Experimental Results In this section, experimental results obtained with a PC with AMD Athlon XP CPU and 1.0G memory are presented 4.1. Experiment 1 In this experiment, we compare our fuzzy calendar algebra with the calendar algebra proposed in [16]. The Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  TIME  04 1530-1311/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE Figure 4. Performance comparison between the calendar algebra and our fuzzy calendar algebra with a simple calendar calendar algebra de?nes operators such as dicing, slicing, and ?atten to construct complex calendars. The time intervals are obtained from a speci?ed calendar and the calendric association rules are discovered in these time intervals. For a complex calendar, the calendar algebra decomposes the calendar into basic ones 


endar algebra decomposes the calendar into basic ones and then the time intervals of each basic calendar are separately searched. This approach is not e?cient since one time interval may be searched with several di?erent basic calendars. On the contrary, our fuzzy calendar algebra checks each time interval only once and can easily ?nd out all the time intervals in a given calendar. Repetitive and unnecessary searches in a time interval can be avoided, and the performance is improved We use 1825 time intervals collected in 5 years, with each time interval representing one day in a year. The execution time for ?nding out the desired time intervals by the calendar algebra and the fuzzy calendar algebra, respectively, is shown in Figure 4. The calendar algebra searches each time interval twice while the fuzzy calendar algebra searches each time interval only once, and thus we can clearly see that our method is more e?cient in interpreting calendars. For more complicated calendars, i.e., containing more basic calendars, our fuzzy calendar algebra performs even better as shown in Figure 5 4.2. Experiment 2 In this experiment, we  d like to show the e?ectiveness of our strategy for mining fuzzy temporal patterns. The number of candidates and frequent itemsets discovered are reported. The execution time for discovering the itemsets is also presented. The dataset Figure 5.

TheNumber of candidates and frequent itemsets discovered T 10.I4.D100K.C10%, containing synthetic data [1] is used, where T is the mean size of a transaction, I is the mean size of potential maximal frequent itemsets D is the number of transactions in units of K, i.e 1000, and C is the correlation between items in terms of percentage. The dataset is partitioned into 200 partitions and there are 500 transactions in each partition. To infer from these partitions with our fuzzy calendar algebra, we assume the ?rst partition being the time interval of 2003/01/01, the second partition being of 2003/01/02, . . . , and so on. The calendar we are interested in is the one given in Eq.\(6 ber of candidates and frequent itemsets discovered are given in Table 4 and the execution time for discovering these itemsets is shown in Figure 6. From Table 4 and Figure 6, proper numbers of frequent itemsets can be discovered in acceptable time with our method 5. Conclusion We have presented the fuzzy calendar algebra which supports fuzzy queries on calendars. Fuzzy calendars Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium on Temporal Representation and Reasoning  TIME  04 1530-1311/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE Figure 6. Execution time with di?erent support thresholds are natural and easy for use in the sense that they capture the way in which human beings reason with time requirements. To accommodate temporal expressions with multiple time granularities, ?ve operations, and 


with multiple time granularities, ?ve operations, and or, not, xor, and sub, are introduced We have shown the usefulness of the fuzzy calendar algebra by incorporating it with PWM to mine fuzzy temporal association rules from temporal databases Firstly, the transactions of the database are divided into a sequence of partitions. Then the weight of each partition is inferred, denoting the matching degree of the corresponding time period to the fuzzy calendar speci?ed in the user  s queries. Temporal patterns in the divided time periods of di?erent matching degrees are then e?ciently produced, and the number of database scans can be e?ectively reduced. Experimental results have shown that this approach of ?nding fuzzy temporal association rules is very e?ective References 1] R. Agrawal and R. Srikant. Fast algorithms for mining association rules.

CONCLUSIONS This paper derives a Bayesian procedure for track association that can solve a large scale distributed tracking problem where many sensors track many targets. When noninformative prior of the target state is assumed, the single target test becomes a chi-square test and it can be extended to the multiple target case by solving a multidimensional assignment problem. With the noninformative prior assumption, the optimal track fusion algorithm can be a biased one where the regularized estimate has smaller mean square estimation error. A regularized track fusion algorithm was presented which modifies the optimal linear unbiased fusion rule by a less-than-unity scalar. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed track association and fusion algorithm through a three-sensor two-target tracking scenario 7. REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and W. D.

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA. In other words, the number Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05 0.055 0.06 N um be r o f C ou nt ed P at te rn s Support Threshold Mafia Min_Conf=0 Min_Conf=0.1 Min_Conf=0.3 Min_Conf=0.5 Min_Conf=0.7 Min_Conf=0.9 Figure 8.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
