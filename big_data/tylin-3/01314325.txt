Verizon vs. the RIAA Implications for Privacy and Democracy   Frances S. Grodzinsky  Herman T. Tavani Sacred Heart University  Rivier College 5151 Park Avenue   420 Main St Fairfield, CT USA   Nashua, NH USA grodzinskyf@sacredheart.edu htavani@rivier.edu   Abstract In January 2003, a US district court in the District of Columbia ruled that Verizon must comply with a subpoena by the Recording Industry Association of America \(RIAA\ requesting the name of a subscriber who allegedly made available more than 600 copyrighted music files over the Internet. This ruling rocked the Internet community, especially those critics who 
saw the decision as one advancing the interests of copyright owners at the expense of broader democratic values in cyberspace such as freedom of speech and privacy for individual users.  In an appeals ruling on December 19, 2003 however, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia overturned the lower court\222s decision. A particular challenge for computer ethicists is to determine how arguments on both sides of this case can be sorted out and evaluated from a moral perspective. The purpose of the present essay is to elucidate the issues surrounding this case by analyzing arguments advanced by both Verizon and the RIAA, and to examine some of the implications that the outcome of this 
ruling may have for future activities in cyberspace. Section 1 of the paper sets the background for understanding the arguments and rulings involved in both lawsuits, while Section 2 examines the infrastructure of the peer-to-peer \(P2P\istribution model and how it supports the values inherent in democracy and democratic ideals.  Section 3 examines some interrelationship between privacy and democracy, and shows why the former is essential for the latter. We conclude this essay in Section 4 by supporting Verizon\222s refusal to hand over the names, on the grounds that doing so would have violated the privacy of the individual subscribers which, in turn, would undermine any 
goals of achieving democracy in cyberspace  I. INTRODUCTION  In September 2003, as part of its attempt to stop file sharing of copyrighted music over the Internet, the Record Industry Association of America \(RIAA\ issued hundreds of lawsuits against Internet users who had used peer-to-peer networks P2P\ distribute proprietary music. These lawsuits were filed against users that the RIAA argued had violated US copyright laws.  The initial lawsuits targeted users who had downloaded and disseminated substantial amounts of proprietary music online; the RIAA also offered amnesty to some individuals who voluntarily came forward and agreed to sign a confession 
admitting guilt and who also promised that they would discontinue their practices of downloading and exchanging proprietary MP3 files. The latest batch of lawsuits, issued in March 2004, targets ordinary downloaders of music. RIAA claims that the illegal copying and distribution of music has cost the recording industry millions of dollars.  While we do not dispute the fact that concerns on the part of the RIAA about protecting intellectual property are legitimate, we focus our attention in this paper on issues involving privacy and democracy that also arise in the debate about P2P file sharing in cyberspace In January 2003, a US District Court in the District of 
Columbia ruled that Verizon must comply with a subpoena by the Recording Industry Association of America requesting the name of a subscriber who allegedly made available more than 600 copyrighted music files over the Internet. The contention of the RIAA was that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA\upported its demand that Verizon release the name of the owner of the machine connected to its network that was involved in pirating over 600 proprietary musical recordings Verizon refused to comply with the subpoena, arguing that no pirated music was stored on its servers and that as an on-line service provider, Verizon fell outside the scope of the 
subpoena.  The ruling of the lower court concluded  that the subpoena power ... applies to all Internet service providers within the scope of the DMCA, not just to those service providers storing information on a system or network at the direction of a user 1   This ruling appalled the Internet community, especially critics who saw the decision as one advancing the interests of copyright owners at the expense of broader social values such as privacy and democracy In an appeals ruling on December 19, 2003, however, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
overturned the lower court\222s d ecision.  According to this court\222s interpretation, the DMCA applied only to those sites hosting illegal content and not to those simply transmitting it The Appeals Court also affirmed that while it was sympathetic to those who hold music copyrights, it was not in the court\222s purview to rewrite the DMCA.   Only Congress, the Court argued, could amend the DCMA.  To appreciate some of the  0-7803-8251-x/04/$20.00 \(C

controversial issues at stake in the Verizon v. RIAA dispute, it is important to understand aspects of the P2P architecture  II. P2P INFRASTRUCTURE The P2P architecture is a network of \223peer machines,\224 each identified with an IP \(Internet Protocol\s.  In this scheme, there are no fixed clients and servers.  Thus all nodes on the network are equal and they can both send and receive packets. P2P networks facilitate person-to-person communication and are not limited to file sharing. \(Email is a network application that can also be thought of along lines similar to a P2P model P2P networks like KaZaA and Grokster  use software to facilitate the sharing of music.  Their applications identify all nodes on their networks by their IP addresses, which are unique identifiers.  The P2P infrastructure facilitates this transfer, as any node can theoretically \223talk\224 to any other node on the network.  Unlike Napster, whic h used a centralized database and thus a centralized point of vulnerability for attack by the RIAA, later P2P models sought to preserve node anonymity as much as possible by eliminating the need for a centralized database. Most current implementations of the P2P architecture work on a distributed network structure. In these networks each node maintains its own local database and each \223talks\224 to a set of neighboring nodes when requesting a particular musical recording \(e.g., a specific song\ by a particular artist. The distributed algorithm of the network determines how this communication occurs.  A responding node that has the requested song replies and the file is sent.   The main point is that no one node knows about all the other nodes on the network Newer versions of P2P networks go one step further in trying to protect the privacy of the individual by not using identifiable IP addresses; instead, random address strings are used.  Jason Rohrer, a 26-year-old programmer, developed one such system called MUTE.  Each time a node connects, a new address is generated, making it extremely difficult to track  When a node requests a particular song, it sends the request to nearby nodes. If the song is not found, then those computers send out the request to the next set of nodes, etc. When the file is found, it is passed back through the network until it reaches the requestor.  Thus the privacy and anonymity of the user is protected In order for RIAA to find out the identity of a node, it would have to track the entire network.  "It's a scary environment to be living in when an organization like the RIAA can just snoop on what you're doing online," says Rohrer. "I've created a piece of software that helps people protect their privacy H i s response is reminiscent of that by Philip Zimmerman, who created Pretty Good Privacy \(PGP\ email encryption program that was designed to help users protect the privacy of their email communications Arguably, P2P architecture is inherently democratic.  It promotes democratic values by facilitating both open communication and freedom of speech. Furthermore, no one node in the network dominates.   Individuals have the opportunity to join P2P networks; in fact, there are communities of users associated with most file sharing networks.   Privacy is preserved in these networks both by the ISPs that provide access to P2P networks, and by the networks themselves.  We believe that the lawsuits advanced by the RIAA, which attempt to enforce copyright laws that are at best murky \226 and perhaps are even \223made-up rules,\224 as Jessica Litman ugg es t s 226 as t h e y appl y t o  s h ari n g of  m u si c ov er the Internet, undermine democratic values by threatening privacy  III. PRIVACY AND DEMOCRACY  What is the relationship between privacy and democracy? Is the former essential for the latter? Why is privacy valued? In this section, we address each of these fundamental questions involving personal privacy. To answer these questions however, we first try to get clear as to exactly what we mean by privacy   Defining Privacy  Privacy is a difficult concept to define. Often, privacy is closely associated with concepts such as liberty and autonomy both of which also are closely linked to democracy. In the context of cyberspace, privacy is also frequently associated with concepts such as anonymity and security. The notion of privacy in the US has evolved during the past two centuries from one that initially was concerned with governmental intrusion \(as expressed in the Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution\, to worries about governmental interference involving one\222s personal decisions \(expressed in important court decisions in the 1960s\ to current concerns about access to and control of personal information. Privacy is still often defined in terms of non-intrusion into one\222s personal space sometimes called \223accessibility privacy\224\iew that traces its roots to a definition of privacy in a classic article by Warren and Brandeis t ot h e r t i mes  pri v ac y i s defi n e d i n t e r m s of  non-interference into one\222s personal affairs \(a view that some describe as \223decisional privacy\224\nd, more commonly today privacy is viewed from the perspective of concerns having to do with access to and control over personal information i.e informational privacy We defend a definition of privacy introduced by James Moor [5 h ic h in corporates k e y ele m en t s of t h e non intrusion, non-interference, and informational views of privacy into a unified theory. According to Moor, an individual \223has privacy in a situation if in that particular situation the individual is protected from intrusion, interference, and information access by others.\224 [Italics A n i m port a n t  aspect in this definition is Moor's notion of a "situation." His definition of a situation is left deliberately broad so that it can apply to a range of contexts or "zones" that can be "declared  0-7803-8251-x/04/$20.00 \(C 50 


private" in a normative sense. In other words, a situation can be an "activity," a "relationship," or the "storage and access of information" in a computer or on the Internet. For example, a P2P context in cyberspace fits Moor\222s notion of a situation Should such a situation receive privacy protection Central to Moor's theory is a distinction between naturally private and normatively private situations. Moor\222s distinction enables us to differentiate between the conditions required for a\aving privacy, and \(b\having a right to privacy. This distinction, in turn, enables us to differentiate between a loss of privacy and a violation of privacy. Consider that in a naturally private situation, individuals are protected from access and interference from others by "natural" means. Examples would include physical boundaries in natural settings, such as when one is hiking alone in the woods. In this case, privacy can be  lost but not violated because there are no norms \226 conventional legal, or ethical \226 according to which one has a right or even an expectation to be protected. In a normatively private situation  on the other hand, individuals are protected by conventional norms. Privacy can be violated only in "normatively private situation" because it is only in those kinds of situations that zones or contexts that merit some kind of normative protection have been formally established. So for example, if we declare a P2P context to be normatively private, then organizations like the RIAA violate the privacy of individuals whenever they succeed in identifying the names of users via subpoenas directed at ISPs. Should ISPs in general, and P2P contexts in particular, be declared normatively private situations? If so should we presume in favor of protecting privacy as a starting point in negotiations, as DeCew [6 su gge st s P e r h a p s t h e  answer to this question presupposes an answer to a larger question: Why do/should we value privacy  Privacy as a Social Value  People generally agree, at least those in Western societies that personal privacy is something to be valued and protected But what kind of value is privacy? Is it something valued intrinsically, i.e., for its own sake? Or does privacy have only instrumental worth \226 as a means to some further end or ends Arguments for the view that privacy is an intrinsic value are extremely difficult to defend. Charles Fried [7 u e s t h at e v en  though privacy can be viewed as a value that is instrumental in one sense, there is another sense in which having privacy is also essential or necessary. We often tend to associate intrinsic values with necessary conditions, and instrumental values with conditions that are non-necessary or contingent. Because privacy is necessary for human ends such as trust and friendship, however, Fried believes that privacy cannot be a value that is merely contingent. So even though privacy has instrumental worth, Fried believes that we should conclude that privacy is not similar to most instrumental values. That is, we should not infer that privacy is simply one means among others that can be used to achieve important human ends such as trust and friendship. According to Fried, privacy is a necessary condition for achieving those ends Perhaps an analogy involving human biology can help to illustrate the central point of Fried's argument regarding the necessary-contingent vs. intrinsic-instrumental aspects of privacy. Consider that a human heart and a human appendix each have instrumental worth, but neither is valued intrinsically. Yet while the appendix has mere instrumental or contingent worth and can be removed without serious consequences to the biological survival of a human being having a heart \226 whether one's own natural heart, a transplanted heart, or even an artificial hear t \226 is essential or necessary for one's biological survival. Note that we do not value having a heart merely because it is means to some end, viz., having a biological life.  Instead, it is va lued because having a biological life would be inconceivable without having a heart. Similarly Fried believes that we value privacy not simply because it serves as a means to human ends such as trust and friendship rather, having those human ends would be inconceivable without privacy [8 Agreeing with the claim that privacy is more than merely an instrumental valu e s a s l igh t l y di ff eren t appro ach to illustrate this point. Like Fried, Moor argues that privacy is not an intrinsic value. However, Moor believes that privacy is the articulation or expression of security which he describes as a "core value." Security is a core value, Moor further argues because it is essential for human flourishing in all societies. So Moor, like Fried, shows why privacy, which is not itself an intrinsic value, is nonetheless essential to achieve certain important human ends. And Moor further suggests that as information technology insinuates itself more and more into our everyday lives, privacy becomes increasingly important as a mode for articulating or expressing the core value of security Others have argued that privacy is valuable because it essential for individual autonomy. James Rachels [9 o tes th at having privacy enables us to control how much personal information we wish to disclose to others and how much we elect to retain or not divulge. Thus one important value of privacy is that enables us to form relationships with individuals, ranging from intimate to casual, by being able to control how much information about ourselves we share with others  Privacy as Essential for Democracy  Does privacy have any \223social capital,\224 or is it simply an individual good? Privacy should not be thought of as a value that simply benefits individuals. For example, Priscilla Regan  a s poi n t ed ou t t h a t of t e n t i m es  w e are t e m p t e d t o f ra m e  the privacy debate simply in terms of how to balance privacy interests as an individual good against interests involving the larger social good. If we view privacy in that sense, Regan believes that support for those interests believed to benefit the social good will generally override concerns regarding individual privacy. If, however, privacy is understood not solely as a value concerned with individual good but as a value contributing to the broader social good, then concerns for individual privacy might have a greater chance of receiving equal consideration in debates involving the balancing of competing values. Along similar lines, Alan Westin d  0-7803-8251-x/04/$20.00 \(C 51 


others suggest that because privacy is essential for democracy it should be viewed as a social good. An examination of Westin\222s arguments for why this is so, however, would take us beyond the scope of this paper So it would appear that privacy is valued for several reasons 226 from those involving individual autonomy and choice to those involving greater social goods such as democracy. Thus privacy is not only a value worth protecting at the level of individuals, it is a social value that is essential for democracy And in so far as the actions of the RIAA threaten privacy, they threaten democracy itself We have briefly sketched some ways in which privacy and democracy are related. But what exactly is the relationship between democracy and the Internet? Is the Internet an inherently democratic medium? Does it enhance democracy Deborah Johns a s poi n t ed ou t  t h at cl ai m s i n v o l v i n g  t h e  connection between the Internet and democracy tend to be made in one of three different ways. Whereas some authors claim that the Internet is a democratic technology \(suggesting that it is inherently democratic\ers claim that the Internet tends to facilitate or even enhance technology. Still others claim that because democratic values are at stake in the cyberspace policies we adopt, we should develop the Internet along democratic principles. We defend this last view, arguing that the infrastructure of cyberspace should support democratic principles. And we believe that the P2P architecture does this Values underlying the P2P architecture \226 i.e., values involving freedom, choice, openness, etc. \226 would certainly seem to favor democratic ideals. Yet many recent laws and governmental policies seem to threaten a future cyberspace that is truly democratic and that exhibits democratic ideals Consider, for example, of the controversial Patriot Act and the implications it has for the possibility of undermining democratic ideals such as personal privacy and related basic civil liberties in cyberspace. But the threat to undermine democracy comes not only from federal laws, such as the Patriot Act, but also from commercial and interests. As we have seen, the policies advocated by the RIAA in the case of file sharing in cyberspace, also serve to erode further some of the basic civil liberties essential for a democratic system  IV. CONCLUDING REMARKS  As noted above, we have chosen privacy and democracy as the key topics on which to focus in our discussion of the moral implications in the Verizon v. RIAA case. Several additional ethical issues also arise in this case \226 perhaps most notably among these are concerns having to do with intellectual property. However, we deliberately elected not to approach our analysis from the perspective of property rights. Clearly property-right issues are very much at the heart of the Verizon case, especially from the point of view of the RIAA which is interested in protecting proprietary information from being exchanged freely via MP3 files. Because of this concern, one might reasonably argue that the \223presumption in favor of privacy\224 that we have defended, following DeCew [6  c a n b e  counterbalanced by a presumption in favor of protecting intellectual property rights. Such a presumption would no doubt support the RIAA\222s interests in protecting the proprietary information of is clients. However, we believe that another presumptive principle can be brought into play here. In particular, we also defend the presumptive principle 223Information Wants to Be Sh h i c h presum es against the \223fencing off\224 or enclosing of information in favor of a view of information as something that should be communicated and shared. This presumptive principle is offered as an alternative way of viewing the intellectual property debate; if adopted, we believe that it could help to reverse trend to turn all digitized information into a 223commodity\224 that can be hoarded and thus made more exclusive The arguments for adopting the presumptive principle that information wants to be shared which are elaborated upon in 14 c a nno t b e e xa m i ne d he r e  U nfo r t u na t e l y d o i ng so  w o ul d  take us beyond the scope of our present paper. However, we believe that when our presumptive principle \226 advocating the sharing of information as a default position \226 is combined with the interests at stake for protecting social values such as privacy and democracy in the current debate involving Verizon and the RIAA, we can justify a policy that tilts in favor of defending the position articulated by Verizon rather the one advanced by the RIAA. \(We have begun to see a realization of this combination of values in Web sites such as iTunes, which provides downloadable music at the reasonable cost of ninetynine cents per song.\As noted above, a thorough examination of the Verizon vs. RIAA case from the vantage point of intellectual-property-right issues requires a separate paper In focusing on privacy-and-democracy concerns related to the Verizon case, we have also indirectly touched on other moral issues, including those having to do with anonymity and liberty in cyberspace. Just as anonymity issues closely relate to concerns involving privacy, qu estions involving liberty are closely connected to those affecting democracy.  We noted that privacy is essential for a range of social values including liberty, which in turn is necessary for democracy. So by focusing on privacy concerns in the Verizon case, we have also shown some implications this case also has for liberty and freedom, which underlie the possibility of realizing democracy in cyberspace  A CKNOWLEDGMENT   Sections 3 and 4 of this essay draw heavily from material previously published in H.

4 Statistical Analysis The M-Max subroutine requires that we estimate the probability of an error 226 i.e an itemset which is actually frequent but appears with frequency of less than the lowered frequency threshold in the sample An over estimation may result in an unnecassary decrease in 000 002 004 005 007 which would result in a larger than required number of candidates Here we describe the probability bound we have used in our implementation which outperforms the naive Chernoff bound discussed in the original paper which described the Sampling algorithm Let b n 005 007 n 016 be the frequency of some arbitrary itemset 017 in 020 022  Consider a random sample 023 of size 024 from 020 022  We will assume that transactions in the sample are independent Hence the number of rows in 023 which contain 017 can be seen as a random variable 025 027 022 032 033 034 024 037 005 007   The frequency of 017 in 024 transactions  005 007  025  024 is an estimate for 005 007  which improves as 024 increases The best-known way to bound the chance that  005 007 will deviate from 005 007 is with the Chernoff bound We use a tighter bound for the case of binomial distributions see Hagerup and Rub 7  007 034  005 007   005 007  0 2  4 6 8 016  005 007 016   005 007      A 8 005 007  005 007    A B D Lemma 1 Given a random uniform sample 023 of N transactions from 020 022  a frequency threshold E 032 033 F 007 H I thelowered frequency threshold 000 002 004 005 007  and the negative border of J K L N  A O 023 Q  denoted 024 022  the probability S  T U K V A W that any 017 Y 024 022 will have frequency larger than or equal to E 032 033 F 007 H I hence causing failure is bounded by  024 022   6 8 016  E 032 033 F 007 H I 016  000 002 004 005 007    K L N  A 8 E 032 033 F 007 H I 000 002 004 005 007  K L N  A B D For any speci\036c itemset in 024 022  the probability that this itemset will cause failure is the probability that its estimated frequency is below 000 002 004 005 007 while its actual frequency is above E 032 033 F 007 H I  Substituting E 032 033 F 007 H I for 005 007 and 000 002 004 005 007 for  005 007  the bound gives us  007 034  F 007 H I 034 017 037 020 022   F 007 H I 034 017 037 023   0 c  4 6 8 016  E 032 033 F 007 H I 016  000 002 004 005 007    K L N  A 8 E 032 033 F 007 H I 000 002 004 005 007  K L N  A B D As for the entire 024 022   007 034 e 017 Y 024 022 h 017 005 i 032 000   4 m n o D p  007 034 017 005 i 032 000   4  1 2 4 8 15 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18  D\212Sampling Speedup Number of Computers Speedup T20.I6.D200M, MinFreq = 1 T10.I4.D375M, MinFreq = 0.5 T5.I2.D600M, MinFreq = 0.25 Linear Speedup  Figure 1 D-Sampling speedup  024 022  6 8 016  E 032 033 F 007 H I 016  000 002 004 005 007    K L N  A 8 E 032 033 F 007 H I 000 002 004 005 007  K L N  A B D Since calculating the negative border is in itself a costly process we choose to relax this bound by substituting  w   J K L N  A O 023 Q  for  024 022   Obviously any itemset in J K L N  A O 023 Q can only be extended by at most  w  items and thus this relaxed bound holds Corollary 1 Toivonen 1996 If none of the itemsets in the negative border caused failure then no other itemset can cause failure Any other itemset 017 outside J K L N  A O 023 Q and 024 022 must include a subset from 024 022  Hence its frequency must be less than or equal to the frequency of this subset It follows that if the frequency of each itemset in 024 022 is below E 032 033 F 007 H I  so is the frequency of 017  5 Experiments We carried out three sets of experiments The 036rst set tested D-Sampling to see how much faster it is to run the algorithm with the database split among 033 machines than to run it on a single node The second set compared DSampling DDM and FDM on a range of E 032 033 F 007 H I values The last one checked scale-up the change in runtime when the number of machines is increased together with the size of the database We ran our experiments on two clusters the 036rst cluster which was used for the 036rst second and fourth sets of experiments consisted of 15 Pentium computers with dual 1.7GHz processors Each of the computers had at least 1 Proceedings of the Third IEEE Internati onal Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM\22203 0-7695-1978-4/03 $ 17.00 \251 2003 IEEE

candidates it uses more communication As can be seen from the graphs in 036gure 3 D-Sampling is scalable in two of the tests In fact for mid-range numbers of computers DSampling runs even faster than with 000 001 003  this is due to the superlinear speed-u p discussed earlier The mild slowdown seen in 036gure 3c is due to the smaller average pattern size and the smaller number of candidates in T5.I2.D1200M The larger the number of candidates the greater the saving in candidates when the number of computers increases If there are enough large patterns this saving will compensate for the increasing communication overhead Such is not the case however with T5.I2.D1200M 6 Conclusions and Future Research We presented a new D-ARM algorithm that uses the communication ef\036ciency of the DDM algorithm to parallelize the single-scan Sampling algorithm Experiments prove that the new algorithm h as superlinear speedup and outperforms both FDM and DDM with any 004 006 000 007 b n f value The exact improvement in relation to previous algorithms depends on the number of database scans they require Experiments demonstrat e good scalability provided the database scan is the major bottleneck of the algorithm Some open questions still remain First it would be interesting to continue partitioning the database until every partition becomes memory resident This approach may lead to a D-ARM algorithm that mines a database by loading it into the memory of large number of computers and then runs with no disk-I/O at all Second it would be interesting to have a parallelized version of the other single-scan ARM algorithm 226 DIC 226 on a share-nothing cluster  or of the two-scans partition algorithm Finally we feel that the full potential of the M-Max algorithm has not yet been

9 Here are some observations and explanations on the results 1\The total time of our comparison includes the time to write the association rules to a file; Bit-AssocRule is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than the various Apriori algorithms \(64-221 times faster\he test data set, the big the time difference between the BitAssocRule and the various Apriori algorithms. We havenêt compared our algorithm with some of the other association rule algorithms such as VIPER  13,24] \(CHARM and CL OSE are base d on the closed frequent itemsets concept\d on their published comparison results with Apriori, our BitAssocRule is very competitive compared to them and a direct comparison will be conducted and reported in the near future 2\e or litter longer time than the various Apriori algorithms in constructing the 1-itemsets because of the extra cost of building the bitmaps for the 1-itemsets. But after the 1-itsemtset is done, Bit-AssocRule is significant faster than the Apriori algorithms in constructing large frequent itemsets because it only uses the fast bit operations \(AND COUNT and SHIFT\nd doesnêt need to test the subsets of the newly candidate 3\aps of the frequent items, and the bitmap storage \(uncompressed less than the original data set \(1/2 to 1/4 of the original data size The main reasons that Bit-AssocRule algorithm is significant faster than Apriori and its variations are 1\ocRule adopts the divide-and-conquer strategy, the transaction is decompose into vertical bitmap format and leads to focused search of smaller domain There is no repeated scan of entire database in BitAssocRule 2\snêt follow the traditional candidate-generate-and test approach, thus saves significant amount of time to test the candidates 3\basic operations are bit Count and bit And operations, which are extremely faster than the pattern search and matching operations used in Apriori and its variations 5. Conclusion The contributions of this paper are in two aspects:  we extend the application domains of bitmap techniques and introduce the bitmap techniques for complex DSS query optimization and association algorithm. We present a bitmap based query optimization algorithm to optimize complex query with multiple table join based on outer join operations and push the outer join operations from the data flow level to the bitmap level and achieve significant performance gain.   We introduce a novel algorithm to calculate the foundset for those tables involved in the prejoin table by using prejoin_bitmap_indexes and integrate this algorithm into the current commercial data flow based query engine seamlessly. Our query optimization can achieve an order of magnitude faster than conventional query engine Secondly we introduce the bitmap technique to the data mining procedure and develop a bitmap-based algorithm Bit-AssocRule to find association rules. Our BitAssocRule avoids the time-consuming table scan to find and prune the itemsets, all the operations of finding large itemsets from the datasets are the fast bit operations. The experimental result of our Bit-AssocRule algorithm with Apriori and AprioirHybrid algorithms shows Bit-AssocRule is2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster. This research indicates that bitmap technique can greatly enhance the performance for decision support queries and finding association rule, and bitmap techniques are very promising for the decision support query optimization and DM applications Bitmap technique is only one way to improve the performance of complex DSS queries and DM algorithm Parallelism is another crucial factor to improve the performance of DSS and data mining.  We are currently working on paralleling the bitmap-based algorithms and hope to report our findings in the near future 6. References  Agrawal R.

Related work The most similar to the representations based on generalized disjunctive sets is the NDR representation which consists of all frequent non-derivable itemsets [7 8], and the representations based on ?-free sets [7, 9]. It was shown in [8], that for each non-empty itemset Z, one can derive the lower bound \(l\(Z u\(Z on sup\(Z from the fact that sup\(Z Non-derivable itemsets are those for which u\(Z Z gt; 0. If u\(Z Z sup\(Z supersets Y of a derivable itemset are also derivable and u\(Y Y Y such that neither sup\(Z Z Z Z It was proved in [7, 8] that u\(Z Z  u\(Z?{a Z?{a for |Z| ? 1 This important result was used in [7, 8] to determine the upper bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets namely: non-derivable itemsets are not longer than log2|D|? + 1 Hence, the bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets is identical to the bound on the length of generalized disjunction-free sets \(please see Theorem 3.2 It has been proved in [7] that ?-free sets are a subset of non-derivable itemsets, so their length is also bounded by ?log2|D|? + 1 There is a claim in [7, 9] that the generalized disjunction-free sets equal the ?-free sets. This claim however, is not correct, which we will prove by the example beneath. Table 4 contains all generalized disjunction-free sets. Among them, there is {fh}, the support of which equals 0. The support bounds for {fh are found as follows \(please, see [7] for the details  sup\({fh f h   sup\({fh f  sup\({fh h  sup\({fh Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Hence, l\({fh fh fh sup\({fh free, is not a ?-free set Since the families of the generalized disjunction-free sets and ?-free sets may differ, finding the relationship between them or between the generalized disjunction-free sets and non-derivable itemsets remains a challenge 8. Conclusions The representations based on generalized disjunctionfree sets belong to the most concise ones among all lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In 


lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
