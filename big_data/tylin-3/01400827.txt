2004 IEEE International Converence on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Mining Circumstance-oriented Association Rules Using Singular Value Dlecomposition Technique  Yong Chen Dept of Computer Science University of Hang Kong yongchen@csis.hku.hk Abstract  Association rule has evolved fiom the primitive form of single dimension infratransaction fa the form of multi-dimension intertransaction The challenge for mining multi-dimension intertransaction rules is the formidable search space Researchers hove propo.sed various methods to handle this problem such as restricting the number 
of dimensions confining sea.Vch space in a small window, etc. These methods unavoidably hove negative impact on mining result and they are less efective when the number of dimensions and the length of rule are really large Moreover all these methods ire derived om the Apriori algorithm and have common weaknesses time consuming and redundancy caused by the iterative nahire of the Apriori algorithm To approcich this problem from a dyerent angle we propose to use he singular value decomposition technique\(SVD With SID the multi-dimension intertransaction rules can be easily identified 
Keywords data mining; information analysis 1 Introduction The algorithm for mining association rules initially suggested by Agawal Imielinski and Swami in 1993 I has been widely used in many industries such as supermarket, banking, stock market, etc To fulfill vari,m requirements in different applications, association rule has evolved into a wide variety of types The primitive association rule looks lie 223customers buying beer are most likely to buy diaper too\224 This kind of rules is called singledimensional boolean association rule 223single dimensional\224 means only one attribute item name is considered; \223boolean\224 means we only care about if a item appears io a transaction 
but not about other aspects such as the purchase quantity The association rule has evolved in several directions 223Multidimensional association rule 224 II 12 131 and \223sequential association rule\224[2 5 6 7 8 9 IO are two major directions attracting many attenticns A typical multidimensional association rule looks like 223students aging from 20 to 29 are likely to pay by credit card\224 In this example three attributes occupation student age \(from 20 to 29\and payment habit ay by 222 0-7803-8566-7/04/$20.00 0 2004 IEEE Kwok-ping Chan 
Dept of Computer Science University of Hang Kong kpchan@csis.hku.hk credit card are involved A typical sequential association rule looks like 223customer is most likely to buy badminton after he has already bought racket\224 The multidimensional association rule and the sequential association rule are able to provide more useful and meaningful information than the traditional association rule Recently, researchers tried to mine more complex rules such as multidimensional sequential association rule 5 21 and multidimensional intertransaction association rule U Typical examples are as follows An example for multidimensional sequential 
rule is 223if a customer of an Internet Service Provider ISP is young then most likely he has the following purchase behaviors fmt subscribe to a 100-hour free trail package second subscribe to a 15-hour/month package third subscribe to a 3O-hour/month package finally subscribe to an unlimited package\224 Two attributes customer age and the type of service package are involved. However, only one attribute the type of service package is involved in the description of the purchase behaviors The other attributre customer age is only used to identify a particular group of customers who follow the purchase pattem 
An example for multidimensional intertransaction association rule is \223if the humidity is high in day 1 and the temperature is high in day 2 then most likely there is high rainfall in day 3\224 Three attributes are involved in the rule Actually multidimensional intertransaction association rule can capture cross-attribute association relationship in a temporal space. This is very meaningful considering it can be used to predict the value of an attribute based on the previous values of all attributes Typical examples include daily meteorological report daily trading record of stock market etc It is reasonable to think 
all attribute values occurring over a period of time actually form one kind of circumstance in which the current value of one particular attribute develops. Inspired by this analysis we propose a new kind of association rules which can reflect the association relationship between the circumstance and the value of an attribute We refer to this kind of association rules as circumstance-oriented association rule A typical example looks like 223if the temperature is in range of A in day 1 the humidity is in the range of B in day 2  the 3169 


visibility is in range of Z in day n-1 then the wind will be strong in day n\224 Compared with multidimensional intertransaction association rule more dimensions and transactions can be dealt with in the circumstance-oriented association rule Therefore, the search space will he very large It is a big obstacle In this study we use Singular Value Decomposition SVD technique to tackle this problem The remainder of this paper is organized as follows Section 2 presents a formal description of the problem Section 3 introduces some related researches so that readers can have a better understanding of our algorithm Section 4 analyzes the problem we will face during establishing the circumstance-oriented association rules Section 5 presents the solution to the problem Section 6 shows the experimental results and related analysis Conclusion is given in section I 2 Problem Statement Let S=<sl,sz,...s  be n consecutive observations of one object Each observation is characterized by m attributes al,az...a  An element of S si is represented as ai a p consecutive observations in S s,=\(al,a I1 z a,},...,sp=\(al,aZ,...aP_ I PP can be thought of as one kind of circumstance Our purpose is to mine interesting rules which reflect the association relationships between the circumstance and the value of the jth attribute in the l observation ap+l,l rj sm 3 Related Researches In this section, we would like to briefly review some researches about mining sequential rules multidimensional rules, multidimensional sequential rules and multidimensional intertransaction rules In 1995 Agrawal and Srikant introduced the concept of sequential association rule and suggested the AprioriSome and the AprioriAll algorithm 2 The sequential association rule is usually mined out from a special database called sequence database The sequence database can be derived from a transaction datahase by reorganizing transaction records to track the purchase history of each individual customer Srikant and Agrawal proposed the GSP algorithm to mine sequential pattern in 1996 SI In this method hash-tree technique was used Based on the GSP algorithm Zaki developed the SPADE algorithm by introducing lattice-theoretic technique in 2001 which can effectively reduce the search space Garofalakis, Rastogi and Shim introduced the concept of regular expression into miniig sequential pattern and developed a family of algorithms called SPIRIT By using this algorithm user can interact with the miniig process The mining results will be more suitable to users\222 needs Multidimensional association rule as another important research topic has also attracted many research efforts The main challenge for mining multidimensional association rule is the large search space caused by the mnltidimentionality and huge numher of possible values of attributes Srikant and Agrawal in 7 dealt with the problem by fiely partitioning the values of attributes and then combining adjacent partitions as necessary The main contribution of 7 is that it proposed an algorithm to optimally distribute values into individual subsequences so that more interesting rules can be discovered. In 8 91 Kamber and Pei ef ai put constraints on attributes to reduce the search space. Fukuda Yasuhiko and Morimoto concentrated on miniig rules in a two-dimension space in IO In a relatively small multidimensional space they can identify a continuous region satisfying user-specified confidence threshold The continuous region is called admissible region The admissible region is usually formed by merging some adjacent cells Therefore, the association rules have a compact representation On the contrary the rules mined out in other study were represented in a \223discrete\224 manner Also they visualized the association des in their study Therefore users can get an intuitive observation on the rules mined out Based on the observation users can even interact with the mining algorithm The major pitfall of this approach is that it is only capable of mining two-dimension association rule Pinto et ai attempted to combine the two concepts 223multidimensionality\224 and 223sequence\224 in ll The rule mined out looks like attribute-I attribute-2  attribute m description For example we have Age=Young Education=University subscribe to a 100-hour free trail package  subscribe to a 15-hourimonth package  subscribe to a 30-hourimonth package  subscribe to an unlimited package This means if a customer is young and his education status is high then most likely he tend to follow the purchase behaviors described in the square brackets They implemented the algorithm by embedding multidimensional information into sequences or by integrating efficient sequential pattern mining algorithm and mnltidimentional analysis method However these methods have difficulty in dealing with high dimensionality and long sequence since the simple integration of these methods does not works well On the other hand only one attribute 223service package\224 is concerned in the description part Hence this kind of rules cannot reflect the cross-attribute association relationships  Strictly speaking they are not multidimensional rule Lu and Feng defined the concept 223multidimensional intertransaction rule\224 in 12 131 which is able to reflect cross-attribute association relationships They used a sliding window single dimensional window for mining single dimensional case multidimensional window for mining multidimensional case to confine the search space With the window each record has a relative address 3170 


4 Problem Analysis All these studies discussed above used Apriori-lie algorithm, which is based on the anti-monotone property if any length k pattem is not frequent in the database its length k+l super-pattem can never be frequent The essential idea of Apriori-like algorithm is to iteratively generate the set of candidate itemsets of length k+l fiom the set of frequent itemsets of length k Hence Apriori lie algorithms is inherently time-consuming The situation becomes worse when dealing with multidimensional sequential case In researches mentioned in section 3 the following measures have been taken to alleviate the problem bucketing values of quantitative attribute putting constraints on attributes confming searching scope etc These measures weaken the power of the mining algorithm Their effect is also limited when the number of dimension is really large and the sequence is really long Apiori-like algorithm has another weakness We take the algorithm in I21 as an example Assume tkre are two sequences mined out a,,aj,a and a:,ab,a,k 1 Si,j,k Sn I rq,r,s cm Superscripts i j and k represent time points at which observations are taken subscriptl q r and s represent the indices of attributes Two association rules can be derived from them a andaj a ind a and a6 a The former implies that 06 occurs first a occurs second then a occurs The latter implies lhat ai occurs first ai occurs second then at oc\(:ur However in real life the following story may happen ab is hound to occur as long as a and a have already occurred in any order The Apriori-like algorithms are unable to deal with such kind of problem These two sequences may be missed during mining process if their respective support counts cannot reach the threshold, exen if the sum of their support counts may satisfies the threshold requirement On the other hand it will be redundant if both of them get into final rule set 5 Solution Undoubtedly we need a technique other than Apriori like algorithm to break the bottleneck posed by multidimensionality and long sequences In this study we use the SVD technique to tackle this problem In malrix theory any arbitrary rectangular matrix W MxN n-ith different entities on the rows and columns can be decomposed into 3 matrices Among them two ue rectangular matrices with their column vectors being orthogonal to each other They are called lei and right singular matrix and usually denoted by U and V l'he remaining one is a diagonal matrix, denoted by S whose diagonal elements are non-negative singular values soned in descending order The diagonal matrix represents a nsw space called semantic space The row vectors of W are projected onto the orthogonal basis formed by the column vectors of the right singular matrix V similarly the column vectors of W are projected onto the orthogonal basis formed by the column vectors of the lei singular matrix U W can be completely reconstructed from U V and S However W is usually approximated by the most important R factors ignoring smaller less important factors This can be expressed as W W  USVT 1 where U MxR left singular matrix with vector S RxR diagonal matrix of singular values V RxN right singular matrix with row vectors R~I~~\(M,N order of decomposition, the rank of W In I Wis the best rank-R approximation to W Detailed explanation can be found in 14 Actually SVD transforms the high-dimension discrete MxN matrix into a low-dimension continuous vector space S RxR also called semantic space in language model field A row vector in the original matrix can be expressed as U in the new space a column in the original matrix can be expressed as SVT That is uiS and Sv represent the positions of the i row and the j column of the original matrix in the new space Essentially SVD operation breaks down the original relationships between rows and columns into linearly independent factors Many of them are less significant and can be omitted We keep the most interesting R factors it R dimensions in the S space which reflects the principal structural associations hidden in the original matrix The original matrix i.e a 2-D relationship table is usually very large and sparse In addition, it can only provide a primitive description about the relationships between the rows and columns SVD operation can easily get rid of the above deficiencies In semantic space S the number of dimensions, R is much less than M and N As discussed in the above description we can use SVD technique to captures the major structural associations hidden in original W although less meaningful factors are ignored. This is because the associations between vectors in the semantic space are determined by the overall pattern hidden in W instead of specific trivial details Therefore we can avoid the interference caused by trivial details The purpose of our study is to find interesting association mles An association rule consists of two parts the antecedent part and the consequent part An association mle embodies one kind of causality A traditional association rule looks like AIAAZA...AA,+B Ai,l Si Sm and B are attribute ui,l Si SM s tS2 8 BSIL  0 vi,l Si SN 3171 


value pairs The antecedent part AlAA2A...AAm describes one kind of circumstance in which the consequent part B develops. Using conjunctive attribute value pairs to describe the antecedent part i.e the circumstauce has a number of weaknesses First to fid rules with long antecedent part the miniig time will be very long Second the sequence of attribute-value pairs in antecedent part are order sensitive That is different permutations of attribute-value pairs have different meanings However in real life the consequence is usually associated with what events have already happened but not with the order in which those events happened One typical example is the case of mining students\222 examination records Assume that we are interested in those rules which reveal the relationship between exam results and whether a degree should be awarded students who pass all course exams will be awarded an academic degree totally three courses are required to he taken by students in any order. According to the mining algorithm described in 12 We may fmd rules 223Coursel-pass Course2-pass and Course3-pass then degree-awarded\224; \223Course3-pass Course2-pass and Coursel-pass then degree-awarded\224 Essentially, the two rules reflect the same association relationship between the exam results and the degree-awarding decision A student will he awarded the degree as long as he passes the three courses, regardless of the order in which he takes the three courses. Actually, taking the order into account may make it more difficult to find intrinsic associations. In essence all the above three weaknesses are caused by the iterative nature of the Apriori-like algorithm-finding the length k+l frequent itemset based on length k frequent itemset To find long frequent itemset the process will repeat many times Additionally, the order of the elements in the itemset has to be preserved during the whole mining process S 12 131 Based on the above discussion we propose the following SVD-based mining algorithm to find circumstance-oriented association rules The can be described as follows 1 divide observation sequence S=<s,,s2,...sn into n-Z+l subsequences by passing a sliding window of size Z through the whole sequence 2 Cluster the subsequences into categories each of which represents a kind of circumstance 3 Construct a MxN matrix W Each column represents a circumstance. Each row represents an attribute If an attribute is categorical then each possible categorical value is represented by a row If an attribute is quantitative, then we discretize the attribute into a few intervals Each interval is represented by a row Each entry represents the occurrence frequency of a particular value of an attribute in a certain circumstance 4 Decompose the mahix into U V and S Calculate the dot product of between the i-th row of U$\224 and the j-th column ofv,S\222\224 which indicates the extent of association between the i-th attribute value and the j-th circumstance If the value satisfies a user-specified threshold, the association will be collected as rule Given a sequence of observations we evaluate and assign it to a particular class. Then we retrieve the rules database to see if there are any association rules whose antecedent part can match with this circumstance class If so the consequent part of this matched rule will tell what may happen next As illustrated above the challenge posed by multidimensionality and long sequences can be easily tackled in the semantic space The circumstance-oriented rules have a different look than traditional association rules In left hand side it is a circumstance in the right hand side it is the consequence which develops in the circumstance Actually the circumstance represents a class of observations which have similar features We will present an example in section 6 6 Experiments In this study we use meteorological data to test the rules mined out. The meteorological data is obtained from hm://uwv.!uuni.nlivoorkd/index enp.html Daily values On-line time series of Dutch stations\which was produced by the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute Specifically, we use the meteorological data recorded during 1981-2002 at the Maastricht peek station station number 380 The data from 1981 to 2000 is used as training data the data of 2001 is used to determine an appropriate value for R the data of 2002 is used as test data The data is provided in text format Totally there are 16 attributes in each observation STN  station-number 06  23S=DeKooy,260=De Bilt,280=Eelde,290=Twenthe,3 1 O=Vlissingen,380 Maastricht YYYYMMDD date DDVEC  prevailing wind direction in degrees 360=North, 180=South,27O=West, @calm FG  daily mean windspeed in 0.1 mis FHX  maximum hourly mean windspeed in 0.1 ds FX maximumwindgustinO.lm/s TG daily mean temperature in 0.1 degrees Celsius TN  minimum temperature in 0.1 degrees Celsius TX  maximum temperature in 0.1 degrees Celsius SQ  sunshine duration in 0.1 hour 1 for 0.05  SP=percentage of max possible sunshine duration DR precipitation duration in 0.1 hour RH  daily precipitation amount in 0.1 mm 1 for PG daily mean surface air pressure in 0,l hPa VVN  minimum visibility NG  cloud cover in octants \(9=sky invisible  0,05 mm 3172 


Except station number STN and date YYYYMMDD there are 14 meteorological attributes All of them are quantitative attributes except cloud cover NG We partition the domain of the attribute wind direction DDVEC into 9 intervals i.e 045 45-90 90 135 135 180 180-225 225-270, 270-315 315-360 and calm The domain of the remaining 13 quantitative attributes is partitioned into 6 intervals. Finally there are 87 independent attributes These attributes form a 223vocabulary 224 A weather condition is described with these \223words\224 in the vocabulary 6.1 Window size To use the SVD technique fust we construct a matrix Each row represents an attribute mentioned above Each column represents a circumstance To create various circumstances, we fmt produce all possible subsequences of observations by moving a window through the sequence of observations The total number of the subsequences depends on the sue of the window For example if there are 6 observations in the sequence md the window size is 3 then totally 4 subsequences can be generated More importantly, by setting window size io a value, say Z we mean the current attribute value is mainly associated with the previous Z observations 6.2 Clustering observation subsequences The meteorological records contain both quantitative and categorical attributes We use the k-prototypes algorithm suggested by Huang in 21 to chter observation subsequences The main feature of the k prototypes algorithm resides in its capability of clustering objects with both quantitative and categorical attributes Assume that the dissimilarity between two mixed-type objects X and Y which are described by attributes A;,A Ai,A  A can be measured by j=l j=p+l where, the weighty is used to strike a balance between the quantitative attributes and the categorical attributes It is determined empirically In out experiment y is 0.9 And If the sliding window size is 2 then every subsequence consists of Z observations, and each observation consists of m attributes Therefore Zxm attributes are involved in a subsequence We use the Zxm attributes as the attributes of an observation subsequence when clustering The procedure for clustering is as follows I Select k initial classes 2 Allocate an object to the class which is the nearest to it according to 3 Update the mean of this class after each allocation 3 After all objects have been allocated to clusters retest the dissimilarity of objects against the current means If an object is found such that its nearest mean belongs to another class rather than its current one, reallocate the object to that class and update the means 4 Repeat step 3 until no object has changed classes after a full cycle test of the whole data set The sliding window sue is 20 tberefore the number of subsequences of the training data totals 365 Day x20 Year 20 Window Size I 7281 We partition these subsequences into 100 clusters representing 100 circumstances 6.3 SVD processing Using the k-prototypes algorithm we get a matrix which has 87 rows and 100 columns The value in each cell represents occurrence times of a particular attribute value developed in a certain circumstance To determine an appropriate value for R we conducted the following experiment By using SVD technique we produce a series of semantic spaces by changing R from 2 to 28 with the step size of 2 In each of these semantic spaces we select 100 most interesting association rules and test the prediction rate of these rules on the data of 2001 Based on the test result we determine the value of R As shown in Figure-1, the trajectory increases quickly in the initial stage but levels off after point R=22 Hence in our study we set R to 22 6.4 Mining results We calculate the dot product of the ith row of U~S\224 and the jth column ofvjS\222/\221 representing the extent of association between the ith attributes and the jth circumstance We select the most interesting association rules to form the final rule set Some examples of rules are shown in  Each circumstance is represented by a cluster center 6.5 Application We tested the rules on the meteorological data of Year 2002 We moved a sliding window of sue 20 over Observation sequence to form circumstances. We measure the Euclidean distances between each circumstance and the center of individual clusters Find the shortest one If the shortest Euclidean distance satisfies a user-specified threshold then the circumstance is assigned to the corresponding cluster There are totally 7,800 possible rules The higher the extent of association between a circumstance and a result the higher its predication rate 31 73 


upon application. The prediction rate of the whole rule database will decrease as more rules are admitted as shown in Figure-2 \(solid line 7 Conclusion In this study we proposed the circumstance-oriented association rules We used the SVD technique to deal with high dimensionality and long sequence The experimental results showed that the approach is promising  s 5 100 90 80  2 95 3 85 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 e a Value of R Fig-1 Prediction rate vs value of R Table-1 Examples for circumstance-oriented association rules s 95  5 90 _ s 85  m 80 a e 100 200 300 400 500 600 1-Circumstance-oriented Rule I Fig-2 Predication rate VS number of rules References l Agrawal R Imielinski T and Swami A 223Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases\224 proceedings of the 1993 ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data Washington D.C May 26-28.

consequently, the results approach more of the presented for the classic vector space model. The several possibilities of values of the parameters were tested however the collections behave in a similar way in its alteration The experiments showed that the proposed model improves the average precision of the answer set for all collections. Besides, the obtained medium precision was not harmed by the recall increase happened when expanding the queries 7. Conclusions In this paper, we presented an extension to the vector space model to contemplate the dependence among the terms of the collection. In the proposed model, the dependence among the terms is represented geometrically in the vector space The proposed model bases on the rotation of the term vectors, in agreement with the dependence among the terms. This rotation is made based on techniques that generate information on the correlation among terms of Proceedings of the International Database Engineering and Applications Symposium \(IDEAS  04 1098-8068/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the collection. In this work, we used the association rules, however, other techniques can be used The generation of association rules is a known technique of data mining, which allows finding frequent patterns in large databases. In the context of this paper it is used to find sets of terms that appear simultaneously in the collection of documents. This information is useful to modify the term vectors, so that they reflect the semantics of co-occurrence defined for the association rules The extension to the vector space model we presented contemplates the dependence among terms in a clear, flexible and new way. It is clear because the dependence incorporation among the terms is made step by step and the vector space basis reflects the semantics defined for the adopted technique. The proposed model is flexible because it allows the correlation incorporation among the terms of collection obtained in several ways Finally, the proposal is new because in the literature there is not an extension to the vector space model which modifies the vector space basis how it was done in this work We evaluated the effectiveness of the model proposed with four reference collections. There was an increase in the retrieval model effectiveness in comparison with the classic vector space model for all of the reference collections used As future works, the effectiveness of the proposed model will be compared to the effectiveness of the generalized vector space model. Besides, we will research other methods of obtaining correlation among the terms of a collection of documents. These methods will be incorporated in a geometric way to the model proposed in this paper. We also intended to evaluate the model proposed for larger collections formed by Web documents References 1]  Agrawal, R., Imielinski, T., Swami, A  Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases   Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD Conference,.

The number of tuples created by this step is S  50  c  1   2  4   The rest of the steps create itemsets that should not participate in the count We create three different kind of tuples that break one

algorithm is independent to the ordering of the tuples Estimate the implication count using algorithm NIPS/CI with a fringe size of four and also without a bounded fringe Perform one hundred such experiments and calculate the mean and the standard deviation of both estimations The total number of tuples for each experiment can be derived by adding the partial number of tuples created in each

of the mean error as that was computed by one hundred such experiments.The deviation is generally negligible which means that the error of the estimated S is always very close to the mean error We also observe that the difference between the estimation using a bounded fringe of size four and a unbounded one is negligible for a very wide range of implication counts and therefore a size of four

accurate estimates for distinct value queries and event reports This algorithm outperforms other estimators that are based on uniform sampling[8 9 e v e n when using much less sample space We also provide comparison with our Implication Lossy Counting ILC algorithm described in Section 5.1 which is based in the Lossy Counting algorithm introduced in For this series of experiments we used a real dataset of eight dimensions which was given to us by an OLAP company whose name we cannot disclose due to our agreement The cardinalities of the dimensions are presented in Table 3 The parameters of the algorithms are presented in Table 5 For NIPS/CI we used 64 concurrent bitmaps with a fringe size of four thus requiring memory enough to hold  2 4  1   64  K  1920 itemsets We expect that the averaging”\([5 o v e r these man y bitmaps will result in an error less than 10 We used the exact same sample space for DS The bound parameter t for DS was set to  1920  50  following the suggestion in F o r ILC we used an approximation parameter   0  01 which increases the memory requirements of ILC relative to those of NIPS/CI or DS On the average ILC used more than twice the memory that NIPS/CI and DS used For example for the experiment in Figure 7\(B it used more than 8,000 entries We evaluate the results of the algorithms with respect to the number of tuples the cardinality of the participating dimensions and the implication conditions To simulate a real data stream scenario we tracked the conditional implication counts of A  B  E  F and the unconditional B  E using the aforementioned algorithms The rst workload corresponds to quite large compound cardinality while the second to very moderate cardinalities Table 4 presents the actual aggregates for various instances of the stream for   5 and  1  60 We believe that most workloads fall somewhere in the middle with respect to the complexity of the wanted implications and the size of the returned counts Figure 7\(A depicts the relative error as the stream evolves for workload A using the algorithms DS NIPS/CI and ILC for different implication parameters In Figure a we show the results for minimum support   5 and  1  60 or  1  80 The different  1 are encoded in the parentheses next to identication of the algorithm in the legend of the graph In Figure b we increased the minimum support to   50 We observe that the behavior of DS varies widely while NIPS/CI remains always below the expected 10 error DS actually keeps a sample of the distinct elements seen so far and tries to scale the implication count that holds for that sample to the whole set of distinct elements In most cases the data in the sample is not representative of the implication The situation for DS is exacerbated when the minimum support increases where quite a lot of samples do not participate in the count making the scaling even more errorprone Algorithm ILC in all cases returned very erroneous results although it used much more space than NIPS/CI and DS since it tries to store not the implication counts but the actual implicated itemsets In these workload the implicated itemsets overwhelm its available memory which is actually larger than the amount given to NIPS/CI and DS In gure 7\(B we present the results of the algorithms for workload B The situation is still in favor of NIPS/CI whose relative error remains always close to the expected 10 unlike DS who returns highly skewed errors even though the domain cardinalities are much smaller and therefore keeps in the sample space much more data As expected from the analysis the error guarantees of NIPS/CI are virtually unaffected by changes in the cardinalities or the number of tuples seen so far in the stream ILC returns very erroneous results although now the cardinalities and the implicated items are much smaller compared to those of workload A The reason is not only because it keeps too much information in memory i.e all the implicated itemsets while both NIPS/CI and DS only hold a mantissa for the count but also because the constraint    rel is broken as the number of tuples increases 7 Related Work There are unique challenges in query processing for the data stream model Most challenges are the result of the streams being potentially unbounded in size Therefore the amount of the storage required in order to get an exact size may also grow out of bounds Another equally important issue is the timely query response required although the volumes of data the need to be processed is continually augmented at a very high rate Essentially the amount of computation per data item received should not add a lot of latency to each item Otherwise any such algorithm wont be able to keep up with the data stream In many cases accessing secondary storage such as disks is not even an option In  there is a discussion of what queries can be answered e xactly using bounded memory and queries that must be approximated unless disk access is allowed Sketching techniques\([14 ha v e been introduced to build summaries of data in order to estimate the number F 0 of distinct elements in a dataset In three algorithms that      approximate the F 0 are described with various space and time requirements Distinct is dri v e n by hashing functions similar to those studied in 14 and provides highly accurate results for distinct value queries compared to those taken by uniform sampling by using only a fraction of their sample size In the algorithms Stick y Sampling and Lossy Counting are introduced that estimate frequency counts with application to association rules and iceberg cubes In a framework for performing set expression on continuously updated streams based on sketching techniques is presented In a general framework over multiple granularities is presented for both range-temporal and spatio-temporal aggregations In a framework for identifying hierarchical heavy hitters i.e hierarchical objects like network addresses whose prexes denes a hierarchy with a frequency above a given threshold is described The effect of impications between columns has been emphasized in the system that identies correlated pairs of columns and soft-dependencies and has been proved very useful in query optimization 8 Conclusions We have presented a generalized and parameterized framework that can accurately and efciently estimate implication counts and can be applied to many scenarios To the best of our knowledge this is the rst practical and truly scalable approach to the problem Proceedings of the 21st International

Figure 3a and 3b, is negative since CBA and PART achieved a higher classification rate against this particular dataset A comparison of the knowledge representation produced by our method, PART and CBA has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the set of rules derived. Figure 4 represents the classifiers generated form the hyperheuristic datasets. Analysis of the rules sets indicated that MMAC derives a few more rules than PART and CBA for the majority of the datasets. In particular, the proposed method produced more rules than PART and CBA on 8 and 7 datasets, respectively. A possible reason for extracting more rules is based on the recursive learning phase that MMAC employs to discover more hidden information that most of the associative classification techniques discard, since they only extract the highest confidence rule for each frequent item that survives MinConf Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 6. Conclusions A new approach for multi-class, and multi-label classification has been proposed that has many distinguishing features over traditional and associative classification methods in that it \(1 that contain rules with multiple labels, \(2 evaluation measures for evaluating accuracy rate, \(3 employs a new method of discovering the rules that require only one scan over the training data, \(4 introduces a ranking technique which prunes redundant rules, and ensures only high effective ones are used for classification, and \(5 discovery and rules generation in one phase to conserve less storage and runtime. Performance studies on 19 datasets from Weka data collection and 9 hyperheuristic scheduling runs indicated that our proposed approach is effective, consistent and has a higher classification rate than the-state-of-the-art decision tree rule \(PART and RIPPER algorithms. In further work, we anticipate extending the method to treat continuous data and creating a hyperheuristic approach to learn  on the fly   which low-level heuristic method is the most effective References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00 © 2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
