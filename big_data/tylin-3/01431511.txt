Web-based educational systems collect vast amounts 
of data on userpatterns and data mining methods can be applied to these databases to discover interesting associations between student attributes problem attributes and solution strategies In this paper we propose a framework for the discovery of interesting association rules within a web-based educational system A hybrid measure of subjective and objective measure for rule interestingness is proposed which is called contrasting rules Contrasting association rule is one in which a conjunction of uttributes is compared for complementary subsections of a data set We provide a new algorithm for mining contrasting rules that can improve these systems for both teachers and 
students  allowing for greater learner improvement and more eflcctive evaluation of the learning process A larger advantage of developing this approach is its wide application in uny other datu mining application 1 Motivation The growth of the world wide web has a great impact on the education arena Recently developed online education systems allow researchers to study how students learn descriptive studies and which leaming strategies are most effective CausaUpredictive studies Michigan State University MSU has pioneered systems to provide an infrastructure for online instruction The research 
presented here was performed on a part of the latest online educational system developed at MSU the Learning Online Network with Computer-Assisted Personalized Approach LON-CAPA  1-33 LON-CAPA involves thee types of large data sets 1 educational resources such as web pages demonstrations simulations, and individualized problems designed for use on homework assignments, quizzes, and examinations 2 information about users who create modify assess or use these resources; and 3 activity log databases which log actions taken by students in solving homework and exam problems In other words we have three ever growing 
pools of data This paper investigates methods for extracting useful and interesting pattems from these large databases using online educational resources and their recorded paths within the system Our research is guided and inspired by the following questions Can we find any associative rules between the attributes of students problems within their courses and the methods they use to solve them? How do contrasting groups differ in a particular course Which attributes are associated with course success? For example is there a relationship between gender and course success How can we compare data from 
the same course between sections or over multiple semesters in addition to examining attributes across courses at a global scale Based on the current state of the student in their learning sequence as well as other student attributes the system could then make suggestions for improving student performance and course design As more and more students enter the online leaming environment databases concerning student access and performance will grow  yielding greater pattern clarity We develop such techniques in order to provide information that can be usefully applied by instructors 
to increase student learning 2 Background This section states a formal definition of association analysis and contrasting rules It also provides a descriptive model of different data attributes in order to supply a formal statement of the problem 2.1 Association rules The task of discovering association rules was initiated in 4 With its main use in business environments association rule mining is focused on market 223basket data\224 which stores items purchased on a per-transaction basis  similar to the 223shopping 
cart\224 from an online store A typical example of an association rule regarding market 223basket data\224 is that 68 of a book store\222s customers who purchase a book on HTML also purchase a book on XML Finding association rules is a valuable source for many applications in the business arena as well as medical diagnosis and remote sensing It is precisely the lack of association rule mining in the field of education that led to this study 0-7803-881 9-4/04/$20.00 Q2004 IEEE 5 04 


The time computational complexity is mainly determined by the first step which is the generation of frequent itemsets According to 4 the basic formal definition of the association rule is as follows Let 1  ill i2    im be the set of all items and T  t f2     fN the set of all transactions where m is the number of items and N is the number of transactions Each transaction t is a set of items such that 9 5 l Each transaction has a unique identifier is referred to as TID An association rule is an implication statement of the form X 3 Y where X c I Y c I and X and Yare disjoint that is X II Y  0 Xis called the antecedent while Y is called the consequence of the rule There are two basic measurements for each rule support and confidence. The rule X  Y has support s in the transaction set T if s of transactions in T containsx U y  The rule has confidence c if c of transactions in T that contain X also contains Y Support indicates how frequentIy the pattern OCCUTS, while confidence indicates the strength of the rule 5 In other words support measures the fraction of transactions that contain all items belonging to the setx U y  Confidence measures the fraction of times the itemset Y is present in transactions that contain X Formally these measurements are defined as follows support 1 and confidence s U y where N is the total number of c\(X s Y   transactions SI 2.2 Rule interestingness The techniques which mine association rules often generate too many rules while most of the rules are useless to the user manual inspection of the rules\222 interestingness is usually a time-consuming difficuIt task This problem sometimes is called post-mining rule analysis 161 In literature different measures are proposed to discover the interestingness of a rule Rule templates 7-81 is a technique that separates only those rules that match the template Actionabilily 19-10 is a subjective measure of the benefiuadvantage obtained by applying a rule Unexpectedness 6 111 is interpreted either in the probabilistic sense or in regards to the user\222s beliefs Neighborhood-bused interestingness  121 defines interestingness within a set of rules in terms of their density and relative confidences Though all of these methods are vaIid within certain regimes we suggest a new method of determining a rule\222s interestingness that will expand the current repertoire and be applicable in all data mining applications Bay and Pazzani 13 presented the definition of contrast sets as a conjunction of attributes and values that differ meaningfully in their distribution across groups They developed the STUCCO Search and Testing for Understandable Consistent Contrast algorithm to find Significant Contrast Sets They use a chi-square test for testing the null hypothesis that contrast-set support is equal across all groups The goal in this work is to find such surprisingly contrasting sets We extend the idea of contrasting sets to the discovery of contrasting rules introducing new measures for finding the significant differences between the groups of rules for contrasting elements 3 Problem Statement Let D be a data set of N transactions with d dimensional attributes The data model for contrasting rules is a generalization of the association data model for the grouped categorical attributes Let B be an attribute with k mutually exclusive elements Let A be an attribute or any conjunction of the attributes such that A n B  0 We define the contrasting rule as follows A3 B A B lA3 B where A is a possible conjunction of at most d-1 attributes B and are the elements of a of the target class and W,Ek and bfi  j  Bi n Bj  0 Suppose A are two rules and let S2 be a ranking measure for rules explained in 2.3 g are contrasting rules if and only if 1 Q\(A 3 B  A=,B 11 U where T is a user defined threshold which implies that there is high gap between both support and confidence of these two rules In the most basic case when k-2 the contrast rules would be A a B B and A A  B and A AS As an example consider gender as the attribute of B while A can be the conjunction of a student\222s grade point average GPA and success within a particular course passifail If an instructor is interested in the difference between males and females who pass his or her course and have a particular GPA then the above contrasting rule is of value 3.2 Criteria for Ranking the Rules D be the subset of I which includes Bi Nl=ID1l and D c D be the subset of transactions which includes Bj N*=\(Dzl nl is the number of transactions of D1 that includes A U B and n2 is the number of transactions of Dz that includes A U B as it shown in figure 1 Let D is a data set N transactions and let D 505 


3 Chi-Square value Rnl l Figure 1 An illustration of operationalized contrasting rulcs We propose some functions to measure the rules and rank them For example in the case that the contrasting group is gender; we divide the transactions into male and female subsets Methodological detail will be explained in the experimental study but first a discussion of rule ranking criteria is necessary 1 Difference ofproportions The difference shown in Eq I expresses the coverage of the rule between B and Bj since it is the difference in ratios of the 223affected\224 to the whole population for each 2 2 Log Odds Ratio Odds ratio shows how two proportions differ Let p=nlAV  q=n2/hr and 223odds ratio\224 l-p q/\(l-q When p and q are equal then their odds ratio is equal to 1 not significant when it is not equal to 1 it shows that the proportion of the one element of a contrasting group is greater than another The value range for this ratio is between zero and infinity with a value of one implying a balance between diagonals in the contingency table Unfortunately as though any two comparable odds ratio values will lie in ranges of differential size zero to one versus one to infinity The logs odds ratio Eq 2 is in the interval a ma when p and q are equal it will be equal to zero The advantage for these criteria is the improvement over the simple odds ratio  the scale of output is smoother Yet it is not without problems As a result of improving the output scale the speed of convergence for more significant rules is low 3 One of the most common tests for significance is shown in Eq 3  the chi-square test  where i is the number of rows andj is the number of columns in the contingency table We implemented all these measures in this paper and the results and the comparison will be discussed in experimental study section 4 Methodology Association analysis is not an easy task for many applications of data mining For example using an Apriori algorithm with very low support to find pattems is quite difficult From one side if we put the minimum support high enough, we lose many interesting but low support pattems On the other hand if we choose a very low minimum-support the Apriori algorithm will find too many rules and finding the interesting rules becomes a very hard task We propose a new method to discover hidden pattems even those with low support An automatic rule miner finds the common rules amongst the contrast elements We develop an algorithm, Mining Contrasting Rules MCR to discover the association rules for the contrast elements Here we describe the framework see Figure 3 in which this algorithm can work for the purpose of discovering association rules while mining for contrasting groups  Selecting data from course and students databases  Preprocessing cleansing data Attribute subset extractiodselection  Discretizing the continuous attributes Pruning the values of attribute with very high support  Select an interesting contrast group Applying the MCR algorithm given a contrasting attribute L Post-processing to idaitify the rule interestingness  Select another measure or contrast group and repeat the brocedure Figure 2 Framework to Mine Contrasting Rules Detail of this framework will be explained in the experimental study Now we explain the MCR algorithm as shown in Figure 4 As it is explained in the algorithm we divide data set 0 into M disjoint subsets In the case of that the contrasting group is gender we divide the transactions into male and female subsets We use the Apriori\222 algorithm in order to find the closed frequent itemset in We used the C Borgelt\222s implementation of Apriori version4.19 5 06

allelizing Dualminer 16 the authors sho wed that by mining relatively small sparse datasets consisting of 10K transactions and 100K items the sequential version of Dualminer took an excessive amount of time Unfortunately the original authors of Dualminer did not show any single experiment to depict the execution time of their algorithm but only the reduction in predicate executions A recent strate gy dealing with monotone and anti-monotone constraints suggests reducing the transactional database input via pre-processing by successively eliminating transactions that violate the constraints and then applying any frequent itemset mining algorithm on the reduced transaction set 4 The main drawback of this approach is that it is highly I/O bound due to the iterative process needed in rewriting the reduced dataset to disk This algorithm is also sensitive to the results of the initial monotone constraint checking which is applied to full transactions In other words if a whole transaction satisìes the monotone constraint then no pruning is applied and consequently no gains are achieved even if parts of this transaction do not satisfy the same monotone constraint To overcome some of the issues in the same approach has been tested against the FP-Growth approach in with ne w effective pruning heuristics 7 Conclusion Since the introduction of association rules a decade ago and the launch of the research in efìcient frequent itemset mining the development of effective approaches for mining large transactional databases has been the focus of many research studies Furthermore it is widely recognized that mining for frequent items or association rules regardless of its efìciency usually yields an overwhelming crushing number of patterns This is one of the reasons it is argued that the integration of data mining and database management technologies is required These large sets of discovered patterns could be queried Expressing constraints using a query language could indeed help sift through the large pattern set to identify the useful ones We argue that pushing the consideration of these constraints at the mining process before discovering the patterns is an efìcient and effective way to solve the problem This does not exclude the integration of data mining and database systems but suggests the need for data mining query languages intricately integrated with the data mining process In this paper we address the issue of early consideration of monotone and anti-monotone constraints in the case of frequent itemset mining We propose a leap traversal approach BifoldLeap  that traverses the search space by jumping from relevant node to relevant node and simultaneously checking for constraint violations The approach we propose uses existing data structures FP-tree and COFI-tree but introduces new pruning techniques to reduce the search costs We conducted a battery of experiments to evaluate our constraint-based search and report a fraction of them herein for lack of space The experiments show the advantages of pushing both monotone and anti-monotone constraints as early as possible in the mining process despite the overhead of constraint checking We also compared our algorithm to Dualminer a state-of-the-art algorithm in constraint-based frequent itemset mining and showed how our algorithm outperforms it and can nd all frequent itemsets the closed and the maximal patterns that satisfy constraints along with their exact supports References  R Agra w al T  Imielinski and A Sw ami Mining

on the intention to use self- and e-assessment center as well as the influence of PQI, PCS and PTS on PU it might represent a single example for a specific economy, country or cultural region . There might be differences for the intention of different informnation systems with different settings. Future research should discuss this issue more detailed  Furthermore our questionnaire was just answered by large-scale corporations in Germany. So our results might not be directly transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises  In addition, as we collected our data from participants at the same time using the same survey our results may be affected by common method varian  6. Conclusion  Self-assessment and e-assessment as online games in staff recruiting are a valuable solution for companies to support on the one side their employer branding activities and on the other side the selection of the favored candidate. The case study of our papers shows that companies can generate more qualified applications and concurrently save time and money. Based on these findings our empirical research with 191 of the Top-1000 companies of Germany provide statistical evidence that perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings are the main reasons beside perceived usefulness and ease of use why companies intend to use self- and e-assessment in their recruiting processes  References   Bago zzi  R  P   T h e Ro l e  of M easu r e m en t i n T h eo ry Construction and Hypothesis Testing: Toward a Holistic Model", in: Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, O.C.

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
