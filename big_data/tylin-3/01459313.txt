2004 3d International Conference on Computational Electromagnetice and Its Applications Proceedings  Association Rules Data Mining in Manufacturing Information System based on Genetic Algorithms Cunrong li Mingzhong Y ang Mechatronics School Wuhaii UniversiQ of Technology Wuhan Hubei Province China e-mai1:Cunrong-li@l63.com Abstract In the process of the traditional association rule algorithm because of the large frequent item set the algorithm usually has very low efficiency In this paper, the genetic algorithm is put into 
use to mining the association rules orienting to the data set in the Manufwturing Information System MIS A corresponding algorithm is also realized According to the test result a conclusion is drawn that the Genetic Algorithm has considerable higher efficiency Keywords Knowledge Discovery Genetic Algorithm Association Rule I Introduction The important meaning of Data Mining M and Knowledge Discovery in Database KDD are widely realized by more and more people The nowadays methods have synthesized the outcome of the Database Expert System Schema recoption Machine Learning and Statistics Although ten years 
have passed after the time that KDD is put forward the extensive and intensive application is in the developing stage There are several DM software developed as prototype otherv+*ise the efficiency and practice of the system cannot meet the detailed needs At present Association Rule especially of Apriori Algorithm is comparatively reaching its maturity but the low efficiency of this algorithm is a obstacle of its extensive application Genetic Algorithm GA has been partly used in the area of schema identification; otherwise the research and usage in the area of MIS 
are at the beginning stage By comparing with some property in the MIS data set analyzing the data structure in the database, the application of Genetic Algorithm in MIS is proved to be a more efficient method The purpose of this paper is to put the GA into use in the area of association rule mining and to improve the efficiency of DM 2 Application Analysis of Genetic Algorithm There are three main operators in GA selection crossover and mutation In order to put the GA into use some analysis 
should be done First, it should be tell apart about the individual the population of individuals and genes in the MIS database The following step is to implement the Genetic Algorithm and get the promising results In the process of data mining hthe MIS database some of the history records could be looked as a population of indwiduals a record as a corresponding individual and the fields representing the property of the table could be looked as the genes the correspondence of the items and a 
table is shown in figure 1 2 I Contrast with Traditional Search Algorithm item set is increased the quantity of 2-item set will increase radically So this factor brings down the efficiency of the algorithm On the other hand GA is randomized parallel search algorithm that models natural selection, the process of evolution. Overtime natural selection has produced a wide range of functions The success of natural selection on earth provides an existence proof of the viability of an evolutionary process as a model 
for data mining Like natural selection GA is a robust search method with high efficiency. With each generation part of the original history record set is a subset with a number of records Accordingly the computation takes little time As a result the gene list reveals the association of the property Traditional search algorithm like Aprori when its 1  2.2 Evaluating Evaluating a rule measures performance relative to predetermined criteria If the criteria are well defined a scalar or vector value can be assigned to candidate 
rule and compared with others In this paper the evaluating criteria is relatively simple to count the number of the record with the detailed properties the percent of the counted number to the whole number of the history records is the compatibility If the value of the calculated compatibility is more than the minimal compatibility that predetermined by user then this rule turned out to be a valuable. After completing the iteration of generation a result set representing the association rules will come out 0-7803-8562-4/04&20.00 02004 I EEE 153 


     Figure 1 To illustrate the correspondence of the item and a table 3 Computation p4cess of Genetic Algorithm in MIS 3 I Basic Genetic Algorithm is divided into six steps In this article the application of GA in MIS database A Encode 3 Select the initial population of individuals from which computed the excellent gene list set Al selectkg the second population of individuals from which computed the excellent gene list set B1 C Save the excellent gene list set above to result set R D Operate the mutation of AI and B1 cross the gene of AI and B1 and generate a new set A2 then select the third population of individuals from which computed the excellent gene list set B2 E Repeat the steps from b to c until there is no new excellent gene Iist F Decode the result set R and generate the knowledge of association rules 3.2 System Encoding The principles of encodmg are the code is unique in the encoding set if there are same values in two fields the code of two value should encode respectively If there are several same values in a field all the same values should belong to a unique code The following is to analyze all of situations and how to encoding The purpose of encoding is to simplify the operation A The separated value should be encoded respectively as shown in figure I the field Cid can be encoded as the following null+O VINET31 TOMSP+2 HAN4R+3 VICTE34 CHOPS35  B The separated value of number should be encoded all over again the original value cannot be the code as to the fieLd Eid shown in figure 1 is encoded as following null+lO 5+11 6312 4+13 7+14 5 1 1    the same values should have a correspondent same code in the field Eid there are two same value 3 and the code is 1 I here C The continuous values should be separated into several segments and then encode the segments into system codes The filedfreight nu113 SO 10 10-20 2&30 30-40 ___ value null should be appended and encode it respectively, as is shown above E The form of a example gene list might be 2231 12   80  224 the gene list consists of genes above D With every filed should be encoded an additional 3.3 Operator of selection crossaver and mutation CA is randomized parallel search algorithm that models natural selection This method can ensure its homogeneous selection User can decide the number of the population of individuals. When original population of individual is drawn out and encoded the application wilI do selection The further evaiuating process can decide which are excellent gene lists The criteria of decision are the compatibilities mentioned abave The compatibilities of the individuals can be computed in this application To generate Structural Query Language \(SQL\sentences are main operation in this process The relations of operations are shown in figure 2 Different users can config the system parameters by themselves. Ordinarily the crossover rate is set between 0,001 and 0.1 andmutation rate between 0.001 and 0.005 The generations of crossover are decided by the stability of the result set R The much number of genes increased the more time of computations takes and the gznerations of crossover and mutation will increase correspondingly 154

4.1 Comparison of time used between GA-based and Apn'on Algorithm The result of experiment in figure 3 shows that the GA-based Association Rule is more efficient than Apriori Algorithm The time used with the Apriori Algorithm increases sharply with the increase of data amount otherwise the other method takes less time In this experiment the original support and the original compntibilify are both set to 5 The results vary with the specific databases 70 60 5 50 40 30 20 10 2 2 h U I n c N A r---w J I I I I I I I I 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Data M byte  Genetic Algorithm Apnori Algorithm Figure 3 Comparison of time used between two algorithms 4.2 Experiment for fetching knowledge increases homogeneously when time lasts and you can exhaust the rules in a predetermined conditions The amount of howledge changing with the time is shown in figure 4 with the time lasts the amount of knowledge will tend to stable With Apriori Algorithm the amount of knowledge i 2 E 9 E7 E 0 s 6 Figure 4 amount of knowledge increase aIong with the time 5 Conclusion The main problem of Association Rules is its low efficiency with large item sets To optimize the method with Genetic Algorithm although the precision decreased a little the efficiency increased a lot When used in Manufacturing Information System it can be applied in many aspects Acknowledgements This research is sponsored by the WYSPP\(Wuhan Youth Science Plan Program Hubei China Grant No 20035O020 1605 References l]Tany Bain Professional SQL Server 2000 Data Warehousing with Analysis Services Wrox Press 2001,p421-423 2 Agrawal R Imieliski T Swami A Mining association rules between sets of items in large database Roc of ACM SIGMOD Intl Conf on Management of Data pp207-2 16 1993 3 Shi Zongzhi Knowledge Seeking Tsinghua University press. pp57-60 Jan 2002 3 Zhang Bopeng Manufacturing Informatics Tsinghua University Press P64-80 5]Tom M Utchell Machine Learning China Machine Press p3X-56 6 Chen Singmiset al Data Warehouse and Data Mining Techniques Publishing House of Electronics Industry 2002.8 p33U-340 156 


Proceedings of the Third International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybemetics, Shanghai 26-29 August 2004 1675 directly to intrusion detection SQL injection can inject or change the SQL statements to some forged statements We use the sample Active Server Pages ASP 221login\222 page of 224I which accesses a SQL Server database and attempts to authenticate access to some fictional application The authentication SQL statement is Var sql=\223select  from users where usemame=\222 224  223 221 224 usemame  223 222 and password  221 224 password If the user specifies the following Usemame 222  drop table users  Password The SQL statement 223select  from users where usemame=\222 222  drop table users  224 will be executed In Transact-SQL, the 221 222 character sequence is the 221single lime comment\222 sequence and the 221:\222 character denotes the end of one query The 221 222 at the end of the username field is required in order for the query to terminated without error After the statement is executed, the users table will be deleted and all the users can\222t login in the database The attacker could log on as any user if using the following input Usemame admin\222   The statement \223select  from users where usemame 222 admin\222  224 will be executed The attacker could log in as the fust user in the 221users\222 table with the following input Usemame 222 or 1=1  The statement \223select  from users where usemame or 1=1  224will be executed The reason why the SQL injection can succeed is that the application believes that the 221constant\222 row that the attacker specified was part of the recordset retrieved from the database SQL injection can be solved partially by the methods such as input validation length limit string replacement and etc But there are many limitations in all the methods ll The mining algorithm of the paper can be applied to prevent SQL injection effectively and remedy the limitations of other methods. To the login statement the algorithm can get the following fingerprint 223select  from users where usemame\222 224\222 I 222 and password=\222 224\222  222  To the injected SQL statements aforementioned, there aren\222t any fingerprints that the statements can match the query support and confidence of the statements is near zero 221and can raise serious alarms The algorithm can also prevent other intrusions such as by obtaining information using error messages and express application semantics due to the using of regular expressions to represent the attribute area in fingerprint For example, if we need that the length of password can\222t be smaller than 5 and the password must I be number or character a fingerprint as following can be gotten 223select  from users where usemame=\222 223\222 I 222 and password 222 a-zA-ZO-9]{5  222  4 Conclusions In this paper we change the computing methods of support and confidence in association rules by using the concept of fingerprint and present an algorithm to find the user query frequent itemsets The algorithm solves the problem that there is no causal relationship in the access of attributes in queries so that it is difficult to use association rule by adding the key and foreign key relations of attributes and the fingerprints that represent the fixed structure of the queries to the computation of support and confidence of the query frequent itemsets.

It should be noted that after the above process the resulting support constraint set may become inconsistent Thus in the next round the value c   m i 1 z i may be larger If that happens the larger value c does not interpret as the privacy condence level Instead it should be interpreted as an indicator for inconsistency of the support constraint set Thus the above privacy deletion procedure should only be carried out one time We should note that even if the condence level is higher that is c   m i 1 z i is small there is still possibility that the condential information specied by  I,s,S  is leaked in theory That is for each transaction database D that satises the constraints S wehave support  I D    s S   However no one may be able to recover this information since it is NP hard to infer this fact Support constraint inference has been extensively studied by Calders in 2 3 It would be interesting to consider conditional privacypreserving synthetic transaction database generations That is we say that no private information is leaked unless some hardness problems are solved efciently This is similar to the methodologies that are used in public key cryptography For example we believe that RSA encryption scheme is secure unless one can factorize large integers In our case we may assume that it is hard on average to efciently solve integer linear programs Based on this assumption we can say that unless integer linear programs could be solved efciently on average no privacy specied in P is leaked by S if the computed condence level c   m i 1 z i is small 5 Conclusions In this paper we discussed the general problems regarding privacy preserving synthetic transaction database generation for benchmark testing purpose In particular we showed that this problem is generally NP hard Approximation algorithms for both synthetic transaction database generation and privacy leakage condence level approximation have been proposed These approximation algorithms include solving a continuous variable linear program According to 6 l i n ear probl ems ha vi ng hundreds of t housands of continuous variables are regularly solved Thus if the support constraint set size is in the order of hundreds of thousands then these approximation algorithms are efcient on regular Pentium-based computers If more constraints are necessary then more powerful computers are needed to generate synthetic transaction databases References 1 R  A g r a w al T  Imilien sk i an d A  S w a mi Min in g association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proc of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Database  pages 207216 1993  T  C a lders  Axiomatization and Deduction Rules for the Frequency of Itemsets  PhD Thesis Universiteit Antwerpen 2003  T  C a l ders  C omput at i onal compl e x i t y of i t e ms et frequency satisability In Proc 23rd ACM PODS 04  pages 143154 ACM Press 2004  R  F agi n J  Hal pern and N Me gi ddo A l ogi c f or reasoning about probabilities Information and Computation  87 1,2\78128 1990  G Geor gak opoul os  D  K a v v a di as  a nd C  P a padi mitriou Probabilistic satisability J of Complexity  4 111 1988  Li near P r ogrammi ng F r equent l y As k e d Q ues t i ons  http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/otc Guide/faq/linear-programming-faq html  T  M ielik  ainen On inverse frequent set mining In Proc of 2nd Workshop on Privacy Preserving Data Mining PPDM  pages 1823 IEEE Computer Society 2003  C  P o t t s  A nal ys i s of a l i n ear programmi ng heuri s t i c for scheduling unrelated parallel machines Discrete Appl Math 10 155164 1985 9 G  R amesh  W  Man iatty  a n d M Zak i Feasib le itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proc 22nd ACM PODS  pages 284295 2003  Y  W a ng X W u  a nd Y  Zheng P r i v ac y p res ervi ng data generation for database application performance testing In Proc 1st Int Conf on Trust and Privacy in Digital Business TrustBus 04 together with DEXA  LNCS 3184 pages 142-151 2004 Springer-Verlag  X W u  Y  W u Y  W a ng and Y  Li P ri v a c y a w are mar ket basket data set generation a feasible approach for inverse frequent set mining In Proc 5th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining  April 2005  Z Zheng R  K oha vi  a nd L Mas on R eal w o rl d performance of association rule algorithms In Proc of the ACM-SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  pages 401 406 ACM Press 2001 8 Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

Experimental Results The aim of our experimentation is to measure performance bene?ts given by our framework, and to quantify the information gained w.r.t. the other lossy approaches 


approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
