Information system also called information table as a knowledge representation contains data about objects of in terest characterized by some attributes or features Generally information system could be used to recognize an object through its features or attributes Objects could be anything human plant animal event condition etc In many appli cations information system can be extended to represent and generate association rules performing a decision table Simply an information system may be represented using a two-dimensional table in which generally rows and columns represent objects and attributes, respectively as shown in Table I The simplest form of information system called binary in formation sy 
see Table II is provided by assigned 0,l for all domain attributes Hence every object is regarded as a crisp set of attributes Binary information system may then be generalized to fuzzy infomation sysrem see Table 111 by allowing every domain attribute to take a value in the unit in terval 0 11 Clearly, every object can be represented as a fuzzy set on the set of attributes. Moreover we may generalize fuzzy information system by considering every domain attribute consisting of fuzzy data as given in Table W In this case every 
cell in Table I aj\(ui as a corresponding between object and attribute consists of a fuzzy data Hence every object can be regarded as a set of fuzzy sets corresponding to domain attributes Furthermore we may provide a more generalized fuzzy information system dealing with a possibility of fuzzy data as shown in Table V Here every cell in Table I might be regarded as a level 2 fuzzy set Generally the concepts of similarity relation between WO objects are proposed by calculating only similar values of their attributes without any consideration to the number of their values of attributes compared with other values in the universal set of objects 
However, based on hummi6 perception two ob jects with a given similar value of attribute may have different degree of similarity in two different discourse universal sets of objects Two objects are intuitivcly looked more similar if their similar vaIues of corresponding attributes are rarer For exam ple, in the universal set of all-American people, Ronald Reagen and Jimmy Carter have high degree of similarity to each other not because they are male but they are ex-presidents of USA Their degree of similarity will reduce when the discourse universal set of objects is all-American presidents Therefore in 6 we proposed and discussed 
a concept and its mathematical properties of similarity relation between two objects in a binary information system based on rarity of attribute value This paper extends the concept to predictably calculate similarity degree relationship between two objects in a more generalized representation of fuzzy information system. First we assume that similarity relation between two fuzzy data satisfies properties of a weak similarity relation in which similarity relation between two fuzzy data may not necessarily be symmetric or transitive Two asymmetric fuzzy classes of an object could be provided dealing with the weak similarity relation applied on a domain attribute Next two measures, namely usualness and rareness 
measures on a given object are defined using two different functions Finally our primary concern in this paper is to introduce and define an extended concept of simiiarity relation between two objects in the generalized representation of fuzzy information system based on weak similarity relation and rareness measure The structure of the paper is the following In Section I1 and 111 basic concepts of information systems and similarity relations are recalled and discussed Section IV as a main contribution of this paper is devoted to propose a similarity relation between two objects. Finally a conclusion is given in Section V SI and 0-7803-8643404/$20.00 0 2004 IEEE 462

Conclusion  In this paper, we presented the XQuery expression of the FP-growth method from XML data We use the FP-growth algorithm to generate the large itemset document, and then select all association rules from the large item set where support is greater than or equal to the minimum support. We have proposed frequent pattern tree \(FP-tree growth method, FP-growth. There are several advantages of FP-growth over other approaches. It constructs a highly compact FP-tree, which is usually substantially smaller than the original database, and thus saves the costly database scans in the subsequent mining processes. It applies a pattern growth method which avoids costly candidate generation and test by successively concatenating frequent 1-itemset found in the \(conditional divide-and-conquer method which dramatically reduces the size of the subsequent conditional pattern bases and conditional FP-trees. To our knowledge, the FP-growth method has been implemented using the query language XQuery, without pre-processing or post-processing of the data. Many issues remain open, one of the issues concerns the structure of the XML data. Since the structure of the XML data can be  very complex and irregular, identifying the mining context on such XML data becomes difficult. Our current and future research in this area focuses on investigating what other standard data mining algorithms can be expressed in XQuery  References  1] PMML 2.1 Predictive Model Markup Language http://www.dmg.org, March 2003 2] World Wide Web Consortium.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
