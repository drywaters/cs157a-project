2005 International Conference on Wireless Networks Communications and Mobile Computing Mining Temporal and Spatial Object Relations in Multimedia Contents Vincent S Tseng Pao-Ching Tseng Kawuu W.C Lin Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering National Cheng Kung University Tainan Taiwan R.O.C vincent paoching linwc}@idb.csie.ncku.edu.tw Abstract A number of studies on multimedia data mining have been done in recent 
years However the existing work on mining spatial patterns in multimedia databases is very restricted although it is an emerging research topic The existing data mining methods for multimedia contents can only find simple spatial relationships among objects and do not consider the temporal changes of the spatial patterns In this paper we propose an effective method that is concerned with the 
discovery of spatial patterns among objects from multimedia contents that were sequentially captured from a remote wireless camera The proposed method can efficiently discover complex spatial relationships among objects like the northeast southeast northwest and southwest Besides we further explore the temporal concept for spatial patterns in multimedia databases An effective method is also proposed for finding the temporal changes 
of spatial patterns Through empirical evaluation the proposed method is shown to deliver excellent performance under different system conditions 1.Introduction In recent years a number of studies have been done on the techniques of database mining One of the extensively studied topics is the association rule mining 1][2 that discovers the association rules from supermarket database In 3 the authors also explored 
the sequential patterns of the customers The association rule mining has been applied to various fields With the rapid growth of multimedia contents more and more researches were made on this problem encountered in the filed of multimedia analysis Since the multimedia extracting techniques are becoming mature 4][7][8 it is possible to apply data mining technologies to discovering interesting knowledge 
from the multimedia contents It is observed that mining the multimedia content is an emerging topic attracting numerous of attention However the existing work on mining spatial patterns in multimedia databases Figure 1 An example scenario of remote multimedia content acquisition is very restricted Several studies on multimedia mining are proposed in 5][6][7][10][11][12][13 The existing mining methods can only 
find very simple spatial relationships among objects and do not consider the temporal changes of the spatial patterns Some of the related studies focused on mining the spatial relations among objects 9][10 The authors considered each image as a transaction and the extracted objects as items They first found the association relation among objects and then they discussed the following 
four spatial relations 1 H-next-to H-next-to Of 02 means that object O1 is horizontal to object 02 2 V-next-to V-next-to 0s 02 means that object 0 is vertical to object 023 Overlap Overlap O1 02 means that object 01 overlaps object 02 4 Include Include 01 02 means that object 01 includes object 020-7803-9305-8/05/$20.00 2512005 IEEE 1371 


we define several time periods for the data i.e the images we integrate the time issue into this concept The transactions are embedded with the captured time and will be grouped by the pre-defined time period We here address the two issues that need to be explored I For each time period we find that there is the time period transformed from its captured time Take a habitat monitoring an image The location of object 01 is 75 45 written Therefore the authors can discover the association relations among object 01 and 2 H-next-to\(O0 02 V-next-to\(O0 02 Overlap\(O0 02 and Include\(O0 02 In this paper we explore is severe The images or videos that case for example if the capturing rate of II For the objects of images of two consequent time periods the relations might change or disappear and  O 2  r L__ te f i_ 0  are sequentially captured from this remote can discover the spatial patterns from the database of each time period As mentioned lots of methods more spatial relations among objects Our proposed method an item In this paper are some spatial relations among the objects Figure 2 An example of relations among objects 0 f}?*.-ss 2  s 2 I i~~~~~~Tii Figure 3 An example of pattern changes as shown in Figure 1 Suppose that we place the digital camera which is attached with a wireless transmission device in the field where it would be dangerous can efficiently discover complex spatial relationships among objects like the northeast southeast northwest and southwest Besides can be used to extract the objects from images to form more detailed spatial relations Consider the scenario or the weather assume that each object locates in a Cartesian coordinate system and is with a x y value By using this system we will discover we further explore the temporal concept for spatial patterns in multimedia databases An effective method is also proposed for finding the temporal changes of spatial patterns Through empirical evaluation the proposed method is shown to deliver excellent performance under different system conditions The rest of this paper is structured as follows In Section 2 a remote wireless camera or videos we will obtain as mi ti where mi oj oj E 0 and ti as  01 75 45 Four spatial relations as 01  75 45 in the database this object is stored with its object identification are defined in this paper I North-West NW As shown in Figure 2 01 is NW to 02 II North-East NE As shown in Figure 2 02 is NE to 03 III South-East SE As shown in Figure 2,02 is SE to 01 1372 0 t a database composed of the images with extracted objects In 8][9 the authors use Apriori algorithm 2 to discover the association rules among objects by considering each image as a transaction and each object that belongs to this image as were sequentially captured from a new database namely D 0 is among objects in camera can be sent back via the wireless transmission device and be stored in the multimedia database for discovery of spatial patterns and temporal pattern changes We we give the problem formulation In Section 3 we describe the proposed method and the underlying data structures The empirical evaluation for performance study is made in Section 4 The conclusions and future directions are given in Section 5 2 Problem Statement Given a set of images or videos that are grouped by the pre-defined time period There are a lot of studies 4][7][8 that discuss the issue of extracting objects from images and hence we will discover the temporal pattern changes Hence we proposed two methods named SP-Miner and CP-Miner to discover the spatial and temporal relations from the multimedia database SP-Miner is a data mining method that a set containing all of the objects in D written as 0 camera is 24 images per day i.e 1 image per hour we will obtain 672 24*28 images after 4 weeks Furthermore we define the time period as one week and the images will be divided into four groups according to their captured time The location of each object is represented by Cartesian coordinate system Figure 2 is an example of relations  01 02 Om Each image is represented

Figure 9 Execution time with average number of objects per image varied Figure 10 Execution time with number of objects varied This experiment analyzed the impact when varying the number of objects in database The following lists the major conditions 1 Database size ID1=40000 100000 200000 and 300000 2 Number of objects 101=400 1000 and 1500 3 Average number of objects per image AvgObj=4 8 and 12 4 Support threshold Smin=0.2 5 Number of time periods JTJ=4 From Figure 10 we observe that the larger number of objects will require more the execution time The main reason is that more objects will generate more 1-candidate and 2-candidate patterns and hence both of SP-Miner and CP-Miner need more time to calculate the support of patterns 5 Conclusions In this paper we propose a data mining method that can discover the spatial and temporal object relation pattern in multimedia contents We first adopt the existing segmentation methods to extract the objects from multimedia databases and the location of objects Then the proposed method is applied to discover the spatial patterns and pattern changes The proposed method can be used to analyze interesting object relations in multimedia contents like videos obtained from wirelsee sensor devices Through empirical evaluation the proposed method is shown to deliver excellent performance under different system conditions For the future work we will extend SP-Miner and CP-Miner to deal with more relations like include and cover relations These two relations involve the physical area of objects and advanced extracting techniques Furthermore we will work on the integration with video files and MPEG-4 contents in the wireless environments ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research was supported by Ministry of Economic Affairs R.O.C under grant no 92-EC-17-A-02-5 1-024 6 References I in Large Databases Proceedings of ACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data pages 207-216 Washington D.C May 1993 2 R Agrawal and R.Srikant Fast Algorithm for Mining Association Rules Proceedings of the Very Large Data Base VLDB-94 pp 487-499 Santiago Chile 1994 3 R Agrawal and R Srikant Mining Sequential Patterns In Proc of the I th Int'l Conference on Data Engineering pages 3-14 Taipai Taiwan March 1995 4 Z.-N Li 0 R Za?ane and Z Tauber Illumination lnvariance and Object Model in Content-Based Image and Video Retrieval Joumal of Visual Communication and Image Representation Academic Press vol 10 R Agrawal T Imielinkski and A Swami Mining Association Rules between Sets of Items n 3 pages 219-244 September 1999 5 C Ordonez and E Omiecinski Image mining A new approach for data mining Technical Report GITCC-98-12 Georgia Institute of Technology College of Computing 1998 6 C Ordonez and E Omiecinski Discovering Association Rules based on Image Content Proceedings of the IEEE Advances in Digital Libraries Conference pages 38-49 Baltimore Maryland May 1999 7 R 0 Stehling M A Nascimento and A X Falc?o On shapes of colors for content-based image retrieval Proceedings of the ACM Multimedia 2000 Workshops pp 171-174 November 2000 8 W Wang Y Song and A Zhang Semantics-Based Image Retrieval by Region Saliency Image and Video Retrieval International Conference CIVR 2002 M.S Lew N Sebe J.P Eakins pp 29-37 July 2002 9 0 R Za?ane J Han Z.-N Li J Y Chiang and S Chee MultiMediaMiner A system prototype for multimedia datamining In Proc Int'l Conf on Management of Data ACM-SIGMOD'98 pages 581-583 Seattle June 1998 10 R Za?ane J Han Z.-N Li and J Hou Mining multimedia data In proc CASCON'98 Meeting of Minds pp 83-96 Toronto Canada November 1998 11 R Za?ane J Han and H Zhu Discovering Spatial Associations in Images Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Theory Tools and Technology 11 SPIE 14th Int'l Symposium on Aerospace/Defense Sensing Simulation and Controls pp 138-147 Orlando FL April 2000 12 0 R Za?ane Discovering Patterns With and Within Images Chapter 2 in Multimedia MiningA Highway to Intelligent Multimedia Documents edited by Chabane Djeraba published by Kluwer Accademic Publishers pages 27-42 2002 13 M J Zaki S Parthasarathy W Lin and M Ogihara Evaluation of sampling for data mining of association rules Technical Report 617 University of Rochester Rochester NY 1996 1376

 1   1   l  1 i 2  i  Hence the true frequency count of any item occurring on some input stream must be C  l  1 j  x 1  tc  j    j    where  is a small quantity 3  The number of items present in each input stream is thus n  C 4  Since synopses for d l  1  x input streams are transmitted through a node at level x  the load on the most heavily loaded link\(s is L  x  d l  2  x  n C  Clearly the maximum value of L  x  is achieved when   0  The expression for L  x  can be simplied to L  x  1  l  1 j  x 1  j  d x  j 1  Now our expression for the worst-case load on any link can be reduced to W  T    max x 0  1 l  2  L  x   We desire to minimize W  T   subject to the constraints  2   l  1  0 and  l  1 j 2  j   1 It is easy to show that this minimum is achieved when L 0  L 1    L  l  2  Solving for  2   l  1  we obtain  i   1  d  1  l  2   d  1 d  2  i  l  2 and  l  1   1  d  l  2   d  1 d  Translating to error tolerances we set  i   1   l  1  i    d  1 d  l  2   d  1 d for all 2  i  l  1  This setting of  2  l  1 minimizes worst-case communication load on any link We term this strategy MinMaxLoad WC Under this strategy the maximum possible load on any link is L wc   l  2   d  1 d d   1 counts per epoch Lastly we note that MinMaxLoad WC remains the optimal precision gradient even if nodes of the same level can have different  values Informally since with worst-case inputs all incoming streams have identical characteristics maximum link load cannot be improved by using non-uniform  values for nodes at a given level we omit a formal proof for brevity 2.1.4 Good Precision Gradients for Non-Worst-Case Inputs Real data is unlikely to exhibit worst-case characteristics Consequently strategies that are optimal in the worst case may not always perform well in practice In terms of minimizing the maximum communication load on any link the worst-case inputs are ones in which the set of items occurring on each input stream are disjoint When this situation arises a gradual precision gradient is best to use as shown in Section 2.1.3 Using a gradual precision gradient some of the pruning of frequency 3 Recall that we allow the frequency of an item to be a real number 4 More precisely each stream contains  n C  items of weight 1 each and one item of weight  n C  n C   Note that each input stream contains at most one item with weight less than 1 as stipulated earlier counts is delayed until a better estimate of the overall distribution is available closer to the root thereby enabling more effective pruning In the opposite extreme when all input streams contain identical distributions of item occurrences there is no benet to delaying pruning and performing maximal pruning at the leaf nodes as in strategy SS2 is most effective at minimizing communication In fact it is easy to show that SS2 is the optimal strategy for minimizing the maximum load on any link when all input streams are comprised of identical distributions we omit a formal proof Note however that SS2 still incurs a high space requirement on the root node R since it sets  1    We posit that most real-world data falls somewhere between these two extremes To determine where exactly a data set lies with regard to the two extremes we estimate the commonality between input streams S 1 S m by inspecting an epoch worth of data from each stream We compute a commonality parameter   0  1 as   1 m   m i 1 G i L i  where G i and L i are dened over stream S i as follows The quantity G i is dened as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i and also at least   S  times in S  S 1  S 2  S m  where  S  denotes the number of item occurrences in S during the epoch of measurement The quantity L i is dened as the number of distinct items occurring in S i that occur at least   S i  times in S i  Hence commonality parameter  measures the fraction of items frequent enough in one input stream to be included in a leaf-level synopsis by strategy SS 2 that are also at least as frequent globally in the union of all input streams A natural hybrid strategy is to use a linear combination of MinMaxLoad WC and SS2 weighted by   The strategy is as follows set

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

per by Ganti et. al. [9] deals with the measurement of similarity \(or deviation, in the authors  vocabulary between decision trees, frequent itemsets and clusters Although this is already a powerful approach, it is not generic enough for our purpose. The most relevant research e?ort in the literature, concerning pattern management is found in the ?eld of inductive databases Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE meant as databases that, in addition to data, also contain patterns [10], [7]. Our approach di?ers from the inductive database one mainly in two ways. Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
