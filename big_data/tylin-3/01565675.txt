sets distribution i.e statistics from frequent itemsets and maximal frequent itemsets are usually given Nevertheless algorithms could have quite different behaviors for apparently similar datasets Benchmarks comparing algorithms performances have been done on real and synthetic datasets 5 see FIMI website 18 Algorithm implementations and datasets are freely available from for mining frequent frequent closed or frequent maximal itemsets Even with all these informations being able to explain why certain algorithms are likely to perform very well or very poorly on some datasets is still an open question 
More generally studying datasets can provide useful hints for devising adaptive algorithms 17 i.e algorithms which adapt themselves to data characteristics in order to increase their time or memory efciency Adaptive behavior of algorithms is not new in the setting of frequent itemsets mining for example 7 use heuristics to decide when tries-like data structure representing datasets and/or itemset collections have to be rebuilt The promising results obtained by these algorithms show the interest of applying specic strategies according to dataset features Another key point is that some problems have specic in 
variant characteristics whatever the studied datasets Their impact on algorithms could give useful information about the difculty to solve these problems while giving hints on the more appropriate strategies to cope with these difculties Related works Classical characteristics of datasets were studied in and more particularly a density criteria Up to our knowledge no formal denition of density does exist According to a dataset is dense when it produces many long frequent itemsets even for high values of minimum support threshold The authors studied seven datasets 
each of them capturing a fairly large range of typical uses The result of these experimentations is a classication of datasets in four categories according to the density The density is estimated by using the characteristics of maximal frequent itemsets The main problem of their classication concerns its variability with respect to minimum support threshold valProceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE 


ues For example a dataset could belong to the rst category for a given threshold value and to the second category for another threshold value 1  Moreover there is no clear relationship between the proposed classication and algorithms performances Even worse a surprising result was obtained in the last FIMI workshop algorithms seem to be more efcient on some very dense datasets than on some other sparser datasets Note also that in in order to easily compare different implementations a tool has been developped from information available at the FIMI website Based on the works done in 32 proposed a s tatistical property of transactional datasets to characterize dataset density Actually they consider the dataset as a transaction source and measure an entropy signal i.e the transactions produced by such a source Moreover they show how such a characterization can be used in many elds from performance prediction minimum support threshold range determination sampling to strategy decisions As for the previous work it does not explain algorithms performances anymore This may be due to the fact that only frequent itemsets are used to calculate the entropy measure In the positi v e border distrib ution i.e the number of maximal elements in each level is considered as a key parameter to characterize transaction databases It is proved that any distribution is feasible and thus susceptible to be met in practice Moreover a constructive theorem is proposed to compute a synthetic transaction database given a positive border distribution as input Nevertheless the negative border is never considered and as a result such synthetic databases do not match the complexity of realworld datasets Contribution In this setting we describe a thorough experimental study of datasets with respect to frequent itemsets We study the distribution of frequent itemsets with respect to itemsets size together with the distribution of three concise representations frequent closed frequent free and frequent essential itemsets For each of them we also study the distribution of their positive and negative borders whenever possible From this analysis we exhibit a new classication of datasets and some invariants allowing to better predict the behavior of well known algorithms The main perspective of this work is to devise adaptive algorithms with respect to dataset/problem characteristics Paper organization In section 2 we introduce some preliminaries Experimental study of datasets is given in section 3 including usual representations of frequent itemsets experimental protocol results and analysis The section 4 1 As a concrete example this case arises with Pumsb  dataset with minimum support threshold values equal to 15 and 25 respectively Other examples are given in presents the main results of this work a new dataset classication and a study of the inuence of anti-monotone predicate on the resolution of some problems Finally we conclude and give some perspectives for this work 2 Preliminaries Let R be a set of symbols called items  and r a database of subsets of R  The elements of r are called transactions An itemset X is a set of some items of R  The support of X is the number of transactions in r that contain all items of X  An itemset is frequent if its support in r exceeds a minimum support threshold value called minsup Givena minimal support threshold and a database the goal is to nd all frequent itemsets We recall the notion of borders of a set using notations given in  Let  I   be a partially ordered set of elements A set S  I is closed downwards if for all X  S  all subsets of X arealsoin S  S can be represented by its positive border B d   S  or its negative border B d   S  dened by B d   S  max   X  S  B d   S  min   Y  I  S  Let p be an anti-monotone predicate on  I    i.e  X Y  I,X  Y if p  Y  is true then p  X  is true If S is the set of elements of I satisfying p  then S is closed downwards For instance a set of frequent itemsets FI in a database with respect to a given minimum support threshold value is closed downwards In this case B d   FI  is often called the set of maximal frequent itemsets  3 Thorough experimental study of datasets In order to introduce our experimental study we rst describe three classical representations of frequent itemsets Then our experimental protocol is explained and our experimental results are given and discussed To end up a relationship between these results and algorithms performances is also pointed out 3.1 Usual representation of frequent itemsets Several concise or condensed representations of frequent itemsets have been studied 12 Their goal is twofold improving efciency of frequent itemsets mining whenever possible and compacting the storage of frequent itemsets for future usages Formally a condensed representation must be equivalent to frequent itemsets one can retrieve each frequent itemset together with its frequency without accessing data Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE 


Such a representation is known as closed sets 33 34 Two other representations are considered in this paper frequent free itemsets 4 8 and frequent essential itemsets  Notice that these sets are not e xactly suf cient to represent frequent sets since they need a subset of the frequent itemsets border to become condensed representations We briey describe these representations in the rest of this section Frequent Closed sets Given an itemset X  the closure of X is the set of all items that appear in all transactions where X appears Formally given a transaction database r  Cl  X    t  r  X  t  If Cl  X  X then X is said to be closed Frequent free itemsets An itemset X is said to be free if there is no exact rule of the form X 1  X 2 where X 1 and X 2 are distinct subsets of X  Free sets can be efciently detected through the following property X is free   x  X sup  X  sup  X  x  Frequent essential itemsets The notion of essential itemsets has been dened recently in It is based on the notion of disjunctive rule 11 A disjunctive rule is of the form X  A 1  A 2   A n  Such a rule is satised if every transaction that contains X contains at least one of the elements A 1   A n  An itemset X is said to be essential if there is no disjunctive rule of the form A 1  A 2    A k  where  A i  i 1 k are distinct elements in X  As for free sets they can be efciently tested exploiting the following property X is essential   x  X sup dij  X  sup dij  X  x  where sup dij  X   t  r  t 012 X    The predicates being a frequent free itemset and being a frequent essential itemset are anti-monotone w.r.t set inclusion In the following we study the distributions of these three collections w.r.t itemsets size Other concise representations based on the notion of disjunctive rules have been dened the reader is referred to the general framework proposed in for more details To end up we believe that our choice of concise representations covers a fairly large range of typical cases 3.2 Experimental protocol For frequent itemsets a benchmark of fourteen datasets is commonly used Most of them are real-life datasets only two being synthetic ones generated by the generator from the IBM Almaden Quest research group All e x periments have been done on these datasets Each dataset has been studied for many representative minimum support thresholds from very high to very low values For each one frequent itemsets frequent closed frequent free and frequent essential itemsets have been collected We have studied their distribution with respect to itemsets size i.e the number of elements in each level from one to the size of the largest itemsets Moreover we have studied the positive and negative borders distributions of frequent frequent free and frequent essential itemsets 2  To perform these tests we used algorithms available at the FIMI website The disco v e ry of frequent itemsets and frequent closed itemsets has been done using FPClose and FP  growth 015 algorithms from ABS  has been updated to nd frequent free and frequent essential itemsets To the best of our knowledge this work is the rst one to address the understanding of datasets for frequent itemsets and other concise representations by using their negative borders 3.3 Experimental results In order to perform a fair comparison with results given in this paper focus on the same datasets i.e Chess  Pumsb  Connect  Pumsb 015  M ushroom and T 10 I 4 D 100 K  Notations used in the sequel are reported in Table 1 FI frequent itemsets FCI frequent closed itemsets FFI frequent free itemsets FEI frequent essential itemsets Table 1 Notations Given a dataset and a minimum support threshold value the Table 2 describes a typical example of our experimental results Due to space limitations the reader is referred to for comprehensi v e results from which the analysis made in this paper has been performed A wider range of minimum support threshold values and other datasets are also described in In the rest of this section we discuss our experimental results with respect to three main axes borders distribution of frequent itemsets stability of borders distribution with respect to support threshold values and borders distribution of frequent free and essential itemsets 2 The set of closed itemsets is not closed downwards and thus the notion of borders does not apply Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

R  XY   S  UV  R  XZ   S  UW   R  XY Z   S  UV W  S  U  V Figure 6 An interaction between FD and IND gap between the negative and positive borders may be very insightful to explain the behavior of algorithms and may also give some hints to guess the existence of properties associated with anti-monotone predicates In spite of the huge amount of work done for frequent itemset mining we are not aware of such kind of contributions Nevertheless we introduce in the sequel another data mining problem known to be representable as sets where such properties have been clearly identied Application to inclusion dependency mining Inclusion dependencies IND are fundamental semantic constraints for relational databases Let r and s be two relations over schemas R and S  and X and Y be sequences of attributes into R and S respectively The IND R  X   S  Y  is true in  r s  if all the values of X in r are also values of Y in s  This notion generalizes foreign keys constraints very popular in practice The underlying data mining problem can be stated as follows Given a database nd all inclusion dependencies satised in this database 23 30 24 From 30 the set of IND candidates can be organized in a levelwise manner a given level say k  corresponds to INDs whose arity is equal to k  Moreover a partial order for INDs can be dened as follows if i and j are two INDs j  i if j can be obtained by performing the same projection on the two sides of i  For example R  AB   S  EF   R  ABC   S  EFG   In this setting the predicate being satised in a database is anti-monotone with respect to  30 Consider now the well known inference rule for inclusion dependencies together with functional dependencies  gi v e n i n F igure 6 Intuiti v e ly  consider an inclusion dependency i  R  XAB   S  YEF  where X and Y are attribute sequences and A B E and F are single attributes Suppose that every IND j such that j  i is satised and let j 1  R  XA   S  YE  and j 2  R  XB   S  YF  be two of them The more  Y  is large the more Y is likely to determine E or F  In other words i is likely to be satised from inference rule of Figure 6 From this result one may logically expect that large INDs should never appear in the negative border even if large INDs exist It implies a potentially large gap between the two borders distribution like for type II datasets for frequent itemsets All our experiments corroborate this hypothesis We tested three synthetic databases built using the chase procedure W e enforced lar ge INDs in their positi v e border  until size 18 For all databases INDs in the negative border were all of size lower than 3 This particular behavior of the positive border of INDs justies an algorithm based on the negative border discovery 5 Conclusion and perspectives In this paper we have thoroughly studied datasets for problems related to frequent itemset mining We have shown that the distribution of the negative and positive borders have an important impact on datasets classication and algorithms performances For frequent itemsets mining a new classication of datasets has been proposed This work is a rst step toward a better understanding of the behavior of algorithms with respect to the search space to be discovered This work has two main perspectives The former is to nd out theoretical foundation of bell curves and stability obtained for the distributions in most of our experiments The latter is the design of adaptive algorithms with respect to dataset characteristics i.e changing dynamically their strategy during runtime References

Experimental Results Table 1: Experiment factor The experiment is to compare the performance between our approach and SWA which has been compare with Algo2a [4 and IGA [10] and is so far the algorithm with best performances published and presented in [12] as we know. The IBM synthetic data generator is used to generate experimental data. The dataset contains 1000 different items, with 100K transactions where the average length of each transaction is 15 items. The Apriori algorithm with minimum support = 1% is used to mine the dataset and 52964 frequent patterns are gotten Several sensitive patterns are randomly selected from the frequent patterns with length two to three items to be seeds With the several seeds, all of their supersets are included into the sensitive patterns set since any pattern which contains sensitive patterns should also be sensitive 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.0205 0.04 0.0618 0.0855 0.1006 ratio of sensitive pattern H id

RS and weakness Fig.8, Fig.9, Fig.10, Fig.11 and Fig.12 show the effect of RS by comparing our work to SWA. Refer to Fig.8, because the level of confidence in our sanitization process takes the minim um support into account, no matter how the distribution of the sensitive patterns, we still are C confident to avoid hiding failure problems. However, there is no correlation between the disclos ure threshold in SWA and the minimum support. Under the sa me disclosure threshold, if the frequencies of the sensitive patte rns are high, the hiding failure will get high too. In Fig.9, beca use our work is to hide the sensitive patterns by decreasing the supports of the pair-subpatterns of the sensitive patterns, the val ue of weakness is related to the level of confidence. However according to the disclosure threshold of SWA, when all the pair subpatterns of the sensitive patterns have large frequencies, it may cause serious F-I Attack problems.

However if the sensitive pattern set is composed of too many seeds, a lot of victim pair-subpatterns will be contained in Marked-Set. And as a result, cause a higher misses cost, such as x = 0.04 in Fig.10 Moreover, refer to the turning points of SWA under x = 0.0855 to 0.1006 in Fig.10 and Fig.11. The reason of violation is that the result of the experiment has strong correlation with the distri bution of the sensitive patterns. Because the sensitive patterns Proceedings of the 29th Annual International Computer Software and Applications Conference  COMPSAC  05 0730-3157/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE are chosen randomly, several variant factors of the sensitive patt erns are not under control such as the frequencies of the sensiti ve patterns and the overlap between the sensitive patterns if the overlap between the sensitive patterns is high, some sensitive patterns can be hidden by removing a common item in SWA Therefore, decrease the misses cost and the dissimilarity 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 0.0205 0.04 0.0618 0.0855 0.1006 ratio of sensitive pattern E x ec u ti o n T im e h  SP SWA 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.3784 0.6392 0.7646 0.9081 1 ratio of large2 in sensitive pattern set H id in g F a il u re SP SWA 


SWA Fig.12: Rel. bet. RS and time. Fig.13: Rel. bet. RL2 and HF Fig.12 shows the execution time of SWA and our approach As shown in the result, the execution time of SWA increases as RS increases. On the other hand, our approach can be separated roughly into two parts, one is to get Marked-Set which is strong dependent on the data, the other is to set sanitization matrix and execute multiplication whose execution time is dependent on the numbers of transactions and items in the database. In the experi ment, because the items and transactions are fixed, therefore, the execution time of our approach is decided by the setting of Marked-Set which makes the execution time changing slightly 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.3784 0.6392 0.7646 0.9081 1 ratio of large2 in sensitive pattern set W ea k n es s SP SWA 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.3784 0.6392 0.7646 0.9081 1 ratio of large2 in sensitive pattern set M is se s C o st SP SWA Fig.14: Rel. bet.

RL2 and Dis Fig.13, Fig.14, Fig.15and Fig.16 show the effect of RL2 Refer to Fig.13 and Fig.14, our work outperforms SWA no matter what RL2 is. And our process is almost 0% hiding failure 


The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
