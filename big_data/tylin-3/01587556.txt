Email: cgzhou@jlu.edu.cn Abstract The microeconomic framework for data mining assumes that an enterprise chooses a decision maximizing the overall utility over all customers. In item selection problem, the store wants to select J item set S that maximizes the overall profit. Based on the microeconomic view, we propose a novel algorithm ItemRank to solve the problem of item selection with the consideration of cross-selling effect which has two major contributions. First, we propose customer behavior model and demonstrate it with the data of customer-oriented business. Second, we propose the novel algorithm ItemRank which is implemented on the basis of customer behavior model. According to the cross-selling effect and the self-profit of items, ItemRank algorithm could solve the problem of item order objectively and mechanically. We conduct detailed experiments to evaluate our proposed algorithm and experiment results confirm that the new methods have an excellent ability for profit mining and the performance meets the condition which requ ires better quality and efficiency 1. Introduction The microeconomic framework con s idered as  one of the most promising of these models though only few theoretical frameworks for data mining have been proposed in the literature. Meanwhile, mining association rule [2 b a sic b u t im p o rtan t o p e ratio n in p r ev ious literatures. However, there are only a few studies concerning how association rule can be beneficial in more specific targets. Recent investigations th e  retailing market have shown an increasing interest on by unitizing association rules which is needed better knowledge about items. Consequently, profit mining was first proposed by Ke Wang et al  o lv e th e problem s  m e n tio n e d abov e bas ed  on microeconomic view The problem of optimal item selection e o f  main profit mining fields. It guides retailers to discard the items that are losing profit and introduce new items by upgrading the item type timely. Consequently, a meaningful and discrete subset is mined out for maximizing the profit. The cross-selling effect [6 o f ite m s  has also been noticed by current retailers, because the  but also is influenced by its relative items. Given that some items fail to produce high profit, they might stimulate customers to buy other high-profit items Consequently, the cross-selling factor which could be achieved by the analysis of historical transactions should be involved in the problem of item selection Searching for such a relation of items has becoming an important issue. However, the current method of mining associate rules is not enough to support profit mining The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we introduce the related work concerning profit mining, followed by the preliminary definitions of optimal item selection problem in Section 3. In Section 4, we demonstrate ItemRank algorithm step by step. First, customer behavior model is proposed and ank algorithm is described systematically and theoretically. Experimental evaluation is given out in Section 5. In Section 6 we draw the conclusion of ItemRank algorithm Proceedings of the 2005 International Conference on Cyberworlds \(CW\22205 0-7695-2378-1/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


2. Related Work Many important literatures concerning profit mining have been published. Brijs et al proposed the PROFSET Model [3 ok adv an t a g e of th e cros ss e l ling effect of items to solve the problem of item selection and pointed out that two importan at  items in retails shops should meet the basic sale request and bring higher profits is requested to being taken into account during the process of mining profit from retail market. Thereby, how to balance the relationship of these two principles is the core problem of profit mining. Ke Wang et al proposed HAP algorithm 6 so lv e th e p r o b l em o f it e m ran k i n g  w i t h th e co n sideration the influence of confidence and profit. Raymond et al proposed the maximal profit problem of item selection \(MPIS h i c h h a s th e g o al o f  m i n i n g  out a subset of items with the maximal profit and then ameliorates these above drawbacks. However, MPIS nt, because it is a NP-hardness problem even in the simplest situation. In other words, although MPIS algorithm could find the best solution, the cost of time is too expressive to be tolerated 3. Problem Definition Based on the microeconomic view e f r a m ework considers a store with a possible set of items depending on the decision chosen, contributes different amounts to the overall utility of a decision from the point of view of the enterprise. It is assumed that the contribution of an item is a possibly complicated, function of the data available on that item. The store chooses an item set that maximizes the overall utility over all transactions nary but important definitions which is essential for the further understanding of problem of item selection 3.1. Basic Definition Given a set I of item and a set of transactions, each transaction is a subset of I An association rule has the form X 002 I j such that IX 003 and I j 004 I the support threshold of association rule is the fraction of transactions containing all items in X and item I j the confidence of association rule is the fraction of the transactions containing all items in set X that also contain item I j  3.2. Problem Definition MPIS is actually the problem of selecting a subset S from a given item set to maximize the estimated profit of the resulting selection Given the dataset which contains m transactions t 1  t 2 203, t m and the item set I which includes n items I 1  I 2 203 I n The profit of item I a in transaction t i is deted by prof\(I a t i  A subset of I denoted by S means ts Stt ii    005 and iii ttd  005 212 Consequently i t  005 represents the selected items in the transaction t i and d i represents the no-selected items in the transaction t i If d i is empty, all items in t i are selected and the profit of t i is unchanged. If i t  005 is empty, we don\220t selected any item in t i and thus t i generates no profit. If both i t  005 and d i are not empty, we stipulate d i  i d 000\241 and i t  005 as follow Y...,,Y,Y{d qi 21   Y...YYY{d qi 006\006\006\006 000\241 321 and  21 ki IIIt   005 where Y i  1<i<q presents a single no-selected item Definition 1 Total Profit of Item Selection [8 h e  total profit of an item selection S is defined as below formula 000\246\000\246  005 004 212 m i ai i t a I ia I,d\(csfactor\(\t,I\(profP 1 1 1 We specify the cross-selling effect \(denoted by csfactor some items for other items by loss rule 8 which has a form of \215 I a 002 000\241 d i 216.

algorithm which is in charge of ranking items is demonstrated theoretically 4.1. Customer Behavior Model Here we pay attention to the individual behavior, i.e reflected information of a transaction. In the domain of profit mining, it is assumed that a customer enters the store and selects items randomly. When a customer finishes selecting a set of items, he or she will begin to Therefore, the possibility of an item to be selected, in the view of our algorithm is the rank of the item \(ItemRank, abbr IR Based on the discussion so far, it is necessary for a retail shop to choose some items to buildup a list which includes items with a high possibility to be brought and  the list guarantees that the higher possibility the items in it are bought, the higher IR of the item In microeconomic view e tra n s act ion o f a n  individual has an influence with the others and the others also influence it. Customer behavior model is proposed on the basis of the regressive relationship that if an item is influenced by many high-profited ones, it must be a high-profited item. Customer behavior model is denoted by a directed graph G = \(V, E where the set V of vertices denotes the items and the set E of directed edges denotes cross-selling effect between items. N i denotes the out-degree of item I i In customer behavior model, we stipulate that an edge from I i to I j means that I i gets the authority from I j and item I j is relatively important if there are many such edges. If many items point to an item, its IR will be high, or there are some high IR items pointing to it When we enlarge other items based on items in the list these items will have high IR. Consequently, the weights of items could be transferred among the items based on the association rules 4.2. ItemRank Process Based on customer behavior model, ItemRank is proposed on the basis of PageRank  g o ri t h m  to solve item selection problem. The initial item rank IR I i is defined as the following equation \(4  000\246 004  E\j,i j j n n i N I\(IR N I\(IR  N I\(IR I\(IR 1 1 4 However, the equation \(4\ails to consider the confidence of items conf\(I i 001 I j  and the profit of items itself prof\(I i  The number of frequent items is far more than the selected items, so the potential cross link I i 001 I j depends on not only the confidence of items, but also the profit of items itself. Consequently if the link I i 001 I j exists, we use \215 conf\(I i 001 I j  327 prof\(i 216 to evaluate the IR of item I j  nd if item I j is not selected the lose profit of itself is also denoted by the value of conf\(I i 001 I j  327 prof\(i which is viewed as the trust weighs of subsequent items of I j so the equation \(4 could be rewritten as 000\246 004 002\327\327  E\j,i j jijj i N II\(conf\I\(prof\I\(IR I\(IR 5 The equation \(5\ the accurate result only under the precondition that all items must become a strongly connected graph.

Experimental Results To evaluate ItemRank algorithm, we use the IBM synthetic generator [11 to c r e a t e a s ynt he tic d a ta b a se   T10.I4.N1K.D10K, with stronger cross-selling factors Item profit should be normal distributed but we still generated profit random average distribution for simple  Prof i t of It e m s are g e n e rat ed as f o l l o w  80 of items have a medium profit ranging from $1 to $5 10% of items have a high profit ranging from $5 to 10, 10% of items have a low profit ranging from $0.1 to $1. The total profit in this dataset is $320092. In T10.I4.N1K.D10K, there are 601 frequent items and 10 frequent pairs with minimum support threshold of 0.5%, 872 frequent items and 15398 frequent pairs have the min support 0.1%. It is obvious that there is stronger cross-selling effect between items when support is 0.1%. All experiments are conducted on a 2.8GHZ Intel PC with 512MB main memory, using the Microsoft Windows XP Data ItemRank algorithm is comprehensively compared with HAP algorithm and na\357ve algorithm s e  HAP algorithm is the state of the art in the consideration of item selection with cross-selling effect in the data mining literature. ItemRank algorithm outperforms both HAP and na\357ve approach with both 0.5 and 0.1% min support threshold on the basis of the experiment evaluation Form Fig.1, the na\357ve approach gives the lowest profitability of all algorithms because it simply calculates the profits generated by each item for all transactions and selects some items which generate the greatest profits without considering any cross-selling effect between items. Suppose that all three algorithms get more profit as the increasing of the number of items get higher profits than HAP and na\357ve approach. Fig.2 presents the running time of those algorithms when support is 0.5 and na\357ve approach need no iteration. Although both ItemRank and HAP algorithm need to more or less 20 iterations trixes ItemRank algorithm outperforms HAP algorithm as the increasing of item selection        minsupport=0.5 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 10 20 30 40 50 60 item selection p ro f i t Na\357ve HAP ItemRank Figure 1.

almost the same result for different d 1 However, when the support is 0.1%, ItemRank can get best result when d is 0.2. Meanwhile, if d is more than 0.3, ItemRank algorithm could get only the same result we set the damping factor d equal to 0.2 for the higher profit. Fig.3 and Fig.4 both indicates that ItemRank has the more excellent performance than HAP and na\357ve approach when strong cross-selling factor exists between items. Although k spends the most time when selecting 10 ient than both HAP and na\357ve algorithm with the increasing of selected items 5.2. Results for HAP Worst-case Set We now illustrate the goodness of ItemRank by using the specially generated dataset where HAP may get the worst results because of the weaknesses of HAP 12  I n 1 2  th e y call t h e d a t a set H A P  w o r s tca se d a ta  set 2 and show how to generate it synthetically\. We generate HAP worst-case set by the following parameters: 1,000 items and 10,000 transactions. When minimize support is 0.05%, all items are frequent and there are 2194 frequent pairs. The profit distribution is the same with the above dataset In Fig. 5, the parameters in ItemRank algorithm is marked. The iteration number is the number in first bracket and the value of damping factor d is in the second bracket         minsupport=0.1 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 item selection p r o fi t Na\357ve HAP 0.2 0.8 0.8 0.8 Figure 5. Results with minsupp 0.05 Obviously, Na\357ve approach gets the worst result ItemRank algorithm gets the best result with the damping factor d 0.2 after 10 iterations. ItemRank gives the second smallest result with d 0.8 and 10 iterations. If the damping factor d is fixed on 0.8, ItemRank can get higher with the more iterations, However, it could not outperform HAP when the selection items are less than 70 From Fig. 5, we maybe draw a conclusion that people usually have 20% chance to purchase a relative item after they have purchased some item 6. Conclusions and Future work We use ItemRank algorithm to rank items which are influenced by the cross-selling effect among items based on microeconomic view. Customer behavior model is proposed for the implement of ItemRank algorithm, which presents the better performance than HAP. Comprehensive experiments indicate very satisfied results which confirm that ItemRank algorithm outperforms well-known algorithms: HAP and Na\357ve 7.

In the next two paragraphs we will discuss two methods: the first one is to utilize user profiles and service access logs to find the rules, and the second is to examine the services within service workflow l ogs to find the co-occurrence pattern among data services, application services and userfacing services  As exhibited in Table 4, user profiles can be created based on user identity, specialized domains and interests. The following rules can be disclosed by studying the data: If a user is a terrorism analyst then entity extraction services and link & group analysis services are useful with 80% support and 100% confidence; If a user is a terrorism analyst and is interested in information about Al-Qaeda and Usama Bin Laden then data service 3 and 4 are good information sources with 40% support and 66% confidence  Table 5 showed six service workflows and revealed the following rules: If a link & group analysis service is used to analyze the data then a hyper bolic tree service is used to visualize the result with 33% support and 100% confidence If data service E is the data source then entity extraction service is used to work with the data with 33% support and 66% confidence  As illustrated above, what th is technique discovered is actually the association and relationship among services in SOA, which is not natively captured in the service registry The rules found can be used to advise proper services for users to leverage based on user profiles or on current selected services. For example, if a new user declares himself to be a terrorism analyst then entity extraction services and link & group analysis services can be recommended. Or when a user selects a link & group service, a hyperbolic tree service can be suggested to the user for visualization. He nce, the association rules technique helps to push individual services and even service workflows to the user  S ERVICE S EQUENTIAL A CCESS P ATTERNS   Sequential Patterns is an interesting data mining technique that has been used to discover customer purchase behavior web access patterns, and time related processes such as scientific experiments, natural disasters, and disease treatments. Its goal is to find inter-transaction patterns such that the presence of a set of items is followed by another item in the time-stamp ordered transaction set  In SOA, this technique can be used to discover users service access patterns in temporal order. For example among users who are working on terrorism information analysis, link & group analysis services are usually called within one hour after accessing an entity extractor service In some scenarios, the sequential patterns technique can also be used to determine which services in the same service categories are more effective. Table 6 demonstrates three analysis processes of differe nt analysts. In all three processes, we can see the r ecurring pattern: the combination of service 1, service 4, and se rvice 8 is always replaced by the combination of service 1, service 5, and service 8, which shows that service 5 probably has more advantage than service 4 when dealing with a specific topic, in this case Al-Qaeda, financial sources”, even though both of them are relevant  Analysis Process Sequences start with RFI user 1  1. search service related to “Al- Qaeda, Financial Sources 2. search result: data service 1, 2, 3; application service 4, 5, 6, 7; user facing service 8, 9 3. construct service flow with service 1, 4, 8 4. view the result 5. modify the service flow to replace service 4 with service 5 and view the result 5. save service flow for the RFI start with existing service flow user 2 1. load existing service flow with services 1, 4, 8 saved for RFI about “Al- Qaeda, Financial Sources 2. modify the service flow to replace service 4 with service 5 and view the result 3. save the modification start with RFI user 3  1. search service related to “Al- Qaeda, Financial Sources 2. search result: data service 1, 2, 3; application service 4, 5, 6, 7; user facing service 8, 9 3. construct service flow with service 1, 5, 8 and view the result 4. modify the service flow to replace service 5 with service 4 and view the result 5. reverse back to service 1, 5, 8 and save service flow for the RFI  Table 6Sequential Pattern in Analysis Process 5  A PPLICATION OF S ERVICE R ATING  Service Rating technique allows service consumers to review and rate services based on a set of criterias.  The review and rating then serve as references for other service consumers to inquire. The set of criterias covers service performance, availability accuracy, validity and effectiveness  Before delving into service rating technique in detail, let us first take a step back and have a look at our everyday life When people are planning to purchase a product or a 


 8 service, reviews and ratings from other customers generally play a very important role in our decision  Whenever planning to go to a restaurant, reserve a hotel purchase a car, or buy a book, people will always want to check consumer guides and any customer reviews available even if they have already got enough information from the product vendor or service provider. You may also want to call your friends to see what they think if they happen to have any experience with the product or the service, and you take their opinions and suggestions very seriously  Amazon has implemented a product review and rating mechanism that enables cust omers to share information about products. In the A9 tool just cam e out i t st art s  to capture review and rating fo r virtual product-website too In SOA, service is also virtual product. The information in the service registry is provided by service provider however a service consumer may have a totally different view from what the provider claims.  This is where a feedback loop becomes increasingly important  By incorporating users’ feedback about services in the format of reviews and ratings into a SOA, service consumers have a 360-degree view of services. They have an opportunity to know more about service performance effectiveness and reliability before making a selection among relevant services, which they were not able to do via the data captured in a re gular service registry   Performance Effectiveness Service Review Service Rating Extended Service Registry Inquiry Reliability  Figure 6Service Review and Service Rating  Service rating provides an overall evaluation for a service while service review provides detailed evaluations in text format.  Reviews and ratings that come from the same user group are especially interesting, since they represent opinions from a community of users with the same interests and same requirements for servi ces. With the latest service reviews and ratings bearing heavier weight, service improvements can be reflected and taken into consideration  By employing service ratings, analysts will gain the ability to focus efforts on highly rated services that are more likely to provide better results. This will allow the process to be more efficient by reducing the number of ineffective and unproductive queries and analysis 6  E XTENDED S YSTEM A RCHITECTURE  In order to take advantage of the data mining technology and service rating techniques discussed in section 4 and section 5, we propose an extended SOA infrastructure to enable pattern and association discovery, service rating and review capturing, dynamic COI construction and inquiry of all the above information  As depicted in Figure 7, the service registry that usually holds service metadata provided by service vendor is extended to include service access patterns, service associations and recurring service flows. New data structures are created in the re gistry to hold these additional information. Based on the examples in section 4 classification of “useful for te rrorism analysis” can be added to service entries of Evidence Entity Link Discovery Service, Entity Extractor service and Link & Group Analysis service \(Table 1, 2\ in the registry. Clusters of services: service 1, 2, 3, 4; service 5; and service 6, 7, 8,9 10 \(Table 3 and entity extraction service and link & group analysis service and hyperbolic tree service \(Table 5 service flow of service 1, 5, 8 \(Table 6\l be captured in the registry. With the information available, when a user inquires about a service from the registry, he can not only get the service metadata, but also get the other services that always co-occur with the current service, similar services and service workflows that the current service often participates in  The service registry is also extended to store service rating and reviews. After interacting with the services, service consumers can rate the service or write review about their experience and publish it to the service registry. The feedbacks are then available while other users look up the services. In the Service Seque ntial Access Patterns example four application services are returned for a RFI about “AlQaeda”, “Financial Sources within which service 5 may have the highest average rating in Effectiveness and Performance. With this information, a user will immediately know that service 5 is the probably the best candidate to pick  In addition to the service re gistry, a user registry is introduced into the architectur e. It captures basic user profile such as name, profession, and interested domains. In addition to that the user registry also serves as a “group registry” and captures user groups of same interest-COIs From the user clustering example in section 4, user clusters  


 9   Figure 7 Extended SOA Infrastructure w ith Pattern/Rating Services  of user A, C, G; user F; and user B, D, E, H can be stored in the “group registry” for inquiry. Different from most of the COIs we encounter today, the COIs here are dynamically constructed and updated by running clustering algorithm on users’ access log of the services. If a user’s interest in terrorism analysis changes from “Al-Qaeda” to “Saddam Hussein”, it will be reflected in the dynamic user groups  To support the new features of service registry and user registry, the interface of Regi stry Service in the Core Enterprise Services block is also extended to enable publishing and querying additional information  The service blocks tier is expanded to include another set of data mining and rating related services Patterns/Associations services offer the capability of service classification, service clusteri ng, service associations and sequential access patterns discove ry. Dynamic COI services cluster users in a dynamic fashion. Both of them interact with ESM to gain access to th e service access log and user it as the input for various data mining algorithms Rating/Review services provi de the interface to define rating criteria, and capture users’ reviews and ratings  Companies like Amazon and eBay have utilized similar sets of data mining and rating services to provide a high level of quality to their customers.  The increase in quality and information leads to an increas ed customer base, increased participation in the “community,” and ultimately to increased satisfaction.  The same paradigm can be applied to the Intelligence Community providing leverage to support the analytical and collaborative process  These new capabilities will enable a more intelligent system that will better support the analyst.  By leveraging standard” advantages of a SOA, these new extension will offer additional advantages to the end user.  With a SOA analysts will have the ability to discover and bind to new services on the network dynamically.  With the new techniques behind data mining and service rating applied to the SOA, analysts will be able to make better determinations on what serv ices will best support their needs  Further, these services can support the next generation of systems built around agent technologies.  With the necessary infrastructure in pl ace, intelligent ag ents can be built to automate many of the service discovery and orchestration steps taken manually today.  This additional increase in automation will allow analysts to spend less time searching and more time analyzing 7  S UMMARY  By combining data mining technology and service rating techniques into a SOA-enabled problem solving space within the Intelligence Community, analysts are able to utilize expertise and knowledge from other analysts to quickly discover services in a meaningful way and compose services into workflows  With the assistance of service mining, service usage mining and service rating, analysts can navigate through services  Dynamic COI Patterns/Associations Service Profiling Intelligent Agents End-to-End Application End Users  Services Blocks Application Services Information Data Process Services BPEL User-Facing Services WSRP Extended Core Enterprise Services Security Messaging Extended Registry \(UDDI ESM Data Mining Services/Rating Services Dynamic COI Patterns/Associations Rating/Review Extended Registry Store Service Registry Patterns Associations Service Flows Service Rating/Review User Registry COIs

mator from sensor 1 also shown 6. CONCLUSIONS This paper derives a Bayesian procedure for track association that can solve a large scale distributed tracking problem where many sensors track many targets. When noninformative prior of the target state is assumed, the single target test becomes a chi-square test and it can be extended to the multiple target case by solving a multidimensional assignment problem. With the noninformative prior assumption, the optimal track fusion algorithm can be a biased one where the regularized estimate has smaller mean square estimation error. A regularized track fusion algorithm was presented which modifies the optimal linear unbiased fusion rule by a less-than-unity scalar. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed track association and fusion algorithm through a three-sensor two-target tracking scenario 7. REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and W. D.

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
