Statistical Association Rules and Relevance Feedback: Powerful Allies to Improve the Retrieval of Medical Images Marcela Xavier Ribeiro, Joselene Mar ques, Agma J. M. Traina, Caetano Traina Jr  mxavier | joselene | agma | caetano  icmc.usp.br Abstract This work aims at developing an efficient support to improve the precision of medical image retrieval by content, introducing an approach that combines techniques of statistical association rule mining and relevance feedback. Low level features of shape and texture are extracted from images. Statistical association rules are used to select the most relevant features to discriminate the images, reducing the size of the feature vectors and eliminating noisy features that influence negatively the query results, making the whole process more efficient. Additionally, our approach uses a new relevance feedback technique to overcome the semantic gap that exists between low level features and the high level user interpretation of images. Experiments show that the combination of statistical association rule mining and the relevance feedback technique proposed here improve the precision of the query results up to 100 1. Introduction Content-based image retrieval \(CBIR\echniques and similarity search queries have been intensively researched in the last years C B I R techni ques work on the whole information embodied into an image and are not restricted to a textual description of it. The reservation about textual descriptions is their inherent subjectivity, because the specialist can be, at the moment, concerned about specific aspects of the image under analysis and other important aspects may be left unreported CBIR uses image processing algorithms to extract relevant characteristics \(features\ from the images organizing them in feature vectors. The feature vectors are employed in place of the images allowing fast and efficient indexing and retrieval. Features quantify the intrinsic visual characteristics of images, such as color shape and texture [13  l eadi ng t o vect or s wit h  Contrarily to what one would think, having a large number of features can be a problem. As the number of the extracted features grows, indexing, retrieving comparing and analyzing the images become much more time consuming [1, 8 In m a ny si tua t i ons a large number of features are correlated, so they do not bring new information about the images and do not improve A large number of features leads CBIR-based systems to face the ty curse" problem y er i n 7 proved that increasing the number of features \(and consequently the dimensionality of the data losing the significance of each feature. Thus, to avoid decreasing the discrimination accuracy, it is important to keep the number of features as low as possible establishing a tradeoff between the discrimination power and the feature vector size Users of CBIR systems have different perceptions eling unsatisfied with between low level features and the high level user interpretation, which is called semantic gap One of the major challenges of CBIR is the development of image representation methods that complies with the human perception subjectivity. An essential approach to overcome the semantic gap is introducing the users in the process, having them interacting and telling what is really relevant from the images being retrieved and analyzed. The relevance feedback RF\ approach asks the user to quantify the relevance of the images retrieved by a query, allowing automatic adjust of future queries. It has been proven that RF is quite fective in bridging the semantic ga In this paper, we propose a method that deals with two critical problems of CBIR systems: \(a\arge number of features that leads to the "dimensionality curse" problem, and \(b\the semantic gap existing between the user interpretation and low level features The first problem is handled applying statistical association rule mining to the feature vectors to find the most relevant features to discriminate images. The second problem is handled using an efficient technique of relevance feedback that chooses the most relevant features to change the similarity function and the query placement. Experiments performed show that the proposed method improves the query precision up to 100%. Moreover, the method is efficient, since the complexity of the query processing decreases along the dimensionality reduction of the feature vector The remainder of this paper is structured as follows Section 2 summarizes the concepts and related works thod. Section 3 presents the proposed method, and Section 4 discusses the experiments and results achieved with the developed method. Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions of this work Proceedings of the 19th IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems \(CBMS'06 0-7695-2517-1/06 $20.00 \251 2006  IEEE 


2. Background and Techniques 2.1 Feature Selection through Statistical Association Rule Mining Image mining and CBIR are closely related as both of them rely on features extracted from images Association rule mining [2 i s one o f th e m o st  investigated areas in data mining and knowledge discovery. It was initially motivated by business applications, such as catalog design, store layout, and customer categorization o wev er  f inding associations has also been widely used in many other applications, such as data classification and summarization [4, 14 The main image features regarding a specific criterion are organized in feature vectors, which a suitable approach to find association rules should consider quantitative data, instead of nominal data, as performed by the main association rule algorithms. In this work we broaden the applicability of the StARMiner hm [11 w h ich ext en ds th e stat i s tical r u le  mining techniques presented to f i nd p a tterns on images. The goal of StARMiner is to find statistical rules involving attributes that best discriminate images into categorical classes. A rule has the format x 000\306 A i and it is identified only if the following conditions are satisfied 200 The behavior of attribute A i in images of category x om its behavior in images of other categories 200 The attribute A i must present a uniform behavior in images of category x  The previous conditions are implemented in the StARMiner algorithm incorporating interesting restrictions in the mining process. Let T be a database of medical images x an image category T x 000\217 T the subset of images of category x and A i a feature. The restrictions of interest implemented in StARMiner algorithm are 1 AvgA i  T x  AvgA i  T-T x  000\225 mindif where 000x\000\003 AvgA i  Z is the average of A i values in the Z subset of images 000x\000\003 mindif is the input parameter that indicates the minimum allowed difference between the average of A i in images of category x and the average of A i in the remaining images of the database 2\ Hypothesis test. H0 should be rejected with a l or greater than minconf with 000x\000\003 H0 AvgA i  T x  AvgA i  T-T x  000x\000\003 H1 AvgA i  T x  000\217 AvgA i  T-T x  where minconf is the input parameter that indicates the minimum confidence to reject the H0 hypothesis 3 0011 A i  T x  000\224 maxstd where 000x\000\003 0011 A i  T x e standard deviation of feature A i values in the subset of images T x  000x\000\003 maxstd is the input parameter that indicates the maximum standard deviation of A i values allowed in images of category x  The StARMiner algorithm identifies the features with the highest discrimination power, since they have a particular and uniform behavior in images of a given category. This is important, because the features presenting uniform behavior to every image in the dataset, independently of the image category, do not contribute to categorize them, and should be eliminated 2.2 Relevance Feedback techniques Relevance feedback \(RF\ aims at learning from the users what they understand as relevant/irrelevant considering their perceptual notion of similarity. By including the human subjectivity in the retrieval process, RF can take advantage of the domain specialist knowledge to increase the applicability of CBIR systems, while dealing with the semantic gap During the RF interaction cycles, users are asked to grade the retrieved images by their relevance to a given query. Such grades are translated in weights, that increase/decrease the contribution of the most/least influential attributes concerning the users\220 view. The weights are updated during RF iterations The results \215correct\216 by the user\220s view are set as and the same happens with incorrect results, which are set as negative examples. The weighing given by the positive images improves the precision of the query answer, but unfortunately it has a limited contribution, as after a number of iterations the maximum gain is reached saturates\d the results cannot be further improved by the sole use of this technique. The negative images have a great potential of improving the results and reducing the semantic gap. This is due to the fact that the irrelevant images returned show the ones to be discharged from the image result set In this paper, we take advantage of a new RF technique called Multiple Point Projection which allies the assurance of increasing the precision for a CBIR query given by the positive images, with the power of changing the query given by the negative ones. In addition, this technique is benefited by the query center relocation and the use of multiple query centers, considering the relevant objects returned by the original query, as we will explain following Proceedings of the 19th IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems \(CBMS'06 0-7695-2517-1/06 $20.00 \251 2006  IEEE 


Multiple Point Projection RF MPP-RF y query q this technique gets the initial results from q and process a at each object \(image\selected as relevant R i by the user. An additional object  phantom regarding relevant and irrelevant objects, which are set by the user at the first interaction. The phantom object is generated by the RF Projection technique \(see A query is posed considering the phantom as the center of it. Thus, if there are r objects selected as relevant, there will be r 1 query centers After obtaining the r 1 new query centers, the original query is re-executed for these new centers Each query i obtains the results O i Let O be the union of O i where i 1\203 r 1. A new combined distance is computed based on the distance between the resulting set and the corresponding query center, which are the selected relevant images R i and the phantom In addition, the new distance considering the relevance weights defined by the user during the RF iteration and the original distances from each relevant object R i o the initial query center Q is calculated. The objects with the smallest new distance values are returned as the result of the query.

A New Method to Improve the Retrieval of Medical Images Our new method deals with two inherent drawbacks of a CBIR system, the high dimensionality of feature vectors, and the semantic gap. We amend the first restriction by selecting the most relevant image and the second one by employing the new relevance feedback technique  MPP-RF The proposed method is illustrated in Figure 2 and is applied in three steps, as follows Step 1: Feature Extraction In Step 1, low level features of texture, shape and color are automatic extracted from the images. The are indexed in place of the images to allow efficient indexing and image retrieval Step 2: Feature Selection Image features are high dimensional vectors, what make the process of indexing and retrieval of images much time consuming and decrease the precision of the query results. Thus, selecting the most relevant features to discriminate images and eliminating the irrelevant ones speeds up and improves the results The StARMiner algorithm is applied in Step 2, to obtained in Step 1 using the previously known class of each image StARMiner finds statistical association rules in the image features. The features most relevant to discriminate the images take part in the most confident rules mined by StARMiner algorithm. These features are used to reconstruct the feature vector Step 3: Improving the user satisfaction with Relevance Feedback Step 3 uses the proposed Multiple Point Projection RF \(MPP-RF\ technique to improve the precision in image retrieval. When a user asks a query, the RF cycle starts. During a RF interaction cycle, the user is asked to grade the retrieved images by their relevance to answer the given query. Such grades are translated in weights. The user feedback information will increase/decrease the contribution of the most/least influential attributes concerning the users\220 view.

information is also employed to define new query centers and to discard irrelevant images from the result set 4. Datasets and Experiments To evaluate the proposed method, we have ach based on the precision and recall \(P&R\graphs obtained from the CBIR query results. Precision and recall are defined as  TS TRS precision 000  TR TRS recall 000 where TR total of relevant images in the database TRS total of relevant images in the query result TS  total of images in the query result Considering the size of the dataset k nearest neighbor k NN\ queries were applied to the indexed image database. A k NN query is a similarity search ng the feature vectors using a distance function to quantify how close \(or similar\ is each pair of vectors. An example of a k nearest neighbor query is: \215given the Thorax-XRay of John Doe \(query center\, find the 10 images most similar to it\216 As a rule of thumb on analyzing P&R curves, the closer is the curve to the top of the graph, the better is the retrieval technique. In the experiments, we have asked k NN queries, considering k as the image base size and taking the queries centers randomly. The images in the query result were ordered by their similarity to the query center. We have firstly computed the graph without RF, using the original feature vector obtained in Step 1, and secondly using the reduced feature vector obtained in Step 2. The same process was repeated, but using the proposed RF technique. The dissimilarity function used in the experiments to measure the similarity between two images is a weighted Euclidean distance Experiment 1 \205 The Mammography dataset The Mammography dataset consists of 89 images of ROIs \(Regions of Interest\ comprising tumoral masses taken from mammographies collected in a clinical hospital. The images are classified either as benign or malignant. The kinds of tumors are strongly related to the image shape: benign masses have well-defined smooth contours, while the malignant ones have the contours spread over the mammary parenchyma Setp 1 extracts the Zernike moments fro m  t h e Mammography dataset, which provide a precise mathematical model that captures the global shape of images. From each image the first 255 Zernike moments were extracted, generating feature vectors with 255 elements In Step 2, the values from the feature vectors obtained in Step 1 were normalized and the StARMiner algorithm was applied selecting a set of 38 relevant features. StARMiner reached a reduction of 85% of the features used to represent the images. An example of rule obtained by StARMiner malign tumor 000\306 7 th Zernike moment indicating the importance of 7th Zernike moment in discriminating malign tumors To evaluate the impact of the number of feedback iterations and the evaluation given by the user in the query precision, Step 3 was executed in several configurations. The three more representative ones are shown in Figure 3. Analyzing the graphs of Figure 3 we can conclude that 000x\000\003 The dimensionality reduction of Step 2 provides an important gain in precision. With and without RF iteration, the precision obtained using the set of 38 StARMiner selected features are higher than the precision obtained using the initial set of 255 features These results testify that the dimensionality curse t features impairs the clear tendency of the relevant ones 000x\000\003 The precision obtained using the MPP-RF technique improves up to 70%, \(Figure 3 \(a,d\\These results show that the proposed MPP-RF technique is efficient in enhancing query results 000x\000\003 The higher values of precision were obtained using the proposed method that combines StARMiner algorithm and MPP-RF technique. These results confirm that the proposed method is effective in improving accuracy of CBIR systems Experiment 2 \205The Heterogeneous Images dataset The Heterogeneous Image dataset consists of 210 medical images classified in eight categories angiogram, MR Axial Pelvis, MR Axial, MR Sagittal Head, MR Coronal Abdomen, MR Sagittal Spine, MR Axial Abdomen and MR Coronal Head. The steps done on this dataset are detailed as follows Step 1 was performed extracting texture features nted in 5 regions by a variation of EM/MPM method. This generated a very compact feature vector of 30 features per image In Step 2 the StARMiner algorithm was applied to Heterogeneous Image dataset selecting a set of 21 features, reducing 30% on the feature vector size Step 3 was executed using three and five RF iterations, asking the user to select 5 images as relevant positive\ 5 images as irrelevant \(negative Proceedings of the 19th IEEE Symposium on Computer-Based Medical Systems \(CBMS'06 0-7695-2517-1/06 $20.00 \251 2006  IEEE

Figure 5\(c\s the results on the 30 original features after a cycle of RF, while Figure 5\(d\ows the results on the 21 selected features after a cycle of RF. The major precision was obtained using the proposed method \(Figure 5\(d\, where all returned images are of the same category of the query center 5. Conclusions In this paper we proposed a new approach to improve the precision in medical image retrieval helping to amend two critical problems of image retrieval systems: the high dimensionality of feature vectors and the semantic gap. The first problem was tackled by using statistical association rules to select the most relevant image features, consequently g expressive dimensionality reduction of the feature vectors.

6. Conclusion In this paper a number of alternative rule ordering and case satisfaction strategies have been considered. Four established ordering strategies were examined. In addition the authors proposed a ?fth strategy, ACS, where more speci?c rules are given a higher precedence than less speci?c rules but using con?dence as the most signi?cant factor for tree pruning during the generation process The principal ?ndings of the evaluation are as follows 1 used in the experiments, \(2 mechanism works better than ìbest î in all the data sets tested, \(3 that a relatively high con?dence threshold is used \(a threshold of % is suggested 4 olds \(% to a ìbest ?rstî case satisfaction produced good results References 1] Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. \(1994 for mining association rules.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
