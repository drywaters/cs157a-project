Thus, it is expected ile a disconnection In order to improve data availability on the DBMS rk proposes to select a priori a subset of the data available on the server side DBMS and copy them to the mobile device ction, this work proposes to mine the SQL history of the mobile device user 1. Introduction According to [4  d i s c o n n ect ed o p er a t i o n s  ar e o n e computing es show that data broadcasting is a ent 5,11,12   T h is te c h n i q u e c o n s is ts b a s i c ally in a the server or ch is nce it s or to groups of ing is the is ink. In addition the broadcasting technique is scalable, since it does not s to which the data is being sent gh the broadcasting technique has its ntages, it also has its down side. For instance, the time for an item appear in result set may increase since the update depends on the server broadcast schedule this problem is to cache frequently nts quests from the local cache without sending uplink requests. This not only reduces the ink and downlink bandwidth consumption rther reduce the query delay and improve the used. In nts, when the server broadcasts data on the broadcast channel, clients sted data without increasing efetching also consumes many system resources Automated hoarding is the process of predicting the predict which set of data should be prefetched. An approach s by Kunning and Pope  T h e i r c l us t e r i n g  method was based on the notion of semantic distance The semantic distance between two operations was ber of directory levels in a relative to objects.

per, we propose to use automated hoarding to discover what should be early prefetched Hoarding through association s [3 can b e a c h i ev ed t h r o u g h th e f o l l o w i n g th r ee ecution: 1\mining of the SQL queries history, 2\onstruction of the candidate set, and 3  ase 1, the history of client requests are preprocessed and analyzed to come up with the es using data mining techniques. In to construct the candidate set and the hoard set, respectively per is organized as follows Section 2 presents the hoarding and prefetching scheme proposed on this work. Section 3 describes the first and second phases of the hoarding process bes the simulation model and provides the experimental results we obtained, and ile discussing possibilities for future research 2. The hoarding and prefetching scheme find es and the data rver-side DBMS in order to oad these related data hoping to reduce the dependency from the server by the client. By dependency we mean the waiting time for the user to ed about side DBMS kely to be queried in a recent future by the user, and thus this prefetched to the client-side DBMS ong items has been clearly defined by Agrawal et al. [3   This definition is provided for clarity Let I  i 1  i 2  i m be a set of literals, called items and D be a set of transactions, such that 002 T 003 D  T 004 I A transaction T contains a set of items X if X 004 T An plication of the form X 000\237 Y where X 005 I  Y 005 I and X 006 Y  007 A rule X 000\237 Y is said to hold in the transaction set D with confidence c if c of the transactions in D that contain X also contain Y The rule X 000\237 Y has support s in the transaction set D if s of transactions in D contain X b Y  of mining association rules is to find all the association rules th at have a support and a sholds [3    spectively. The problem of ed and is outside the scope of this paper. In this paper, we focus uct nity among mobile ization of the resulting association rules in hoarding. In this access queries of nts issued to the server are stored in a history log Association rules are obtained by analyzing the history by clients To date, association rules have been used in various rmining  megamarkets [3 A u to mate d u s e o f as s o c iatio n r u l e s  by n d 8 b u t b o t h granularities were files such as web pages.

The candidate set is defined as the set of  t of data items actually loaded to date set is constructed using inferring on association rules as istics are used to prune the candidate set to the hoard set so that as explained in Section 3.2 The process of automated hoarding via association summarized as follows 200 are logged to further transmission to the server 200 rring date set prior to disconnection 200 the prefetch set 200 d to the client Proceedings of the 5th IEEE/ACIS International Conferenc e on Computer and Information Science and 1st IEEE/ACIS International Workshop on Component-Based Software Engineeri ng, Software Architecture and Reuse \(ICIS-COMSAR\22206 0-7695-2613-6/06 $20.00 \251 2006  IEEE

Finding the candidates An inferring mechanism is used to construct the candidate set of data items that are of interest to the client to be disconnected. The candidate set of the client is constructed in two steps 200 nds the association rules whose pre-conditions, i.e., left hand side sts in the current session 200 side of the s are collected into the candidate set ctive hoarding process, the d come up with a sufficient hoard set that will satisfy the client\220s needs for most of the client request patterns  need to have low minimum support and confidence values for the association rules. Priorities need to be assigned for the items obtained as a result of the inferring. Our priority metric is based on the rule by a rule with a high confidence or support. To include both support and confidence value, the priority of a rule is set to be the multiplication of the confidence and support value for that rule 3.2. Pruning the candidates that sources. The ular importance for ve a limited space to load the d in pruned to che. Each result set item in the candidate set is associated with a priority. These priorities together with various termining the s in ch set is built ghest priority in the candidate set just enough to fill the cache. For an effective hoarding, both successful and missed SQL ld be recorded and reflected to the history upon reconnection. In this manner, we can capture the whole picture of client requests, both connected and disconnected 4.

An average effect stands for R²-values between 0.67 and 0.34. The explanatory power is weak for an R² between 0.34 and 0.19 and overall not relevant for R²-values under 0.19 [1    Figure 2: Structural model validation   Therefore R² of our research model for the intention to use self- and e-assessment can be categorized as substantial expressive for perceived usefulness and as an average effect for intention  4.4. Results  The results of our empirical research based on our explorative case study is that the intention to use self and e-assessments can be explained by Davis perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use Furthermore antecedents of perceived usefulness are perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings derived of the MATH e ll as th e [36]. Statistical  support can be provided for all the hypothesized relations between constructs except of perceived ease of use on perceived usefulness  5. Limitations  As with any work in a new field of research relevant literature about self- and e-assessments to build on is almost nonexistent. Unfortunately the operationalization of "perceived cost and time savings" as well as perceived quality improvements  in this paper could consequently not build on earlier work too much so we had to derive them of the MATH m  w e ll as t h e UT A U T  36   As with any empirical field study, this work has limitations. It is important to note that we have build an explorative model to examine the acceptance of self- and e-assessments.

on the intention to use self- and e-assessment center as well as the influence of PQI, PCS and PTS on PU it might represent a single example for a specific economy, country or cultural region . There might be differences for the intention of different informnation systems with different settings. Future research should discuss this issue more detailed  Furthermore our questionnaire was just answered by large-scale corporations in Germany. So our results might not be directly transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises  In addition, as we collected our data from participants at the same time using the same survey our results may be affected by common method varian  6. Conclusion  Self-assessment and e-assessment as online games in staff recruiting are a valuable solution for companies to support on the one side their employer branding activities and on the other side the selection of the favored candidate. The case study of our papers shows that companies can generate more qualified applications and concurrently save time and money. Based on these findings our empirical research with 191 of the Top-1000 companies of Germany provide statistical evidence that perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings are the main reasons beside perceived usefulness and ease of use why companies intend to use self- and e-assessment in their recruiting processes  References   Bago zzi  R  P   T h e Ro l e  of M easu r e m en t i n T h eo ry Construction and Hypothesis Testing: Toward a Holistic Model", in: Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, O.C.

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
