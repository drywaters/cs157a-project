relationships in weighted settings as illustrated by experiments performed on web usage datasets. We propose a strategy for maintaining association rules in dynamic databases. This method uses weighting technique to highlight new data. The experiments have shown that our approach is efficient and promising  1. Introduction  Traditional association rules mining \(ARM\ model assumes that items have the same significance without taking account of their weight/attributes within a transaction or within the whole item space. But this is not always the case. In order to tackle this problem, we 
made adaptation on the traditional association rule mining model under the \223significant \226 weighted support\224 metric framework instead of the \223large \226 support\224 framework used in previous works Due to the completeness nature of algorithms for mining association rules \(such as the Apriori algorithm 1    th e n u m b er o f d i s co v er ed  r u l es can b e s o l ar g e that browsing the rule set and finding interesting rules from it can be quite difficult for the user. This algorithm will be faced with tremendous searching space, so has lower efficiency. Artificial immune 
systems are highly distributed systems based on the principles of the natural system. It offers powerful and robust information processing capabilities for solving complex problems. Its ability of self/non-selfidentification provides a good solution to Web usage mining based on association rules. So in this paper, we present a new algorithm, association rules mining based on artificial immune algorithm 2. Weighted association rules mining  In this paper, the idea of replacing the support with significance is proposed in [2  an d it ar g u e th at a 
223weighted downward closure property\224 can be retained by using weighted support. It also proves that this property is valid under the \223weighted support \226 significant\224 framework In order to make use of the weight in the mining process, several new concepts have been adapted Support is used in association rule mining. In weighted association rule mining \(WARM\, itemsets are no longer simply counted as they appear in a transaction This change of counting mechanism makes it necessary to adapt traditional support to weighted 
support. The goal of using weighted support is to make use of the weight in the mining process and prioritize the selection of target itemsets according to their significance in the dataset, rather than their frequency alone Let  
001\001\001 be a set of distinct items and W be a set of non-negative real numbers. A pair \(x, w\ is called a weighted item where Ix 
002 is an item and Ww 
002 is the weight associated with x. A 
 n iiiI  21 
transaction is a set of weighted items, each of which may appear in multiple transactions with different weights Definition-1 Weighted attributes weighting attributes 
001\001\001 are variables selected to calculate weights. Depending on the domain, there could be any variable ranging from item\222s price in a supermarket domain to visitor page dwelling time in a web log mining domain There are two types of weights \226 the  
 k aaaA  21 
item weight and the  itemset weight   Definition-2 Item weight Item weight is a value attached to an item representing its significance. We denote it as 
 iw In the web log mining setting where each item is a page visited in a click-stream/transaction, the weight can be related to a users average dwelling time on that 


   where i e is the number of clone i sl is the affinity of i antibody  k is a constant value to control the number of antibodies that participate in cloning operation. The antibodies produced by cloning must be mutated Cloning_ And_ Mutation \(antibodies set For each antibody in the population  For \( i=0;i sl k  003   antigens k k antigen antibody antigens k k i antigen weight antigen weight antibody sl k i 1  1  The weight of antigen   k antigen weight can be calculated by using the formula given in Definition-4 4\ Cloning and mutation  When antibodies on a B-cell bind with an antigen, the B-cell becomes activated and begins to proliferate. New B-cell clones are produced that are an exact copy of the parent Bcell, but then undergo somatic hypermutation and produce antibodies that are specific to the invading antigen. The number of clone is relevant with the affinity page Definition-3 Itemset weight Based on the item weight  i w  the weight of an itemset, denoted as 004 i Generate and mutate new Clone If  the new clone is identical to any antibody in the population Eliminate the new Clone Else Add the new Clone to the population   As for mutation operation, we adopt random point mutation, and change the value of these points 5\emory cell   The immune system maintains a memory of its encounters with antigens The Bcells, in addition to proliferating or differentiating into plasma cells, can differentiate into long-lived B memory cells. During our algorithm performing the outstanding individual that their stimulation is larger than the minimal threshold will be preserved as a memory cell. If the memory cells are overflow, the antibody with lower stimulation level will be remove from memory cells. So we can easily mining association rules from memory cell The procedure of the association rules mining based on artificial immune algorithm can be described as follows AIS_Based_Association_Rule_Mining_Algorithm   1  Also bear in mind that an item weight is a special itemset weight when the itemset has only one item Definition-4 Transaction weight Transaction weight  is a type of itemset weight. It is a value attached to each of the transactions. Usually the higher a transaction weight, the more it contributes to the mining result The transaction weight k t an be derived from weights of the items presented in the transaction. One may formulate it easily as the average weight of the items presented in the transaction   1  An itemset is denoted large if its support is above a predefined minimum support threshold. In the WARM context, we say an itemset is significant if its weighted support is above a pre-defined minimum weighted support threshold. This method may be more meaningful than only specifying relatively arbitrary support threshold  3. Presentation of algorithm  Through the inspiration by artificial immune system[3  th e o r i g in al  tr an s a ct i o n s an d can d i d at e model can be considered as chromosome. The chromosome is constituted by gene \(attributes Therefore the transactions in the database will be regarded as antigens, the candidate model as antibody In our algorithm, there are the following definitions 1\ntibody The antibodies are specific proteins that recognize and bind to another protein. As the antigens, antibodies are also used to represent a certain data item. So according to our need antibody population are those transactions that are randomly selected from dataset 2\ntigen Each antigen in the AIS represented an individual data item. In our application, after initialising the antibody population, the rest transactions of dataset are regarded as antigens 3\ Stimulation level Each antibody can recognize a set of related antigens, each of which differs slightly in shape. The stimulation level of an antibody dictates whether the antibody survives. It represents the intensity of combining antigen and antibody. The higher stimulation an antibody has the stronger intensity their combination will have The stimulation level is defined as follow  i i sl k e     is i w is w is k k    k t i k t i item weight t weight k  is w  can be derived from the weights of its enclosing items One simple way is to calculate the average value of the item weights, denoted as 


   X wsp w X wsp w X newSP w 2 2 1 1  Y X wsp  Y X wsp  Y X conf w satisfy the minimum confidence threshold, then this rule is the association rule in db DB  004  004 then X is valid, else it will be deleted. Meanwhile, delete all pagesets in DB that contain X. In Group 3  004  004 then X is valid, else it will be deleted in db. Continually, utilize above method to deal with remained rules. At last, if   p X wsp w X wsp w sup min 2 2 1 1 Initialize the antibody population Load antigen population While \( Termination condition not met  Present antigens set Calculate antibody stimulation level Select antibody with high stimulation level and store their digital strings and stimulation as memory cells If \( memory cells are overflow Remove the antibody with lower stimulation level If \( Termination condition not met Cloning_And_Mutation \( antibodies set  Generate association rules The minimum stimulation level, the number of memory cells and the value of k need to be specified by user  4. Mining incremental data sets  Given the original database DB minsupp is the minimum support threshold. For efficiency, we reuse the information from the old frequent pages and not frequent pages as they are done in our proposed algorithm. After some updates, the increment database db is added into the original database DB. Let 1 w and 2 w be the weights of DB and db, respectively 1 2 1   003 005   005 set n transactio k k t Y X set n transactio k k t weight t weight Y X wsp k _ 1    _ 1 1  where  X wsp 1 is known, and the support of X in db also is available, if  X wsp 1 if   w w Then for any association rule Y X  we define its support and confidence as 005 004  005 004  005 2 2 1 1 005 is the support of Y X in db DB 004  004  In Group 2    Y X wsp w Y X wsp w Y X newSP w 005 1 and 005 The association rule Y X can be extracted as a valid rule in db DB 005 only if it has both support and confidence larger than minsupp and minconf respectively Any pagesets X can be divided into the following four groups Group 1: the X is significant in both DB and db Group 2: the X is significant in DB but not significant in db Group 3: the X is not significant in DB but significant in db Group 4: the X is neither significant in DB nor db In order to make full use of the result of DB, we execute our algorithm in transaction set db, and obtain the 1-pagesets and all association rule. First, let\222s select the 1-pagesets in db that its support value satisfies the minimum support threshold and compare them with 1pagesets in DB. Given in Group 4, then X cannot be used to generate any rule because their supports are less than the minimum support threshold. Thus, X is indifferent. In Group 1, X is certainly significant in db DB 005 its support 005   5. Experiment and results  We present our experience in applying association rule technique to the web data set maintained by Guangxi University. In this paper, we concentrate on Web usage mining that discovers user navigation patterns from a large collection of Guangxi University Web access logs. Its Web site mainly presents the basic conditions of Guangxi University. The data set is composed of 2880 transactions and 322 pages. The weight of page is visitor page dwelling time. We provide a concrete example to illustrate this in Figure 1 In Figure 2, three different minimum weighted supports ranging from 0.03 to 0.05 are used for both cases  Transaction Page and its weight  1 P86,2.0\ \(P233,0.5 P255,0.5\ \(P303,0.5\ \(P304,0.5 P319,20 2 P255,0.33 3 P86,0.857 P162,2.0\ \(P236,0.5\ \(P255,2.0 P320,0.5 4 P3,1.25\ \(P86,4.0\ \(P105,0.5 P178,0.5\ \(P194,0.5\\(P279,2.0 5 \(P65,0.5\ \(P68,0.833\\(P246,2.0  Y X newSP w      p X wsp w X wsp w sup min 2 2 1 1 005 2 are the support of Y X in DB and db, respectively  X wsp 2  is known, by searching the running result in DB we also obtain the support

The running results are illustrated as follows. After first running, 139 frequent itemsets are generated in Apriori algorithm, and 167 significant itemsets are generated in weight model, where 139 frequent itemsets are both in the two models. It means that significant itemsets generated in weight model contain all frequent itemsets generated in Apriori algorithm. 28 significant itemsets only in weight model have high weight. And the general results are presented in Figure 3 Min support=0.03 Algorithm Number of significant itemset Max length of itemsets Our algorithm 167 5 Apriori 139 5 Figure3  significant itemsets for different algorithm  For mining incremental data set, we added the increment datasets db, and the size of each increment db is 5%, 10%, 20% and 30% of the size of the original database respectively. We performed experiments with different updates on our weighting model. Let min_supp=0.03, min_conf=0.5, and the weights of old and new itemsets be 7 0 1  w and 3 0 2  w  respectively. Our method gets a significant improvement by only scanning the new data sets once while the Apriori algorithm is least efficient because it needs to scan for the candidate items in the old and new datasets. As we have mentioned, effects of weights is mainly critical. Because the new data in db can partly reflect the novel properties of the data in some context, we can exploit this novelty of data to assign weights  6. Conclusions  The experiments show that the mining results in the weighted setting conform to the expected hypothesis The experiments also show that we studied an efficient, fast, incremental updating technique for maintenance of the association rules discovered by web usage mining. The developed method strives to determine the promising itemsets and hopeless itemsets in the incremental portion and reduce the size of the candidate sets to be searched against the original large data set. The idea of weighted methods really reflects the novelty of dynamic data. Our association rules mining based on AIS algorithm could effectively find out satisfied and interested association rules, and make search more efficient  7.

that in order to find an approximation to the Pareto front it is best to use the NSGA I1 algorithm Given our results the potential of NSGA I1 for nugget discovery is clear The flexibility of this algorithm will make it advantageous for solving this type of data mining problem As the subject of further research, the first step is to com pare the performance of the NSGA I1 algorithm with the true Pareto optimal front We are already working in this area and results will be reported shortly It may be interest ing to introduce more objectives into the search, such as the simplicity of a rule It may also be worth while to compare the performance of other Pareto-based algorithms against NSGA I1 for this particular problem  Bibliography I R Agrawal T Imielinski and A Swami Database mining A performance perspective In Nick Cercone and Mas Tsuchiya editors Special Issue on Learning and Discover in Knowledge-Based Databases num her 6 in 5 pages 914-925 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Washington U.S.A 1993 2 S Ah K Manganaris and R Srikant Partial clas sification using association rules In D Heckerman H Mannila,,D Pregibon and R Uthurusamy, editors Proceedings of the Thid.Int Cunf on Knowledge Dis coven andData Mining pages 115-1 18 AAAI Press 1997 3 R J Bayardo and R Agrawal Mining the most inter esting rules In S Chaudhuri and D Madigan. editors Proceedings of the Fiffli ACM SIGKDD Int Conf on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining pages 145 155.

  Query creates a table of product-month pairs for which there are more than 00 sales transactions in the Sales table.  Query 2 creates a table ReducedSales which extracts from the Sales fact table only those sale transactions that involve product-month pairs resulting from Query The result of Query 2, a reduced Sales table ReducedSales is based on question B.  This reduced table is used in Query 3 to create a table of product-month-zip triples for which there are more 00 sales transactions in the Sales fact table and later in Query 4 to create a table ReducedSales2 that extracts all sale transactions that involve product-month-zip triples resulting from Query 3.  We did not have to use the original Sales fact table, because we know that all possible transactions that satisfy conditions of Query 3 and 4 are replicated in much smaller ReducedSales table Finally, Query 5 performs a join of the ReducedSales2 table with itself in order to find the final result  6. Experiments  In this section we describe an experimental performance study of mining real world data that uses the system and methods described in previous sections of this paper For our experiments we used Oracle 9i relational DBMS running on a 28KB Linux machine.  The data we used reflects the aggregated daily purchases for a major US-based retailer during a six-month period and conforms to the schema shown in Figure 2.  The sizes of the tables are as follows The Product table has around 5000 tuples The Location table has around 2000 tuples with about 50 different Regions The Calendar table has around 200 tuples The Sales table has around 3 million tuples As we discussed in Section 4, standard association rules are not defined for such data.  However, as we also outlined in Section 4, we can still mine association rules by approximating or redefining the meaning of 223frequently together.\224  In our experiments we mined both association rules and extended association rules.  In this paper, we present the results of two queries that are typical for our experiments The first query finds regular association rules based on the following question Find all pairs of items that appear together in more than 9000 transactions Our implementation of this query \(code available by contacting the authors\ involves a pruning of all infrequent items as described in Section 5.2.

 time to produce about the same number of rules as association rule mining.  Furthermore, in order to find a similar \(manageable\ber of rules, the support threshold for the association rules had to be set significantly larger than the threshold for extended rules This fact supports our claim that association rules find coarser granularity correlations among items while extended rules discover finer patters The experiments also validate the viability of our tightly-coupled integration with the relational DBMS The running times for all of our queries are measured in seconds and minutes; and there is still a room for significant performance improvement by, for example upgrading hardware or through the addition of indexing In practice, in cases when a data warehouse is heavily utilized with OLAP and reporting requests, a separate data mart dedicated exclusively to data mining can be a good alternative in order to minimize the hits on the enterprise data warehouse and improve overall performance  7. Conclusions  In this paper, we presented a new data-mining framework that is tightly integrated with the data warehousing technology.  In addition to integrating the mining with database technology by keeping all query-processing within the data warehouse, our approach introduces the following two innovations Extended association rules using the other non-item dimensions of the data warehouse, which results in more detailed and ultimately actionable rules Defining association rules for aggregated \(nontransactional\ata We have shown how extended association rules can enable organizations to find new information within their data warehouses relatively easily, utilizing their existing technology.  We have also defined several exact approaches to mining repositories of aggregated data which allows companies to take a new look at this important part of their data warehouse We have conducted experiments that implement our approach on real-life aggregated data and the results support the viability of our integration approach as well as the appropriateness of extended association rules In our future work we plan to elaborate on the optimization algorithm.  We also intend to undertake a further performance study with larger data sets, using different hardware platforms and various types of indexes  References    A g ra wa l R., Im ie linsk i T. a n d A  Sw a m i.

CONCLUSIONS This paper derives a Bayesian procedure for track association that can solve a large scale distributed tracking problem where many sensors track many targets. When noninformative prior of the target state is assumed, the single target test becomes a chi-square test and it can be extended to the multiple target case by solving a multidimensional assignment problem. With the noninformative prior assumption, the optimal track fusion algorithm can be a biased one where the regularized estimate has smaller mean square estimation error. A regularized track fusion algorithm was presented which modifies the optimal linear unbiased fusion rule by a less-than-unity scalar. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed track association and fusion algorithm through a three-sensor two-target tracking scenario 7. REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and W. D.

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA. In other words, the number Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05 0.055 0.06 N um be r o f C ou nt ed P at te rn s Support Threshold Mafia Min_Conf=0 Min_Conf=0.1 Min_Conf=0.3 Min_Conf=0.5 Min_Conf=0.7 Min_Conf=0.9 Figure 8.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
