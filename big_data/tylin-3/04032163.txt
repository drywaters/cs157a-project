Episode mining can discovery the knowledge hidden in the event sequence. Currently, the most influential algorithm for episode mining is 
WINEPI. However, it is likely to suffer from the tendency of generating too many of candidate episodes In this paper, a novel algorithm named DRE for mining frequent episodes is presented. It studied the conditions for the events which can be pruned from the database, so the size of database is reduced gradually The performance of algorithm DRE was evaluated and compared with WINEPI algorithm. The results demonstrate that the DRE has better performance  1. Introduction  
Sequence data arises naturally in many applications Examples of such data are alarms in a computer network, occurrences of recurrent illnesses, etc Abstractly, such a data collection can be viewed as a 
sequence of events, where each event has an associated time of occurrence. Episode [1  i s d e f i ne d a s a  collection of events that occur in the same time window 
 
The task of episode mining is to discover the episodes that occur frequently. Once such episodes are known, one can produce rules for describing or predicting the behavior of the system. Sequential patterns [3  4  a r e s i mi lar  to f r eq u en t  ep is o d es to s o me  degree. However, there is no concept of time window so it is not suit for mining the time-window-related episodes Algorithm WINEPI i s de v i s e d f o r  m i ni n g  frequent episodes. While being the first algorithm for 
episode mining, WINEPI is likely to suffer from the requirement of scanning database many times and scanning the whole database at each time. The similar problem also exists in the Apriori-based algorithms [5  for association rules. To solve this problem, DHP [6  employs pruning techniques to gradually reduce the transaction database size. However, in episode mining one event is included in win windows, where win is the width of the window. It is more difficult to determine whether an event can be pruned from the sequence or not In this paper, we propose an algorithm named DRE 
to discover frequent episodes in event sequence. It studies the conditions of events can be pruned. Thus the size of events sequence can be reduced gradually Data experiments show that DRE has outstanding time performance The remainder of the paper is organized as follows The problem statements are discussed in section 2. The algorithm DRE is presented in section 3. The performance study of DRE is reported in section 4. The conclusions are given in section 5  2   Problem Statements  In this section, we present the formal definitions of event sequence, window, episode, frequent episode 
etc, which are the basic concept in episode mining [1   Definition 1  event sequence uppose E is the set of event types. An event sequence S on E is a triple     e s T T s where s  1  1  t A  2 2   t A 205  n n t A   s T denotes the start time and 
e T denotes the end time of the sequence. The pair     i i t A is an event where E A i 
001 is the event type and i t  e i s t t t 
 002 s the occurrence time For example, Figure 1 is an event sequence, where the integer denotes the time; the letter is the event type Definition 2 sub-sequence  Given an event sequence     e s T T s  
       e s T T s  is a sub-sequence of     e s T T s  if and only if s s 
002  002    For example, the event sequence  S in Figure 2 is a sub-sequence of  S in Figure 1 
003  and e e s s T T T T 


 E D C  and  Definition 3   episode  Episode is a subset of the set of event types. There can be repeated events in the same episode For example 006 005  For example, in Figure 1 the number of windows is 18. If 3  1 _  D E C   Definition 5  window   A window  on the event sequence    e s T T s S 005    002 The time span s e t t 212 k episode, it can be pruned from the database Proof If an event type is not a member of any frequent k episode, it is impossible to be a member of any k  1\-frequent episode. So it can be pruned  E C  is a sub-episode of episode   W in  occurs     S,win w win S W w  B A A   are all episodes Definition 4 sub-episode  Episode   E C B A F    1 002  002 and w consists of those pairs    t A from s where e s t t t  Table 1 212 is called the width of the window    win S W denotes the set of windows W on S such that win W width  fr min it is easy to know that the set of frequent 1-episode is    For example, the window in Figure 3 is  15  11  14    13    12    11   A C B A W  where e e s s T t t T  the width  of the window is 4, the start time of the window is 11 and the end time is 15. Table 1 shows all the windows in Figure 1, where the width of the windows is 4 Definition 6  episode occurs in a window n episode  f and only if all the event types in    E C   1 To improve the algorithm performance, we studied the condition for the event can be pruned from the event sequence database. The gain is as follows Theorem 1 In  k iteration, if the type of an event is not a member of any frequent All the windows in the event sequence S ID s t  e t  Events 1 8 12 \(A,11 2 9 13 \(A,11\,\(B,12 3 10 14 \(A,11\,\(B,12\,\(C,13 4 11 15 \(A,11\,\(B,12\,\(C,13\,\(A,14 5 12 16 \(B,12\,\(C,13\,\(A,14\,\(A,15 6 13 17 \(C,13\,\(A,14\,\(A,15\,\(E,16 7 14 18 \(A,14\,\(A,15\,\(E,16 8 15 19 \(A,15\,\(E,16 9 16 20 \(E,16\,\(C,19 10 17 21 \(C,19\,\(E,20 11 18 22 \(C,19\,\(E,20\,\(D,21 12 19 23 \(C,19\,\(E,20\,\(D,21\,\(F,22 13 20 24 \(E,20\,\(D,21\,\(F,22\,\(B,23 14 21 25 \(D,21\,\(F,22\,\(B,23\,\(A,24 15 22 26 \(F,22\,\(B,23\,\(A,24\,\(A,25 16 23 27 \(B,23\,\(A,24\,\(A,25 17 24 28 \(A,24\,\(A,25 18 25 29 \(A,25  Lemma 1 If episode 001 In other words, the  frequency  of an episode is defined as the fraction of windows in which the episode occurs Given a frequency threshold fr min _  is an event sub-sequence     e s t t w W 004 is the subepisode of 005  if and only if 005 004 003  For example, episode 005 occurs in a window  W  w  s t  win t s 005 are contained in W  and for each event type, the times of its occurrence in the window is no less than that in episode 005  For example, in Figure 3 episode    C A and     A C A are occur in window W but episode     C C B is not Definition 7 frequent episode  Given an event sequence S and a window width win the frequency of an episode 005 in S is      win S fr 005 is frequent if and only if fr min win S fr _     005 is frequent in an event sequence, all sub-episodes 005 004 002 are frequent  3   Algorithm DRE  The task of episode mining consists of two main steps. The first step involves finding the set of all frequent episodes. The second step consists of generating all the episode rules with the confidence above the threshold confidence. Given all frequent episodes, episode rules generation is straightforward So we only concentrate on how to find the frequency episodes  3.1. The Database Reduction Techniques in DRE  


001  0   ec   s t    Bring in new events to the window for all events    t A such that 1 212   win st t    In our example, event  20   E occurs in 4 windows the identifiers of these windows are 10, 11, 12 and 13 Theorem 2 Suppose    t A be an event in event sequence and the set of candidate k episodes which occur in window     i t A and contain event type A  is epi i t A     where win i In our example, because D is not frequent, so the event \(D, 21\ can be pruned from the database Theorem 1 gives the obvious pruning condition for the event. Theorem 2 discloses the abstract and profound pruning condition Lemma 2 Suppose    t A be an event in event sequence, there are win windows contain    t A where win is the width of the window. We denote these windows as      i t A where win i   m A  E C and    E B    C C   E E   002 002 m i It is obvious that  1 1     A A  epi i t A or  1  1 F is obtained by scanning the database once; Let 1  k  2  while  window width win the set of candidate k episode k C the frequency threshold fr min _   Output The frequent k episodes k F  Method Initialization  fc   212 t win t and the last window is in time span    win t t  e i t A             min epi i t A e 005 If  1   win i i  epi i t A     e i t A     then event    t A can be pruned from the event sequence Proof For the aim of contradiction, we suppose that    t A is contained in a candidate k 1\pisode 005 and 005  occurs in window      i t A Suppose 1  005 are 1 2 1   005  that contain    t A is A 006 006 006 m epi i t A A    19   i C  t n k F  3  The set of candidate k 1\pisode 1 005  occurs t he set of event types that is not a member of any candidate k episode is denoted as De   e  005  inw is t he set of candidate k episodes that are contained in current window    i A con is the set of episodes that contain exactly i events of type A  in  005  appear  in current window, and epi i t A epn i t A         t  in w  0   212  win T st s  e T st    B B  002   002 002 m i n i times where 1 1   m e  Suppose the set of k sub-episodes of  j n  m A  j n  1 002 002 i It is obvious that 4 1 002 002 007 i  1   19    epi i C 2   19    005 and if 1      B A 002 002 007  0      002 002 b m j j satisfies that A E j 005  and the event types in 005      e i t A     It is conflict with the assumption. So event    t A is impossible to occur in any candidate k 1\pisode. So it can be pruned from the event sequence  It is easy to know that in our example, the candidate 2-episodes are 005 indicates the time when episode is entirely contained in the window ec  005 0     C B    E C where 4 1     C A    E A 002 002 1  Proof It is obvious that    t A is contained in win  windows, the first window that contains    t A is in time span  1  1  002 002 1 Let    Input  Event sequence     e s T T s S  cou A where E A 001 005  for 1 005 According to lemma 1, all the episodes in A  m E E E Each event type occurs  1 1  212 k episode are pruned firstly. At the same time, the frequent counts of the candidate episodes are counted. According to theorem 2 the events that satisfy the pruning condition are deleted from event sequence. Finally, the set of frequent k episode k F can be determined, then go to 2 5  Output all the frequent episodes  The step1\ 2\nd 3\are same to algorithm WINEPI. The distinct feature of DRE is the database reduction techniques in  2     k k  4  The sliding window technique is used to get the frequent counts of the candidate k episode When the window slide, the events whose type are not the member of any frequent 005 denotes the number of event types in episode 005 It can be proved that if 1 005 occur in    i t A  So 005 denotes the number of windows in which episode 005 is t he number of event types in episode 005 i ndicates how many events of 005 where k C 001 005 005 where e   The iteration procedure of DRE is as follows 1  The set of candidate 1-episode is E C  1  k C is derived from k F let 1   e i C It\222s impossible that  19   C is contained in a candidate 3-episode. So it can be pruned from event sequence  3.2. The Iteration Procedure of DRE 006 k k iterations The pseudo code is presented below. We first give the denotations which are used in the pseudo code cou A   denotes the number of type A events in current window fc

Performance Study  To assess the performance of DRE, we conducted several experiments on the campus grid management database of Northwestern Polytechnical University The database covers a time period of one year.  Since the most important concept in episode mining is event type. Jobs submission, data transaction, network congestion, load unbalance etc can all be viewed as events. The decision tree algorithm is used to cluster the events to 98 clusters. Then the algorithm DRE is used to mining the frequent episodes     if  1   win i i 002 002 007  e i t A epi i t A          002  212  1  if De A 212  st t  for each     cou A A con  005 013  inw inw   e     1   min  1     005  inw inw 001 005   cou A ec    001 005  if k ec 005 005 212     cou A ec         current window contains episode 001 theorem 1 Delete    t A continue      cou A  for  i t A epn  k e i t A 001   for each      cou A A con       Update the related variables of the event type A  for all     t A such that t t win t 005 e t t t A e t t t A  212   212  Drop out old events from the window for all events    t A in s such that 1     Delete    t A theorem 2 output frequent k-episode   002  i win i i     1   0     005  for each inw 005 001 A      1    t A epn   e     1   min  1    005 005  ec  then st in    1    t A epn     212  1      t t t A epn   e     1   min  1        212 212 cou A   Figure 4 The relative performance with respect to different minimum support threshold Figure 4 shows the relative performance between WINEPI and DRE. It is shown that algorithm DRE in general outperforms algorithm WINEPI for various frequency thresholds, indicating the robust performance of algorithm DRE  Figure 5 The remaining of events in each iterations Figure 5 shows the effect of gradually trimming the database size by DRE. The number of events in the database scanned by DRE gradually decreases due to the elimination of events which ate deemed useless for later frequent episode generation. The relation between the window width and the effect of events pruning is also studied. The wider the window is, the more slowly the number of events decreases. This result can be explained by the difference in the number of events in the windows when the width of the window is different. When the window is wide, the more events can be included in a window. The support of the candidate episode may be increase. So there are more frequent episodes. As a result, fewer events can be pruned. At the same time, the number of iteration increases  5.

It is shown that by utilizing database reduction technique for events sequence, algorithm DRE incurs an execution time that is significantly shorter than that of WINEPI  References   4 Y  L  C h e n   S  S  C h e n  P  Y  H s u   223 M in in g H y b r id  Sequential Patterns and Sequential Rules\224, Information Systems, 2002, 27\(5\, pp: 345-362  5  A g ra wa l, T   Im ie li n s k i, A.

The result shows a dramatic increase of 17% in the recall of globular proteins and only a 3% decrease in the recall of OMPs relative to the statistical method. It indicates that our SVM method based on non-gapped amino acid pair composition outperforms the statistical method based on dipeptide composition. Using the accumulative combination with S 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 d 6 we obtained the same recall of OMPs and a dramatic increase of 18% in the recall of globular proteins relative to the statistical method. On the other hand, the recalls of the four structural classes are all higher than 93% \(within both d 1 and d 6\ Especially, the recall of all globular proteins of our method achieves remarkable increase of 26% compared to the statistical method. It shows the outstanding capability of our method in distinguishing all globular proteins from barrel membrane proteins. The comparison shows that our method outperforms the statistical method based on dipeptide composition 3.6. Performance of each k gapped amino acid pair composition and other combinations In this section, we have also evaluated the performance of each k gapped amino acid pair composition. The results are shown in Figure 2. Based on some observation of these results, several experiments with other combinations are performed As observed in Figure 2\(a\ the performance of the one-, two-, and five-gapped amino acid pair compositions are better than others. Therefore, a SVM classifier was constructed using a novel combination with S 1, 2, 5 consisting of these k gapped amino acid pair compositions The result shows a precision of 95.0% with a recall of 91.5%. It shows 0.9% improvement in precision and the same value of recall compared to the accumulative combination with S 0, 1, 2\ Moreover, the average of the precision and recall is over the accumulative combination with S 0, 1, 2, 3\ and that with S 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\. However, the performance is worse than the best performed accumulative combination with S 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\. Interestingly, the precision and recall of the combination with S 1, 3, 5\re the same as that with S 1, 2, 5 As observed in Figure 2\(b\he one-, three- and five gapped amino acid pair compositions perform better.

It shows a decrease of 0.5% in precision and an increase of 1.4% in recall compared to the accumulative combination with S 0, 1, 2\wever, the performance is worse than the best performed accumulative combination with S 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\. We also examined the combination with S 0, 2, 4\he performance achieves the precision of 95.7% with a recall of 94.2 These experiments show that these k gapped amino acid pair compositions within a combination contain redundant sequence order information and that the combination with S 1, 3, 5\ contains more discriminative sequence information to improve the prediction result. It also indicates that one-, three- and five-gapped amino acid pair compositions are meaningful for OMPs 4. Conclusion In this paper, we propose a method for discriminating OMPs from other proteins by Support Vector Machines using combinations of k gapped amino acid pair compositions. We analyzed the discriminative capability for different combinations of k gapped amino acid pair compositions. For dataset 1, the performance achieves a precision of 95.5% with a recall of 92.4% when using the combination of k gapped amino acid pair compositions with S 0 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\ There are 0.9% and 7.1% increases in precision and recall, respectively, compared to the method based on frequent subsequences. Furthermore, the number of features is remarkably reduced in our method. It shows that the combination of gapped amino acid pair compositions can capture more discriminative sequence information than frequent subsequences. For dataset 2, the results showed that our method has approximately the same power for discriminating OMPs from globular proteins even in different structural classes and that our method is much more powerful than the dipeptide based statistical method for discriminating OMPs from all globular proteins In this study, several combinations of k gapped amino acid pair compositions are demonstrated to contain valuable sequence information to discriminate OMPs from other proteins. The results indicate that the combination of one-, three- and five-gapped amino acid pair compositions are more meaningful than other combinations for OMPs We believe that further study in the gapped amino acid pair compositions will lead us to understand better the structural regularity of the OMP sequences and biological meanings behind the gapped amino acid pair compositions. Moreover, the high precision and recall of the OMPs as well as the high accuracy of excluding globular proteins represent the potential for identifying OMPs encoded within the genome References 1 Ma rte lli P  L Fa rise lli P  Krog h, A  a nd Ca sa dio, R A  Sequence-Profile-Based HMM for Predicting and Discriminating Barrel Membrane Proteins Bioinformatics  18, 2002, pp. S46-S53 2 Ba g o s  P  G L i a k opoulos T  D  Spy ropou los I.C. a n d  Hamodrakas, S.J., çA Hidden Markov Model Method, Capable of Predicting and Discriminating Barrel Outer Membrane Proteins BMC Bioinformatics 5, 2004, pp. 29 the web service at: http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr PRED-TMBB 3 Big e low H  R P e tre y  D  S., L i u, J   P r z y by ls k i D  a n d  Rost, B., çPredicting Transmembrane Beta-Barrels in Proteomes Nucleic Acids Research 32, 2004, pp. 2566-2577 4 L i u, Q   Zh u Y   W a ng B  a n d L i Y    I de nt if ic a tion of  Barrel Membrane Proteins Based on Amino Acid Composition Properties and Predicted Secondary Structure Computational Biology and Chemistry 27, 2003, pp. 355361 5 She R C h e n  F W a ng K Es te r, M G a rd y  J  L  a n d  Brinkman, F.S.L., çFrequent-Subsequence-Based Prediction of Outer Membrane Proteins SIGKDDê03 August 2003, pp. 24-27 6 G a rd y   J  L  L a ird, M.R., Che n  F., Re y  S., Wa ls h, C.

on the intention to use self- and e-assessment center as well as the influence of PQI, PCS and PTS on PU it might represent a single example for a specific economy, country or cultural region . There might be differences for the intention of different informnation systems with different settings. Future research should discuss this issue more detailed  Furthermore our questionnaire was just answered by large-scale corporations in Germany. So our results might not be directly transferred to small and medium-sized enterprises  In addition, as we collected our data from participants at the same time using the same survey our results may be affected by common method varian  6. Conclusion  Self-assessment and e-assessment as online games in staff recruiting are a valuable solution for companies to support on the one side their employer branding activities and on the other side the selection of the favored candidate. The case study of our papers shows that companies can generate more qualified applications and concurrently save time and money. Based on these findings our empirical research with 191 of the Top-1000 companies of Germany provide statistical evidence that perceived quality improvements, perceived cost savings and perceived time savings are the main reasons beside perceived usefulness and ease of use why companies intend to use self- and e-assessment in their recruiting processes  References   Bago zzi  R  P   T h e Ro l e  of M easu r e m en t i n T h eo ry Construction and Hypothesis Testing: Toward a Holistic Model", in: Conceptual and Theoretical Developments in Marketing, O.C.

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
