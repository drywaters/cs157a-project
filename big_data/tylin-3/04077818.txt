    Abstract In this paper, a rough sets based fuzzy logic control method was proposed for greenhouse temperature control. The process of system attribute reduct and a normalized processing for the sample data were carried out. Then the discernibility function was applied in the mining of certain and association rules from an incomplete decision table. Two overall thumb rules were generated for the definition of the fuzzy logic rule set The corresponding fuzzy logic control system for greenhouse temperature was established by using the Simulink tools of MATLAB, including the choosing of variables, grade partition of the universes, choosing of membership functions. The simulation achieved good performance, which verified the validity of employing rough sets based fuzzy logic control for 
greenhouse temperature control I  I NTRODUCTION  ODERN greenhouses can optimize the growth environment for both the above-ground part and rootage of plants, offering the plants with desirable growth conditions in the hope of obtaining the best produce. More and more theories from researches and results from practical experiments show that desirable entironment, especially proper distribution of the temperature contour, can greatly help increase the crop yield But due to the inherent complexity of the greenhouse environment system in addition to its multi-variable and their nonlinear nature, it’s difficult to achieve optimum control of greenhouse temperature using traditional on-off control or 
proportional control based methods[1  Be s i d e s   a d op t i n g  on-off or proportional based control methods to run the heating equipment may result in a loss of energy which has increasingly become an issue as the fuel prices have been soaring in recent years while the heating fare counts for a great portion of the winter greenhouse running cost. So an improved or more economical control method is essential for maximizing the greenhouse profit Fuzzy logic, as part of artificial intelligence \(AI techniques, provides a formal methodology to represent manipulate and implement expert heuristic knowledge for controlling a system. And a fuzzy logic controller performs well in robustness and cost saving[2  I n t h i s se n s e  f u z z y

To some extent, this takes substantial subjectivity or randomicity which may directly weaken the performance of the controllers In this paper, the theory of rough sets was used to distinguish the essential factors from those negligible in terms of decision making for the greenhouse temperature. Also 
overall control rules, on which based the construction of the fuzzy logic controller for greenhouse temperature, were extracted from the pool of data collected in the greenhouse field. After that, another set of data were imported into the greenhouse temperature model, controlled by the fuzzy logic controller to perform MATLAB simulations II  K NOWLEDGE A CQUISITION BY R OUGH S ETS  The notion of rough sets, first introduced by Pawlak  9  is  a n e x te n s io n o f s e t t h e o r y f o r  t h e s t u d y o f i n te llig e n t systems characterized by insufficient and incomplete information. Motivated by practical needs in classification data mining and concept formation under insufficient or 
incomplete information conditions, the theory of rough sets is emerging as a powerful mathematical approach dealing with incomplete data[1 T h e e x t e n s i o n s o f P a w l a k s  r o ugh s e t  model may be used in reasoning and knowledge acquisition in incomplete information systems and incomplete decision tables w h i c h m a ke s  i t po s s i b l e t o de a l w i t h p r o b l e m s l i ke  extracting control rules from limited collected field data for greenhouse temperature The data, on which based this research, were collected in a Venlo-type intelligent glasshouse in Zhejiang Province high-tech agriculture demonstration garden, located at Xiaoshan district, Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province Following the procedure of knowledge acquisition based on rough sets, a group of sample data was first selected to 
determine the attributes related to the decision making. The notion of information systems\(IS\ provides a convenient basis for the representation of objects in terms of their attributes. And a non-supervised discretion process was carried out to determine the system attribute values.

It can be found that attribute c is essential for this rule because both d2:c0e1->g3 and e1:c0d2->g3 are tenable, but c0:d2e1->g3 is incompatible within the system. And d2:c0e1->g3 and e1:c0d2->g3 can be further combined into d2e1:c0->g3, the final reduct for this rule One by one, the decision TABLE III after attribute value reduct should finally result in  TABLE  IV F INAL R EDUCT A FTER A TTRIBUTE VALUE R EDUCT  U c d e g x1 0 * * 3 x2 0 * * 3 x3 1 1 * 2 x4 0 * 3 x5 2 * * 1 x6 2 * 1 1 x7 0 3 x8 3  And restoring the above final reduct with system attributes will give birth to the final decision table for greenhouse temperature\(TABLE V

The heat supply system alter the steam pipeline temperature by changing the steam valve openness, thus providing the greenhouse environment with different heat supply power to achieve the desirable greenhouse temperature for plant growth The greenhouse control system can be allowed to act in response to the combined situation of greenhouse temperature difference and the rate at which the greenhouse temperature difference changes to eliminate the temperature deviation Corresponding control rules can be described using fuzzy statement as follows IF E=NB AND EC=PB   THEN U=PB IF E=NB AND EC=PM   THEN U=PB IF E=NB AND EC=PS  THEN U=PB IF E=NB AND EC=ZO   THEN U=PB IF E=NB AND EC=NS   THEN U=PB IF E=NB AND EC=NM  THEN U=PB IF E=NB AND EC=NB   THEN U=PB  In turns, all 49 control rules can consist of a fuzzy control rule set\(TABLE VI  TABLE  VI O RIGINAL D ECISION T ABLE FOR G REENHOUSE T EMPERATURE  EC U NB NM NS ZO PS PM PB NB PB PB PB PB PB PB PB NM PB PB PB PB PB PM PM NS PB PB PM PM PS PS PS ZO PM PM PS ZO ZO ZO ZO PS PS PS ZO ZO ZO ZO ZO PM ZO ZO ZO ZO ZO ZO ZO PB ZO ZO ZO ZO ZO ZO ZO  B  Greenhouse Temperature Control System Model According to Xu[12 v e n t s in w i n t e r g r een h o u s es ar e usually closed in order to cut the operation costs.

  paying particular attention to energy saving and running cost Fig.4. presents the simulation outcome of the experiment within MATLAB   Fig. 4.  simulation result for rough based fuzzy logic control of greenhouse temperature   In Fig.4., the output temperature curve basically meets the set temperature request, which shows the superiority and the reliability of applying fuzzy logic control method in multi input systems, such as greenhouses. Around the noon, the greenhouse temperature exceeds the set value for a long time because the greenhouse had not adopted any other temperature reduction measure under winter climatic conditions except ventilation. And the simulation result shows that the temperature has never surpassed 30 and still meets the temperature request for andreanum growth The simulation results indicate good feasibility and validity of the greenhouse temperature control effect using fuzzy logic control strategy based on rough sets for knowledge acquisition V   C ONCLUSION  This work first aimed to establish the feasibility and validity of rough sets based fuzzy logic strategy for greenhouse temperature control. Detailed process of knowledge acquisition using rough set was presented before the construction of the fuzzy logic control system for greenhouse temperature. It can be found that theory of rough sets can acquire the essential attributes from the candidates by discernibility function under incomplete decision system conditions effectively Computational simulations were carried out within MATLAB and the results were found to have a good agreement with the expected outcome. The rough sets based fuzzy logic controller can manage the greenhouse temperature effectively by controlling the output power of the steam pipelines to provide the plants with decent temperature environment in the greenhouse despite that the micro-climate in the greenhouse was constantly under the influences of time variable factors like solar radiation and outdoor temperature etc.. The simulation results indicate that it’s advisable to apply rough sets based fuzzy logic control in greenhouse temperature management A CKNOWLEDGMENT  The authors are grateful to the staffs of the Zhejiang Province Hi-Tech Demonstration Garden of Agriculture, who helped with the experiments.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
