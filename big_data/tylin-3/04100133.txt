The Blondie25 Chess Program Competes Against Fritz 8.0 and a Human Chess Master David B Fogel Timothy J Hays Sarah L Hahn James Quon Natural Selection Inc 3333 N Torrey Pines Ct Suite 200 La Jolla CA 92037 USA dfogel\(natural-selection.com AbstractPrevious research on the use of coevolution to improve a baseline chess program demonstrated a Blondie25 is the result of 7462 generations of evolution in performance rating of 2650 against Pocket Fritz 2.0 self-play in which the static board evaluator was evolved based on 16 games 
played 13 wins 0 losses 3 draws including material values positional values and three The resultant program named Blondie25 did not use object neural networks front back and center of the any rules for managing the time allocated per move it chessboard Moves are selected based on minimax with simply used three minutes on each move Heuristics to alpha-beta pruning Readers interested in background on more effectively manage time were developed by trial the development of the program should review 11 One and error play testing 
against Fritz 8.0 The best of the limitations of the Blondie25 program is that it has heuristics discovered were different for black and not evolved because it has not been allowed to evolve white The results of 12 games played on each side the use of time per move as a facet of play Instead it has were 1 win 4 losses and 7 draws for black and 2 devoted an equal amount of time for each move wins 6 losses and 4 draws for white Fritz 8.0 is rated regardless of the current situation 
or history of moves For currently at 2752 26120 on SSDF the acronym for the tournament conditions three minutes per move have been Swedish Chess Computer Association placing it as used the 12th strongest program in the world At the time of the contest between Blondie25 and Fritz 8.0 Fritz 8.0 An effort was made to incorporate simple heuristics for was rated 5 in the world The results are the first case using time more effectively Performance was judged on of an evolved chess program defeating a world-class 
competitions with Fritz 8.0 a highly rated chess program chess program three times The performance rating that was in the top five of all chess programs rated on 12 for Blondie25 against Fritz 8.0 was 2635.33 which at the time of our testing Fritz 8.0 is currently ranked as compares well with the previous performance rating the 11 th best program in the world of 2650 against Pocket Fritz 2.0 Blondie25 was then tested against a nationally ranked human chess The approach undertaken was to reflect the time

Management efforts in artificial intelligence both in terms of computers playing against other computers and Experimentation in 153 games some of which crashed computers playing against humans for more than 50 years mid-play yielded two different sets of heuristics for time 2-9 management for Blondie25 playing black or white It may be helpful to recall that 120 minutes are allocated for This paper reports on progress in testing the self-learning the first 40 moves first time period 60 minutes are evolutionary chess program named Blondie25

The heuristics were chosen for black are presented in the The baseline for 20 seconds/move was arbitrary Using following algorithm where Ft is the amount of time used less time than Fritz 8.0 used when Fritz 8.0's move was by Fritz 8.0 on the previous move and x is Blondie25's anticipated assisted in saving time for situations that were time unanticipated In such situations the longer that Fritz 8.0 used to find its move suggests a deeper required search 1 If Fritz 8.0's move was anticipated then x  Ft For black more time is provided when Blondie25 is 10 seconds but not less than 20 seconds playing behind however testing with this strategy for 2 If Fritz 8.0's move was unanticipated then if white did not evidence any tangible benefits Also for a Ft  3 minutes x  Ft  1 minute black extra time is provided at the beginning of play b 3  Ft  5 minutes x  Ft  2 minutes fourth move out of the book to provide an initial deeper c Ft  5 minutes x  Ft  4 minutes search and at the beginning of the second time period 3 Regardless of whether or not Fritz 8.0's move but it is not entirely clear why this may be effective for was anticipated if Ft  8 then x  Ft  3 black minutes 4 In addition if Blondie25 is down on pawns but Both Fritz 8.0 and Blondie25 were executed using a not other pieces then add 1 minute to x If Pentium II processor running at 1.5GHz with 512MB of Blondie25 is down on pieces other than pawns RAM The SSDF Swedish Chess Computer Association add 4 minutes to x If Blondie25 is down both rating of 2752\26120 of for Fritz 8.0 was based on a Athlon pawns and pieces set x  10 minutes 1200MHz with 256MB of RAM Thus the computing 5 After leaving the opening book for the first three equipment used was slightly more powerful than used by moves x  20 seconds SSDF Fritz 8.0 was run using default parameters on the 6 For the fourth move out of the book x  10 Fritz 8.0 engine which includes a hashtable size of 409 minutes MB contempt value selectivity tablebase depth 7 For the 41St move which begins the second agressiveness the permanent brain five-piece perfect period of time control x  8 minutes endings and so forth 8 If the duration assigned for any move would cause an overtime condition or leave fewer than 3 Results 20 seconds for each remaining move then x is set to the ratio of the time remaining to the Twenty-four games were played between Blondie25 and number of moves remaining in the time period Fritz 8.0 with the above-described heuristics for time management An equal number 12 of games were Rules 2 and 3 above applied to the first and second played with Blondie25 as black and as white The results time periods were 1 win 4 losses and 7 draws for Blondie25 as black and 2 wins 6 losses and 4 draws as white Thus the The heuristics for white were similar but simpler overall performance was 3 wins 10 losses and 1 1 draws Given Fritz 8.0's current rating 10 of 2752 this  If Fritzs8.0's movewas anticipateds,thenX=Ft corresponds to a performance rating for Blondie25 of 10 seconds but not less than 20 seconds 2635 commensurate with grand masters We believe this 2 If Fritz 8.0's move was unanticipated then if is the first result of chess program that was optimized a Ft  3 minutes x  Ft  1 minute using evolutionary algorithms that was able to defeat a b 3 Ft  5 minutes x  Ft  2 minutes then top-5 chess program now ranked 1 I on 1O c Ft  5 minutes x  Ft  4 minutes 3 Regardless of whether or not Fritz 8.0's move Following this contest it was desired to compete was anticipated if Ft  8 then x  Ft  3 Blondie25 against a competent human player It is well 4 For the first three moves out of the opening known that computer chess programs do not play in the book x  20 seconds same manner that human masters and grand masters do 5 If the duration assigned for any move would and that rating eamed solely in comparison to other causes an overtime condition or leave fewer than computer programs may not reflect ratings eamed against 20 seconds for each remaining move then x is human competition Co-author James Quon a nationally set to the ratio of the time remaining to the ranked chess master played a four-game series against number of moves remaining in the time period Blondie25 two as black two as white The program won three of the four games and lost the other eamning a It is unclear presently why the effects of the additional performoance rating of 2501 black rules were helpful for playing black but not white The rationale for some of the rules can be offered 4 Discussion however the values assigned for time periods only reflect the results of experimentation and no claim of optimality CoatrJmeQunantialyakdchsmse should be Inferred analyzed each of the 24 games against Fritz 8.0 His l-4244-0464-9!06/$20.OO 2006 IEEE 231 CIG'06 May 22-24 2006 


assessment is that the match between the two programs master Quon noted however that the program's opening was very competitive where the programs seemed more play is often weak and he was able to detect a horizon closely matched than the score would indicate The effect in some games in which the program can be opening phase of the game is still a weak point for manipulated because it can only see to a fixed ply depth Blondie25 not only because it does not have knowledge Future work will be aimed at offering additional object of the theoretical variations but it would also often neural

should such optimization has been used in Blondie25 This likely not be found in Fritz 8.0's normal opening book suggests an opportunity to improve the competitive since it is judged to be a poor move however we verified performance of Blondie25 with software engineering In that the default opening book was indeed in use in all addition performance ratings on small sets of games are games inherently variable It would be of interest to evolve time management rules and determine if more effective rules In contrast there were many instances in which could be discovered and to evaluate these rules across a Blondie25 was able to achieve a superior endgame At wider array of chess programs and human competitors in times it appeared that Fritz 8.0 was not playing with the a sufficient number of games to provide bounds on the use of an endgame database but Blondie25 was unable to program's rating that are in line with those offered by the convert the advantage of poor play and would

Observe that I2 is a superset of I1: it contains all closed itemsets which are under the CAM border \(as I1 plus those itemsets which arise in equivalence classes which are cut by the CAM border \(such as for instance ce and cde in Figure 3\(a Proposition 3 Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq ?

Using free sets interpretations I1 and I2 coincide when dealing with anti-monotone constraints because minimal elements are not cut o? by the constraint \(e.g. de in Fig. 3\(a constraints \(e.g. no free solution itemsets in Fig. 3\(b Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 4. Algorithms In this Section we study algorithms for the computation of MP5. We ?rst discuss separately how monotone and anti-monotone constraints can be pushed in the computation, then we show how they can be exploited together by introducing the CCIMiner algorithm 4.1. Pushing Monotone Constraints Pushing CAM constraints deep into the frequent itemset mining algorithm \(attacking the problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM  since they behave exactly as Cfreq . The case is di?erent for CM constraints, since they behave exactly the opposite of frequency. Indeed, CAM constraints can be used to e?ectively prune the search space to a small downward closed collection, while the upward closed collection of the search space satisfying the CM constraints cannot be exploited at the same time. This tradeo? holding on the search space of the computational problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CM extensively studied [18, 9, 4], but all these studies have failed to ?nd the real synergy of these two opposite types of constraints, until the recent proposal of ExAnte [6]. In that work it has been shown that a real synergy of the two opposites exists and can be exploited by reasoning on both the itemset search space and the transactions input database 


set search space and the transactions input database together According to this approach each transaction can be analyzed to understand whether it can support any solution itemset, and if it is not the case, it can be pruned In this way we prune the dataset, and we get the fruitful side e?ect to lower the support of many useless itemsets, that in this way will be pruned because of the frequency constraint, strongly reducing the search space. Such approach is performed with two successive reductions  reduction \(based on monotonicity reduction \(based on anti-monotonicity to  reduction we can delete transactions which do not satisfy CM , in fact no subset of such transactions satis?es CM and therefore such transactions cannot support any solution itemsets. After such reduction, a singleton item may happen to become infrequent in the pruned dataset, an thus it can be deleted by the ?reductions. Of course, these two step can be repeated until a ?xed point is reached, i.e. no more pruning is possible. This simple yet very e?ective idea has been generalized in an Apriori-like breadth-?rst computation in ExAMiner [5], and in a FP-growth [10] based depth-?rst computation in FP-Bonsai [7 Since in general depth-?rst approaches are much more e?cient when mining closed itemsets, and since FP-Bonsai has proven to be more e?cient than ExAMiner, we decide here to use a FP-growth based depth?rst strategy for the mining problem MP5. Thus we combine Closet [16], which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining closed frequent itemset, with FPBonsai, which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining frequent itemset with CM constraints 4.2. Pushing Anti-monotone Constraints Anti-monotone constraints CAM can be easily pushed in a Closet computation by using them in the exact same way as the frequency constraint, exploiting the downward closure property of antimonotone constraints. During the computation, as soon as a closed itemset X s.t  CAM \(X ered, we can prune X and all its supersets by halting the depth ?rst visit. But whenever, such closed itemset X s.t  CAM \(X e.g. bcd in Figure 3\(a some itemsets Y ? X belonging to the same equivalence class and satisfying the constraint may exist \(e.g bd and cd in Figure 3\(a ery such X in a separate list, named Edge, and after the mining we can reconstruct such itemsets Y by means of a simple top-down process, named Backward-Mining, described in Algorithm 1 Algorithm 1 Backward-Mining Input: Edge, C, CAM , CM C is the set of frequent closed itemsets CAM is the antimonotone constraint CM is a monotone constraint \(if present Output: MP5 1: MP5 = C split Edge by cardinality 2: k = 0 3: for all c ?

Closed Constrained Itemsets Miner The two techniques which have been discussed above are independent.

Experimental Results The aim of our experimentation is to measure performance bene?ts given by our framework, and to quantify the information gained w.r.t. the other lossy approaches 


approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
