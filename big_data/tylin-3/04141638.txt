No 174 2 instructional document read by the student automatically A Hypermedia Environment Users might read hypermedia from one page to another page through hyperlink via browsers arbitrarily   I t l e a d s d i s ta n c e learning on WWW to asynchronous mode Teachers will not be able to know whether students read these documents orderly or not 1  In th i s w a y  t each er s d o n o t k n o w w h a t each s t u d en t h a s learned and might not able to give student suitable help In addition students will not know how to deal with the difficulty either As we know that there are more and more teachers and researchers put their instructional matters on the Internet for students to read Although Internet has brought a lot of benefits some teaching materials on the Internet could still be seen as static because students only can follow the learning sequence made by teachers in advance Students can not learn more about what they are really interested in For example Ken wants to know more about the concept Object while he reads the Class section on the Sun Java Tutorial website http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/concepts/class.ht ml  Ken will never get what he wants because the tutorial website designers had never considered that the student might want to know the Object while he/she reads the teaching materials about Class when they built the Sun Java Tutorial website Therefore applying knowledge structure to modify hypermedia structure of instructional materials is necessary Because knowledge structure could help students to retrieve related information and understand learning status Here comes an important issue how to supervise a student's learning path in a non-monitored e-Learning environment We need to give the student a right and good instruction for the next document to read or says to retrieve Thus the student might study more easily and efficiently if we can design knowledge structure with several knowledge operations generate knowledge navigation rules and create reference links in a hypermedia document to other relevant documents automatically B Formal Concept Analysis Formal concept analysis is a mathematical theory based on ordered set and complete lattice And it is also a method mainly used for the data analysis 7  9   I n t he J a va l a ngua g e d o m a i n the most well-known concepts for instance are Object Class Method Inheritance and Variable For example there are six document structures as Table I lists At first sight we might not find out the relation of the concepts listed in Table I But we can create formal context from Table I based on FCA theory Table II shows a simple example formal context of Java course First we let the object set O is  s 1  s 2  s 3  s 4  s 5  s 6 and the attribute set A is{O,C,M,I,V Weknowthatthekeyword Object appears in the s 1  s 3  s 4 and s 5 We can use the formal context to represent the corresponding knowledge keywords with documents as Table II lists After the formal context has been created a special concept hierarchy likes Fig 1 can be draw out from the lattice produced by FCA Fig 1 points out that the concept Class is an upper bound of three concepts Variable Inheritance and Method In the other words concept Class is more representative than all those five concepts Furthermore Class will be the basis concept of the course Object Oriented Programming in Java C Rule Extraction We can take any structured documents in the hypermedia environment as transactions in commerce Moreover those keywords in the documents could be also seen as the frequent purchasing items of customers and the customers could be either documents or students in a hypermedia environment Association rule mining ARM is a well explored research area we will only introduce some basic and classic approaches for association rule mining The Apriori 8 a l g or it h m is th e most well-known association rule algorithm and is used in most commercial products Apriori is just a straightforward approach that requires many passes over the database generating many candidate itemsets and storing counts of each candidate while  Fi g 1 Thecorres p ondin g ke y word hierarch y of ontolo g ical conce p ts T ABLE II S IX DOCUMENTS OF J AVA COURSE AS A FORMAL CONTEXT  s 1 s 2 s 3 s 4 s 5 s 6 Ox xxx Cxxxxxx M x xxx Ix x xx Vxxxxx T ABLE I F IVE KEYWORDS IN SIX DOCUMENT STRUCTURES  s i Keywords in s i 1OCIV 2CMV 3OCIV 4OCMV 5OCMIV 6CMI 


No 174 3 most of them turn out to be non-frequent To show that how the rule extraction works consider the transaction set example given in Table III Based on these transactions and the minimum support threshold minsup  80 the frequent itemsets were generated in Table IV Take the frequent itemset BE for example since both BE and A appear in every transactions a rule     1.0 A BE    can be extracted Similarly because C and AC only appear in 80 transactions which means the other two rules     8  0 C BE   and     8  0 AC BE    are sustained III A C OMPLETE E XAMPLE A hypermedia instructional material is composed of a keyword set and several document structures The keyword set can be seen as the itemset in Apriori algorithm When we want to extract some confident association rules  we need to set minimum support and confidence thresholds first The confidence threshold helps us to reconstruct the original webpage to a really useful one In this Section a series of examples give us a view of what the hypermedia structure reconstruction flow is and how we plan to realize such system Nelson\(1995 suggested an idea about associating hypertext in a multiple and flexible way for any hypermedia[10  N et w o r k structure is one possible metaphor to represent the information of nodes and links in a hypermedia environment No matter a structured document is hypertext or not which can be transformed into the independent hierarchical no-flat structures is so-called the document structure  S  s i  The elements of the document structure include chapters sections paragraphs and sentences Example 1  Fig.2 shows an example of hypermedia environment Here the document structure s 1 e.g article has a header associated with the keyword k 1 and a paragraph S 11  The structure s 11 also has another header associated with the keyword k 2  one sentence  s 111  and one hyperlink to the document s 2  The sentence s 111 contains two keywords they are k 3 and k 4  The document s 2 contains another two keywords k 5 and k 6   In the most of e-Learning systems webpage designers often focus on the content such as pictures animation objects video games and online-test However they seldom pay an attention to consider the students possible traversal paths Different traversal paths may make students feel comfortable or confused especially when the instruction materials are designed for a hypermedia environment such like WWW The task of mining associations between keywords can be stated as follows Let K  k 1  k 2  k m  be a set of keywords and let S  s 1  s 2  s n  be a set of structure identifiers in hypermedia documents In typically speaking a hypermedia instructional material contains lots of document structures where each document structure contains a set of keywords Example 2 Consider the hypermedia instructional materials showninT ABLE I T ABLE I will be used as a running example in this section The keywords in the keyword set K={O,C,M,I,V are Object Class Method Inheritance Variable Moreover the document structure set is S  s 1  s 2  s 3  s 4  s 5  s 6  To simplify and make it more readable we use CMV to represent a keyword set C M V Similarly a document structure set 1 3 5 will also write as 135 for the same reason  The support of the keyword set is how many different document structures that a specific keyword appears on it A keyword set will be frequent if its support value is higher than the expected threshold A confident association rule is denoted as  m p n k k k k     2 1  which means that if all of the keywords k 1  k 2  k n can be found out in the specific document's structure then there should be a good chance to find the keyword k m out from the same document structure too The T ABLE IV A LL F REQUENT I TEMSETS WITH MINIMUM SUPPORT 80 Support Itemsets 100 5/5 A},{B E AB},{AE},{BE ABE 80 4/5 C AC},{BC},{CE ABC},{ACE},{BCE ABCE  T ABLE III S AMPLE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING ITEMS A B C D AND E Transaction Items t 1 ABDE t 2 ABECD t 3 ABEC t 4 BEBAC t 5 DABEC T ABLE V F REQUENT KEYWORD SETS IN THE STRUCTURED DOCUMENTS WITH MINSUP 50  F REQUENT KEYWORD SET MINSUP  50 S UPPORT C 100 V CV 83 O M I OC OV CM CI OCV 67 OI,MV,IV,OCI,OIV,CMV,CIV,OCIV 50 Fig 2 s 1 and s 2 are structured documents 


No 174 4 acceptance ratio probability for such kind of association rules is called the confidence of the rule In practical researchers only care those association rules with high confidence Example 3 One extracted rule for Java instructional materials on the Sun website is  e inheritanc supclass subclass    85  0   This rule means that the document structure in the instructional material mentions the subclass and superclass will also mentions the inheritance And this rule's confidence will be 0.85 85  As Apriori uses the frequent itemset to generate rules a frequent itemset is an itemset whose occurrence ratio is higher than the threshold An itemset can be seen as a keyword set  K i  in the instructional material Beside the itemset the transaction set in Apriori can be also represented as the document structure  s i  By using Apriori an association lattice of keywords based on Example 3 can be built more easily as Fig 3 shown In this case there are five keywords items O C M I V The edge in the lattice represents the relation between two keyword-sets itemsets The frequent itemset property in Apriori mentioned that any subset of an itemset must be frequent if the parent itemset is frequent Fig 4 shows the nonempty subsets of OCV are OC OV CV O C V Therefore according to the frequent itemset property if OCV is frequent then all of the subsets should be frequent too After an association lattice of keywords was constructed the next step is generating confident rules The step can be divided into three stages 1 To choose the frequent itemset with a minimal support threshold For example when the minimal support 50 C with support 100 V,CV with support 83 O OC OV OCV with support 67 2 To find out all the possible rules according to the example above CV O   V OC   OV C   C OV   OC V   O CV   3 To search the confident association rules with a minimal confidence threshold For example when the minconf equals to 100 CV O   0  1  V OC   0  1  C OV   0  1  By using the three stages above the association lattice of keywords can be retrieved automatically For example if a student wants to study about the topics   O C V  the relevant association lattice of keywords OCV can be discovered as showninFig.5 Example 4 When student reading a courseware of Java language  Taking the Sun's Java online lectures for example  http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/index.html this courseware was writing about the concepts of object-oriented programming In this document there is a statement A software object implements its behavior with methods  When a student read this statement he/she might not understand the meaning of the keyword  methods clearly Therefore the student will need more references for methods However unfortunately in the most of time the student will not find out It is because of the editors of instructional materials never think that will be a question mark in the students mind Therefore if the dependent documents that are associated with the keyword   Fig 6 Re-construct the original webpage and provide related Fig 5 Association lattice of keywords with a learning topic O,C,V Fi g  4 Subsets of OCV Fig 3 Association lattice of keywords{O C M I V based on Example 3 


No 174 5 methods could be retrieved automatically and the original document structure could be re-constructed to more suitable for learning and reading just like Fig 6 shows that will be perfect  IV H YPERMEDIA S TRUCTURE R ECONSTRUCTION F LOW The hypermedia structure reconstruction flow is divided into three phases In the first phase concept association analysis phase a concept association lattice is built based on the keywords and concept relations as Fig.7 shows the second phase rule extraction phase discovers association rules from the built concept association lattice as Fig 8 shows and students then could use the K-Navi toolbar to reconstruct the teaching materials according their requirements at the third phase structure reconstruction phase as Fig 9 shows After showing the overall picture of the hypermedia structure reconstruction flow we can reveal the detail operations for each phase Phase I is activated by students when they are starting to browse any learning website step I-1 The system first gathers all connected teaching materials and analyzes the keywords contained in each webpage with pre-defined keyword set step I-2 Teachers have to define related keyword set for what they plan to teach students in advance Then the system retrieves domain concepts from a concept database in order to discover the relations among the teaching materials step I-3 With the keyword analysis results and domain concepts the system can build a concept association lattice about the learning website which is visited by students step I-4 output of phase I Based on the data mining techniques the system can extract the concept association rules from the output of phase I the 012 012      012\012\015 012\015		\012\012                                                                  012\015\012 012\015 012\012       015		\012 012 015 015	\012\015 012 012  015  Fig 9 Reconstructing the hypermedia instructional materials by inserting relevant knowledge pieces hyperlinks automatically  012    015               015 015 012 012            012\012\015\015\012\015       015 015 012  Fig 7 Keyword analysis and association lattice generation  Fig 8 Association rules extraction 


No 174 6 concept association lattice step II-1 There might be many rules extracted by the system therefore teachers have to define two thresholds minimum support and minimum confidence to filter some rules out The selected association rules then will form a concept structure operation step II-2 output of phase II When the flow comes to the phase III our goal is almost achieved The system can reconstruct the hypermedia structure by inserting additional hyperlinks at appropriate position according to the concept structure operation the output of phase II step III-1 As the student studies a topic on the web step III-2 the K-Navi toolbar will reconstruct the requested webpage which allows the student searches relevant knowledge piece easily and quickly via those auto-generated hyperlinks V K-N AVI T OOLBAR For realizing the mechanism proposed in this paper an Internet-based online learning tool K-Navi Toolbar Knowledge Navigation Toolbar is implemented as shown in Fig 10 The K-Navi Toolbar is developed with Borland  C Builder 6.0 and the execution environment is built on the Intel  Pentium IV 1.5G MHz CPU  512MB RAM with Windows  XP Professional and Internet Explorer 6.0 The K-Navi Toolbar has four major functions as we can see in Fig 10 1 keywords markup  Markup button 2 association rule extraction  Rules Gen button 3 document reconstruction  K-Navi button and 4 visualized association lattice  FCA button We will talk about the details of each function with related snapshots as Fig 11 to Fig 15 show Fig 11 shows the experiment framework for a student when he/she reads a teaching material via a web browser After he/she clicks on the Keywords button a keyword edit window pops up,asFig.12shows When the student clicks on Markup button the system makes the keywords red and bold as Fig 13 shows This function can help students get a clear view for knowing which part is important within the teaching material The FCA button provides both students and teachers a visualized keyword association lattice On the right hand side of Figure 14 there is matrix form of keyword relations and possible association rules filtered out according to the support and confidence thresholds  Fig 13 Keyword markup Fig.11Readingcoursewareonthewebwith K-Navi Toolbar  Fig 12 System configuration Fig 10 Snap-shots of K-Navi Toolbar system 


No 174 7 The Rules Gen button allows students/or teachers to see the association rules and allows students/or teachers to manage the minimum support and confidence value in order to filter some non-important rules as Fig 15 shows Finally when students click on the K-Navi button some relevant knowledge pieces hyperlinks will be added automatically into the appropriate position of the document just as Fig 16 shows This paper applies the K-Navi toolbar to the online object-oriented Java language learning website Object Oriented Programming of Java language from the Sun tutorial website http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/index.html There are four keywords including Object Class Method and Inheritance within those teaching materials on the learning website The contents of the original document structures are shown in Table VI After parsing the document text the formal context table can be derived in Table VII After applying the minimal support threshold to the lattice some association rules can be retrieved within its confidence value as listed in T ABLE VIII  Fig 16 Additional relevant knowledge pieces hyperlinks Fig 14 Keyword Association Lattice Fig 15 Association rule extraction T ABLE VII Formal context from T ABLE V Object Class Method Inheritance s 1 11 0 1 s 2 01 1 0 s 3 11 0 1 s 4 11 1 0 s 5 11 1 1 s 6 01 1 1 T ABLE VI Contents of hypermedia materials with specific keywords s 1 Software objects are modeled after real-world objects in that they too have state and behavior A software object maintains its state in one or more variables Classes near the bottom of the hierarchy provide more specialized behavior A subclass derives from another class  For example a subclass cannot access a private member inherited from its superclass s 2 Class can also declare class methods Methods and variables are inherited down through the levels In general the farther down in the hierarchy a class appears the more specialized its behavior In addition to instance variables classes can define class variables s 3 Object oriented programming Subclasses can also override inherited methods and provide specialized implementations for those methods  You are not limited to just one layer of inheritance  The inheritance tree or class hierarchy can be as deep as needed A class variable contains information that is shared by all instances of the class  In such situations you can define a class variable that contains the number of gears All instances share this variable s 4 These objects are created when the user launches the application The applications main method creates an object to represent the entire application and that object creates others to represent the window label and custom component You can invoke a class method directly from the class  whereas you must invoke instance methods on a particular instance If one object changes the variable it changes for all other objects of that type s 5 Method A function defined in a class See also instance method class method Unless specified otherwise a method is not static Methods are inherited down through the levels s 6 Because the object that represents the spot on the screen is very simple lets look at its code The Spot class declares three instance variables size contains the spots radius x contains the spots current horizontal location and y contains the spots current vertical location It also declares two methods and a constructor  a subroutine used to initialize new objects created from the class The inheritance tree or class hierarchy can be as deep as needed 


No 174 8 There are three rules when the minimum support is set to 0.6 60 1\object  class 2\method  class 3   class Based on these three association rules when a student is reading s 4 its content is listed in Table IV the system can recommend the student to read another document in which the keyword class is included because there exist object and method in s 4  For example s 2 is a document that talks about the concept class VI C ONCLUSION A web-based instructional material analyzing and reconstructing system is built in this paper according to the unsupervised reconstruction mechanism By using keyword association lattice the relevant hyperlinks between learning resources can be inserted into the original static webpage automatically for individual student Moreover the most appropriate instructional materials webpages related to what students read can also be able to find out for making suggestions to students The K-Navi tool was really created to prove that the reconstruction mechanism is workable and reasonable association rules were also discovered It is worth to note that the experiment system is not only can be used for e-Learning system but also will be available for any kind of web-based browsing environment In the future we will explore the time performance of generating association rules when the concept association lattice is very large There are also other possible directions to extend this work 1 The keyword database may be able to construct automatically or semi-automatically thus students could read any on-line materials more conveniently 2 The mechanism of extracting association rules from a concept association lattice needs a pre-defined minimum support and confidence threshold We hope the system could find the most appropriate values for these two thresholds by itself 3 The concept association lattice and related association rules should be able to build and extract in real time without requiring students to click on any button to start the process R EFERENCES 1 C  S   B  F r e i t a g a n d P  B rs s l e r   M e t a m o de l i ng f o r W e b Ba s e d Teachware Management Proc Intl WWWCM99 Workshop on World-Wide Web and Conceptual Modeling pp.360  373 Paris France Nov 15-18 1999 2 G  A  N o v a k V i rt ua l C o u rs e w a r e f o r G e o s c i e n c e Educ a t i o n V i r t ua l Earthquake and Virtual Dating Computers  Geosciences Vol.25,No 4 pp 475-488 1999 3 J  P he l p s a nd R  R e y n o l ds  F o r m a t i ve Ev a l ua t i o n o f a W e b b a s e d Co u r s e in Meteorology Computers  Education  Vol 32 No 2 pp 181-193 1999 4 J  X  C he n  T h e C urr e nt T r e n d o f e L e a r n i n g M a r ke t i ng o n A m e r i c a n  Trans of I.T Application for Management Vol 24 No 3 pp.92-96 2001 5 M  R o s e nbe r g  E-Learning Strategies for Delivering Knowledge in the Digital Age  MacGraw-Hill Companies Inc 2001 6 P  C im ia n o  A  P iv k  L  Sc h m i d tT h iem e  a n d S St aab  L e a r n in g taxonomic relations from heterogeneous sources Proc of the ECAI 2004 Ontology Learning and Population Workshop 2004 7 P  C i m i a no  S  S t a a b  a nd J  T a ne   D e ri v i ng c o nc e p t h i e ra r c hi e s f r o m text by smooth formal concept analysis Proc of the GI Workshop LLWA pp 72-79 2003 8 R  A g r a w a l  H M a n n i l a R S r i k a n t H T o i v o n e n a n d A  I  V e r k a m o  Fast discovery of association rules In U M Fayyad G Piatetsky-Shapiro P Smyth and R Uthurusamy editors Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining chapter 12 pp 307-328 AAAI Press 1996 9 R  G od i n a n d R  M i s s a ou i   A n i n c re me n t a l c o n c e p t f orm a t i on a p p r oa c h for learning from databases Theoretical Computer Science Vol.133 pp.387-419 1994  T  Be rne r sL e e  W e a v i n g t he W e b T h e O ri g i na l D e s i g n a nd U l t i m a t e Destiny of the World Wide Web by Its Inventor New York HarperCollins Publishers Inc 1999  T  C h a n g   H i e N e t  A u se r c e nt e r e d a ppr o a c h f o r a ut o m a t i c l i n k generation Proc of the ACM Conference on Hypertext Hypertext'93 Seattle WA USA pages 145-158 November 1993 T ABLE VIII Association rules generated by K-Navi system Minimal Support Association Rule Support Confidence  method  class inheritance 0.33 0.5   object class 0.667 0.667   class method 0.667 0.667 0.3   class inheritance 0.667 0.667 object  class inheritance 0.5 0.75 method  class 0.667 1 inheritance  class 0.667 1 0.4   class 1 1 object  class inheritance 0.5 0.75 method  class 0.667 1 inheritance  class 0.667 1 0.5   class 1 1 object     class 0.667 1 method     class 0.667 1 0.6      class 1 1 0.7    class 1 1 0.8 null null null

Performance Evaluation The performance of QARMINT has been evaluated through both arti?cial data and real bench mark data Sets of arti?cial data have been generated under various conditions.

Simulations One has run simulations comparing the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm and the new algorithm here. A typical multisensor multitarget tracking environment is assumed in the simulations. According to article [1,3], One known that the performance of sequential MSJPDA is better than the performance of parallel MSJPDA. Therefore, the performance of parallel MSJPDA algorithm will not be compared here There are three sensors, which are fixed in three platforms. Regarding the 2nd sensor as fusion centre situation of the other sensors are: =?-500m?-500m 0m??N =?-500m? 500m?0m??The distance error of each sensor is: =300m, =200m, =100m?The bear error of each sensor is 0.03rad, =0.02rad, =0.01rad?The of sample is T=1s?The nonparametric model of clutter is used in the simulations, and expected number of false measurement is m=1.8 1 sN 3 s 1r 2 2r 3 3r 1 Simulations have been run for racking two targets. The true initialization state of the targets is X1?[-29500m,400m/s,34500m,-400m/s X ?[-26250m,296m/s,34500m,-400m/s]'? 2 The two targets will cross above 31seconds later. To evaluate tracking performance, 50 Monte Carlo runs were performed for three case of the target detection probability Pd=0.97 ? Pd=0.76 ? Pd=0.58. In every run, the total simulation time is 140 steps 


simulation time is 140 steps            Figure 1  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.97          Figure 2  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.97       Figure 3  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.76 567 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005         Figure 4  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.76         Figure 5  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.58          Figure 6  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.58  Table 1 The emanative times comparison for sequential MSJPDA and SD-CMSJPDA algorithm  Pd N A  0.97 0. 76 0.58 Sequential MSJPDA 2 11 17 SD-CMSJPDA 0 3 5 Pd denotes detection probability, N denotes emanative 


Pd denotes detection probability, N denotes emanative times, A denotes the kind of algorithm Table 1 shows the summation of emanative times for sequential MSJPDA and SD-CMSJPDA algorithm in 50 Monte Carlo simulations. From table 1 , it is shown that the stability of SD-CMSJPDA is better than that of sequential MSJPDA as the detection probability varied Figure 1,2 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0. 97, respectively; Figure 3,4 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0.76 respectively; Figure 3,4 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0.58, respectively. From the figures we can see that the average RMS position error is lower for the SD-CMS JPDA algorithm. We also see that the state estimation precision of sequential MSJPDA get worse as the detection probability decreases The reasons for these simulation results lies:1 state estimation precision will get worse when the detection probability decrease;2 algorithm is to process measurement from each sensor using single sensor JPDA algorithm sequentially. Therefore the estimation error from each sensor will be accumulated Moreover, the sequential MSJPDA algorithm can  t improve the joint detection probability of the multisensor system The estimation error of the SD- CMSJPDA  algorithm will not be accumulated for it processes the measurement from each sensor directly in the mean time .What  s more the new method can greatly improve the joint detection probability of the multisensor system. Therefore, the tracking performance of SD-CMSJPDA algorithm is better than that of sequential MSJPDA. Algorithm All of the simulations are run in the personal computer with a 2.0G CPU and a 256M memory. The average cost time per step is 0.0251 in the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm. And the average cost time per step is 0.0282 in the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm. According to the results we can see that there is few difference in real time between the new method and the sequential   MSJPDA when there is not so many sensors and targets 568 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005  5. Conclusion In order to solve the problem of multisensor multi target tracking, a new centralized multisensor  joint probabilistic data association  algorithm is proposed in this paper. The simulation results shows that the tracking performance of the new algorithm is better than that of the sequential MSJPDA algorithm The computational complexity of the new method will increase as the number of sensors and targets grow Therefore, how to improve the real time of SD- CMSJPDA algorithm will be pay attention References 1] He You, Wang Guohong, Lu Dajin, Peng Yingning Multisensor Information Fusion With Application[M Publishion House of Electronics Industry. 2000, Beijing.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
