interpreted as database tuples satisfying that X are likely to satisfy Y Association rules are widely used in marketing decision making and business management The most popular model for mining association rules from databases is a priori algorithm the support-confidence framework proposed by Agrawal et al 2 This model measures the uncertainty of an association rule with two factors support and confidence An association rule is expected to capture a certain type of dependence among items in a database Brin et al made the suggestion to measure the significance of association via the x2 chi-squared test for correlation used 
in classical statistics 3 There have been published numerous papers showing improvements on association rule mining 4]-[7 A method of association rule mining using Genetic Network Programming GNP has already been proposed 8][10 The algorithm using GNP could extract association rules whose consequent are not fixed The method calculates not only support and confidence of association rules but also x2 value using GNP GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques which uses the directed graph structures as genes 11 12 GNP is composed of two kinds of nodes judgement node and processing node Attributes in database correspond 
to judgement nodes in GNP Association rules Kaoru Shimada Kotaro

minimum threshold x2 value x2 value of each rule is measured by the feature of GNP's structure  Extracted rules are stored in a pool through generations GNP evolves in order to store new interesting rules in the pool not to obtain the individual with high fitness value The method cannot extract all the rules meeting the given definitions of importance but extracts important rules sufficiently enough for user's purpose  Extracted important association rules in a pool are reflected in genetic operators as acquired information Mutation changes the contents of the nodes using the knowledge of interesting rules acquired in the pool  The proposed method can easily extract positive 
and negative association rules just by defining the judgement nodes including negative attributes Rule based classification systems have been widely used in real world applications because of the easy interpretation of rules Classification rule mining aims to discover a small set of rules in the database that form an accurate classifier Liu et al have proposed a framework to integrate classification and association rule mining 13 When the consequent item in the rule is the classification class attribute they can be used for classification There have been proposed associative classifiers mining the training set as an a priori-like method or using FP-tree as association rule 
discovery algorithm 14 These methods generate the association rules in the supportconfidence framework A training data set often generates a huge set of rules So it is challenging to store retrieve prune and sort a large number of rules for classification efficiently In addition in most conventional associative classification methods the rule with the highest confidence is used for classification However such a classification may not always be the correct one because it is not easy to identify the most effective rule The association rule mining using GNP measures the significance of the association via the x2 test Users can 1-4244-0100-3/06/$20.00 C2006 IEEE 5338 


define conditions of important association rules Therefore all the extracted important rules can be used for classification directly In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for important class association rule mining using GNP The conventional algorithm using GNP could extract the important association rules in the case of free consequent However the proposed method extracts the class association rules whose consequent are restricted to the classification class attribute In addition we also propose methods for building a classifier using extracted important class association rules This paper is organized as follows In the next section the outline of GNP is reviewed briefly Some related concepts and definitions on association rules are presented in Section III In section IV a new algorithm capable of finding the important class association rules using GNP and the methods for building classifiers are described Performance results are presented in Section V and conclusions are given in Section VI II GENETIC NETWORK PROGRAMMING GNP In this section the outline of conventional GNP 11 12 is reviewed GNP is one of the evolutionary optimization techniques which uses the directed graph structures as solutions The basic structure of GNP is shown in Fig 1 GNP is composed of two kinds of nodes judgement node and processing node Judgement nodes correspond nearly to elementary functions of Genetic Programming GP Judgement nodes are the set of Ji J2  Jp which work as if-then type decision making functions On the other hand processing nodes are the set of P1 P2  Pq which work as some kind of action/processing functions The practical roles of these nodes are predefined and stored in the library by supervisors Once GNP is booted up firstly the execution starts from the start node secondly the next node to be executed is determined according to the connection from the current activated node The genotype expression of GNP node is shown in Fig 2 This describes the gene of node i then the set of these genes represents the genotype of GNP individuals NTi describes the node type NTi  0 when node i is start node NTi 1 when node i is judgement node and NTi  2 when node i is processing node IDi is an identification number for example NTi I and IDi 1 mean node i is JI Cil Ci2 denote the nodes which are connected from node i firstly secondly  and so on depending on the arguments of node i All individuals in a population have the same number of nodes The following genetic operators are used in conventional GNP Crossover operator affects two parent individuals All the connections or contents of the uniformly selected corresponding nodes in two parents are swapped each other by crossover rate P Mutation operator affects one individual All the connections of each node are changed randomly by mutation rate of P D Start Nodc 0  Judgement Node 0  Processing Node Fig 1 Basic structure of GNP INT I J i  C I    C   Fig 2 Gene structure of GNP node i III ASSOCIATION RULES AND CLASSIFICATION A Association Rules The following is a formal statement of the problem of mining association rules Let I i l i2,...,il be a set of literals called items or attributes Let G be a set of transactions where each transaction T is a set of items such that T C I Associated with each transaction is a unique identifier whose set is called TID We say that a transaction T contains X a set of some items in I if X C T An association rule is an implication of the form X 4 Y where X cI Y CI and XnY 0 X is called antecedent and Y is called consequent of the rule In general a set of items is called an itemset Each itemset has an associated measure of statistical significance called support If the fraction of transactions containing X in G equals t then we say that support\(X  t The rule X XY has a measure of its strength called confidence defined as the ratio of support X U Y support X An example is shown below using Table I Let item universe be I A=,A2,A3,A4,Z and transaction universe be TID  1,2,3,4 In order to extend our research not only to market basket problems but also to dense databases we indicate the items of the transaction by 1 or 0 as shown in Table I In Table I itemset Al A3 occurs in two transactions of 1 and 3 in TID So its frequency is 2 therefore its support that is support\(\(Al 1 A A3 1 becomes 0.5 Itemset A 1,A3,Z occurs in the transaction of 3 in TID Its frequency is 1 so its support i.e support\(\(AI  1 A A3  1 A Z 1 becomes 0.25 Therefore support\(\(AI l 1 A A3  1 X Z 1  0.25 and confidence\(\(AI  1 A A3  1 X Z 1  0.5 The a priori algorithm searches large frequent itemsets in databases 2 This algorithm finds all the rules meeting user-specified constraints such as minimum support or minimum confidence However this algorithm may suffer from large computational overheads when the number of frequent 5339

has been also a recent trend in applying the rule mining to dense databases such as census data analysis 3 where any or all of the following properties are found many frequently occurring items strong correlations between several items many items in each tuple 5 Calculation of x2 value of the rule X at Y is described as follows Let support\(X  x support\(Y  y support\(X U Y  z and the number of database tuples equal N If events X and Y are independent then support\(X U Y xy Table II is the contingency of X and Y the upper parts are the expectation values under the assumption of their independence and the lower parts are observational Now let E denote the value of the expectation under the assumption of independence and 0 the value of the observation Then the x2 statistic is defined as follows X2 x O E Al/Cells TABLE I AN EXAMPLE 1 1 1 0 1 4 0 0 1 1 TABLE II THE CONTINGFENCY OF X AND Y Y LaMy X Nxv N\(xxv Nz N\(x  Nx X N\(y-xy N\(l-x-y+xv N\(1-x N\(yz N\(1-x OF 0 TID A1

the 99 significance level we should reject the independence assumption B Classification Using Association Rules Building accurate and efficient classifiers is one of the essential subjects of data mining The main idea of the classification is to discover interesting patterns in training set of data to build a classifier model able to predict the unknown classification class attribute Association rules can be applied to classification when the consequent item in the rule is the classification class attribute Rule based classification usually involves two stages training and testing In the training stage an important rule set is generated for classification by training set of data Then in the testing stage obtained rule set is applied to test data without class information Then unknown classification class attributes in the test data set are predicted The proportion of predicting test data incorrectly is the error rate of classification Liu et al have proposed to integrate classification rule mining and association rule mining techniques 13 The algorithm is called CBA Classification Based on Associations The integration is done by focusing on mining a special subset of association rules whose consequent is restricted to the classification class attribute The rules are called class association rules CARs The associative classification framework consists of the following three steps  discretizing continuous attributes if any  generating all the class association rules CARs and  building a classifier based on the generated CARs They generate the complete set of CARs that satisfy the user-specified minimum support minsup and minimum confidence minconf constraints minsup has a strong effect on the quality of the classifier produced If minsup is set too high possible rules satisfying minsup but with high confidences will not be included and the CARs may fail to abstract the effective rules Thus the accuracy of the classifier suffers There are roughly two types of models for building classifiers based on association rules ordered rule based and unordered rule based CBA is the ordered rule based model Rules are organized in the descending accuracy order The first matching rule in the sequence makes the prediction When there is no matching rule the class of the class attribute is predicted on the default base On the other hand unordered rule based model is to compare the accuracy of all possible classes obtained from the multiple rules The class getting the highest accuracy is the prediction Antonie et al have proposed a new way to prune irrelevant classification rules using a correlation coefficient without jeopardizing the accuracy of the associative classifier model 15 They use the scoring scheme of confidence in the classification Although the confidence averaging seems to work well in many cases there are some examples where the classification is inaccurate while good rules exist IV CLASS ASSOCIATION RULE MINING USING GNP AND BUILDING A CLASSIFIER In this section a method of class association rule mining using GNP is proposed The extracted rules can be used for classification directly because they satisfy the conditions of importance given by users Extracted rules are stored in a pool all together through the generations GNP individuals evolve in order to store new interesting rules in a pool not to obtain the individual with high fitness value Therefore the method is fundamentally different from other evolutionary algorithms in its evolutionary way Let Ai be an attribute item in a database and its value be 1 or 0 and Z be the set of class labels The proposed 5340 y+z col Ny N v

in a population have the same number of nodes The connections of the nodes and the functions of the judgement nodes at an initial generation are determined randomly for each GNP individual GNP needs not include all the functions of judgement nodes and the number of each function is not fixed Fitness of GNP is defined by F  JIX2\(i  1O\(n\(i 1  anew\(i 6 iel The terms in 6 are as follows I set of suffixes of extracted important association rules satisfying 3 4 and 5 in a GNP individual X2\(i x2 value of rule i n\(i the number of attributes in the antecedent of rule i anew i additional constant defined by a<ne W  an rule i is new 0 rule i has been already extracted 72\(i n\(i and anew\(i are concerned with the importance complexity and novelty of rule i respectively We consider that the fitness represents the potential to extract new rules The rule changing an attribute to another one or the rule adding some attributes can be candidates of important rules We can obtain these rules effectively by GNP genetic operations because mutation and crossover will change the connections or contents of the nodes We use three kinds of genetic operators crossover mutation-I change the connection of nodes and mutation-2 change the function of judgement nodes At each generation individuals are replaced with new ones by a selection rule The individuals are ranked by their fitnesses and upper 1/3 individuals are selected After that they are reproduced three times for the next generation then three kinds of genetic operators are executed to them These operators are executed for the gene of judgement nodes of GNP All the connections of the processing nodes are changed randomly in order to extract rules efficiently The above number 1/3 is determined experimentally which is not so sensitive to the results We demonstrate the above more concretely using 120 individuals at each generation The individuals are ranked by fitness values after that the top 40 individuals are selected reproduced three times and the following genetic operators are executed to them Crossover crossover we used is the uniform crossover Judgement nodes are selected as the crossover nodes with the probability of PC Two parents exchange the gene of the corresponding crossover nodes 40 parent individuals for crossover operation are divided into 20 pairs of parents and new 40 offspring are produced Mutation-1 Mutation-i operator affects one individual The connection of the judgement nodes is changed randomly by mutation rate of Pm1 The 40 parent individuals for mutation1 reproduce new 40 offspring Mutation-2 Mutation-2 operator also affects one individual This operator changes the functions of the judgement nodes by a given mutation rate m2 New 40 offspring are reproduced from 40 parent individuals by mutation-2 If the probabilities of crossover and mutation are set at small values then the same rules as in the pool are extracted repeatedly and GNP tends to converge at an early stage These parameter values are chosen experimentally As one of the features of the proposed method we can select the new functions of the mutated judgement nodes using the frequency of attributes of the extracted rules in the pool When mutation-2 is carried out we can define the probability of selecting the attribute Aj for judgement nodes by the following PJ pg ng\(Aj  c 8 XkEK ng Ak  C where ng\(Aj is the frequency of the attribute Aj in the rules extracted in the latest g generations K is the set of suffixes of attributes c is a constant given by users If no rules are extracted in the latest g generations then Pg is equal to the inverse of the number of attributes We could use all the extracted rules in the pool however it has been found that using extracted rules in some of the latest generations is better than using all rules 10 C Building a Classifier This subsection presents the methods for building classifiers using class association rules extracted by GNP The extracted rules in the pool can be used for classification directly because they satisfy the conditions of importance The following two methods for building classifiers are proposed Input The associative classifier i.e a set of extracted rules by GNP A new data to be classified Output Class predicted by the classifier  Method 1 1 total\(C compute the total number of rules satisfying Z  C

Data Engineering K H Tung V EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We tested our methods on some datasets from UCI ML Repository 16 Class association rules with x2 test were extracted by GNP then built classifiers using extracted rules Descretization of continuous attributes is done using the Entropy method All the categorical attribute values are transformed to a set of attributes whose attribute value is 1 or 0 A 10-fold cross validation was performed on each dataset and results are given as the average of the errors over 10-fold cross validation We use 3  2  6.63  4 minsup  0.05 5 7 anew  150 and 1  n\(i  8 Class association rules are extracted for each class using each specific GNP The population size is 120 The number of processing nodes and judgement nodes in each GNP individual are 10 and 75 respectively The conditions of crossover and mutation are P,c 1/5 Pml  1/3 and Pm2 1/5 We used the probability P\260 of 8 i.e the inverse of the number of attributes for selecting the attributes of judgement nodes in mutation2 The condition of termination is 500 generations All algorithms were coded in C Experiments were done on a 1.50GHz Pentium M with 504MB RAM The results of classification using test data are shown in Table III cleveland and breast-w have 2 classes for prediction The transformed cleveland and breast-w dataset consist of 25 attributes 297 tuples and 18 attributes 683 tuples respectively allp,,I 0.8 and 0.9 in Table III denote the cases using all rules the rules satisfying confidence  0.8 and the rules satisfying confidence  0.9 in the pool respectively The results for CBA and C4.5 are taken from 13 The results show that the proposed method has comparable accuracy with conventional models It is found that using the condition of minimum confidence affects the accuracy of classification a bit Especially the error rate increases in cleveland by the increase of the threshold of confidence Medical dataset sometimes includes different characteristics individual by individual in data set so we can say that it is not good to use too strict rules for classification of medical data In this simulation minsup we used is 5 however minsup in conventional models such as CBA is 1  Therefore our method can avoid over fitting and can acquire the rules with high reliability for classification Table IV shows the error rates versus the number of used rules for classification Each extracted rules in the pool has an inherent numeric order by its appearance We examined 6 cases of using 10 30 100 300 1000 rules by numeric order and all the extracted rules for each class It is found that using 300 rules is almost equivalent to using all rules in the pool Table V shows averaged run-time versus the number of extracted rules in the pool This shows that the proposed method extracts the rules sufficiently enough for classification in a short time Table VI shows the error rates of using long rules whose antecedent contains 7 or 8 attributes A small number of rules in method 1 cannot predict the class accurately On the other hand method 2 is effective even in the case of a small number of rules Using a sufficient number of rules reduces the error rate in both methods In the proposed method all the extracted rules satisfy the conditions of importance and have the qualification for the classifier Therefore we need not store retrieve prune and sort a large number of rules for classification as conventional methods This is one of the features of our method The proposed method cannot extract all the rules meeting the given definition of importance but extracts important rules sufficiently enough for user's purpose in a short time As a result the proposed method suits the classification problems that need real-time processing In addition the method can be used for incomplete test dataset such as having missing data VI CONCLUSIONS In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for important class association rule mining using GNP Instead of generating a large number of candidate rules the method can obtain a sufficient number of important association rules for classification The method measures the significance of the association via the y2 test Therefore all the extracted important rules can be used for classification directly We have performed some experiments and estimated the performances of the method The results showed that the proposed method extracts the important class association rules effectively The proposed method suits class association rule mining in dense dataset and uses x2 value for importance so it could be applied to medical dataset We are currently studying the applications of our method to real world databases REFERENCES 1 R J Bayardo no.1 pp.43-56 no.1 pp.102111 2006 11 B vol.36 no 1 pp 179-193 rule

6. Conclusion In this paper a number of alternative rule ordering and case satisfaction strategies have been considered. Four established ordering strategies were examined. In addition the authors proposed a ?fth strategy, ACS, where more speci?c rules are given a higher precedence than less speci?c rules but using con?dence as the most signi?cant factor for tree pruning during the generation process The principal ?ndings of the evaluation are as follows 1 used in the experiments, \(2 mechanism works better than “best ” in all the data sets tested, \(3 that a relatively high con?dence threshold is used \(a threshold of % is suggested 4 olds \(% to a “best ?rst” case satisfaction produced good results References 1] Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. \(1994 for mining association rules.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
