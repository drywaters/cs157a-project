This paper proposes an IPA \(Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules the EC \(Electronic Commerce model takes both the traveling and purchasing behaviors of customers into consideration at the same time to overcome the disadvantages of the pure association rule mining and pure path traversal pattern mining.  The IPA model considers not only user traversal forward information but also backward information.

The experimental results show that the IPA model can correctly capture the user  s traversing and purchasing behaviors 1. Introduction In EC \(Electronic Commerce find the association rules between purchasing items [1 2, 3] is very important.  If we provider this kind of information to the web site manager, the performance of cross-selling should be improved.  However, the web site managers may also pay attention to the navigation behaviors of customers.  Association rule mining just purely considered the purchasing behaviors of customers.  It cannot fully satisfy the managers   requirements Path traversal pattern mining [4, 5, 6] is the technique that find most of the navigation behaviors of customers in the EC environment.  The web site designer can use this information to improve the web site design, and to increase the web site performance Besides, this information can also provide the navigation suggestions to customers.  However, the web site manager considers not only the pure navigation behaviors but also the purchasing behaviors of customers.  The path traversal pattern mining just purely considered purchasing behaviors of customers It cannot fully satisfy the managers  requirements To overcome the disadvantages of the pure association rule mining and pure path traversal pattern mining, [7] proposed a model that takes both the traveling patterns and purchasing behaviors of customers into consideration at the same time.  We use an example to explain their method.  Figure 1 is an example of web transaction of a customer.  It shows the customer traverses from A to B \(buys the item 1 to D.  Thereafter, the customer backs to C and then goes to E \(buys item 3, 4 back to C and buys the item 2 at that time Figure 1. Web transaction of a user 


Figure 1. Web transaction of a user First, [7] cuts each web transaction into several web transaction records.  Then, WTM/WTS algorithm is Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on e-Technology, e-Commerce and e-Service  EEE  04 0-7695-2073-1/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE used to discover the final results based on these web transaction records.  In [7], when the customer has the backward behavior, a web transaction record is generated.  Besides, if the last web page of a web transaction record does not purchase any items, it cannot be generated.  According to the Figure 1, three web transaction records are generated shown below Table 1. Web transaction records Path Purchases ABCE B{1}, C{2}, E{4}, E{3 ABFGH B{1}, H{6 ASJL S{7}, S{8}, L{9 Because web pages D and I do not purchase any items, the ABCD and ASI cannot be generated.  The reason for cutting each web transaction into web transaction records is that they think the backward movement is not meaningful.  Also, it can reduce the complexity of the algorithm.  However, in Figure 1, it is easy to see that the customer traverse to E and purchase items 3 and 4, and then back to C and purchase item 2 at that time.  From Table 1, the web transaction records show that the customer buys the item 2 at C and then buys items 3 and 4 at E Therefore, the order of traversing and purchasing is not correct after dividing In addition, they assume that the purchasing path is the shortest path from the root node to the purchasing node.  For instance, if the customer purchases at the L in Figure 1, they produce the purchasing path {A, S, L that is the shortest path form the root node to the purchasing node L.  Hence, if there is not only one path from root node to the purchasing node, this method cannot work.  Because the web site architecture is usually regarded as a graph in real world the purchasing path is not unique Consequently, their assumption is not reasonable For this reason, this paper proposes an IPA Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules Electronic Commerce also takes both the traveling and purchasing behaviors of customers into consideration at the same time to overcome the disadvantages of the pure association rule mining and pure path traversal pattern mining The IPA model considers not only user traversal forward information but also backward information Besides, web structure is also used in this paper to prune unnecessary candidates.  Especially, the IPA model allows the noise exist in web transactions.  The next section will describe our model in details 2. IPA \(Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules Before illustrating our model, we firstly describe the definitions about support and confidence.  The following shows an example of our mining results lt;ABCE: B{1} ? E{4}&gt This example explains that if the customers purchase item 1 at web page B, they usually buy item 4 at web page E and the traversal path is ABCE.  We define the support of &lt;ABCE: B{1},E{4}&gt; is X/N.  N denotes the number of total customers.  X denotes the number of total customers who visit ABCE sequentially and purchase item 1 at web page B then purchase item 4 at web page E.  We also define the support of &lt;ABC: B{1}&gt; is Y/N.  N is the same as 


support of &lt;ABC: B{1}&gt; is Y/N.  N is the same as above.  Y denotes the number of total customers who visit ABC sequentially and purchase item 1 at web page B.  Based on the definition of support, we can define the confidence of &lt;ABCE: B{1} ? E{4}&gt;.  It is shown below Y X      Confidence  gt;&lt gt;&lt  gt;=&gt;&lt The confidence explains that customers traverse ABC and purchase item 1 at web page B, and the probability of purchasing item 4 at web page E is X/Y Besides, a traversal sequence, e.g., ABC, is a set of web pages ordered by increasing traversal-time.  The support for a traversal sequence is the number of customers who visit this sequence sequentially.  If the support for a traversal sequence s satisfies the user-specified minimum support, then s is called a frequent traversal sequence.  The length of a traversal sequence is the number of web pages in the sequence A traversal sequence of length k is called a k-traversal sequence, and a frequent traversal sequence of length k is called a frequent k-traversal sequence.  Similarly, a purchase sequence is a set of web pages ordered by increasing traversal-time, and at least one of these web pages has purchasing behaviors.  The other definitions are the same as the traversal sequences Based on these definitions, the main procedure is listed below Phase Executing Step Phase 1 1. List all candidate 1-travelsal sequences and candidate 1-purchase sequences Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on e-Technology, e-Commerce and e-Service  EEE  04 0-7695-2073-1/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 2. Scan database and calculate the support of candidate sequences.  Find all frequent 1-traversal sequences and frequent 1-purchase sequences 3. Join the frequent 1-traversal sequences and frequent 1-purchase sequences to the same set, and then join any two sequences to form a new one which just has a direct link in the web site structure.  As a result, we can generate all candidate 2-traversal sequences and candidate 2-purchase sequences Phase K K&gt;=2 1. Scan database and calculate the supports of candidate K-traversal sequences and candidate K-purchase sequences separately.  Then, find all frequent Ktraversal sequences and frequent K-purchase sequences 2. Put frequent K-traversal sequences and frequent K-purchases sequences to the same set and then join any two sequences to form a new one which just has a direct link in the web site structure to generate all candidate \(K+1 K+1 any two different frequent K-sequences 1-k21 S,,S,Sr  and { }t,S,,S,S 1-k21  a 


1-k21 S,,S,Sr  and { }t,S,,S,S 1-k21  a K+1  will be generated 3. Execute steps 1 and 2 recursively, until no frequent sequences can be generated In order to clearly explain our model, the following shows an example.  The web site structure is shown in Figure 2 and the customer traversing and purchasing database is shown in Table 2.  The notation  represents that the customer purchases on that web page Figure2. Web site structure Suppose the minimum support is set to 2/6.  First we list all candidate 1-traversal sequences and candidate 1-purchase sequences \(Phase 1, Step 1 this example, all candidate 1-traversal sequences are A, B, C, D, E, F} and all candidate 1-purchse Table 2. Customer traversing and purchasing database ID Access Path Items Bought 1 BECAF  C F{1 2 DBAC  AE  C{2}, E{3 3 BDAE 4 BDECAF  C F{1 5 BAC  AE  C{2}, E{3 6 DAC  C{2 sequences are {C  E  F  Next, we scan database and calculate the supports of these sequences.  Then we find all frequent 1-traversal sequences and frequent 1-purchase sequences \(Phase 1, Step 2 the support count of C is 5.  In order to count C, we add up the original support count of C, i.e., 2, and support count of C  i.e., 3.  Because the supports of all candidates are greater than the minimum support, all frequent 1-traversal sequences are {A, B, C, D, E, F and all frequent 1-purchase sequences are {C  E  F   Then, we put these sequences to the same set, i.e A, B, C, D, E, F, C  E  F  and then join any two sequences to form a new one which just has a direct link in the web site structure \(Phase 1, Step 3 example, if we join frequent 1-traversal sequence {A and frequent 1-purchase sequence {C  then candidate 2-purchase sequence {AC  will be generated Because page A have a direct link to page C, we preserve this candidate 2-purchase sequence According to this way, we can generate all candidate 2-traversal sequences, i.e., {AC, AE, AF, BA, BD, BE CA, DA, DB, DE, EC, FC} and candidate 2-purchase sequences, i.e., {AC  AE  AF  BE  DE  EC  FC   C  A, E  C, E  C  F  C, F  C   Next, we scan database and calculate the supports of all candidate K-traversal sequences and candidate K-purchase sequences to find all frequent sequences Phase 2, Step 1 AC} is 5 and {AC  is 3.  Based on the minimum support, we can generate all frequent 2-traversal sequences, i.e., {AC, AE, AF, BA, BD, BE, CA, DA DE, EC, FC}, and frequent 2-purchase sequences, i.e AC  AE  AF, BE  C  A, F  C}.  All of these sequences have the direct link on the web site structure According to this way, we can generate all frequent sequences when k is equal to 5.  Suppose the minimum confidence is set to 1/2.  After finding all frequent sequences, the final mining results which integrate traversal patterns and purchasing behaviors are generated.  It is shown in Table 3 As shown in Table 3, we consider not only forward information but also backward information, e.g B D

E{3}&gt; 2/6 2/2 lt;AC: C{2}&gt; 3/6 3/6 allows the noise exist in the transactions.  For instance, &lt;BAE: E{3}&gt; is supported by customers 2 and 5, although BAE is not successive in the traversal paths of these two customers.  BAE is counted in the counting procedure because there is a direct link between pages B and A, and also pages A and E.  In other words, web pages between A and E can be seen as noises 3. Experimental results The following experiments use a real web transaction database for testing the execution performance of our model.  This real database is a networked database for renting DVD movies.  We collect the user traversing and purchasing behaviors from 02/18/2001 to 03/24/2001.  There are 428,596 records in this database.  We partition this database into seven testing subsets.  The first testing subset includes the data of the first day \(02/18/2001 second testing subset includes the data of the first two days \(02/18/2001~02/19/2001 these subsets, the experimental results for the execution performance of our IPA model are shown in Figure 3 0 50 100 150 200 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Testing Subset E xe cu tio n T im e s ec  Figure3.

But, it does not grow exponentially 4. Conclusions In this paper, we propose an IPA \(Integrating Path traversal patterns and Association rules

 For each  I i s i S i  P  chooses a random number r i  n where n is the total number of transactions We distinguish the following two cases 1 If u i  support  I i  D   r i  0  then chooses a random series of  u i transactions t j that do not contain the itemset I i  and modify these transactions to contain the itemset I i  2 If u i  support  I i  D   r i  0  then chooses a random series of u i transactions t j that contain the itemset I i  and modify these transactions in a random way so that they do not contain the itemset I i  After the above process the resulting transaction database contains no condential information specied in P and the database owner is ready to release it In the second scenario the database owner uses the following procedure to generate the synthetic transaction database 1 use a software package to mine the real-world transaction database to get a set of itemset support frequency constraints 2 release the support frequency constraints to the public 3 a customer who has interest in a synthetic transaction database generates a synthetic transaction database D from the published support frequency constraints using a software package based on our linear program methods In this scenario the mined support frequency constraints are released to the public directly Thus the database owner wants to make sure that no condential information specied in P is contained in these support frequency constraints Without loss of generality we assume that there is a single element  I,s,S  in P and the mined support constraints are S    I i s i  i  m   S contains the condential information  I,s,S  if and only if for each transaction database D which is consistent with S wehave support  I  D    s S   In another word S does not contain the condential information  I,s,S  if and only if there exists an integer s  with s  s or S<s  n such that S  I,s    is consistent That is there is a transaction database D that satises all support constraints in S  I,s     In the following we show that there is even no efcient way to approximat ely decide whether a given support constraint set contains condential information We rst dene the problem formally ApproPrivacy Instance Aninteger n  an item set I  a support constraint set S    I  1 s  1      I  m s  m   andaset P    I i s i S i  I i I i  l   Question  For all transaction database D of n transactions over I with  support  I  i  D   s  i   O  m  for all 0  i  m dowehave support  I i  D    s i S i  for all i  l If the answer is yes we write S  a P  By Theorem 2.3 we have the following result Similar NP hardness results for exact frequency constraints inference have been obtained in 2 3 7 Theorem 4.1 ApproPrivacy is co NP complete Proof S 012   a P if and only if there is a transaction database D andanindex j  l such that D satises S  I j  support  I j  D  s i   or D satises S   I j  support  I j  D  S i   approximately Thus the theorem follows from Theorem 2.3 Q.E.D Thus there is no efcient way for the database owner to decide whether a support constraint set S leaks condential information specied in P  In practice however we can use the linear program based approximation algorithms that we have discussed in Section 3 to compute the condence level about private information leakage as follows 1 Convert the condition S  I,s   s  s or S s   n  to an integer linear program in the format of 8 Note that the condition  s  s or S s   n  is equivalent to the existential clause  s   s  s  015  S<s   n   Thus it is straightforward to convert it to integer linear program conditions 2 Let the condence level be c   m i 1 z i  The smaller c  the higher condence In the ideal case of c 0  we have found an itemset transaction database D that witnesses that no condential information specied by  I,s,S  is leaked in S  If the database owner thinks that the condence value c   m i 1 z i obtained in the above procedure is too larger thus condence level is too low He may use the following procedure to delete potential condential information from the support constraint set 1 Let i be the number that maximizes max  I i s i  S  I  I i   2 Modify the value s i to be a random value 3 Approximately revise support constraint values in S to make it consistent For example to make it satisfy the monotonic rule Since it is NP hard to determine whether a support constraint set is consistent we can only revise the set S to be approximately consistent 7 Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE 


It should be noted that after the above process the resulting support constraint set may become inconsistent Thus in the next round the value c   m i 1 z i may be larger If that happens the larger value c does not interpret as the privacy condence level Instead it should be interpreted as an indicator for inconsistency of the support constraint set Thus the above privacy deletion procedure should only be carried out one time We should note that even if the condence level is higher that is c   m i 1 z i is small there is still possibility that the condential information specied by  I,s,S  is leaked in theory That is for each transaction database D that satises the constraints S wehave support  I D    s S   However no one may be able to recover this information since it is NP hard to infer this fact Support constraint inference has been extensively studied by Calders in 2 3 It would be interesting to consider conditional privacypreserving synthetic transaction database generations That is we say that no private information is leaked unless some hardness problems are solved efciently This is similar to the methodologies that are used in public key cryptography For example we believe that RSA encryption scheme is secure unless one can factorize large integers In our case we may assume that it is hard on average to efciently solve integer linear programs Based on this assumption we can say that unless integer linear programs could be solved efciently on average no privacy specied in P is leaked by S if the computed condence level c   m i 1 z i is small 5 Conclusions In this paper we discussed the general problems regarding privacy preserving synthetic transaction database generation for benchmark testing purpose In particular we showed that this problem is generally NP hard Approximation algorithms for both synthetic transaction database generation and privacy leakage condence level approximation have been proposed These approximation algorithms include solving a continuous variable linear program According to 6 l i n ear probl ems ha vi ng hundreds of t housands of continuous variables are regularly solved Thus if the support constraint set size is in the order of hundreds of thousands then these approximation algorithms are efcient on regular Pentium-based computers If more constraints are necessary then more powerful computers are needed to generate synthetic transaction databases References 1 R  A g r a w al T  Imilien sk i an d A  S w a mi Min in g association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proc of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Database  pages 207216 1993  T  C a lders  Axiomatization and Deduction Rules for the Frequency of Itemsets  PhD Thesis Universiteit Antwerpen 2003  T  C a l ders  C omput at i onal compl e x i t y of i t e ms et frequency satisability In Proc 23rd ACM PODS 04  pages 143154 ACM Press 2004  R  F agi n J  Hal pern and N Me gi ddo A l ogi c f or reasoning about probabilities Information and Computation  87 1,2\78128 1990  G Geor gak opoul os  D  K a v v a di as  a nd C  P a padi mitriou Probabilistic satisability J of Complexity  4 111 1988  Li near P r ogrammi ng F r equent l y As k e d Q ues t i ons  http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/otc Guide/faq/linear-programming-faq html  T  M ielik  ainen On inverse frequent set mining In Proc of 2nd Workshop on Privacy Preserving Data Mining PPDM  pages 1823 IEEE Computer Society 2003  C  P o t t s  A nal ys i s of a l i n ear programmi ng heuri s t i c for scheduling unrelated parallel machines Discrete Appl Math 10 155164 1985 9 G  R amesh  W  Man iatty  a n d M Zak i Feasib le itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proc 22nd ACM PODS  pages 284295 2003  Y  W a ng X W u  a nd Y  Zheng P r i v ac y p res ervi ng data generation for database application performance testing In Proc 1st Int Conf on Trust and Privacy in Digital Business TrustBus 04 together with DEXA  LNCS 3184 pages 142-151 2004 Springer-Verlag  X W u  Y  W u Y  W a ng and Y  Li P ri v a c y a w are mar ket basket data set generation a feasible approach for inverse frequent set mining In Proc 5th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining  April 2005  Z Zheng R  K oha vi  a nd L Mas on R eal w o rl d performance of association rule algorithms In Proc of the ACM-SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  pages 401 406 ACM Press 2001 8 Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
