The implicit meanings of knowledge can be repressed by different knowledge representations. A concept hierarchy is a concise and general form of knowledge representation. Hierarchical concept description can organize relationships of data and express knowledge embedded in databases explicitly. In this paper, we propose a new scheme based on rough sets to cluster and refine the concept hierarchy automatically for a given data set with nominal attributes. The proposed scheme consists of two algorithms: the concept clustering algorithm and the concept refinement algorithm. The experimental results show that the concept hierarchy mined by the proposed scheme contains meaningful concept in comparison with the previous approaches The analyses of the algorithms also show that the proposed scheme is efficient and scaleable for large databases. It is also able to be extended to mining meaningful rules from databases I. INTRODUCTION Knowledge discovery in databases \(KDD important research topics in both areas of machine leaming and databases. The objective of KDD is to extract knowledge automatically from huge amounts of data. The knowledge mined from large practical databases can be applied to many applications. For different applications, the different types of knowledge lead to various methodologies in the development of data mining techniques. For example, classification leaming algorithms for decision trees construction [ 151, the Apriori algorithm for mining association rules [ 11, and unsupervised learning algorithms for generating clusters [9 Regardless of the mining approaches involved, we can imagine the various types of discovered knowledge as the concept in the database based on different viewpoints For representing concepts explicitly, a meaningful and clear concept description is required. Concept hierarchies are a concise and general form of concept description widely used. Many knowledge representations are variants of concept hierarchy in different presentations. For transaction databases, as an example, association rules are the set of rules describing the relative relationships in a partial ordering hierarchy of large item sets. Decision tree is another type of concept hierarchy used for generating classification rules and classifying the categories of data. The other type of concept hierarchy, like clusters, is a one-level concept grouping data with high similarity into classes Animal Level0 Fig. 1. An animal world of concept hierarchy ANY Level 0 \(Ho Fig. 2. The hierarchical concept model A concept hierarchy defines a sequence of mappings from a set of low-level concepts to higher-level, more general concepts on one or a set of attribute domains. Such mappings may organize the set of concept in partial order according to a general-to-specific ordering and form a tree-like structure The most general concept can be a universal concept whereas the most specific concepts correspond to the specific values of attributes in the database, as Fig. 1. Each node in a concept hierarchy represents a concept which helps to express knowledge and data relationships in a database as a concise, high level term [4j. Formally, we define a hierarchy H on a set of domains D1, . . ., Dk, we have Hl : {Dl x . . . x Dk a H,.l . . . = HO , where H, denotes the set of concept at the primitive level, H,-l denotes the set of concept at one level higher than those at HI, and Ho represents the most 


level higher than those at HI, and Ho represents the most general concept on the top level denoted as  ANY  as Fig. 2 It is reasonable that various concept hierarchies can be constructed fiom the same attributes based on different users   viewpoints or preferences. For constructing concept hierarchies, many methods for numerical or categorical data have been developed. We summarize the related methods 0-7803-8353-2/04/$20.00 0 2004 IEEE 1343 FUZZ-IEEE 2004 into three kinds in the following. The first kind of methods is to specify concept hierarchies by users, experts or data analysts according to a partial or total ordering of attributes explicitly at the schema level. A user or expert can easily define a concept hierarchy by semantics of schema or hisher need. Another kind of methods is that given a set of attributes the system then tries to generate the partial ordering of attributes automatically so as to construct a meaningful concept hierarchy. Some related researches on generating hierarchies in a single numerical attribute [4] and finding the partial ordering in a set of categorical attributes [8] have been proposed. The third kind of methods is to define a portion of a concept hierarchy by clustering explicit data in databases Most of methods of this kind focus on automatic generation of concept by grouping data using clustering techniques Without knowledge of data semantics, a concept hierarchy will be generated from the distinct values of attributes at the lowest level of hierarchy; then the more general concept are generated in higher levels. The related researches include Cluster/;! by Michalski and Stepp [ 111, COBWEB by Fisher 3], parallel clustering by Hong and Mao [7], generality based clustering by Talavera and Bejar [16], etc. It is still a interesting and important problem for finding complete a hierarchical structure from a large database efficiently and meaninally The purpose of this paper is to automatically construct a meaningful concept hierarchy in databases. We introduce rough entropy based on rough sets to measure the generality of concept described by the subset of attributes in a database We had proved that the values of rough entropy for a set of attributes are increasing monotonously while the attributes are removed one by one from the set of attributes. This property accords with the fact that concept in higher level of hierarchy is more general than concept in lower level. Based on proposed rough entropy, we give a concept clustering algorithm to generate main concept levels and group the most relevant concepts into one. For producing more detailed hierarchy structures, the concept refinement algorithm is designed. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, some experiments and comparisons with the other researches are made. The results show that the proposed method is efficient and the mined concept levels contain meaningful concept knowledge The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces rough sets theory and rough entropy. In Section 3, we presented the two proposed algorithms based on rough entropy for generating and refining the concept hierarchy from categorical databases. In Section 4, we describe the experimental results. Conclusions and future work are made in Section 5 been broadly and successfully applied to knowledge discovery. The theory provides a powerful foundation to reveal and discover important structures in data and to classify complex objects. An attribute-oriented rough set technique can reduce the computational complexity of learning processes and eliminate the unimportant or irrelevant attributes so that the knowledge can be learned from large databases efficiently In an information system, if some categories of objects cannot be distinguished by the available attributes and may be just able to be defined roughly or approximately, the rough set theory is suitable to deals with such information 


rough set theory is suitable to deals with such information system. The idea of rough sets is based on establishment of equivalence classes on the given data set U and supports two approximations called lower approximation and upper approximation. The lower approximation of a concept X contains the equivalence classes that are certain to belong to X without ambiguity. The upper approximation of a concept X contains the equivalence classes that cannot be described as not belonging to X. Let S = \(U, A system where U means a non-empty finite set of objects with a non-empty finite set of attributes A .  For all a d  and each B d ,  we define a binary indiscernible relation &amp;\(B following Definition 1: Let x, Y E U ,  we say that objects x and y are indiscemible if the equivalence relation &amp;\(B the set U RA x,y  U, v  a a  a\(x Definition 2: Let apr = \(U, RA The object neU belongs to one and only one equivalence class. Let [x]B denote an equivalence class of R A denote the set of all equivalence classes [x]B for X E U .  We have I B  = b I &amp;\(B  Definition 3: Let S = \(U, A entropy of information based on a subset of attributes B is where l[xi]BI denotes the cardinality of the equivalence class of [&amp;]B and n is the number of objects in U Theorem 1: Let S = \(U, A  E A .  If [xj]B c [x~]B   then E\(B B   Corollary 1: Let S = \(U, A  d. If B  E B, then E\(B B   11. ROUGH ENTROPY Theorem 1 states that the rough entropy of equivalence classes decreases monotonously when the granularity of information becomes smaller through finer partitions. Hence The rough set theory was first proposed by Zhislaw Pawlak in 1982 [121[141. Rough set is used to deal with the identification of common attributes in data sets [13]. It has 1344 25-29 July, 2004 Budapest, Hungary the concept is more general while the value of rough entropy is larger as Corollary 1 states 111. THE ALGORITHMS A. Notations The symbols used in our proposed algorithms are defined in the following U : A database with categorical attributes n : The number of objects in U A : The finite set of categorical attributes in U m : The number of attributes in A aJ : The j-th attribute of A,  aJ E A, 15 j &lt;  m amp;]B : The equivalence class of x, satisfying RA\(B I[x,]Bl : The cardinality of [&amp;]B, x, E U v], : The partition of RA\(@ on U, [U], = { [ x , ] B  1 x, E U C, : The k-th concept We define the reduced set of attributes in the following Assume that B = {al,  a2, . . . , a,} is a set of attributes. Let BJ be a reduced set with m' attributes of B, m' &lt; m. BJ = {bl b2, . . . , b,,} is a subset of B, where b,, bJ E B and b, f bJ for l&lt;i,j&lt; m'. Let Pn,,\(B sets with m' attributes of B. Thus, the number of attributes in B, is lBJ1 = m' and IP,,\(B 2 B. The Concept Clustering and Refinement Algorithms After the definitions, we describe the algorithms for clustering hierarchical concept with respect to a given database Algorithm: The hierarchical concept clustering Input: A database U with the set of attributes A Output: A concept hierarchy H for S = \(U, A Step 1: Initialize the values of m' = m, k = 1 and B = A Step 2: Generate the concepts Ck of lowest level with the

Assume that the time complexity of partitioning U set of attributes A .  That is, H, = [UA IBI - 1 and find f B two sub-steps all concept levels H = {Ho, . . . , H,n is T\(n m P,t\(B mT\(n values of rough entropy E\(BJ for all Bi E P Step 5, the time for generating a single concept level is less than n. Finally, the number of attributes is decreased when a new concept level is generated. The overall time complexity is O\(m2\(T\(n obviously bounded by the sorting problem. Hence, the time complexity of the algorithm is no more than O\(m2nlogn give an example to help readers to understand the above algorithm TABLE I THE EXAMPLE DATA SET Example 1: TABLE I shows a database containing eight objects U = {xl, x2, x3, x4, xs, X6, x7, x8} and five attributes A gender, income, insurance, status, car}.  The symbolic categories in the five attributes, respectively, are: gender male \(m b g h low \( I y n divorce, yet} and car: {yes, no}. The hierarchical result of clustering is shown in Fig. 3. The steps are executed as follows Input: The dataset as TABLE I shows Output: The concept hierarchy H Step 1: Initialize the values of m' = m = 5, k = 1 and B = A Step 2: Generate the concepts of lowest level H, with the set gender, income, insure, status, car of attributes A HS = [V!A = [Uligender, income, innire. slatus. car cl, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, cl, c8 A  71x21A, [x31A,[x4lA ,[xSIA 9 b 6 i A 9  b 7 1 A  9 [%]A Step 3: We set m' = JBJ - 1 = 4.

The result of clustering algorithm for TABLE I Algorithm: The concept refinement algorithm Input: A concept hierarchy H for S = \(U, A Output: A refined concept hierarchy P for S = \(U, A Step 1 : Let j = 1, B, be the reduced set of attribute used in H and Ck is the top concept in Ho. We set k = k + 1 Step 2: For all the reduced sets of attributes Bef,\(B z B,, repeat Step 3 to Step 5 to refine the concept level H Step 3: Find the partition of [U], = { [xIB 1 x E U Step 4: If there is [x]~ existing objects that belong to distinct concepts in H,, go to Step 5 ;  otherwise, go to Step 2 Step 5: Generate the new concept CL in concept level of H CL = [XIB.  The [ x ] B  is the equivalence class satisfying the condition in Step 4 Step 6: If j &lt; m, j = j + 1, go to Step 2 for refining the higher concept level; otherwise, the algorithm is halt Example 2: We continue to explain the concept refinement algorithm following the result of Example 1. The result of refinement is shown in Fig. 4. The steps are explained as the following example Input: A concept hierarchy H in Fig. 3 Output: A refined concept hierarchy P for S = \(U,  A Step 1: j = 1, k = 16 and BI  = \(income}, HI  = \(C14, C ~ Z Step 2: P,\(B B2 B2 and B # B1 = \(income}; that is B = \(car} ,  execute Step 3 to Step 5 to refine the concept level HI Step 3: Find partition [Ul{car, = \(C7uC12, C13 Step4:Because there is an object x7 in C7 belonging to distinct concepts C14 and C12 in HI at the same time the next step goes to Step 5 Step 5 :  Generate the new concept CI6 in concept level of Hl c,, = c7vc,2 Step 6:j=1 &lt; m = 5 , j  = j  + 1 = 2, the algorithm repeats Step 2 for refining the hgher concept level H, untilj = 5 It is easily to know that the time complexity of the concept refinement algorithm is still the same to the concept clustering algorithm. While the detailed concept we need is only the part of whole hierarchy, our scheme can help to find the useful concept levels without wasting time to generate all detailed concept hierarchy x i  xi x5 x; x, x3 x4 x Fig. 4. The result after refinement algorithm for TABLE I 1v. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, we make some experiments and comparisons using several test data sets. The experiments are done by using Pentium I11 800MHz CPU with 128MI3 RAM. Test datasets are selected from UCI Machine Learning Repository [2] summarized in TABLE 11 1346 25-29 July, 2004 Budapest, Hungary TABLE 11 SUMMARY OF SELECTED DATASETS TABLE 111 PREDICTIVE ACCURACIES AND EXAMINED NODES Attributes Instances Classes BCW 9 683 2 CLEVE 13 296 2 CRX 15 653 2 GLASS 9 2 14 7 HORSE 12 326 2 PIMA 8 768 2

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the concept level, we perform learning and prediction processes The decision attribute is used only at prediction, but hidden during the learning process. After the leaming process, we use the following measurement function and a threshold a to label the concept in the concept hierarchy to predict the test data. The function is where X denotes the concept of decision attribute, B is the reduced set of attributes at that concept level. We select the nodes with p  x shows predictive accuracies and number of nodes examined in prediction for original hierarchy and refined hierarchy The experiments are done with IO-fold cross validation Considering the best accuracies on each dataset among the methods, the method with refinement is better than without refinement. We compare the results of the generated concept hierarchy with refinement with GCF [16] and COBWEB [3 methods. TABLE 1V shows the comparison including the average accuracy and number of nodes examined to make the predictions with the standard deviations. The average number of nodes examined can be viewed as a measure of the complexity of the hierarchy. Results show that none of the systems is the best for every domain, thus suggesting that each one may be better suited for a particular type of problem Considering only the best accuracies for three systems on each data set, our algorithm needs to examine fewer nodes on average to attain the same accuracy or the better accuracy COBWEB uses an objective function that implicitly weights features and it is intended to produce predictive clusters GCF model uses similarity metrics which are sensitive to the choice of features and may need some information about feature weights to be more robust. This may the reason for COBWEB performing much better than GCF and our approach in some domains. Experimental results confirm that our system traverses fewer nodes than previous work for making good prediction in average V.

The concept hierarchy is an explicit representation of knowledge and can be widely used in many applications. In this paper, we present a new scheme for generating concept hierarchies based on rough set and rough entropy. The scheme contains the concept clustering algorithm and the concept refinement algorithm. We can fast construct a meaningful concept hierarchy by the concept clustering algorithm first, and then refine the concept level by the concept refinement algorithm as users  needed. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is efficient and the generated concept hierarchy is effective. In 1347 FUZZ-IEEE 2004 the future, we are going to extend the research to cope with the data with missing values ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This work was supported in part by the National Science Council of Taiwan, R.O.C. under grant no.

Transactions do not record the order of the individual changes involved Hence our evaluation cannot take the order into account the changes were madeand treats all changes equal In practice we expect specic orderings of changes to be more frequent than others which may affect results for navigation and prevention We have made no attempt to assess the quality of transactions ROSE learned from past transactions regardless of whether they may be desired or not Consequently the rules learned and evaluated may reect good practices as well as bad practices However we believe that competent programmers make more good transactions than bad transactions and thus there is more good than bad to learn from history We have examined the predictive power of ROSE and assumed that suggesting a change narrowed down to a single le or even a single entity would be useful However it may well be that missing related changes could be detected during compilation or tests in which case ROSE s suggestions would not harm or may be known by trained programmers anyway who may nd ROSE s suggestions correct but distracting Eventually usefulness for the programmer can only be determined by studies with real users which we intend to accomplish in the future 7 Related Work Independently from us Annie Ying developed an approach that also uses association rule mining on CVS version archives 25 She es pecially e v aluated the us efulnes s o f the results considering a recommendation most valuable or surprising if it could not be determined by program analysis and found several such recommendations in the MOZILLA and ECLIPSE projects In contrast to ROSE  though Yings tool can only suggest les not ner-grained entities and does not support mining-on-the-y Change data has been used by various researchers for quantitative analyses Word frequency analysis and keyword classication of log messages can identify the purpose of changes and relate it to change size and time between changes 18 V a ri ous res earchers comput ed met ri cs on t h e module or le level 3 9 11 12 or ort hogonal t o t hes e per feature 19 and in v e s tigated the change of thes e m etrics over time i.e

these rules are re-\e relationships like method invocation inheritance instantiation or overriding Both papers lack an evaluation of the quality of the patterns found However Michail mines a single version while ROSE uses the changes between different versions To guide programmers a number of tools have exploited textual similarity of log messages 5 o r program code 2  HIPIKAT 6 i mpro v e s o n t his by taking als o other s ources like mail archives and online documentation into account In contrast to ROSE  all these tools focus on high recall rather than on high precision and on relationships between les or classes rather than between ne-grained entities 8 Conclusion and Consequences ROSE can be a helpful tool in suggesting further changes to be made and in warning about missing changes But the more there is to learn fro m history the more and better suggestions can be made  For stable systems like GCC  ROSE gives many and precise suggestions 44 of related les and 28 of related entities can be predicted with a precision of about 40 for each single suggestion and a likelihood of over 90 for the three topmost suggestions  For rapidly evolving systems like KOFFICE or JEDIT  ROSE s most useful suggestions are at the le level Overall this is not surprising as ROSE would have to predict new functions which is probably out of reach for any approach  In about 47 of all erroneous transactions ROSE correctly detects the missing change If such a warning occurs it should be taken seriously as only 2 of all transactions cause false alarms What have we learned from history and what are our suggestions Here are our plans for future work Taxonomies Every change in a method implies a change in the enclosing class which again implies changes in the enclosing les or packages We want to exploit such taxonomies to identify patterns such as this change implies a change in this package rather than in this method that may be less precise in the location but provide higher condence Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Software Engineering \(ICSE04 0270-5257/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 


Sequence rules Right now we are only relating changes that occur in the same transaction In the future we also want to detect rules across multiple transactions The system is always tested before being released as indicated by appropriate changes Further data sources Archived changes contain more than just author date and location One could scan log messages including the one of the change to be committed to determine the concern the change is more likely to be related to say Fix vs New feature Program analysis Another yet unused data source is program analysis although our approach can detect coupling between items that are not even programs knowing about the semantics of programs could help separating related changes into likely and non-likely Furthermore coupling that can be found via analysis 25 need not be repeated in ROSE s suggestions Rule presentation The rules as detected by ROSE describe the factual software processwhich may or may not be the intended process Consequently these rules can and should be made explicit In previous work 27  w e u sed visual mining t o d etect re gularities and irregularities of logically coupled items Such visualizations could further explain the recommendations to programmers and managers We are currently making ROSE available as a plug-in for ECLIPSE  For information on download and installation see

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
