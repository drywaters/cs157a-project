However, it is difficult and time consuming to create the concept map of a course. Thus, how to automatically create a concept map of a course becomes an interesting issue. In this paper we propose a Two-Phase Concept Map Construction \(TPCMC map by learners  historical testing records. Phase 1 is used to preprocess the testing records. We apply Fuzzy Set Theory to transform the numeric testing records of learners into symbolic, apply Education Theory \(Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing apply Data Mining approach to find its grade fuzzy association rules. Then, in Phase 2, based upon our observation in real learning situation, we use multiple rule types to further analyze the mined rules and then propose a heuristic algorithm to automatically construct the concept map. Finally, the Redundancy and Circularity of the concept map constructed are also evaluated Keywords: Adaptive Learning Environment, Concept Map, Data Mining, Testing Records 1. Introduction With vigorous development of the Internet, e-learning system has become more and more popular. Therefore, in the last five years, many adaptive learning and testing systems [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9] have been proposed to offer learners customized courses in accordance with their aptitudes and learning results. For achieving the adaptive learning, in many Computer-Assisted Instructional \(CAI environments [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9], a predefined concept map of a course, which provides teachers for further analyzing and refining the teaching strategies, is often used to generate adaptive learning guidance. However, it is difficult and time consuming to create the concept map of a course. Thus, how to automatically create a correct concept map of a course becomes an interesting issue Therefore, in this paper, we propose a Two-Phase Concept Map Construction \(TP-CMC automatically construct a concept map of a course by historical testing records. In the first phase, we apply Fuzzy Set Theory to transform the numeric testing records of learners into symbolic, apply Education Theory to further refine it, and apply Data Mining approach to find its grade fuzzy association rules. In the second phase based upon our observation in real learning situation, we use multiple rule types to further analyze the mined rules and then propose a heuristic algorithm to automatically construct the concept map according to analysis results which can be used to develop adaptive learning system and refine the learning strategies of learners 2. Related Work In 1984, Novak [7] proposed Concept Map to 


In 1984, Novak [7] proposed Concept Map to represent the knowledge as a network consisting of nodes as concepts and links as the relations among concepts Concept Map can be used to demonstrate how the learning status of a concept can possibly be influenced by learning status of other concepts and give learners adaptive learning guidance Thus, Appleby [1] proposed an approach to create the potential links among skills in mathematics domain. The direction of a link is determined by a combination ofthe relative difficulty of skillsand the relative values of crossfrequencies. For example, f BA represents the amount of learners with wrong answers of skill A and right answers of skill B. If BABA ff  an easier skill A could be linked to a harder skill B, but backward link is not permitted Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies \(ICALT  04 0-7695-2181-9/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE Hsu [6] also proposed a conceptual map-based notation, called Concept Effect Relationships \(CER model the learning effect relationships among concepts In brief, for two concepts, Ci and Cj, if Ci is the prerequisite for efficiently learning the more complex and higher level concept Cj, then a CER Ci  Cj exists. Later based upon statistical prediction and approach of Hsu [6 a CER Builder was proposed by Hwang [5]. Firstly, CER Builder finds the test item that most students failed to answer correctly and then collects the other test items failed to answer by the same students. Thus, CER Builder can use the information to determine the relationships among the test items. Though the CER Builder is easy to understand, only using single rule type is not enough to analyze the prerequisite relationship among concepts of test items, which may decrease the quality of concept map Tsai [9] proposed a Two-Phase Fuzzy Mining and Learning Algorithm. In the first phase, Look Ahead Fuzzy Mining Association Rule Algorithm \(LFMAlg was proposed to find the embedded association rules from the historical learning records of students. In the second phase, the AQR algorithm is applied to find the misconcept map indicating the missing concepts during students learning. The obtained misconcept map as recommendation can be fed back to teachers for remedy learning of students. However, it is not a complete concept map of a course, only represents the missing learning concepts, its usefulness and flexibility are decreased 3. Two Phase Concept Map Construction TP-CMC In TP-CMC, the Test item-Concept Mapping Table records the related learning concepts of each test item. As shown in Table 1, five quizzes contain these related learning concepts A, B, C, D and E, where  1  indicates the quiz contains this concept, and  0  indicates not Moreover, a concept set of quiz i is denoted as CSQi, e.g CSQ5={B, D, E}. The main idea of our approach is to extract the prerequisite relationships among concepts of test items and construct the concept map. Based upon assumptions, for each record of learners, each test item has a grade Table 1: Test Item  Concept Mapping Table As shown in Figure 1, our Concept Map Construction includes two phases: Grade Fuzzy Association Rule Mining Process Phase and Concept Map Constructing Process Phase. The first phase applies fuzzy theory Grade Fuzzification Anomaly Diagnosis fuzzy grade association rule types, L-L, L-H, H-H, H-L 


fuzzy grade association rule types, L-L, L-H, H-H, H-L among test items. The second phase further analyzes the mined rules based upon our observation in real learning situation. Even based upon our assumptions, constructing a correct concept map is still a hard issue. Accordingly we propose a heuristic algorithm which can help construct the concept map Figure 1: The Flowchart of Two Phase Concept Map Construction \(TP-CMC 4. Grade Fuzzy Association Rule Mining Process In [9], the Look Ahead Fuzzy Association Rule Miming Algorithm \(LFMAlg associated relationship information embedded in the testing records of learners. In this phase, we propose an anomaly diagnosis process to improve LFMAlg and reduce the input data before the mining process 4.1 Grade Fuzzification For objective judgment of learner's performance, we apply fuzzy concept to transform numeric grade data into symbolic, called Grade Fuzzification. Three membership functions of each quiz  s grade are shown in Figure 2. In the fuzzification result  Low    Mid  and  High   denotes  Low Grade    Middle Grade  and  High Grade   respectively. Qi.L, Qi.M, and Qi.H denotes the value of LOW, MIDDLE, and HIGH fuzzy function for the quiz i          0.7 Figure 2: The Given Membership Functions Example 1:In Figure 3, assume there are 10 testing records with 5 quizzes of learners and the highest grade on each quiz is 20 Historical Testing Records Database Grade Fuzzification Anomaly Diagnosis Fuzzy Data Mining L-L Rule Type L-H Rule Type H-L Rule Type H-H Rule Type Educational Experts Phase 1 Grade Association Rule Mining Process Mined Association Rules Concept Map Constructor Phase 2 Concept Map Constructing Process Test Item-Concept Mapping Database Concept Map Dicussion A C B E D Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies \(ICALT  04 0-7695-2181-9/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE Fuzzification Figure 3: The Fuzzification of Learners  Testing Records 4.2 Anomaly Diagnosis Based upon Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing of 


Based upon Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing of Educational Theory [8], the discrimination of item can tell us how good a test item is. If the discrimination of the test item is too low \(most students get high score or low score contribution to construct the concept map. For refining the input testing data, we propose the anomaly diagnosis called Fuzzy Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing \(FIANR shown in Figure 4. A test item will be deleted if it has low discrimination Algorithm: Fuzzy Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing \(FIA-NR Symbol Definition RiH /RiL:The sum of the fuzzy grades on test item i of each student in the high\(H L group.\( H=1, M = 0.5, L=0 NiH /NiL:The number of learners in high/low group PiH &amp; PiL:The ratios of RiH to NiH and of RiL to NiL , respectively Input : Fuzzified testing records of learners Output : The Difficulty index \(Pi Di Step1: Sort Scores in descending order and divide it into High, Middle, and Low groups each has 1/3 learners Step2: Let N R P iH H iH i  and N R P iL iL iL   Step3: Compute 2 1 PP P iLiH i   and ,PPD iLiHi for i=1  k Step 4: Delete the test items with low Discrimination \(&lt;0.5 Figure 4: Fuzzy Item Analysis for NormReferencing \(FIA-NR Example 2:Table 2 shows the fuzzified testing grades of learners on Q4 sorted in the descending order of each learner's total score in the test sheet Table 2: Sorted Fuzzified Testing Grade on Q4 Table 3: Difficulty and Discrimination Degree of Each Quiz As shown in Table 3, by applying FIA-NR algorithm, since Discrimination D4 of Q4 is 0.33 learners  grade on Q4 will be deleted. Accordingly, the test sheet can be redesigned 4.3 Fuzzy Data Mining After filtering out these useless quizzes, we can apply Look Ahead Fuzzy Association Rule Mining Algorithm 9] to find the fuzzy association rules of test items. The mining process is shown in Example 3 Example 3:For the data shown in Examples 1 and 2 Figure 5 shows the process of finding the association rules with large 2 itemset by LFMAlg algorithm

Qi.L notation denotes that the ith question \(Q L degree, e.g., Q2.L?Q3.L means that learners get low grade on Q2 implies that they may also get low grade on Q3. The confidence is used to indicate the important degree of a mined association rule. For example, the confidence of rule Q2.L? Q3.L can be obtained as follows 95.0      2 32 32   LQsuuport LQLQsuuport ConfidenceLQLQ 5. Concept Map Constructing Process Before constructing the concept map, we can get the prerequisite relationship among concept sets of quizzes from analyzing four association rule types, L-L, L-H, HL, and H-H, based upon our observation obtained by interviewing the educational experts, in real learning situation. Therefore, we can conclude the Heuristic 1 given two quizzes Q1 and Q2, if concepts of Q1 are the Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies \(ICALT  04 0-7695-2181-9/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE prerequisite of concepts of Q2, Learner gets low grade on Q1 implies that s/he may also get low grade on Q2 or Learner gets high grade on Q2 implies that her/his grade on Q1 is high As shown in Table 5, for each rule type, we use Heuristic 1 to get its prerequisite relationships among concept sets of quizzes with parameterized possibility weight, which are used to construct the concept map Symbol Definition QiCS : indicate concept set of quiz i WRi : indicate the possibility of the possible scenario of the rule Table 5: Prerequisite Relationship of Association Rule In this paper, association rules generated from Large 2 Itemset are firstly used to analyze the prerequisite relationships between learning concepts of quizzes. Based on the prerequisite relationships of concept sets and the Test item-Concept Mapping Table, we propose a Concept Map Constructing \(CMC corresponding learning concepts of concept sets to construct the concept map. Therefore, by looking up Table 5, we can obtain the prerequisite relationships of concept sets of quizzes with the possibility weight \(Wi for each mined rule in Table 4. The possibility Wi is a heuristic parameter of CMC algorithm and it can be modified according to different domains and learners   background. Moreover, the related explanations of the analysis in Table 5 are shown in Table 6. Table 7 shows 


analysis in Table 5 are shown in Table 6. Table 7 shows the result of transforming association rules in Table 4 by analyzing the prerequisite relationships in Table 5 Table 6: The Explanations of Rule Types Table 7: Result by Analyzing the Prerequisite Relationships in Table 5 In Figure 6, the mined rules, Q1.L  Q2.H and Q1.H  Q2.L, can be transformed into corresponding prerequisite relationships of concept sets, resulting in a cycle between concept sets, called circularity. That is concepts of Q1 and concepts of Q2 are prerequisite of each other, which is a conflict in our analysis. Therefore, we have to detect whether a cycle exists or not, e.g CSQ1  CSQ2  CSQ1 Q 1 L  Q 2 H Association Rules Q 2 H Q 1 L Q 1.H  Q2 .L Q2.L Q 1.H 0 .9 1 ,0 .8 CS Q 2 C S Q 1 T ra nsfor ming C or resp on di ng C S Q2 C SQ 1 Cycle appeared P rerequ isite R ela tion sh ip of Con cept S et 0 .8 ,1 .0 C o nf 1 W 1  Merging Figure 6: The Transforming of Association Rules Because each concept set may contain one or more learning concepts, we further define a principle of joining two concept sets and then generate corresponding concept-pair, \(Ci, Cj n a    a n d  CSQ2 1 j b     t h e  s e t  o f  c o n c e p t p a i r  i s  C S Q 1  J O I N  C S Q 2  1 ji a     w h e r e  j i  b a     a n d  m n k   For example, if CSQ1={a1,a2} and CSQ2 = {b1,b2}, CSQ1 JOIN CSQ2 a1,b1 a1,b2 a2,b1 related definition used in creating the concept map is given as follows Concept Map CM = \(V, E z V = {Ci | denotes the learning concept, each node is unique in CM z E jiCC  | i ? j, denotes that Ci is the prerequisite of Cj The jiCC has a Influence Weight kIW , denotes the degree of relationship between learning concepts. The formulation of kIW is = k kk1-k    1?k n, where n is the amount of jiCC  


 For the CMC algorithm shown in Figure 7, the main purpose of Cycle Detection Process is to detect the unreasonable prerequisite relationship as a cycle among concept sets. The Influence Weight kIW denotes the degree how the learning status of concept Ci influences Cj. Therefore, the number of jiCC  will enhance the value of Influence Weight. In the formulation of influence Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies \(ICALT  04 0-7695-2181-9/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE weight, the Wi denotes the possibility of the learning scenario of the association rule in our analysis. Thus, the educational experts can assign different value of Wi to the algorithm according to different domains and learner  s backgrounds Figure 7: Concept Map Constructing \(CMC For the association rules given in Table 7, the process of CMC algorithm is shown in Figure 8. In Figure 8.b, the edges drawn as dash line have the lowest confidences in cycles will be deleted in Cycle Detection Process Moreover, Table 8 shows the example of computing the Influence Weight of Concept-Pair \(B, D Because the Concept-Pair \(B, D CSQ5 and CSQ1, we have to compute the Influence Weight twice Figure 8: The Process of CMC Table 8: The Result of Computing the Influence Weight of Concept-Pair \(B, D 7. Conclusion In this paper, we propose a Two-Phase Concept Map Construction \(TP-CMC construct a concept map. In Phase 1, we apply Fuzzy Set Theory to transform the numeric testing records into symbolic, apply Education Theory to further refine it, and apply Data Mining to find its grade fuzzy association rules. In Phase 2, based upon our observation in real learning situation, we use multiple rule types to further analyze the mined association rules and then propose a heuristic algorithm to automatically construct the concept map without Redundancy and Circularity. Moreover, we also evaluate the constructed concept map, that is, NonRedundancy: the anomaly diagnosis can filter many useless test items with low discrimination for refining the input data and Non-Circularity: the cycle detection process can delete these cycles, which make the concept map un-ambiguous.  In the near future, we will analyze the effect of rules with large-3 itemset for improving the concept map and do some experiments based upon real learning testing records 8. References 1] J.

can test whether the hyperlinks on a page have been placed appropriately by analyzing significant navigational patterns \(association rules In our experiments the percentage of hyperlinks confirmed by rules was calculated by dividing the number of common items in hyperlink sets and whole ranking lists for a given page, by the number of hyperlinks on the page separately for direct, indirect and complex rules \(Fig. 8 Note that the number of hyperlinks was put in the denominator as opposed to calculations in section 7.4 where it was ranking length 48 89%87 0 20 40 60 80 100 direct indirect complex Figure 8. The average percentage of all hyperlinks confirmed by rules Proceedings of the 2005 5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and  Applications \(ISDA  05 0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE The average percentage of hyperlinks confirmed by direct rules amounted to only 48%, probably because there were too few of them. Indirect and complex rules, on the other hand, confirmed many more hyperlinks  87% and 89%, respectively, due to their larger quantity. These relatively great values that we received may have resulted from the enormous differences between the average number of hyperlinks on a page  10 and the average ranking length: 51, 177, 180 for direct, indirect and complex rules respectively. Concluding, indirect and complex rules appear to be better at assessing the usefulness of hyperlinks compared to direct rules Note that in any case at least 11% of hyperlinks were not confirmed by any rule, so they may be recommended to be removed from the content of pages 8. Conclusions and future work Complex rules combining both direct and indirect rules usually increase the length of rankings compared to those based on direct associations. This helps overcome the problem of a multitude of pages with too short rankings Fig. 5 quested ranking length \(Fig. 6 rules substantially change the order of ranking lists \(Fig. 2 and 3 greater extent only confirm hyperlinks existing on web pages compared to lists extracted from complex rules, for short and long ranking lengths \(Fig. 7 of rules, especially indirect and complex ones, can be useful for the assessment of hyperlinks Concluding, far more diverse indirect rules can significantly improve potential value of recommendation. Nevertheless, to confirm the usefulness of indirect rules for end users, some tedious tests with their participation are required Acknowledgements The authors are indebted to thank Marcin Pilarczyk for providing cleansed data about hyperlinks on WUT pages 9.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
