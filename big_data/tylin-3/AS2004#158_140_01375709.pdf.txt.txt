Osaka 599-853 1, Japan E-mail: hisaoi@;ie.osakafu-u.zic.jp Abstract: We examine the performance of compact fuzzy rule based classification systems that consist of a small number of simple fuzzy rules with high comprehensibility. Those fuzzy systems are designed in a heuristic manner using rule selection criteria. In this paper, we first describe fuzzy rule-based classification. Next we describe heuristic rule selection criteria using the terminology in data mining: cnnfinence and sripport A small number of fuzzy rules are extracted from numerical data based on each rule selection criterim. Then we examine the classification performance of extracted fuzzy rules through computational experiments on a number of benchmark data sets from the UCI MC Repository. Our results should be viewed as the lowest benchmark performance of fuzzy rule based classification systems because fuzzy rules are extracted using a simple heuristic method with no optimization or tuning procedures. Nevertheless our results on some data sets are comparable to reported results by the C4.5 algorithm in the literature I. INTRODUCTION In the design of fuzzy rule-based systems, accuracy maximization has been mainly discussed in the literature. In the area of filzzy classification [l], various approaches have been proposed for iinproving the acciuacy of fuzzy rule based classification systems by tuning fuzzy rules. Those approaches are often based on fuzzy-neuro learning [2]-[3 and evolutionary optimization [4]. Some of recent studies on the design of fuzzy rule-based systems emphasize the importance of comprehensibility of fuuy  rules as well as their accuracy [5]-[8]. That is, the comprehensibility accuracy tradeoff has bcen discussed \(see [9]-[ 1 11 for various issues on the comprehensibility-accuracy tradeoff In this paper, we examine thc classification perfonnancr of compact fuzzy rule-based systems that consist of a small Takashi Yamamoto Department of Industrial Engineering Osaka Prefecture University Sakai, Osaka 599-853 1, Japan E-mail: yama@ie.osakafu-u.zic.jp number of simple fuzzy rules with high comprehensibility Those fiizzy systems are designed in a heuristic manner using rule selection criteria.

The classification performance of extracted fuzzy rules is evaluated using the ten-fold cross-validation \( 1 0-CV heuristic rule selection criteria are examined in this paper This paper is organized as follows. In Section 11, we describe fuzzy rule-based classification. In Section 111, we explain heuristic rule selection criteria using the terminology in data mining: coq/Xence and suppurt. In Section IV, we examine the performance of f u y  rules extracted from numerical data using each rule selection criterion. Our results are compared with reported results [12]-[13] by the C4.5 algorithm [ 141. Finally Section V concludes this paper 11. FUZZY RULE BASED CLASSIFICATION We use fuzzy rules of the following type for an n 


We use fuzzy rules of the following type for an n dimensional pattem classification problem [ 151 Rule R, : If xI is Aql and ... and x,, is Ay then Class C, with CF,, \(1 where x = \(,XI ,..., x n Ay, is an antecedent fuzzy set \(i.e., linguistic value such as small and large class. and CFq is a rule weight \(i.e., certainty grade fuzzy rule R,  in \( I rule  LAq  =$ Class C  where A, = \(A , ] ,  ..., A y l r First we explain how the consequent class Cc, of the 0-7803-8353-2104/$20.00  2004 IEEE 161 FUZZ-IEEE 2004 fuzzy rule R, in \(1 assume that we have n2 labeled patterns x p  = \(xpl  ,..., xpU,n p = 1,2, ..., m from Mclasses \(i.e., we have an n-dimensional M-class problem training pattern x p  with the antecedent part A, of the fiiu;y rule R, using the product operator as pAQ Xp l p2 X p n 2 where p,4 antecedent fuzzy set AYj .

HEURISTIC RULE EXTRACTION Let us assume that we have K antecedent fuzzy sets for each attribute. In this case. the number of combinations of the antecedent fuzzy sets is K" for n-dimensional problems For two-dimensional problems \(i.e., n = 2 


For two-dimensional problems \(i.e., n = 2 all the K 2  combinations for generating fuzzy rules Generated f w  rules have high comprehensibility. The comprehensibility of furzy rules, however, is degraded when they are applied to high-dimensional problems due to the following two difficulties. One is the exponential increase in the number of fuzzy rules. It is a troublesome task for human users to manually examine thousands of fuzzy rules. The other is the increase in the number of antecedent conditions It is not easy for human users to intuitively understand fuzzy rules with tens of antecedent conditions Our idea for avoiding these two difficulties is to choose only a small number of short fuzzy rules. The number of antecedent conditions in each fuuy  nile is referred to as the rule length. For generating short fuzzy rules, we use don 't care as an additional antecedent fuzzy set. Thus the number of combinations of antecedent fuzzy sets is \( K  i I task is to find a small number of short fuzzy rules with high classification accuracy from such a huge number of possible combinations of antecedent fuzzy sets. In this section, we show several heuristic rule selection criteria We extract a pre-specified number of fuzzy rules for each class in a simple greedy manner. That is, the best L fuzzy rules with respect to a heuristic rule selection criterion are extracted for each class. In our former work [8] .  we examined three rule evaluation criteria: the confidence, the support. and their product. In the same manner as the confidence of the fuzzy association rule "A', z Class h " in 4 where M is the number of given training pattems. In this paper, we examine two composite criteria of the confidence and the support in addition to their product. One is the 162 25-29 July, 2004 Budapest, Hungary support criterion with the minimum confidence level where the rule selection is performed using the support criterion from fuzzy rules whose confidence values satisfy a pre specified minimum level. The other is the confidence criterion with the minimum support level We also examine two heuristic rule selection criteria used in iterative f u ~ z y  GBML algorithms 1201-[23 Gomalez &amp; Perez [20] proposed an iterative algorithm called SLAVE where a single fuzy  rule was extracted in its single iteration. The SLAVE algorithm was modified in [22 by including a tiebreak mechanism that favors more general rules. While a somewhat complicated general formulation was shown in 1201, [22] ,  the rule selection criterion used in their computational experiments can be written as n+\(R R R R positive and negative examples, respectively. We use the following fuzzified version of this criterion F A y \( x y x p x, &amp;lass Cq x p  crClnss c 10 Since the rule selection is not an  ected by the linear transformation of the rule selection criterion \(i.e., since the same fuzzy nile is chosen after the linear transformation rewrite \(10  fsLAVE\(R4 A, Class Cy A, 3 Class C 1 1 where I h = l h#Cq s\(A,, 3 Class Cy A, 3 class h 12 On the other hand, the following criterion was used in h e  iterative fuzzy GBML algorithm in Castro et al. [23 where I Class C, I and /Class cl are the number of training patterns in Class Cy and the other classes respectively. We use the following fuzzified version of \(13 IClass Cy I 


IClass Cy I 4 This criterion can be rewritten by removing the constant terms in the numerator and the denominator as c ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ \( R A, 3 Class Cy It should be noted that we can remove [Class C, I and 1 Class a from the denominator of \(14 consequent class Cy is pre-speciiied in our heuristic rule extraction \(i.e., because the best L fuzzy rules are extracted lor each class For some rule selection criteria, the selection of the best L fuzzy rules for each class can be efiiciently performed using the well-known Apriori algorithm [24] in the field of data mining. For example, when A, cB, holds for antecedent fuzzy sets, the follou ing relation holds for fuzzy association rules in the case of the support criterion s\(A, 3 Class Cy B, 3 Class Cy 16 where the inclusion relation for the fuzzy vectors A, and B, is defined by their elements as A, c B, e Aqi c B,, for Vi The inequality in \(16 does not increase when we add an additional condition to its antecedent part. For example, the inequality condition in 16 small, small, don  t cave B, = \(small, don  f care, don  t care fuzzy rule  B, 3 Class Cy  is not high, we do not have to examine m y  fizzy rule  A, 3 Class C  satisfying the inclusion relation A, cB, . Thus we can efficiently perform the fuzzy rule extraction using the support criterion This search technique can be also utilized for the product criterion, the SLAVE criterion, and the Castro criterion using the following relations c\(R Rq A, 9 Class Cy fsLAL~u\(R A, 3 Class Cy 18 19 jkastm\(R Ay Clas  C 20 class C, 1 m On the other hand, the confidence has no monotonicity similar to \(16 new condition is added to the antecedent part \(i.e., as the rule length increases needs the restriction on the rule length 1V. COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS We examined the performance of each rule selection criterion through computational experiments on benchmark data sets with many continuous attributes in the UCI ML 163 FUZZ-IEEE 2004 Repository. Table 1 summarizes data sets used in this paper Some data sets in Table 1 have missing values. We did not use incomplete patterns with missing values. Data sets with missing values are marked by "*" in the third column of Table 1 where inconiplete patterns with missing values are not included in the number of patterns. All attribute values were linearly transformed in real numbers in the unit interval 0, 11 before the heuristic rule extraction was performed TABLE 1 DATA FETS USED IN OUR COtv4PUTATIONAL EXPFRIMF~NTS Data set Attributes Pattems Classes Brcast W 9 683* 2 Diabetes 8 768 &amp;. 7 Glass 9 214 6 Heart C 13 297* 5 Hepatitis 19 80* 2 Iris 4 150 3 Liver 6 345 - 7 Page blocks 10 5.473 5 Segnentation 18 2,310 7 Sonar 60 208 2

In our computational experiments, we simultaneously used four fuzzy partitions in Fig. 1 for all attributes because we did not know an appropriate granularity of the fuzzy partition for each attribute. In addition to the 14 fuzzy sets in Fig. 1, we also used don 't care as an additional antecedent f u z y  set. Thus the total number of possible combinations of the antecedent fuzzy sets is 15" for an n-dimensional problem 0.0 ""Dooa. 0.0 1 .o ~~~ 0.0 1 .o Fig. I .  Four fuzzy partitions used in our computational cxperimcnts Our task is to find a small number of comprehensible fuzzy rules with high classification performance. In our computational experiments on the 60-dimensional sonar data we only examined fuzzy rules with two or less antecedent conditions. For the other data sets, we examined fuzzy rules with three or less antecedent conditions. The restriction on the number of antecedent conditions is for finding short fhzzy rules as well as for decreasing CPU time We extracted L fuzzy rules \( L  = 1,2, ...I for each class using one of the above-mentioned seven rule selection criteria \(the confidence, the support. their product, the confidence with the minimum support level, the support with the minimum confidence level, the SLAVE criterion, and the Castro criterion support and confidence levels were examined. The heuristic rule extraction was performed for each class in a simple greedy manner. That is, the best L fuzzy rules were found for each class. There were many cases where multiple fuzzy rules had the same best value of a rule selection criterion. In those cases, the tiebreak was performed using the following two-step procedure. The first tiebreak criterion was the number of antecedent conditions. The fuzzy rule with the least antecedent conditions was chosen. This tiebreak criterion is to favor shorter fuzzy rules. When a single fuzzy rule could not be chosen by the first tiebreak criterion, we used the total area of the antecedent fuzzy sets of each fuzzy rule as the second tiebreak criterion. The total area was calculated by sitnply summing up the area of the triangular membership function of each antecedent f k z y  set in each fuzzy rule. The fuzzy rule with the largest total area was chosen. The second tiebreak criterion is to favor more general fuzzy rules that cover larger subspaces of the pattern space. When multiple fuzzy rules still had the same best evaluation with respect to all the three criteria \(i.e., the primary rule selection criterion and the two tiebreak criteria a single rule was randomly selected among those best rules For evaluating the classification performance on test data we used the ten-fold cross-validation \(1 0-CV Since the classification rate estimated by the IO-CV technique usually depends on the data partition into ten subsets, we executed the whole IO-CV procedure ten times using different data partitions \(i.e., IO x 10-CV classification rates on test data are summarized in Table 2 where ten fuzzy rules were extracted for each class In Table 2, we also cited some reported results of the C4.5 algorithm 1141 in the literature. Quinlan [12] proposed a modified version \(R.8 in Table 2 R.7 in Table 2 attributes. He evaluated the performance of each version by ten iterations of the whole 10-CV procedure. Elomaa &amp Rousu [13] proposed an optimal discretization method of continuous attributes into multiple intervals. They examined the performance of six variants of the C4.5 algorithm, which 164 25-29 July. 2004 Budapest, Hungary 9.2 51.5 57.1 43.5 42.6 42.4 72.6 73.9 70.4 74.8 73.6 71.6 74.4 64.2

Due to the page limitation, we show a part of our experimental results. From the comparison between Table 2 and Table 3, we can see that our experimental results by a single rule for each class are still comparble to the C4.5 algorithm for some data sets \(i.e., Breast W, Diabetes, Heart C, Hepatics, Iris and Sonar is interesting to observe that the classification perkormance did not always monotonically increase with the number of fizzy rules e.g., see Breast W suggests that OUT experimental results may be improved by searching for good cornbinations of f i q  rules extracted by our heuristic procedure V. CONCLUDING REMARKS We examined the classification performance of a sinall number of simple fuzzy rules that were extracted from numerical data in a greedy manner based on heuristic rule selection criteria We did not intend to propose a new approach to the design of fiizzy nile-based classification systems. Our intention was to provide the lowest benchmark performance \(i.e.. lower bound of the perfomtance demonstrated that very simple fuzzy rule-based systems had high classification ability for some data sets \(e.g., see Table 3 where only a single rule was extracted for each class experiinental results can be referred as benchmarks in future studies on the tradeoff between the accuracy and the comprehensibility of fiwy rule-based classification systems Our idea of extracting hzzy rules using heuristic rule selection criteria can be also utilized as a pre-screening procedure for genetic rule selection. First, a pre-specified number of promising candidate rules are generated by heuristic 


number of promising candidate rules are generated by heuristic rule selection. Then optimal combinations of candidate rules are searched for by evolutionary optimization techniques.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and benet the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R  A gra w al and R  S r i kant   Fast Al gori t h ms for M i n i n g A ssociation Rules Proc of the 20th VLDB Conf  1994 pp 487499  R Agra w a l and J C S hafer  Paral l e l M i n i n g o f A ssoci at i o n Rules IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 8 No 6 1996 pp 962969 3 M  S  C hen J Han and P  S  Y u   Dat a Mi ni ng An Overview from a Database Perspective IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 8 No 6 1996 pp 866883 4 D  W  C heung S  D L ee and Y  Xi ao  E f f ect of Dat a S k e w ness and Workload Balance in Parallel Data Mining IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 14 No 3 2002 pp 498514 5 S  M  C hung and J Y ang  A Par al l e l D i s t r i b ut i v e J oi n A l gorithm for Cube-Connected Multiprocessors IEEE Trans on Parallel and Distributed Systems  Vol 7 No 2 1996 pp 127137  R  F e l dman and H Hi rsh F i ndi ng Associ at i ons i n Col l ections of Text Machine Learning and Data Mining Methods and Applications  R Michalski I Bratko and M Kubat editors John Wiley and Sons 1998 pp 223240  R F e l dman I Dagen and H  H i rsh Mi ni ng T e xt Usi n g Keyword Distributions Journal of Intelligent Information Systems  Vol 10 No 3 1998 pp 281300  C  Fox L e x i cal Anal ysi s and S t opl i s t s   Inforamtion Retrieval Data Structures and Algorithms W.FrakesandR Baeza-Yates editors Prentice Hall 1992 pp 102130 9 M  G or don and S  Dumai s Usi ng L a t e nt S e mant i c I nde xi ng for Literature Based Discovery Journal of the Amer Soc of Info Science  Vol 49 No 8 1998 pp 674685  J Han J P e i  and Y  Y i n Mi n i n g F r equent Pat t e r n s w i t hout Candidate Generation Proc of ACM SIGMOD Intl Conf on Management of Data  2000 pp 112  J D Holt and S  M Chung Multipass Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Text Databases Knowledge and Information Systems  Vol 3 No 2 Springer-Verlag 2001 pp 168183  J D Hol t and S  M C hung Mi ni ng Associ at i o n R ul es Using Inverted Hashing and Pruning Information Processing Letters  Vol 83 No 4 Elsevier Science 2002 pp 211220  J D Hol t and S  M C hung Mi ni ng associ at i o n R ul es i n Text Databases Using Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning Proc of the 14th IEEE Intl Conf on Tools with Articial Intelligence  2002 pp 4956  J S  Park M S  C hen and P  S  Y u   Usi n g a Hash-B a sed Method with Transaction Trimming for Mining Association Rules IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 9 No 5 1997 pp 813825  G  S a l t on Automatic Text Processing The Transformation Analysis and Retrieval of Information by Computer  Addison-Wesley Publishing 1988  E  M V oorhees and D K Harmon edi t o rs The Fifth Text Retrieval Conference  National Institute of Standards and Technology 1997  O R  Z a i a ne and M L  Ant o i ne C l assi f y i n g T e x t D ocuments by Associating Terms with Text Categories Proc of the 13th Australian Database Conf  2002 0-7695-2132-0/04/$17.00 \(C Proceedings of the 18th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium \(IPDPS04 


  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
