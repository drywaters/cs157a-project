INTRODUCTION Paradoxically, the explosion of scientific information has resulted in diminishing awareness. In the face of an ever growing body of literature, disciplines are becoming increasingly specialized, while individuals and groups are becoming ever more insular. The availability of scientific bibliographies in onlme databases is a rich source of scientific information for scientists to support their research. Although the text processing community has created tools that search for relevant scientific literature \(information retrieval identify facts \(information extraction to find specific facts and relationships. Thus, there is ever increasing interest in the process of efficiently discovering knowledge from the huge collection of scientific literature text mining Y.

National Library of Medicine as knowledge base [7 I 11, [22]-[25]. In biomedicine, we are able to not only access enormous literature databases l i e  Medline, but also make use of excellent knowledge base systems like UMLS. This may be the reason why more literature-based discoveries have been made in biomedicine rather than other disciplines 


made in biomedicine rather than other disciplines In previous research, two concepts are assumed to be related, if they CO-occur in scientific literatures. Other measures of two concepts' relationship are seldom considered In fact, the relationship of two concepts can also be measured by their inherent relations in a hierarchical structure of concepts Association rules are used to identify relationships among a set of items in a database [I]-[3], [26]. These relationships are not based on the inherent properties of the data\(as with functional dependencies occurrence of the data items. Association rules were originally developed for the purpose of market-basket analysis, where it is of interest to find patterns of the form A-B, for example beer -f peanuts, with the intuitive meaning "baskets that contain A tend to contain B". Marketers use this information to position items, and control customers' routes in stores. In addition to the above marketing application, the same sort of question has the following use In text mining, association rules are used to indicate co occurring keywords or topics in a text collection [4]. We can apply existing association rule minmg algorithms to a body of Baskets=literature; itemswords This work is partially supported by the Zlst cenhlly COE program ca1led"Scientific Knowledge  Creation Based on Knowledge Science", Ministry of Education Cultwe, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan 450 0-7803-8376-1/04/$20.00 Copyright 2004 IEEE scientific literature and get association rules of concepts. Then we can replace some concepts in the existing association d e s and propose new association rules. Such new association rules can serve researchers as major repositories of candidates for new research themes, as impetus for inspiration impetus, or as hypotheses to be tested in future The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe how to calculate the appropriate degrees of replacing one concept with another. Section 3 talks about mining association rules of concepts from a given body of scientific literature. Section 4 describes bow to produce new association rules by replacing concepts in existing association rules. Section 5 gives an example of predicting new association rules from biomedical literature. Some conclusions are present in Section 6 11. APPROPRIATE DEGREES OF CONCEPTS REPLACEMENT A. Concept's Parent U = {ci} is a set of all concepts in a hierarchical structure of concepts. We define a binary relation %/ on U as follows 1 In other words, ci is a parent of c j Further, t/ci, cj E U , we define their parent set as follows F\(ci,cj 2 Ohviously,F\(ci,cj cj,ci ci,cj the number of the parents from which ci and c j  directly derive B. Concept's Sibling We define a binary relation % on U as follows ciiRbcj a 3 c k  E U , C , % ~ C ~  and ckXfcj  \(3 In other words, ci is a sibling of cj Relation % has the following two properties CiYIbCi \(4 C i X b C j  o c j % b c i  \( 5 Relation %* is not transitive. In other words, even if ci%,cj and cjSbct, then ci!Rbck does not necessarily hold. Because c j  may directly derive from two different concepts ci and c,, while ci%/ci and c,,,%~c Further, Vci E U ,  we defme its sibling set as follows B\(ci 6 According to the two properties of relation Sb ,a sibling set has the following two properties ci EB\(Ci 7 


ci EB\(Ci 7 ci E B\(Cj Ci 8 C. A Fuqv Set We want to replace some concepts in the existing association rules and propose new association rules. The different concepts replacements should be distinguished. For example, both cj and c, are siblings of ci , i.e c j  eB\(ci ci more parents in common, i.e.  IF\(^^, cj C ~ ,  ck 11 Then we can say that it is more appropriate to replace ci with c j  than to replace ci with ck . However, we cannot say that it is more appropriate to replace ci with c j  than to replace c j  with ci, because we do not h o w  the siblings distributions of ci and cj  now. If the siblings distribution of Ci  differ from that of c j  , the appropriate degree of replacing concept ci with cj may he different from that of replacing concept c j  with ci. Similarly, only from the above information, we also cannot compare the appropriate degree of replacing cj  with ci and that of replacing C, with ci. To sum up, the appropriate degree of replacing concept ci with c should depend not only on IF\(ci, cj siblings distribution of ci appropriate degrees of According to the above analysis, in order to compare the 1 2 3 4 we have the following defmition T\(ci concept ci . Its member function is defined as follows 1 if ci =c i 45 1 Membership function pT\(ci c j appropriate degrees of replacing concept ci with C j .  Its definition completely satisfies the requirement to distinguish the appropriate degrees of above four replacements 111. MINE EXISTING ASSOClATION RULES OF CONCEPTS FROM A GIVEN SET OF SClENTIFlC LITERATURE If some concepts CO-occur in a scientific document, we suppose a transaction happens containing those concepts that co-occur in the document. We can apply existing association rule d i g  algorithms to a set of scientific literature D , and find all existing association rules of concepts with at least minimum support \(called minsup called minconf values specified by the user R, is the pth existing association rule of concepts as follows R , :  A , - + B p where A, and B,  are antecedent and consequent of R respectively. Both A ,  and B,  are sets of concepts. Support S, and confidence C, of the association rule R ,  are calculated as follows where the function g\(x literature which contain all the concepts in the set X ; ID1 is the amount of scientific literature in the set D Iv. PRODUCE NEW ASSOCIATION RULES BY REPLACING CONCEPTS IN EXISTING ASSOCIATION RULES In this paper, we assume that the concepts in an existing association rule are not siblings to each other. The extreme cases will be considered in our future research. We replace some concepts in an existing association rule with their siblings. If the result of the change is not the same as any existing association rule, we call it a valid change. The jth valid change of existing association rule R ,  is as follows RL: A: + B j  P \(13 where A; and B j  are antecedent and consequent of respectively An existing association rule may have more than one valid change. The reasons are as follows 1 


1 hierarchical structure of concepts 2 can he replaced with its siblings The solution to the combinatorial problem depends on the user  s research interest and background knowledge. For example, the user can specify a sibling, limit number of replaced concepts, or just replace some concepts in antecedents or consequents. We also propose the following indicators to distinguish the various valid changes of existing association rules A. Change Degree The more concepts in an existing association rules are replaced, the more changes take place. Hence, we define the change degree of RL as follows N j  =1- n PT\(&lt;J \(4 14 e .~A,uB, ,c{  = B \( e i where concept ci E A, U B ,  in the existing association rule R ,  is replaced with its sibling C B. Realized Possibiiify Two questions arise, when we replace some concepts in an existing association rule with their siblings. Is a valid change meaningful? Will it become true in the future? In order to answer these two questions, we propose an indictor called realized possibility. We suppose that the realized possibility of a valid change of an existing association rule is related to the following factors 1 2 3 Hence, we define the realized possibility of R: as follows r; = S , C p \( l - N 15 where s, and c, are support and confidence of the existing association rule R, , respectively C. Support Support S, is the occurring fiequency of concepts in the existing association rule R ,  . It represents the hot degree of concepts in R ,  . We borrow the word  support  to reflect the future hot degree of concepts in a valid change of an existing association rule. We suppose that support of a valid change of an existing association rule is related to the following factors 1 2 Hence, we defme support of R; as follows S i  =S,\(l-Nj 16 452 D. Confidence Confidence C, represents implication strength of the existing association rule R,  [26]. We also borrow the word  confidence  to reflect the future implication strength of a valid change of an existing association rule. Similarly, the confidence of a valid change of an existing association rule is related to the following factors 1 2 Hence, we defme confidence of R i  as follows change c; =C,\(l-Nj 17 E. Incorporate Valid Changes If two valid changes have the same antecedent and consequent, they are regarded as the same and should be incorporated. For example, R,k is the kth valid change of existing association rule R,  as follows R,k: A: +B,k k If A i  =A;  and B i  = B: , we incorporate Ri  and R Stepl: Replace S i ,  C i ,  N j  , ri of R i  with S i  + S in the following way  k  C i  + C: , min\( N i  , N r  r Step2 Remove R The above procedure continues until the remaining valid 


The above procedure continues until the remaining valid changes are different kom each other. The incorporation results are called new association rules v. ANEXAMPLE In general, the procedure for fuzzy predicting new association rules of concepts from current scientific literature is as follows Stepl: Find existing association rules of concepts from a given set of scientific literature Step2 Replace some concepts of existing association rules with their siblings to produce valid changes Step3: Incorporate valid changes to produce new association rules In order to clearly show the method  s usage, we give an example of predicting new association rules from biomedical literature A. Find Existing Association Rules of ConceptsjPom Medline Citations Medline is the premier source for bibliographic coverage of biomedical literature produced by the U.S. National Library of Medicine \(NLM follows PMID- 855081 1  MH - Alleles MH - Base Sequence MH - Gene Expression MH -Genotype MH - HLA-D Antigendgenetics MH -Haplotypes MH -Human PMID is a unique identification number, and MH refers to the Medical Subject Headings \(MeSH citation. MeSH is a controlled vocabulary created, maintained and provided by the US. National Library of Medicine. Each citation is associated with a set of MeSH that describe its content. Indexers always choose the most specific MeSH available to describe a citation  s subject content. Medline can be searched by using MeSH, which provides a consistent way to retrieve information that may use different terminology for the same concepts We regard the MeSH associated with each citation as important concepts co-occurriOg in a transaction. The current algorithms for association rule mining can be applied to a given set of M e d h e  citations; then we get a set of existing association rules of concepts. For example, we assume an existing association rule on diseases is as follows  R ,  : \(Parkinson Disease; Multiple Sclerosis Temporal Arteritis; Melanoma} \(19 Its support and confidence are 0.3 and 0.6, respectively B. Calculate Appropriate Degrees of Replacing A Concept with Its Sibling MeSH are organized in 15 categories. Each category is M e r  divided into subcategories. Within each subcategory MeSH are arrayed hierarchically from most general to most specific in up to eleven hierarchical levels. The hierarchical structure is referred to as a  tree  Each MeSH is followed by its tree number, which show its location in the tree. Each MeSH appears in at least one place in the tree, and may appear in as many additional places as may be logically appropriate then it may have more than one tree number. For example  Parkinson Disease  appears in two places as follows 1  Lewy Body Disease [C10.228.140.079.862.400 Parkinson Disease [C10.228.140.079.862.500 Parkinson Disease, Secondary Cl0.228.140.079.862.800 2  Heredodegenerative Disorders, Nervous System Lewy Body Disease [C10.574.53 I 


Lewy Body Disease [C10.574.53 I Motor Neuron Disease [C10.574.562 Multiple System Atrophy [C10.574.625 Olivopontocerebellar Atrophies [C10.574.750 Paraneoplastic Syndromes, Nervous System Parkinson Disease [C10.574.812 C10.574.500 C10.574.781 453 Postpoliomyelitis Syndrome [C10.574.827 Prion Diseases [C10.574.843 Shy-Drager Syndrome [C 10.574.8751 Tauopathies [C10.574.945 Using the tree number associated with each MeSH, we can easily find its parent and sibling in the tree. In the fmt  place of the above example, Lewy Body Disease is a sibling of Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders is a parent of Parkinson Disease According to the hierarchical structure, we can easily calculate appropriate degree of replacing one concept in an existing association rule with its sibling. For example, let c =Parkinson Disease, c j  = L e v  Body Disease, then we get c j Parkinson Disease with Lewy Body Disease C. Produce New Association Rules We continue with the example RI in subsection A. For simplicity, we assume the 1st valid change of RI is replacing Parkinson Disease with Lewy Body Disease, while retaining other concepts as follows R: : { Lewy Body Disease; Multiple Sclerosis Temporal Arteritis; Melanoma 20 Its support, confidence, change degree, realized possibility are 7o , :5 , , 3:o , respectively. Perhaps, replacing some concepts in another existing association rule may produce the same valid change. For example, Rk is the 1st valid change 3 of R,. R; is the same as R:. We assume support I confidence, change degree, realized possibility of R,  are 9 1  9 I I 7o , , 700, respectively. We incorporate RI and R,, then the new support, confidence, change degree, realized possibility are 6 , &amp; , $ , &amp;j , respectively VI. CONCLUSIONS In this paper, we propose a new method to predict new possible association rules of concepts by mining current scientific literature. It is very necessary to incorporate domain experts to evaluate the utility of predicted association rules. In contrast to previous related research our methods novelties are as follows 1 rule tiom a concept to a set of concepts 2 hy their co-occurrence in scientific literature, but also by their inherent relationship in a hierarchical structure of concepts 3 with its sibling 4 changes of existing association rules The method can help researchers explore new research directions from huge body of currently reported scientific and technical developments. Based on their research interest and background knowledge, researchers can select some of new association rules to indicate future research directions according to the indicators support, confidence, change degree realized possibility ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would l i e  to thank Dr. TieJu Ma and Mr. LE Minh Hoang for their help REFERENCES I] R.

Simulations One has run simulations comparing the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm and the new algorithm here. A typical multisensor multitarget tracking environment is assumed in the simulations. According to article [1,3], One known that the performance of sequential MSJPDA is better than the performance of parallel MSJPDA. Therefore, the performance of parallel MSJPDA algorithm will not be compared here There are three sensors, which are fixed in three platforms. Regarding the 2nd sensor as fusion centre situation of the other sensors are: =?-500m?-500m 0m??N =?-500m? 500m?0m??The distance error of each sensor is: =300m, =200m, =100m?The bear error of each sensor is 0.03rad, =0.02rad, =0.01rad?The of sample is T=1s?The nonparametric model of clutter is used in the simulations, and expected number of false measurement is m=1.8 1 sN 3 s 1r 2 2r 3 3r 1 Simulations have been run for racking two targets. The true initialization state of the targets is X1?[-29500m,400m/s,34500m,-400m/s X ?[-26250m,296m/s,34500m,-400m/s]'? 2 The two targets will cross above 31seconds later. To evaluate tracking performance, 50 Monte Carlo runs were performed for three case of the target detection probability Pd=0.97 ? Pd=0.76 ? Pd=0.58. In every run, the total simulation time is 140 steps 


simulation time is 140 steps            Figure 1  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.97          Figure 2  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.97       Figure 3  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.76 567 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005         Figure 4  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.76         Figure 5  RMS position error in case of Pd=0.58          Figure 6  RMS velocity error in case of Pd=0.58  Table 1 The emanative times comparison for sequential MSJPDA and SD-CMSJPDA algorithm  Pd N A  0.97 0. 76 0.58 Sequential MSJPDA 2 11 17 SD-CMSJPDA 0 3 5 Pd denotes detection probability, N denotes emanative 


Pd denotes detection probability, N denotes emanative times, A denotes the kind of algorithm Table 1 shows the summation of emanative times for sequential MSJPDA and SD-CMSJPDA algorithm in 50 Monte Carlo simulations. From table 1 , it is shown that the stability of SD-CMSJPDA is better than that of sequential MSJPDA as the detection probability varied Figure 1,2 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0. 97, respectively; Figure 3,4 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0.76 respectively; Figure 3,4 show the RMS errors for position and velocity in case of Pd=0.58, respectively. From the figures we can see that the average RMS position error is lower for the SD-CMS JPDA algorithm. We also see that the state estimation precision of sequential MSJPDA get worse as the detection probability decreases The reasons for these simulation results lies:1 state estimation precision will get worse when the detection probability decrease;2 algorithm is to process measurement from each sensor using single sensor JPDA algorithm sequentially. Therefore the estimation error from each sensor will be accumulated Moreover, the sequential MSJPDA algorithm can  t improve the joint detection probability of the multisensor system The estimation error of the SD- CMSJPDA  algorithm will not be accumulated for it processes the measurement from each sensor directly in the mean time .What  s more the new method can greatly improve the joint detection probability of the multisensor system. Therefore, the tracking performance of SD-CMSJPDA algorithm is better than that of sequential MSJPDA. Algorithm All of the simulations are run in the personal computer with a 2.0G CPU and a 256M memory. The average cost time per step is 0.0251 in the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm. And the average cost time per step is 0.0282 in the sequential implementations of MSJPDA algorithm. According to the results we can see that there is few difference in real time between the new method and the sequential   MSJPDA when there is not so many sensors and targets 568 Proceedings of  the Fourth International Conference on Machine Learning and Cybernetics  Guangzhou, 18-21 August 2005  5. Conclusion In order to solve the problem of multisensor multi target tracking, a new centralized multisensor  joint probabilistic data association  algorithm is proposed in this paper. The simulation results shows that the tracking performance of the new algorithm is better than that of the sequential MSJPDA algorithm The computational complexity of the new method will increase as the number of sensors and targets grow Therefore, how to improve the real time of SD- CMSJPDA algorithm will be pay attention References 1] He You, Wang Guohong, Lu Dajin, Peng Yingning Multisensor Information Fusion With Application[M Publishion House of Electronics Industry. 2000, Beijing.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
