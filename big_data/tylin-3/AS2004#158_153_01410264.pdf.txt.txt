In this paper we shed light on this problem by providing a formal de?nition and a thorough characterization.We also study computational issues and show how to combine the most recent results in both paradigms, providing a very e?cient algorithm which exploits the two requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed in order to reduce the computation as much as possible 1. Introduction Frequent itemsets play an essential role in many data mining tasks that try to ?nd interesting patterns from databases, such as association rules, correlations sequences, episodes, classi?ers, clusters. Although the collection of all frequent itemsets is typically very large the subset that is really interesting for the user usually contains only a small number of itemsets. Therefore, the paradigm of constraint-based mining was introduced. Constraints provide focus on the interesting knowledge, thus reducing the number of patterns extracted to those of potential interest. Additionally, they can be pushed deep inside the mining algorithm in order to achieve better performance. For these reasons the problem of how to push di?erent types of constraints into the frequent itemsets computation has been extensively studied [13, 15, 19 Extracting too many uninteresting frequent patterns, with large requirements both in terms of time and space, is an even harder problem when mining dense datasets containing strongly related transactions Such datasets are much harder to mine since only a few itemsets can be pruned by the anti-monotonicity of frequency, and the number of frequent itemsets grows very quickly while the minimum support threshold decreases. As a consequence, the mining task becomes rapidly intractable by traditional mining algorithms, which try to extract all the frequent itemsets Closed itemsets mining is a solution to this problem Closed itemsets are a small subset of frequent itemsets, but they represent exactly the same knowledge in a more succinct way. From the set of closed itemsets it is straightforward to derive both the identities and supports of all frequent itemsets. Mining the closed itemsets is thus semantically equivalent to mining all frequent itemsets, but with the great advantage that closed itemsets are orders of magnitude fewer than frequent ones How to integrate the two paradigms of constrained frequent itemsets and closed frequent itemsets is clearly an interesting issue Following the constraints framework, one could wrongly express the property of being closed as just another constraint Cclose. Consider the following induc 


other constraint Cclose. Consider the following inductive query Q : Cfreq\(X X X.price which requires to mine itemsets which are frequent, are closed and have a sum of prices less than 22. Such a query has ambiguous semantics. In fact there are two possible di?erent interpretations for query Q  I1 : mine all frequent closed itemsets which have the additional property of having sum of prices less than 22  I2 : mine all frequent itemsets having sum of prices less than 22 and which have the additional property of being closed \(w.r.t. the other two constraints In this paper we shed light on this problem showing that these two possible interpretations produce di?erent solution sets: this is due to the fact that being closed is not a property which an itemset satis?es or not for its own characteristics, but it is a property of an itemset in the context of a collection of itemsets Then we show that the interpretation I2 is the meaningful one and, according to it, we de?ne the closed Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE constrained frequent itemsetmining problem. Finally, we study computational issues and we provide a very ef?cient algorithm which exploits the two requirements satisfying constraints and being closed in order to reduce the computation as much as possible 1.1. Problem Definition and Notation Let I = {x1, ..., xn} be a set of distinct literals called items, where an item is an object with some attributes \(e.g., price, type, etc non-empty subset of I. If |X| = k then X is called a k-itemset. A constraint on itemsets is a function C : 2I ? {true, false}. We say that an itemset I satis?es a constraint if and only if C\(I the theory of a constraint as the set of itemsets which satisfy the constraint: Th\(C X A transaction database D is a bag of itemsets t ? 2I called transactions.

Thus with this notation, the set of frequent itemsets can be denoted Th\(Cfreq Since we are usually interested in mining problems which requires to output the support of each solution itemset, we de?ne a special frequency-theory which is a set of couples itemset-support Definition 1 \(F -Theory junction of constraints C and a transaction database D we de?ne: FThD\(C X C In the following, we de?ne the concepts of closures and borders of theories, which will be useful to characterize the solutions spaces of our mining problems Definition 2 \(Closure of a F -Theory sure of a F-Theory is a function Cl : FThD ?

C This de?nition will be proven to be the only reasonable in Section 3 1.2. Related Work Even if a lot of work has been done with closed itemsets and with constrained itemsets, there are only a few approaches analyzing the conjunction of these two frameworks. The ?rst approach is [8] where instead of mining closed itemsets, it is proposed to mine free itemsets, i.e. the minimal elements of each equivalence class of frequency \(closed itemsets are the maximal elements of such classes with all the free itemsets satisfying a given set of monotone and anti-monotone constraints. The authors propose a variation of the A-CLOSE [14] algorithm, with constraints pushed into the computation. Free itemsets representation is concise, though the number of Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE D a,b,c,d,e b,c b,c,d,e a,b,c,d a,b,c,e b,c,d,e item price a 15 b 18 c 2 d 4 e 14 Borders of theories B+\(Th\(Cfreq[D,3 B?\(Th\(Cfreq[D,3 B+\(Th\(CM B?\(Th\(CM ab abc

In fact, it is not possible to reconstruct the whole Th\(Cfreq through the dataset are performed. Moreover we will see how this representation retains the same ambiguity in mining constrained free sets. Since this kind of representation is itself problematic \(i.e. it is not lossless and since it does not bring any advantage in mining the constrained solution space, we will focus on closed itemsets in this paper instead of free itemsets In [11], hard constraints are pushed into the frequent closed itemsets mining process. The output of the algorithm is the same of a post-processing one, i.e rst closed itemsets are discovered and then they are tested against a given set of constraints. Both these works exploit the interpretation I1, without addressing the problem of the information loss it produces This choice is explicitly made in order to simplify the mining process. In this paper we quantify such information loss given by the post-processing approach and give a new accurate de?nition of the problem of constrained closed itemset mining, which provides a concise and lossless condensed representation of the solution space 2. Preliminaries In this Section we review and deeply characterize the constrained frequent itemsets mining problem MP3 and the closed frequent itemset mining problem MP4 The provided characterization will then be useful to characterize the new problem MP5

Constrained Frequent Itemsets A na  ve solution to the constrained frequent itemset mining problem \(MP3 itemsets and then test them for constraints satisfaction. However more e?cient solutions can be found by analyzing the property of constraints comprehensively, and exploiting such properties in order to push constraints in the frequent pattern computation. Following this methodology, some classes of constraints which exhibit nice properties \(and the relative computational strategies e.g anti-monotonicity, monotonicity, succinctness, convertibility  basic classes of constraints: anti-monotone and monotone constraints \(see De?nition 3 The most studied anti-monotone constraint is the frequency one. The anti-monotonicity of Cfreq is used by the Apriori [2] algorithm with the following heuristic: if an itemset X does not satisfy Cfreq , then no superset of X can satisfy Cfreq , and hence they can be pruned. Another typical example of CAM constraint is sum\(X.price symmetrically, sum\(X.price straint. In the rest of this paper we will consider these two constraints as prototypical CAM and CM constraints without loss of generality We now characterize the solutions spaces of the two problems Th\(Cfreq ?

Condensed representation is a term ?rst introduced in [12], which we use to indicate a representation of a theory, which is both concise: the size of the representation is signi?cantly smaller than the original theory lossless: from the representation it should be possible to reconstruct all the information present in the original theory without mining the database again According to this de?nition, the set of maximal frequent itemsets, B+\(Th\(Cfreq sentation \(concise and lossless Cfreq FThD\(Cfreq maximal frequent itemsets we can reconstruct the full

Moreover, association rules extracted from closed sets have been proved to be more concise and meaningful, because all redundancies are discarded The problem of mining closed frequent itemsets MP4  has received a great deal of attention especially by an algorithmic point of view [16, 20, 17 Formally, given the functions: f\(T T, i ? t}, which returns all the items included in the set of transactions T , and g\(X which returns the set of transactions supporting a given itemset X, the composite function f ? g is called Galois operator or closure operator.

itemsets are exactly the maximal elements of these equivalence classes. Figure 2 shows the lattice of frequent itemsets derived from the same simple dataset of Figure 1. Each equivalence class contains elements sharing the same supporting transactions and closed itemsets are their maximal elements.

Note that the number of closed frequent itemsets \(5 than the number of frequent itemsets \(19 It trivially holds that these equivalence classes of frequency are never cut by the border of frequency \(as shown in Figure 2 alence classes when they are cut by some CAM or CM constraints? In the next Section by giving an answer to this question, we provide a characterization of MP5 3. Closing Theories of Constraints Recall the mining query discussed in the Introduction Q : Cfreq\(X X X.price The two di?erent interpretations of Q are as follows where CAM ? sum\(X.price  I1 : Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq[D CAM  I2 : Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ?

With interpretation I1 we mine closed frequent itemsets and then we remove those ones which do not satisfy the CAM constraint: this way we lose the whole information contained in those equivalence classes cut by the CAM constraint. On the other hand, according to interpretation I2, we mine the set of itemsets which satisfy the CAM constraint and then we compute the closure of such itemsets collection: thus, by de?nition, the itemsets bd and cd are solutions because they satisfy CAM and they have not a superset in the result set with the same support and satisfying the constraint Which one of the two di?erent interpretations is the most reasonable? It is straightforward to see that interpretation I1 is not a condensed representation since it loses a lot of information. In extreme cases it could output an empty solutions set even if there are many frequent itemsets which satisfy the given set of user-de?ned constraints. On the other hand, interpretation I2, which corresponds to the de?nition Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM representation of FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM Observe that I2 is a superset of I1: it contains all 


Observe that I2 is a superset of I1: it contains all closed itemsets which are under the CAM border \(as I1 plus those itemsets which arise in equivalence classes which are cut by the CAM border \(such as for instance ce and cde in Figure 3\(a Proposition 3 Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq ?

In Figure 3\(b show the usual equivalence classes and how they are cut by CM ? sum\(X.prices are upward closed, we have no problems with classes which are cut: the maximal element of the equivalence class will be in the alive part of the class. In other words when we have a CM constraint, the two interpretations I1 and I2 correspond Proposition 4 Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq ?

This could be an alternative. However since closed itemsets provide a much more meaningful set of association rules, we consider a good tradeo? among performance, conciseness and meaningfulness the use of Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq?CM resentation Finally, if we use free sets instead of closed, we only shift the problem leading to a symmetric situation. Using free sets interpretations I1 and I2 coincide when dealing with anti-monotone constraints because minimal elements are not cut o? by the constraint \(e.g. de in Fig. 3\(a constraints \(e.g. no free solution itemsets in Fig. 3\(b Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 4. Algorithms In this Section we study algorithms for the computation of MP5. We ?rst discuss separately how monotone and anti-monotone constraints can be pushed in the computation, then we show how they can be exploited together by introducing the CCIMiner algorithm 4.1. Pushing Monotone Constraints Pushing CAM constraints deep into the frequent itemset mining algorithm \(attacking the problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM  since they behave exactly as Cfreq . The case is di?erent for CM constraints, since they behave exactly the opposite of frequency. Indeed, CAM constraints can be used to e?ectively prune the search space to a small downward closed collection, while the upward closed collection of the search space satisfying the CM constraints cannot be exploited at the same time. This tradeo? holding on the search space of the computational problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CM extensively studied [18, 9, 4], but all these studies have failed to ?nd the real synergy of these two opposite types of constraints, until the recent proposal of ExAnte [6]. In that work it has been shown that a real synergy of the two opposites exists and can be exploited by reasoning on both the itemset search space and the transactions input database 


set search space and the transactions input database together According to this approach each transaction can be analyzed to understand whether it can support any solution itemset, and if it is not the case, it can be pruned In this way we prune the dataset, and we get the fruitful side e?ect to lower the support of many useless itemsets, that in this way will be pruned because of the frequency constraint, strongly reducing the search space. Such approach is performed with two successive reductions  reduction \(based on monotonicity reduction \(based on anti-monotonicity to  reduction we can delete transactions which do not satisfy CM , in fact no subset of such transactions satis?es CM and therefore such transactions cannot support any solution itemsets. After such reduction, a singleton item may happen to become infrequent in the pruned dataset, an thus it can be deleted by the ?reductions. Of course, these two step can be repeated until a ?xed point is reached, i.e. no more pruning is possible. This simple yet very e?ective idea has been generalized in an Apriori-like breadth-?rst computation in ExAMiner [5], and in a FP-growth [10] based depth-?rst computation in FP-Bonsai [7 Since in general depth-?rst approaches are much more e?cient when mining closed itemsets, and since FP-Bonsai has proven to be more e?cient than ExAMiner, we decide here to use a FP-growth based depth?rst strategy for the mining problem MP5. Thus we combine Closet [16], which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining closed frequent itemset, with FPBonsai, which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining frequent itemset with CM constraints 4.2. Pushing Anti-monotone Constraints Anti-monotone constraints CAM can be easily pushed in a Closet computation by using them in the exact same way as the frequency constraint, exploiting the downward closure property of antimonotone constraints. During the computation, as soon as a closed itemset X s.t  CAM \(X ered, we can prune X and all its supersets by halting the depth ?rst visit. But whenever, such closed itemset X s.t  CAM \(X e.g. bcd in Figure 3\(a some itemsets Y ? X belonging to the same equivalence class and satisfying the constraint may exist \(e.g bd and cd in Figure 3\(a ery such X in a separate list, named Edge, and after the mining we can reconstruct such itemsets Y by means of a simple top-down process, named Backward-Mining, described in Algorithm 1 Algorithm 1 Backward-Mining Input: Edge, C, CAM , CM C is the set of frequent closed itemsets CAM is the antimonotone constraint CM is a monotone constraint \(if present Output: MP5 1: MP5 = C split Edge by cardinality 2: k = 0 3: for all c ?

Experimental Results The aim of our experimentation is to measure performance bene?ts given by our framework, and to quantify the information gained w.r.t. the other lossy approaches 


approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
