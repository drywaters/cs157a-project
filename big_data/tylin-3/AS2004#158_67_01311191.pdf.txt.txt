The representation that consists of all frequent closed itemsets and the representations based on generalized disjunction-free patterns or on non-derivable itemsets are proven the most concise ones. Experiments show further that the latter ones are by a few orders of magnitude more concise \(and determinable former one. As follows from experiments, the representations based on generalized disjunction-free patterns are also more concise than the available in the literature representations of frequent patterns, which determine supports of patterns in an approximate way. In this paper, we provide an upper bound on the length of generalized disjunction-free patterns. The bound determines the maximum number of scans of the database carried out by Apriori-like algorithms discovering the representations based on generalized disjunction-free patterns 1. Introduction Frequent patterns are often used for the discovery of several types of knowledge such as association rules episode rules, sequential patterns, and clusters [10]. As the number of frequent itemsets is usually large, it is important to apply concise, preferably lossless representations of frequent itemsets. By lossless we mean a representation that allows derivation and support determination of all frequent itemsets without accessing the database. A number of lossless representations of frequent patterns have been proposed. Frequent closed itemsets \(CR  representation \(GR  lossless representations are based on disjunction-free sets DFSR  DFGR  generalized disjunction-free generators \(GDFGR  generalized disjunction-free sets \(GDFSR  derivable itemsets \(NDR  k-free sets [7, 9]. All these representations, except for CR, consist of two major parts: a main component and a border. In practice, the conciseness of the CR and GR representations is of the same order of magnitude. The remaining border representations are by up to two orders of magnitude more concise than CR and by four than all frequent patterns [16]. In consequence, an intensive and promising research has started that examines the usage of such representations for speeding up the process of mining around frequent patterns and association rules in databases [5] or for reasoning from partial knowledge 14, 16, 18]. The methods of deriving all frequent patterns from respective representations were discussed in [6-8, 13, 16, 21, 24]. In [16, 22-23], a collection of algorithms for dataless transitioning among representations of frequent patterns has been offered. The pattern representations are used for efficient derivation of concise representations of other types of knowledge such as association rules [12, 15-16, 24-26, 28], episode rules 11], classifiers [3], and dependence rules [29 It is worth noting that the generalized disjunction free representations and k-disjunction-free representations where k?2, are even by two orders of magnitude more concise than the approximate representations of frequent patterns, which were offered in [5, 27 The characteristic feature of all lossless 


The characteristic feature of all lossless representations of frequent patterns, except for CR, is that for any pattern X contained in the representation, all its subsets also belong to the representation. Thus Apriori-like algorithms discover such representations within at most n+1 scans of the database, where n is the length of a longest representation element In this paper, we offer three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations We prove that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. We make this Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE estimation more accurate by taking into account also constraints imposed on the sought representation or both the constraints and the information on previously found representation for the same data set The layout of the paper is as follows Section 2 introduces the notions and properties of frequent itemsets, generalized disjunction-free sets and generalized disjunctive sets, as well as the representations based on them. In Section 3, we derive a basic formula for determining upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set. In Section 4 we refine this formula be applying the information on constraints imposed on the representation to be mined. In Section 5, we derive formula that additionally uses the information on the already found representation on which another \(less restrictive imposed. Experimental evaluation is provided in Section 6. The related work is discussed in Section 7 Section 8 concludes the results 2. Basic notions and properties 2.1. Itemsets, frequent itemsets Let I = {i1, i2, ..., im}, I??, be a set of distinct literals called items. In the case of a transactional database, a notion of an item corresponds to a sold product, while in the case of a relational database an item will be an attribute, value Any set of items is called an itemset. An itemset consisting of k items will be called a k-itemset Let D be a set of transactions \(or tuples, respectively where each transaction \(tuple Without any loss of generality, we will restrict further considerations to transactional databases itemset X is denoted by sup\(X or percentage The itemset X is called frequent if its support is greater than some user-defined threshold minSup, where minSup ? [0, |D|]. The set of all frequent itemsets will be denoted by F F = {X ? I| sup\(X Property 2.1.1 [1 a X Y b c 2.2. Generalized disjunctive sets and generalized disjunction-free sets In this section, we recall the notion of generalized disjunctive sets and generalized disjunction-free sets [16 21]. Informally speaking, generalized disjunctive sets allow reasoning about supports of their supersets. To the contrary, the supports of generalized disjunction-free sets are not derivable. The key concept in definition of both types of sets is the notion of a generalized disjunctive rule Let Z?I. X?a1? ... ?an is defined a generalized disjunctive rule based on Z \(and Z is the base of X?a1? ... ?an 


X?a1? ... ?an X ? Z and {a1, ..., an} = Z\\X Support of X?a1? ... ?an, is denoted by sup\(X?a1? ... ?an transactions in D in which X occurs together with a1 or a2, or ... or  an. Please note that sup\(X?a X?{a Let err\(X?\\/a1? ... ?an transactions containing X that do not contain any item in a1, ..., an}; that is err\(X?a1? ... ?an X X?a1? ... ?an X?a1? ... ?an is defined a certain rule if err\(X?a1? ... ?an Thus X ? a1? ... ?an is certain if each transaction containing X contains also a1 or a2, or ... or an An itemset X is defined as a generalized disjunctive set if there is a certain generalized disjunctive rule based on X; that is, if ?a1, ..., an?X such that X\\{a1, ..., an}?a1? ... ?an, where n ? 1, is a certain rule Otherwise, itemset X is defined a generalized disjunction-free set The set of all generalized disjunction-free sets will be denoted by GDFree, that is GDFree = {X?I  a1, ..., an?X err\(X\\{a1, ..., an}?a1? ... ?an Example 2.2.1. Let us consider the database D from Table 1. Table 2 presents all generalized disjunctive rules based on {ab}. None of them is certain. Hence, {ab} is generalized disjunction-free. Table 3 presents all generalized disjunctive rules based on {abc}, three of which are certain. Thus, {abc} is generalized disjunctive  Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Table 1.

If X?a1? ... ?an is certain, then Z?X Z?a1? ... ?an is certain The next property is an immediate consequence of Property 2.2.1 and states that supersets of a generalized disjunctive set are also generalized disjunctive. In consequence, all subsets of a generalized disjunction-free sets are also generalized disjunction-free Property 2.2.2 [16, 21]. Let X?I a b 


b It was proved in [16, 20] that each certain generalized disjunctive rule determines an errorless method of calculating the support of the base of that rule from the supports of proper subsets of this base. In addition, it was shown there that the information on the support of a generalized disjunctive set and the supports of all its proper subsets is sufficient to reconstruct all certain generalized disjunctive rules based on it. In the result the information on the supports of all generalized disjunction-free sets and the supports of all minimal generalized disjunctive sets is sufficient to derive the supports of all other itemsets in 2I 2.3. Representations of frequent patterns based on generalized disjunction-free sets Generalized disjunction-free sets is a key concept for lossless GDFGR [16, 21] and GDFSR [17 representations of frequent patterns. One can distinguish two components in such representations  the main component consisting of all generalized disjunction-free sets that are frequent \(denoted by FGDFree; that is FGDFree = F ? GDFree  the border consisting of minimal generalized disjunctive sets and/or minimal infrequent itemsets The complete border of FGDFree \(denoted by Bd   defined as the itemsets not present in FGDFree whose all proper subsets belong to FGDFree; that is Bd  X?I| X?FGDFree and \(?Y?X Y?FGDFree Thus the complete border consists of either frequent generalized disjunctive sets or infrequent itemsets For the sake of simplicity of the presentation, in this paper we will discuss GDFSR, which is a  canonical   form of a generalized disjunction-free representation, and stores the information on all itemsets in FGDFree and all itemsets in Bd  Other representations based on generalized disjunction-free sets, such as GDFGR, are particular subsets of the canonical representation. Please see [7, 9, 17, 19] for lossless methods allowing considerable reduction of the border size. A simple method of lossless reduction of the main component has been recently proposed in [20 It has been proved in [20] that each itemset in 2I that is not present in the canonical representation has a subset in the complete border Lemma 2.3.1 [20 2I \\ \(FGDFree ? Bd   Y?Bd   Thus, if an itemset not present in the canonical representation has an infrequent subset in the border then it is found infrequent \(by Property 2.2.1c Otherwise, it is a superset of some frequent generalized disjunctive set. So its support is recursively determinable from its proper subsets \(please see [16, 21] for details of deriving supports of itemsets from generalized disjunction-free representations Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE 3. Determining upper bound on the length of generalized disjunction-free itemsets without accessing database Since generalized disjunction-free sets are those itemsets the support of which cannot be derived \(by means of generalized disjunctive rules be able to predict what the maximal length of such an itemset is. If one knows that the length of a longest itemset is not greater than n, one will also know that Apriori-like algorithms will find all generalized disjunction-free sets after n scans of the database. One more scan of the database will be needed to identify also all minimal generalized disjunctive sets In this section we will derive estimation of the length 


In this section we will derive estimation of the length of generalized disjunction-free sets with respect to the length of the database to be mined. Our estimation does not require any evaluation of the database and is independent of the transactions  length We start with simple observation that the error of any generalized disjunctive rule is always a non-negative number and is not greater than the length of the database Let Y be an itemset such that Y = {y1, ..., yn}. In the latter of the paper, the disjunction y1? ... yn will be denoted by \\/Y Property 3.1. Let X,Y be itemsets such that X?Y and Y err\(X?\\/Y  Proof err\(X?\\/Y X X?\\/Y err\(X?\\/Y X X?\\/Y X  Our purpose now is to derive the relationship between the errors of the following rules: X?\\/Y, X?\\/Y ? a X?{a}?\\/Y. To this end, we need to recall a simple property Property 3.2 [16, 21]. Let X,Y,{a} be itemsets such that X?Y = ?, Y ? ? and a?X?Y sup\(X?\\/Y ? a X?\\/Y X?a sup\(X?{a}?\\/Y Lemma 3.1. Let X,Y,{a} be itemsets such that X?Y Y ? ? and a?X?Y sup\(X?\\/Y ? a X?\\/Y X?{a}?\\/Y Proof sup\(X?\\/Y ? a sup\(X?\\/Y X?{a}?\\/Y sup\(X?a X?{a  sup\(X?{a} ? sup\(X?{a}?\\/Y X?\\/Y err\(X?{a}?\\/Y  Theorem 3.1. Let X,Y,{a} be itemsets such that X?Y = ?, Y ? ? and a?X?Y err\(X?\\/Y X?\\/Y ? a X?{a}?\\/Y Proof err\(X?{a}?\\/Y sup\(X?\\/Y X?\\/Y ? a X sup\(X?\\/Y X?\\/Y ? a X?\\/Y err\(X?\\/Y ? a  Thus, we see that the sum of the errors of rules X?\\/Y ? a and X?{a}?\\/Y, which are based on X?Y?{a} equals the error of rule X?\\/Y, which is based on the subset X?Y. The next two corollaries follow immediately from this observation and from the fact that rules  errors are non-negative integers Corollary 3.1. Let X,Y,{a} be itemsets such that X?Y = ?, Y ? ? and a?X?Y err\(X?\\/Y ? a X?{a}?\\/Y X?\\/Y Proof: By Theorem 3.1 and Property 3.1  Corollary 3.2. Let X,Y,{a} be itemsets such that X?Y = ?, Y ? ? and a?X?Y min\(err\(X?\\/Y ? a X?{a}?\\/Y     err\(X?\\/Y Proof: By Theorem 3.1 and Property 3.1  Now we will derive the relationship between the value of the minimum error of generalized disjunctive rules having the same base and the length of that base Lemma 3.2. Let Z be an itemset such that |Z| ? 1 min{err\(Z\\Y?\\/Y Proof \(by induction w.r.t. the length of Z Let |Z| = 1. Then, only one distinct generalized disjunctive rule based on Z can be created, namely

Thus min{err\(Z\\Y?\\/Y  however, min{err\(Z\\Y?\\/Y    log2|D|? + 1  Thus each generalized disjunction-free set is not longer than ?log2|D|? + 1 and minimal generalized disjunctive sets are not longer than ?log2|D|? + 2 Example 3.1.  Let us consider database D from Table 1 which consists of 7 transactions. According to Theorem 3.2, the lengths of all generalized disjunctionfree sets GDFree discovered in D will not be greater than ?log27? + 1 = 3.

Determining upper bound on the length of elements of generalized disjunction-free representation In this section, we offer an estimation of the length of elements that occur in the canonical representation of frequent patterns; that is, frequent generalized disjunction-free sets, as well as, minimal frequent generalized disjunctive sets and minimal infrequent itemsets in this representation. Now we will take into account the value of the support threshold value We start with the observation that the error of any generalized disjunctive rule that is based on a frequent itemset is less than the length of the database decreased by the minSup threshold Lemma 4.1.

Follows from Lemma 4.2 \(instead of Lema 3.2  Thus each frequent generalized disjunction-free set is not longer than ?log2\(|D| ? minSup to estimate the lengths of all elements in the canonical representation Corollary 4.1.

Let us consider database D from Table 1 which consists of 7 transactions. Tables 6-7 present elements of the main representation component and its border, respectively, obtained for minSup = 4. In accordance with Corollary 4.1, the lengths of elements in the main component are not greater than ?log2\(7?4 whereas the lengths of border elements are not greater than ?log2\(7?4 Table 6.

Related work The most similar to the representations based on generalized disjunctive sets is the NDR representation which consists of all frequent non-derivable itemsets [7 8], and the representations based on ?-free sets [7, 9]. It was shown in [8], that for each non-empty itemset Z, one can derive the lower bound \(l\(Z u\(Z on sup\(Z from the fact that sup\(Z Non-derivable itemsets are those for which u\(Z Z gt; 0. If u\(Z Z sup\(Z supersets Y of a derivable itemset are also derivable and u\(Y Y Y such that neither sup\(Z Z Z Z It was proved in [7, 8] that u\(Z Z  u\(Z?{a Z?{a for |Z| ? 1 This important result was used in [7, 8] to determine the upper bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets namely: non-derivable itemsets are not longer than log2|D|? + 1 Hence, the bound on the length of non-derivable itemsets is identical to the bound on the length of generalized disjunction-free sets \(please see Theorem 3.2 It has been proved in [7] that ?-free sets are a subset of non-derivable itemsets, so their length is also bounded by ?log2|D|? + 1 There is a claim in [7, 9] that the generalized disjunction-free sets equal the ?-free sets. This claim however, is not correct, which we will prove by the example beneath. Table 4 contains all generalized disjunction-free sets. Among them, there is {fh}, the support of which equals 0. The support bounds for {fh are found as follows \(please, see [7] for the details  sup\({fh f h   sup\({fh f  sup\({fh h  sup\({fh Proceedings of the 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database  Management \(SSDBM  04 1099-3371/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Hence, l\({fh fh fh sup\({fh free, is not a ?-free set Since the families of the generalized disjunction-free sets and ?-free sets may differ, finding the relationship between them or between the generalized disjunction-free sets and non-derivable itemsets remains a challenge 8. Conclusions The representations based on generalized disjunctionfree sets belong to the most concise ones among all lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In 


lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
