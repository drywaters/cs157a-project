It is analyzed that the relationship between elder  s  activity time distribution and the activity, and then the association rules of elder  s actions is  obtained. It can help to detection abnormal activity and provide timely and appropriate services to the solitary  elder Keywords: solitacy elder, data mining, association rules, time cluster, Apriori 1. Introduction Our country has stepped into the aging time at the beginning of 21st century. The increasing number of aged population in Chinese will bring a lot of social problems such as big state budget and so on. With this proliferation of the elderly population, the need for the old group including assisted living facilities, must be enhanced However, most of the elderly desire to live in their private residences as long as possible, some safe and economy methods are needed to meet their request 2. Gathering of solitary elder  s life data At present, to detect the accident occurrence of the elder in the remote room, we usually monitor the room by taking pictures that will be sent to the monitor center through network. The guardianship can master the situation of the elder from the pictures. There are several problems in using this method. Firstly, it will infringe the individual privacy Secondly, a mass of data will aggravate the burden of the network; Thirdly, the proportion of abnormal infomation in the elder  s daily information is very small. The guardianships often lose the exceptional information because it lack of data mining and analyzing; the last one but not the Ieast one, it  s hard to deliver unusual information to different departments, so that the corresponding guardianships could take appropriate action The thesis proposes a method to detect remote abnormal event by d e  educed from daily activities data gained by infixed sensor. On one hand, the way to get the daily information by infrared sensor can protect the elder  s privacy; on the other hand, it can also analyze the elder  s activity through disposing the informatjon gathered by sensor with computer. A5 shown in the Fig.1, the sensor is installed in each room. Among the daily data, the unusual data is very important. It i s  necessary to find the inside relation of the solitary elder  s daily data, the connotative and possibIe to be unusual information from the daily data characteristic by data mining techniques Fig. 1. Elder  s house and sensor  s position Fig.1 illustrates how simple sensors might be installed ubiquitously in the home. Locations where a sensor could be placed to provide useful information. Ideally, the sensors are unintrusive and removable without damage to the cabinets or furniture, and all rooms of the home may have such measurement devices. The sensors are  tape on and forget  devices that can be quickly and ubiquitously installed in home environments. One of the goals of this work is to present an activity recognition system that would use such sensors to recognize activities of daily living. The proposed sensors require no major modifications to existing homes and can be easily retrofitted in real home environments When sensors were installed, each data collection board 


When sensors were installed, each data collection board which has a unique ID} was marked on a plan-view of the environment so that when the sensor data was collected, the Iocation \(e,g kitchen e.g refrigeratory sensor was known 837- PR0002/04/oooO-0837 W O O  0 2004 SICE 3. Method of data mining To create algorithms that detect activities, computational models that capture the structure of activities must be developed. The behavior of an individual can be characterized by the temporal distribution of elder  s activities such as patterns in timing, duration, Bequency sequential order, and other factors such as location, culhral habits, and age. Human behavior attributes that present challenges for recognition are as follows: 1 2 complexity; 5 We emplo the association rules finding algorithm with time cluster to analysis the elder  s activity. Basically roposed method consists of the following two procedures Time clustering for each item in itemsets I to generate 8 new itmesets I* with time-scale Mining association rules among the I* itemsets Fig. 2 illustrates the outline of the method History data of Real-time data of I ,I elder activiiy The da I with t Time Association Real-time cluster 1 rule mining s monitoring Fig.2. Flow chart 1 Firstly, we cluster each item of elder activity with time For example, Fig3 describe the distribution of sleep time o f elder. Each item represent points on a two-dimensional coordinate grid. the x-axis can be used for time in hours and the y-axis for frequency. We extract the significative time scale with the horizontal line Le, which associated with the mini-support. If the Le value equal to 2, we think the point which is less than 2 should be removed. In this method, we should choose appropriate time granularity. Tf the granularity is half time, the event occuring in 8:OO is same as the one in 899 The item d is described as d*={d\(Dli D12 clustering. We mine association rules among new itemsets I* generated from original itemsets I by time clustering assuming the elder activity original itemsets I={ a,b,c,d} \(a: getting up; b:toilet;c:dining;d:sleep The new itemsets I* should be I*= Ia@i i Dzz Dz D~ drc Dm: time scale We can get the distribution of elder  s activity from new itemsets I* for elder abnormal behavior detection. Then we analysis the relation of items by association rules mining method. In this paper, we choose the Apriori algorithm by R.Agrawa1 Secondly, Association rule mining is a two-step process  The first step is to find all frequent itemset. By definition, each of these itemsets will occur at least as Frequently as a pre-determined minimum support count The second step is to generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets. By definition, these rules must satisfy minimum support and minimum confidence. The overall performance of mining association rules is determined by the first step. Generation of candidate itemsets and frequent itemsets is shown in the Fig.4 32 D33 A f A 


f A Fig.3. Time cluster To discover the set of frequent 2-itemsets L, the algorithm uses Ll X LI to generate a candidate set of 2-itemsets Cz. the transactions in D are scaned again and the support count of each candidate itemset in Cz is accumulated. The set of frequent 2-itemsets C, is determined. Consisting of those candidate 2-itemsets in Cz having minimum support. And so on, until no more frequent k-itemsets can be found. if the subset of Ck can  t be find in Lk.,,we remove them from C3 based on the Apriori algorithm property that all subsets of a frequent itemset must also be frequent 838 Scan D for count of  each candidate suppot 22 30 29 20 21 I Compare candidate support with minimum support count support  Fig.4. Generation of candidate itemsets and frequent itemset In the Apriari algorithm, the item has not time scale, but in the itemsets I* for elder, every item has time scale. So we should update the join process which is used to produce the candidate itemset Ck from the k-1-itemsets Lk-l. The new join process is described by sql language as follow lNSERT into ck SELECTCp.iteml,p.item2,. . .,p.itemk.l,q.itemk.I FROM p\(inte-tim inte-timeJ WHERE p.iteml=q.iteml,. . .,p.itemk.2=q.itemk-~,p.item~-~&lt;q,~temL and s\(inte-time inte-time be-time: time scale of itemset p S\(inte-tim  s time scale E\(inte-time  time scale For example LI= \(a\(5:30,6:30 12:30,13:30 6:00,7:00 13:00,14 The result produced by join process 00 lS:00,19:00 C2= {a\(~:00,6:30 6:00,7:00 5:30,6:3OUb\( 13:00,14 40 5:30,6:30 I 8:0O, 19:00 12:3O, 13:30 13:00,1 3:30 12:30,13:30 IX :OO,19:OO Once the frequent itemsets f  transactions in a database D have been found, association rules can be generated as follow 1 subsets of 1 2  s-&gt;\(l-s  if supprt\(l s  is the minimum confidence threshold For example, for 2-itemsets C2={a\(S:00,6:30 6:00,7:00 transactions containing a\(5:00,6:00 6:00,7:00 and the number of transactions containing a\(5:00,6:00 25 \(in 30 days minimum confidence and support threshold both be 20 This rule a\(5:00,6:00 6:00,7:00 4. Discussion This work is a first step towards showing that everyday routines in the home are sufficiently structured so that activities can be detected in readings from ubiquitous 


activities can be detected in readings from ubiquitous sensors via supervised learning algorithms Some of the activities detected in this work include activities important  or medical applications such as toiIeting, bathing, and grooming with detection accuracies ranging from 25% to 89% depending on the evaluation criteria used. Therefore, systems like the one developed in this work may enable IT and health researchers to study behavior in the home, to recognize a significant number of the activities of interest to medical professionals, and ultimately to detect specific changes in behavior automatically From the data mining of the solitary elder  s daily life this research analyzes the relationship between elder  s activity time distribution and the activity, and then gets the association rules of elder  s actions. But the Life made of the elder is not invariable, as the elder  s age growing, it is sure that they will have some difference from the little younger stage, so we need to do a series work: Sample -* Explore 3 Modify 3 Model 3 Assess 4 the Sample circulation and the recursion process. The process of this research sampling automatically carries on by the infrared sensor that instatled in each room of the elder. Every recursion process will firstly do advance revision for the model, only until the guardianship side obtains the confirmation, it will execute the revision on the model The elder  s life model that founded by the method can reflect the individual character and the dynamic variability as the age increasing. It also has the advantage in automatically possess sampling and model revision online Because of the space limited, the correlative research reports on this subject will be discussed in the following thesis 839 5. ConcIusions References This article discusses the discovery of the unusual event in the aging society through data mining technology. Based on the personality, the continuity, the regularity and the dynamic variability ofthe activities of the solitary elders, it analyzes the relationship between the activities and the time as well as the relation between the events that based on time-scale. Through the association formula based on time cluster, the algorithm is created to analyze activities rules of the elder, so as to deduce the association formula of the elder activity ruk. It illustrates the inside relation of the daily data attributes of the solitary elder  s life, and the connotative and possible to be the unusual information. So with the application of data mining technology on the aging society, it can provide timely and appropriate services to the solitary elder and the disabled people I] ChenWenWei, Data Mining Techniques \(Chinese 83-86, BeGing Industrial University Press, 2002 2]  Takehisa Yairi; Yoshikiyo Kat0 and Koichi Hori, Fault Detection by Mining Association Rules from House-keeping Data, Proc. of International Symposium on ArtificiaI Intelligence, Robotics and Automation in space, 2001aa 3] JiaweiHan, Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques 164-172,China Machine Press, 2001 4] Tracy Barger; Donald Brown; Majd Alwan, Health Status Monitoring Through AnaIysis of BehaviotaI Patterns, the 8th congress of the Italian Association for Artificial Intelligence \(AI*IA Intelligence, Springer-Verlag, Pisa, Italy, September 2003 840 pre></body></html 


groups, and to be used to choose the relevant moments and also to test the accuracy reached by the method given by a human specialist s are classified either as benign or s done by radiologists and eventually confirmed by complementary exams. These kinds of lesion are tightly related to the image shape:  benign masses have well-defined smooth contours, while the malignant ones have their contours spread over the mammary parenchyma 4.1 Pre-processing of Images regions and execute the extraction of moments without a previous segmentation, which is mandatory when objects shape is employed to retrieve images, the Zernike Extractor executes some basic pre-processing procedures a\ Auto-level: stretching of the maximum and minimum gray levels of the image to the maximum interval \(0-255\ This is important because the majority of mammography ROIs is dim b Reduction of the number of levels: the gray levels are reduced to 12. The complete interval [0 i s  partitioned into 12 intervals and gray values that are in the same interval receive the same new value new_gray 000O old_gray  12  256 000P c Median filter: this filter reduces white noise without affecting the object contours, making the image regions more homogenous  these three processes can be applied at a unique scan on the grid of pixels of the image 4.2 Representative Moments The 3-step method described in Section 3 was executed over an image training set consisting of 90 images selected from the initial database In Step 1, moments of order 30 were extracted nt of 256 moments for each image Step 2 was executed twice: first using the wellknown C4.5 decision tree generator a n d t h e n  using the StARMiner. It was done in order to compare the performance of both algorithms. C4.5 generated a decision tree, where 38 moments were identified as relevant. StARMiner generated a set of association rules, where other 38 moments were identified as the most relevant In Step 3, the 38 relevant moments from both C4.5 and StARMiner were processed by FD-ASE algorithm FD-ASE uses a threshold parameter that determines the limit of influence that makes a feature dependent or not of another. For this dataset, the value of threshold was 0.5 s of influence had determined a set of 18 representative moments from the set of C4.5 38 relevant moments and another set of 16 representative moments from the set of StARMiner 38 relevant moments 4.3 Results K nearest neighbor queries were applied to the images from the database, taking randomly the query images and varying the values of k for all feature sets generated in Steps 1, 2 and 3 Figure 3 presents curves of precision vs. recall obtained with 256 moments \(Step 1\ 38 moments from C4.5, 38 moments from StARMiner \(Step 2\ 18 moments from FD-ASE after C4.5 and 16 moments from FD-ASE after StARMiner \(Step 3 Figure 3. Precision x recall: 256, 38, 18 and 16 moments By analyzing the graph, we conclude that 200 The results with 38 moments are better than with 256 moments for both StARMiner and C4.5. The dimensionality reduction of Step 2 has provided an nd 0.8\in r 0.2. The regions of low recall are the most important into a PACS environment because k nearest queries es of k These results testify that the dimensionality curse really damages the results: the irrelevant features disturb nce of the relevant ones 200 StARMiner reaches a better performance than C4.5.

while with C4.5 this value of recall is around 0.3 200 The dimensionality reduction of Step 3 does not rformance with 16 moments is the same as with 38 moments for StARMiner. The same occurs with C4.5 In order to verify that the final feature set is the minimal set that maintains the precision, one moment were removed from each feature set, resulting in 15 moments for StARMiner and 17 moments for C4.5 Figure 4 shows that precision suffers a critical decrease proving that the feature sets that were generated in Step 3 are the minimal representative ones Figure 4. Precision x recall: 18, 17, 16 and 15 moments 5. Conclusions A new method that combines classification and shape similarity retrieval of images has been presented. This s to retrieve shape description, statistical association rules to identify relevant attributes and fractal theory to reduce dimensionality. The experimental approach applies a preprocessing procedure that discards the need of image and the tool developed allow the user to execute k nearest neighbor queries retrieving the most suitable images, that is, the ones that belong to the same class of the query image and at the same time, are similar in shape to it The results of searching a database consisting of ROIs of breast tumoral masses show that a significant reduction in the number of features \205 from 256 to 16 moments \205 can be applied, leading to an increase to the accuracy of the method. The precision values es under 20%. The experimental results also show that the final set consisting of 16 moments is the minimal one that maintains the accuracy for classification tasks 6.

It should be noted that after the above process the resulting support constraint set may become inconsistent Thus in the next round the value c   m i 1 z i may be larger If that happens the larger value c does not interpret as the privacy condence level Instead it should be interpreted as an indicator for inconsistency of the support constraint set Thus the above privacy deletion procedure should only be carried out one time We should note that even if the condence level is higher that is c   m i 1 z i is small there is still possibility that the condential information specied by  I,s,S  is leaked in theory That is for each transaction database D that satises the constraints S wehave support  I D    s S   However no one may be able to recover this information since it is NP hard to infer this fact Support constraint inference has been extensively studied by Calders in 2 3 It would be interesting to consider conditional privacypreserving synthetic transaction database generations That is we say that no private information is leaked unless some hardness problems are solved efciently This is similar to the methodologies that are used in public key cryptography For example we believe that RSA encryption scheme is secure unless one can factorize large integers In our case we may assume that it is hard on average to efciently solve integer linear programs Based on this assumption we can say that unless integer linear programs could be solved efciently on average no privacy specied in P is leaked by S if the computed condence level c   m i 1 z i is small 5 Conclusions In this paper we discussed the general problems regarding privacy preserving synthetic transaction database generation for benchmark testing purpose In particular we showed that this problem is generally NP hard Approximation algorithms for both synthetic transaction database generation and privacy leakage condence level approximation have been proposed These approximation algorithms include solving a continuous variable linear program According to 6 l i n ear probl ems ha vi ng hundreds of t housands of continuous variables are regularly solved Thus if the support constraint set size is in the order of hundreds of thousands then these approximation algorithms are efcient on regular Pentium-based computers If more constraints are necessary then more powerful computers are needed to generate synthetic transaction databases References 1 R  A g r a w al T  Imilien sk i an d A  S w a mi Min in g association rules between sets of items in large databases In Proc of ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Database  pages 207216 1993  T  C a lders  Axiomatization and Deduction Rules for the Frequency of Itemsets  PhD Thesis Universiteit Antwerpen 2003  T  C a l ders  C omput at i onal compl e x i t y of i t e ms et frequency satisability In Proc 23rd ACM PODS 04  pages 143154 ACM Press 2004  R  F agi n J  Hal pern and N Me gi ddo A l ogi c f or reasoning about probabilities Information and Computation  87 1,2\78128 1990  G Geor gak opoul os  D  K a v v a di as  a nd C  P a padi mitriou Probabilistic satisability J of Complexity  4 111 1988  Li near P r ogrammi ng F r equent l y As k e d Q ues t i ons  http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/otc Guide/faq/linear-programming-faq html  T  M ielik  ainen On inverse frequent set mining In Proc of 2nd Workshop on Privacy Preserving Data Mining PPDM  pages 1823 IEEE Computer Society 2003  C  P o t t s  A nal ys i s of a l i n ear programmi ng heuri s t i c for scheduling unrelated parallel machines Discrete Appl Math 10 155164 1985 9 G  R amesh  W  Man iatty  a n d M Zak i Feasib le itemset distributions in data mining theory and application In Proc 22nd ACM PODS  pages 284295 2003  Y  W a ng X W u  a nd Y  Zheng P r i v ac y p res ervi ng data generation for database application performance testing In Proc 1st Int Conf on Trust and Privacy in Digital Business TrustBus 04 together with DEXA  LNCS 3184 pages 142-151 2004 Springer-Verlag  X W u  Y  W u Y  W a ng and Y  Li P ri v a c y a w are mar ket basket data set generation a feasible approach for inverse frequent set mining In Proc 5th SIAM International Conference on Data Mining  April 2005  Z Zheng R  K oha vi  a nd L Mas on R eal w o rl d performance of association rule algorithms In Proc of the ACM-SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining  pages 401 406 ACM Press 2001 8 Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

In Algorithm 2 we merge them in a Closet-like computation obtaining CCIMiner Algorithm 2 CCIMiner Input: X,D |X , C, Edge,MP5, CAM , CM X is a closed itemset D |X is the conditional dataset C is the set of closed itemsets visited so far Edge set of itemsets to be used in the BackwardMining MP5 solution itemsets discovered so far CAM , CM constraints Output: MP5 1: C = C ?X 2: if  CAM \(X 3: Edge = Edge ?X 4: else 5: if CM \(X 6: MP5 = MP5 ?X 7: for all i ? flist\(D |X 8: I = X ? {i} // new itemset avoid duplicates 9: if  Y ?

Experimental Results The aim of our experimentation is to measure performance bene?ts given by our framework, and to quantify the information gained w.r.t. the other lossy approaches 


approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
