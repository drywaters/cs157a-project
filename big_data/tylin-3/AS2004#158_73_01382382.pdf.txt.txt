This tool incorporates the hqnan-machlne interactive methods to lead the user to perfom data mining. The system can interactively perform data flassifcation, relativity analysis, assoeiation rule analysis and implement the roll-up and drill-down functions We also tert the functions of this system using several rad data sets Keywords COOrdiaste 1. Introduction data mining; visualization; visval data mining; parallel Data mining is a process which can extract connotative, unknown before and latent knowledge from hugely incomplete, blurry and random data. However, data mining envisage gigantic amount of database or data warehouse. Its process is time-consuming and technology-complex, and it can find a great deal of unused noise data and knowledge. Therefore, in the data mining process, we should use the effective way to observe the distributing and structure of data clearly, to understand the mutual relation and developing trend of data and to catch on the process and results of data mining. The Visual Data Mining \(VDM data mining can provide a effective way to solve this problem This paper summarizes current data mining technologies and tools, and presents a visual data mining tool VisDM-PC based on parallel coordinate. This tool includes many functions: open database connection, data exhibition, data analysis and human-machine interaction We have applied VisDM-PC in many data minipg fields 2. High dimensional data visualization and its parallel coordinate representation Presently, there are many ways for data visualization such as: \(1 2 3 other technologies etc[11'21[31. In the visualization ways mentioned above, Parallel coordinate based on icon represent high dimensional data set as 2 dimension icon This way is the same with very high dimensional data sets in which the amount of data objects is not much, we can observe the distribution and structure of data directly according parallel coordinate Parallel coordinate is one of the muliti-dimensional data visual technologies represented by two dimensional for"41[s1. Its-basic idea is that the description of a higher dimensional object is captured, to a considerable extent, in the 2-dimensional representation of the envelops of the polygonal lines representing its points. Points are denoted by capitals, and lines \(or arcs of curves letters respectively. On the plane with xy-Cartesian coordinates, and stating on the y-axis, N copies of the real line, labeled xl,x2, - * * , XN, are placed equidistant and perpendicular to the x-axis. Figure1 is an illustration that parallel coordination represents a point in high dimensional data space I i X I Figure 1, Parallel coordinate representation of a point in 3-D One aait by which Parallel coordinate differs from 


One aait by which Parallel coordinate differs from other visual technologies is that Parallel coordinate can not only display data points, but also represent the relation between data. Points on the plane are represented by segments between the x 1 and x2-axis.

Duality induced in the plane by parallel coordiiates In the parallel coordinates, the intersecting point is defined by the slope of line in xy-Cartesian. It follows that the intersecting point is to the right of the x2-axis , for h &lt; l ,  on the ship between the axes for mcO, and to the left of the x,-axis when ml. Horizontal and vertical lines are represented by points on the x and x-axis respectively Figure 3\(a slope m; \(b I x2 I XI b I - m  I-m a X .kXI  Figure 3.

Figure 4 is the projection of lines in ten dimension   I Figure 4. Pamllel coordinate representation of lines in 10-dimension Compared with traditional Caxtesian coordinates, the main merit of parallel coordinates is that the dimension amount decides the width of screen, it need not use vector or other visual icons. When the dimension amount increases, it is difficult for the traditional coordinate to represent data information. When the data set is very large many overlapping lines make the folding density large hierarchy is faint, users identified them difficultly. So we organize the data set by hierarchy and induct interaction ways to decrease confusion 3. Visual data minhg tool based on parallel coordinate: ViDM-PC VisDM-PC which developed from IBM VisualAge for 1 245 JAVA V4.0 can be applied by any browsers 3.1. Description of the VisDM-PC VisDM-PC includes the following aspects User Interface: it can submit the user's query and 


User Interface: it can submit the user's query and knowledge discovery requirements according the buttons and mouse drag Database: it can receive data from the multi database and data warehouse Data Preprocessing: it normalizes the data before visualization according to it, so the data can be showed in the parallel coordinates Data Visualization: users can select and observe any subsets from the whole data in graphics Interaction: data selection, graphical color graphical properties etc can be defined freely Development Plat: this system is developed by IE3M Visual Age for JAVA V5.0 Applications: it can be applied in commerce finance, science, education and information management etc 3.2. Functions of ViDM-PC The system structure of VisDM-PC is showed in Figure 5 1 information source by loading the data from existent database or data warehouse 2 set of models or functions to describe the typical features of data sets 3 is the trend of data measurement, interacting parallel coordinate can not only give the average data mean of whole data, also show the data arithmetical mean of any data subsets 4 the quarter.

VisDM-PC can exchange the coordinate so as to help user compare the data 6 interested and compute the relationship by the following formula 5 n i s  the number of data object, Avg\(A average mean in attribute A and B respectively. SA and S are the variances normalized If DO, then it denotes that they are positive correlation r is much bigger which represents one attribute includes another attribute more possibly If r=O, then it denotes that they are independent If r &lt;O, then it denotes that negative correlation, one attribute will prevent another athibute appearing 7 knowledge come forth frequently from given. data sets They like X=&gt;Y etc. VisDM-PC set two rules Minimum Support and Minimum Confidence which Gill be showed by the area and color of region Ordinary correlation rules mining algorithms can mine plentiful strong correlation rules, there are many redundancy and useless in them, so this will affect users support and confidence to system. Our system will let users select data and compute the support and confidence of them In fact, the correlation rules are given by the user, which have s&amp;nger purpose. User need not know the program or computing ways of correlation rules which are showed in visualization to represent the correlation grade of data by VisDM-PC 8 sometimes to analyze data in hierarchy. The transformation between different bierarchies are named roll-up and drill-down. VisDM-PC will display the roll-up and drill-down in visualization

 Suppose we have three parties :d1, d2, d3 ; the "miner and two calculators. Let us take a look on some itemset ABC, see Figure 2 The Miner sends the random noises: 3,2,1 to the three parties respectively   Figure 2:  The second algorithm  Next, all the parties add the noise to the number of appearances of every set and send the results to both calculators, in this case for ABC: the first party sends 2+3 = 5 and 2-3 = -1, the second 2+2 = 4 and 2-2=0 the third 2+1=3 and 2-1=1 Next \(see Figure 3\ng the Apriori algorithm to compute support of some itemset, the Miner selects some random number R, sends R to first calculator which adds his support about the itemset and sends R1 to the  second calculator, which  computes R2 and sends it to the Miner. The Miner computes R2 \226 R\\(2*3\ and this is the support of itemset ABC    Figure 3: Second algorithm \226 computing the support  3.2.2 Second version \(using the lemma  Basically the same algorithm, except for the following  changes 1 Initially, the miner chooses an encryption key to encrypt each item-set and send it to all participants 2 The participants, before sending their two databases to the calculators encrypt the corresponding itemsets 3 the participants compute the frequent itemsets locally and send results to the miner The Miner does the Apriori only for itemsets of which one of the local parties has found frequent! \(i.e. using the Lemma For those   itemsets, it sends the calculators their encrypted for to enable them to retrieve their respective frequency  Privacy analysis  Same as the first algorithm  except  that the Miner now knows frequency of itemset at local sites  The purpose of the encryption is to prevent the calculators from knowing that a particular itemset is frequent at some local database  To prevent the Miner from knowing the local site frequency, we can add an extra Mediator site. The mediator will not know the itemset which is currently being tested, but will get the frequency counts from the various sites and just send the Miner a flag whether there is a site in which the frequency of the itemset is above the threshold. This increases the privacy but introduces additional communication overhead The computation and communication overhead are less than in the previous  algorithm because of the use of the Lemma, but obviously, this algorithm also requires exponential space for each of the local databases, therefore we need the third  version   3.2.3 Third version \(using Apriori and the lemma  This algorithm is a mix of the first algorithm \(3.1 and the last one The Miner performs the Apriori algorithm, and at each step asks the participants to send the two frequency results with the noise to the calculators. Then the Miner asks for the support from the calculators as before. This algorithm has the same security properties as the previous two, however, no encryption is necessary, since as in the first algorithm, the Claculators don\222t know which itemset is being computed The  communication overhead of this version  is higher than in the first two versions and is similar to the overhead in the first algorithm. The main advantage of-course is that the local parties don\222t need to create and send large \(exponential\  databases  3.3 Third algorithm General DB   The mode l The same as in the first model, one miner, one calculator and N participants. Also, all the definitions stay as in the first algorithm,  except the for goal  The goal  To perform any data mining algorithm without compromising privacy  The algorithm  The mine r   Calculato r 1 Calculato r 2 A B C  1 | 1  1 1 2 | 1  1 1 3 |0  0  1 A B C  4 | 1  1 1 5 | 1  1 1 6 |0  0  1 A B C  7 | 1  1 1 8 | 1  1 1 9 | 0  0 1 The mine r  Calculato r 1 Calculato r 2 


 Step 1 The "miner" tells to the participants to add N versions of  specific pseudorandom  noise to their data and to send it to the "calculator". That it, the calculator gets from each participant its database N times.\(with a different noise  Step 2 The miner sends to the calculator some "seed" to create the pseudo-random noise. This seed will create a noise which is identical to one of the N noises, but the calculator doesn\222t know which one it is  Step 3 For every created noise the calculator subtract the noise from all N databases and perform the mining and sends the results back to the miner  Step 4 The miner picks up the right results  Privacy analysis  The parties \226 learn nothing but the results The miner \226 learns global data mining results but nothing on the local databases The calculator \226 The Calculator has one real database out of the N databases, so he has the probability of 1/N to learn everything! Obviously we can reduce this probability by adding some more artificial partcipants but each such participant increases the computation overhead  Computation and Communication overhead  The computation overhead is much higher, it is essentially multiplied by N. The communication overhead is N*overhead of Algorithm 2, but this is a one-shot overhead, and the communication overhead between the Miner and the Calculator is greatly reduced \(one message only  4. Conclusions   We discussed the problem of privacy-preserving data mining in distributed databases. We suggested a new architecture \(paradigm\ which is based on using two separate entities: a Miner and a Calculator, both not having parts of the database. We presented three algorithms which are based on this paradigm, one for Vertically partitioned data, one for Horizontally partitioned data, and one for any data mining method In contrast to the previously known methods of Perturbation or Secure computation, our algorithms produce accurate results \(better than perturbation\, but usually with much less computation and communication overhead than secure computation In the future we plan to investigate these algorithms and evaluate their performance on real-life databases   Acknowledgment   Thanks to the reviewers for their useful comments    References  1 R  A g r a w a l a nd R   Sr i k a n t  P r i v ac y pr es e r v i ng da t a  mining.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and benet the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R  A gra w al and R  S r i kant   Fast Al gori t h ms for M i n i n g A ssociation Rules Proc of the 20th VLDB Conf  1994 pp 487499  R Agra w a l and J C S hafer  Paral l e l M i n i n g o f A ssoci at i o n Rules IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 8 No 6 1996 pp 962969 3 M  S  C hen J Han and P  S  Y u   Dat a Mi ni ng An Overview from a Database Perspective IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 8 No 6 1996 pp 866883 4 D  W  C heung S  D L ee and Y  Xi ao  E f f ect of Dat a S k e w ness and Workload Balance in Parallel Data Mining IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 14 No 3 2002 pp 498514 5 S  M  C hung and J Y ang  A Par al l e l D i s t r i b ut i v e J oi n A l gorithm for Cube-Connected Multiprocessors IEEE Trans on Parallel and Distributed Systems  Vol 7 No 2 1996 pp 127137  R  F e l dman and H Hi rsh F i ndi ng Associ at i ons i n Col l ections of Text Machine Learning and Data Mining Methods and Applications  R Michalski I Bratko and M Kubat editors John Wiley and Sons 1998 pp 223240  R F e l dman I Dagen and H  H i rsh Mi ni ng T e xt Usi n g Keyword Distributions Journal of Intelligent Information Systems  Vol 10 No 3 1998 pp 281300  C  Fox L e x i cal Anal ysi s and S t opl i s t s   Inforamtion Retrieval Data Structures and Algorithms W.FrakesandR Baeza-Yates editors Prentice Hall 1992 pp 102130 9 M  G or don and S  Dumai s Usi ng L a t e nt S e mant i c I nde xi ng for Literature Based Discovery Journal of the Amer Soc of Info Science  Vol 49 No 8 1998 pp 674685  J Han J P e i  and Y  Y i n Mi n i n g F r equent Pat t e r n s w i t hout Candidate Generation Proc of ACM SIGMOD Intl Conf on Management of Data  2000 pp 112  J D Holt and S  M Chung Multipass Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Text Databases Knowledge and Information Systems  Vol 3 No 2 Springer-Verlag 2001 pp 168183  J D Hol t and S  M C hung Mi ni ng Associ at i o n R ul es Using Inverted Hashing and Pruning Information Processing Letters  Vol 83 No 4 Elsevier Science 2002 pp 211220  J D Hol t and S  M C hung Mi ni ng associ at i o n R ul es i n Text Databases Using Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning Proc of the 14th IEEE Intl Conf on Tools with Articial Intelligence  2002 pp 4956  J S  Park M S  C hen and P  S  Y u   Usi n g a Hash-B a sed Method with Transaction Trimming for Mining Association Rules IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 9 No 5 1997 pp 813825  G  S a l t on Automatic Text Processing The Transformation Analysis and Retrieval of Information by Computer  Addison-Wesley Publishing 1988  E  M V oorhees and D K Harmon edi t o rs The Fifth Text Retrieval Conference  National Institute of Standards and Technology 1997  O R  Z a i a ne and M L  Ant o i ne C l assi f y i n g T e x t D ocuments by Associating Terms with Text Categories Proc of the 13th Australian Database Conf  2002 0-7695-2132-0/04/$17.00 \(C Proceedings of the 18th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium \(IPDPS04 


  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
