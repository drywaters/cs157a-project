In routine learning, already recognized contexts are utilized in modeling the user behavior The methodology is presented via a use case scenario. Data collected from various ubiquitous sensors are used in recognizing and defining contexts, and association rules determine the routines. The focus is on testing the suitability of the Apriori algorithm for this application area. Several useful routines were derived from the user data, and the results show that data mining can be utilized in pervasive computing Keywords: Pervasive computing, association rules machine learning, context-awareness, locationing 1. Introduction This paper is for reporting and analyzing the connection of data mining algorithms and routine learning in a mobile environment. A routine is a temporal \(context Routine learning has been studied in the frameworks of building intelligent or smart homes [1], [2], [3], in assisting patients with Alzheimer  s [4], [5], and studying PC users  behavior [6 In data mining [7], data analysis is generally done after the data has been collected. In a mobile environment, it is necessary to consider also the situations, where data is analyzed in real-time and the results of the analysis are sent to the user straight away in order to make things easier for her. Also usually the data mining algorithms available are designed keeping in mind the fact, that a human analyses the results. When ubiquitous computing is concerned, this is not always the case. The system has to be automatic, and there should be minor interaction with the user. All in all, the problem is to specify what user actions and contexts are really important and meaningful We have generated a use case Know Your Whereabouts [8] that contains a vision of an intelligent mobile device, which records the actions and locations of the user, and identifies the user  s routines based on sensory information. The work started with recognizing important places from location data and associating simple actions to these locations. Context recognition is certainly an important factor in the system, but in this paper, we label the contexts by hand \(guidelines are taken from real data In [9], [10], [11], and [12] there are algorithms for recognizing the contexts of a mobile user, carrying similar sensors we have used. Later on, we are going to user these algorithms for recognizing the contexts from our versatile data set Here, routine learning is considered as associating different contexts into each other. These associations are derived as IF-THEN rules, called association rules. The Apriori algorithm [13] is tested for deriving these rules from a data set, collected in an office environment. The results show that it is possible to utilize data mining in a mobile environment 2. Know your whereabouts Know Your Whereabouts [8] is a scenario on routine learning. The test settings for routine learning 


routine learning. The test settings for routine learning were designed based on this application scenario. In this section, the basic principles for enabling routine learning are described The scenario is the following Marie buys a new mobile device. She is not very familiar with all the services the device has to offer so she mainly uses it as a phone. Marie also has an electronic calendar. She takes the phone along everywhere she goes After a week, the device asks Marie if she wants to get familiar with all the possibilities of the device. If Marie helped the device to place her important locations on the map, she could start to use the location-sensitive services Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing  ITCC  04 0-7695-2108-8/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Figure 1. Scenes for Know Your Wherabouts From her friends, Marie has heard that these services are really convenient and she therefore wants to try them. The phone presents a map of the places Marie has frequently visited and asks her to name these places. Marie names the places and, for some time, plays with the new navigation service which is activated by clicking the names of the places in the calendar. The device shows a route from her current location to the clicked place Marie cannot believe her eyes when the device asks whether she would like the device to go automatically into a silent mode when she enters the meeting room in her office. This is something she has been waiting for Marie will have a meeting in half an hour at her office and she is still at home. The device reminds her that it is time to go Marie goes to a meeting at the office. The device is silent The user  s important locations can be determined based on the location data. After the important places have been identified, the user is asked to name them In this way, each place gets a higher and more abstract meaning attached to it. The device guides the user to give generally known names for locations When ``home'' is used to label the user's home, all services that understand the concept of home can start to utilize this information, for example. Also, the user can ignore some places if she does not think they are important The important places could be the office, the meeting room 1, the meeting room 2, the coffee room etc. The mobile device also records the changes of profile \(time stamps included loud, beep, normal mode, etc. An imaginary data matrix of user behaviors is presented in Table 1 In Table 1, the user contexts are expressed as variables \(Loc for location, and Mode for phone profile variable. If the user \(or device indentified by a variable, the value of the corresponding variable is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of the variable is zero Table 1. An imaginary data matrix for user contexts Ti me Loc M1 Loc M2 Loc

Another interesting problem is to predict, what the user is about to do next. Thus the events that occur in \(temporal be identified. In the next section, a method for finding associations from a data matrix of the kind shown above is described 3. Association rules Association rules were initially developed for analyzing market-basket data where rules like "A customer who buys beer and sausage will also buy diapers with probability 0.85." The Boolean data matrix in Table 1 suggests what routine learning could be like. By following the use case and the data matrix in Table 1, rules \(or associations L o c M e e t 1  M o d e S i l e n t  o r  L o c O f f  M o d e B e e p could be recognized. These rules are called association rules, and in the following, definitions and methodology about finding these association rules are described A n  a s s o c i a t i o n  r u l e  i s  a n  e x p r e s s i o n  X  Y   w h e r e X and Y are sets of items. Given a database D of transactions, where each transaction DT ? is a set o f  i t e m s   X  Y  e x p r e s s e s  t h a t  w h e n e v e r  a transaction T contains X then T probably contains Y also. The probability is called the rule confidence and it is defined as the percentage of transactions containing Y in addition to X with regard to the overall number of transactions containing X. In other words, the rule confidence is the conditional probability TXTYP Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing  ITCC  04 0-7695-2108-8/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE The most common algorithm in discovering association rules is the Apriori algorithm developed by Agrawal et al. [13], [14]. The basic goal is to find all combinations of items that have certain userspecified minimum support \(minsup minconf support above minimum support are called large itemsets and all other combinations small itemsets The large itemsets are used to generate desired rules That is if, say ABCD and AB are large itemset, then w e  c a n  d e t e r m i n e  i f  t h e  r u l e  A B  C D  h o l d s  b y computing the ratio r=S\(ABCD AB r&gt;minconf, then holds the rule. The rule will have minimum support because ABCD is large The pseudo code for Apriori algorithm is described below \(from [13 1. =1L {large itemsets 2. for \( kLk k ;;2 1 3. kC =apriori-gen\( 1?kL 4. forall transactions Tt ? do begin

The large itemsets 1?kL found in the earlier pass are used to generate candidate itemsets kC \(function apriorigen, found in [13 kC is counted In this paper, different values for minimum confidence and support were tested, in order to achieve association rules for routine learning 4. Test settings The data for testing routine learning were collected in the research group's office space. A Compaq iPAQ with a Wireless LAN card was used for the data collection. A Wireless LAN covers the whole office space and the location of the user is achieved using Ekahau [15], which tracks the location of the Wireless LAN card \(therefore, the location of the iPAQ devices for acceleration \(x,y,z temperature, skin conductivity, and illumination was attached to the PDA. A more detailed description of the sensor box can be found from [16 The data collected consisted of three different scenarios. One scenario was about 20 minutes long The first scenario was repeated 10 times, the second and the third 5 times. The sampling frequency for the sensor box is 10Hz and for the Ekahau 0.5Hz Data was collected by going to different locations in the research group's office space. One of the three scenarios is described below 1. The testee sits by a desk in location 1 for about six minutes. The device is on the table illumination sensor upwards 2. The testee gets up and walks to the elevators location 4 3. When the elevator arrives, the testee steps into the elevator, and goes down to the first floor in the building 4. When arriving downstairs, the testee gets out of the elevator and walks to the main doors location 5 5. At the doors, the testee steps outside, and walks to the door beside a corridor \(location 6 6. The testee walks back to location 1 The data was tagged every time a context changed This way, the recognition of different contexts can be verified. At this point, the contexts were labeled by hand for further processing with the APriori algorithm, however. This means, that apriori information from the tags were used in determining the contexts, and no actual context recognition occurred. Later on, we are going to use the data for context recognition The important locations were derived from the location data. The methodology of [8] was used here The important location is considered as a circle, the radius covering an area of one room in our research laboratory. If the user stays in one location for more than five minutes, and on two different occations during the measurement period, then it is considered to be important The known contexts labeled \(and the sensor 


The known contexts labeled \(and the sensor measuring the situation  walking, walking downstairs, walking upstairs sitting, in an elevator \(acceleration signals  inside, outside \(illumination  in the office, in a library, in a lobby, in a stairway, in a restaurant \(Ekahau Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing  ITCC  04 0-7695-2108-8/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE Also, a context variable describing the profile status of a PDA \(mobile phone matrix. It was assumed that in each location a suitable profile was used. The profiles are general, silent outdoors, and meeting A binary data matrix was generated for the user behavior and contexts. The context variables were arranged according to the sensorbox data, so the transaction database consisted of over 6000 lines. In other words, this transaction file has 16 columns for the contexts and for each context there is either 0 or 1 indicating, whether the user is in this particular context. The Apriori algorithm was implemented with java 5. Results and discussion The routine learning starts by identifying important places from location data. In [8], we have verified that it is possible to associate simple contexts or actions to these locations using the \(simplified methodology of the Apriori algorithm. We built a prototype for an architecture, which aids in building interactive mobile services that adapt to the user  s situation. In our previous experiments, we had a data set consisting of over 60 hours of location data for three different users. In our prototype, a PDA could be profiled into general, meeting, silent or outdoors modes. The routines identified for one testee were \(26 hours of data collection L o c a t i o n  T S 3 8 0   M o d e  G e n e r a l  L o c a t i o n  T S 3 3 5   M o d e  M e e t i n g  L o c a t i o n  L a b X   M o d e  S i l e n t  L o c a t i o n  R o b o l a b   M o d e  S i l e n t  L o c a t i o n  C o f f e e R o o m   M o d e  G e n e r a l  L o c a t i o n  S t a i r w a y   M o d e  G e n e r a l   a n d L o c a t i o n  M e d i a l a b   M o d e  M e e t i n g  For another testee, data were collected for about 22 hours. In this test, eight important locations were correctly recognized, and four routines were detected From the third test, which lasted for a total of about 12 hours, three important locations were recognized and two routines detected. The amount of data in the database grows considerably as several users join the network. Each user provides merely 2.4 M of location data per each 24 hours. In the first prototype, the database is flushed of the actual location and profile from time to time In this paper, we wanted to test a more complex setting and extend the number of contexts. In the first prototype, the important locations and PDA profiles were considered. Therefore, there are only two variables to consider and one needs to calculate only the confidences values for these two variables, one for each important location. In this paper, there are several other contexts \(walking, sitting etc consider, so the Apriori algorithm is utilized with its full extent. The binary matrix containing the context variables was processed with the Apriori algorithm and different support and confidence values were tested. The processing time of our data set was less than one second. All the combinations for support values of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and confidence 


values of 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1 were tested. First the algorithm produces the frequent k-itemsets, and then the rules. The most interesting rules were generated with a low support value and high confidence. This is natural, since it is important to know if some contexts occur together in most of the cases. If the user visits a meeting room only twice during the measurement period and always switches the profile into a silent mode, for example. Below, the rules for the support value of 0.1 and confidence value of 0.8 are shown W a l k i n g   g e n e r a l   i n s i d e  0  9 4 I n  t h e  O f f i c e   g e n e r a l   1 I n  t h e  O f f i c e   s i t t i n g   i n s i d e   g e n e r a l   1 I n  t h e  l i b r a r y    s i t t i n g   i n s i d e   s i l e n t   1 I n  t h e  l o b b y   s i t t i n g   i n s i d e   m e e t i n g   1 S i l e n t   s i t t i n g   i n s i d e   i n  l i b r a r y   1 The rules are more diversified than in our first prototype, since the user contexts sitting, walking etc. have been considered also. When in the office the user is probably sitting, she is inside, and the profile of the PDA is on a general mode, etc The number of rules was 97, but the rules shown above are selected so, that the location or the profile context is the main factor for the rule. The other rules are basically combinations of these rules. It seems that the methodology can be used in routine learning as long as the number of contexts is not very high In Figure 2, the important locations derived from the location data collected are shown. There were three recognized places. Also, the routines identified with the Apriori algorithm, are shown. When these rules have been presented to the user, she can select and automate some of the actions. For example, the user can verify, that when in the library, the profile should be switched into a silent mode. Also, the contrast of the PDA display can be set higher or the ringing volume of a mobile phone set louder when outdoors, for example Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Technology: Coding and Computing  ITCC  04 0-7695-2108-8/04 $ 20.00  2004 IEEE The rule inside does not seem very important here but it is because the data was mainly collected indoors. If different scenarios are considered the meaning of indoors and outdoors would be more evident Figure 2. Important locations and routines identified In this paper, it was assumed that the contexts used here can be reliably recognized. In our future work the main problem will be the fuzziness of the situations. We probably cannot make a binary assumption for each of these contexts. The location contexts are easily verified with map information, but the walking, running, sitting etc. contexts, derived from the acceleration signals might not be so straightforward Furthermore, longer periods of data collection will be done. It is worth studying, how the rules already identified can be utilized when new data arrives, since the database must be flushed from redundant context data to avoid overflows Acknowledgments This work was funded by TEKES and Academy of Finland.

Observe that I2 is a superset of I1: it contains all closed itemsets which are under the CAM border \(as I1 plus those itemsets which arise in equivalence classes which are cut by the CAM border \(such as for instance ce and cde in Figure 3\(a Proposition 3 Cl\(FThD\(Cfreq ?

Using free sets interpretations I1 and I2 coincide when dealing with anti-monotone constraints because minimal elements are not cut o? by the constraint \(e.g. de in Fig. 3\(a constraints \(e.g. no free solution itemsets in Fig. 3\(b Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 4. Algorithms In this Section we study algorithms for the computation of MP5. We ?rst discuss separately how monotone and anti-monotone constraints can be pushed in the computation, then we show how they can be exploited together by introducing the CCIMiner algorithm 4.1. Pushing Monotone Constraints Pushing CAM constraints deep into the frequent itemset mining algorithm \(attacking the problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CAM  since they behave exactly as Cfreq . The case is di?erent for CM constraints, since they behave exactly the opposite of frequency. Indeed, CAM constraints can be used to e?ectively prune the search space to a small downward closed collection, while the upward closed collection of the search space satisfying the CM constraints cannot be exploited at the same time. This tradeo? holding on the search space of the computational problem FThD\(Cfreq[D,?] ? CM extensively studied [18, 9, 4], but all these studies have failed to ?nd the real synergy of these two opposite types of constraints, until the recent proposal of ExAnte [6]. In that work it has been shown that a real synergy of the two opposites exists and can be exploited by reasoning on both the itemset search space and the transactions input database 


set search space and the transactions input database together According to this approach each transaction can be analyzed to understand whether it can support any solution itemset, and if it is not the case, it can be pruned In this way we prune the dataset, and we get the fruitful side e?ect to lower the support of many useless itemsets, that in this way will be pruned because of the frequency constraint, strongly reducing the search space. Such approach is performed with two successive reductions  reduction \(based on monotonicity reduction \(based on anti-monotonicity to  reduction we can delete transactions which do not satisfy CM , in fact no subset of such transactions satis?es CM and therefore such transactions cannot support any solution itemsets. After such reduction, a singleton item may happen to become infrequent in the pruned dataset, an thus it can be deleted by the ?reductions. Of course, these two step can be repeated until a ?xed point is reached, i.e. no more pruning is possible. This simple yet very e?ective idea has been generalized in an Apriori-like breadth-?rst computation in ExAMiner [5], and in a FP-growth [10] based depth-?rst computation in FP-Bonsai [7 Since in general depth-?rst approaches are much more e?cient when mining closed itemsets, and since FP-Bonsai has proven to be more e?cient than ExAMiner, we decide here to use a FP-growth based depth?rst strategy for the mining problem MP5. Thus we combine Closet [16], which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining closed frequent itemset, with FPBonsai, which is the FP-growth based algorithm for mining frequent itemset with CM constraints 4.2. Pushing Anti-monotone Constraints Anti-monotone constraints CAM can be easily pushed in a Closet computation by using them in the exact same way as the frequency constraint, exploiting the downward closure property of antimonotone constraints.

Experimental Results The aim of our experimentation is to measure performance bene?ts given by our framework, and to quantify the information gained w.r.t. the other lossy approaches 


approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
