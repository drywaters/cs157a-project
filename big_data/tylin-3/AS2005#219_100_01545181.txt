Localization and map making is an important function of mobile robots One possible task to assist with this functionality is to use laser scan matching In laser scan matching the position and orientation or pose of the current scan is sought with respect to a reference laser scan by adjusting the pose of the current scan until the best o v erlap with the reference scan is achie v ed In the literature there are methods for 2D and 3D scan matching This paper is oriented to w ards 2D scan matching only  therefore in this paper scan matching is restricted to 2D laser scan matching Scan matching approaches can be local 12  or global 15  Scan matching approaches also 
can be cate gorized based on their association method such as feature to feature point to feature and point to point In feature to feature matching approaches features such as line se gments 8  corners or range e xtrema 11  are e xtracted from laser scans and then matched Such approaches interpret laser scans and require the presence of chosen features in the en vironment In point to feature approaches such as one of the earliest by Cox 5 the points of a scan are matched to features such as lines The line features can be part of a predened map Features can be more abstract as in 3  where features are Gaussian distrib utions with their mean and v ariance 
calculated from scan points f alling into cells of a grid Point to point matching approaches such as the approach presented in this paper  do not require the en vironment to be structured or contain predened features Examples of point to point matching approaches are the follo wing iterati v e closest point ICP iterati v e matching range point IMRP and the popular iterati v e dual correspondence IDC In the Besl and Mac Kay 2 proposed ICP  where for each point of the current scan the point with the smallest Euclidean distance in the reference scan is selected IMPR w as proposed by Lu and Milios 12  where corresponding points are selected by choosing a point which 
has the matching range from the origin IDC also proposed by Lu and Milios 12  combines ICP and IMRP by using the ICP to calculate translation and IMPR to calculate rotation The mentioned point to point methods can nd the correct pose of the current scan in one step pro vided the correct associations are chosen Since the correct associations are unkno wn se v eral iterations are performed Matching may not al w ays con v er ge to the correct pose since the y can get stuck in a local minima Due to the applied association rules matching points ha v e to be searched across 2 scans resulting in O n 2  comple xity  where n 
is the number of scan points All three approaches operate in a Cartesian coordinate frame and therefore do not tak e adv antage of the nati v e polar coordinate system of a laser scan There are other scan matching approaches such as the method of W eiss and Puttkamer 16  Here for both reference and current scans an angle-histogram of the orientation of line se gments connecting consecuti v e points is generated The orientation of the current scan with respect to the reference scan is obtained by nding the phase with the maximum cross correlation of the 2 angle histograms The translation is found similarly by calculating x and y histograms and calculating cross correlations In scan matching not 
all approaches use only that information in a scan which describes where objects are Thrun et al 14  in their scan matching method utilize the idea that free space in a scan is unlik ely to be occupied in future scans In scan matching another important task apart from nding the current scans pose is the estimation of the quality of the match Lu and Milios 12  calculates the uncertainty of the match results by assuming white Gaussian noise in the x,y coordinates of scan points This implicitly assumes that correct associations are made that results in optimistic error estimates especially in corridors Bengtsson and Baerv eldt in 1  de v eloped more realistic approaches In their rst 


approach the pose co v ariance matrix is estimated from the Hessian of the scan matching error function In their second approach the co v ariance matrix is estimated of f-line by simulating current scans and matching them to the reference scan Mapping with scan matching has been done for e xample by minimizing an ener gy function 13  using a combination of maximum lik elihood with posterior estimation 14  using local re gistration and global correlation 8  and using F astSLAM 9  A Kalman lter implementation can be found in 4  In this paper we present a no v el scan matching approach called Polar Scan Matching PSM which w orks in the laser scanner s polar coordinate system therefore taking adv antage of the structure of the laser measurements Laser range measurements of current and reference scans are associated with each other using the matching bearing rule which eliminates the search for corresponding points The rest of the paper is or ganized as follo ws rst our PSM algorithm is described follo wed by a Kalman lter SLAM implementation utilizing our scan matching approach Details of e xperimental results follo w that include simulation ground truth measurements and an implementation of SLAM Finally conclusions and future w ork are presented A more detailed description of PSM can be found in 6 The source code of PSM can be do wnloaded from www irrc.monash.edu.au/adio si I I  P O L A R S C A N M A T C H I N G The laser scan matching method described ne xt aligns the current scan with respect to the reference scan so that the sum of square range residuals is minimized It is assumed that an initial pose of the current scan is gi v en e xpressed in the coordinate frame of the reference scan The coor dinate frame of a laser scan is centered at the point of rotation of the mirror of a laser scanner  The X axis or zero angle coinciding with the direction of the rst reported range measurement The current scan is described as C   x c  y c   c  f r ci   ci g n i 1   where x c  y c   c describe position and orientation f r ci   ci g n i 1 describe n range measurements r ci at bearings  ci  e xpressed in the current scans coordinate system f r ci   ci g n i 1 are ordered by the bearings in ascending order as the y are recei v ed from a SICK laser scanner  The reference scan is described as R  f r r i   r i g n i 1  The scan matching w orks as follo ws after preprocessing the scans scan projection follo wed by translation estimation is alternated with scan projection follo wed by orientation estimation More details on these steps are gi v en in the follo wing sections A Scan Pr epr ocessing Prior to matching the current and the reference scans are preprocessed First as in 8  a median lter with a windo w of 5 is applied to the range measurements to remo v e objects that are lik ely to mo v e such as table and chair le gs Then range readings are se gmented to pre v ent interpolation between 2 disjoint objects and to enable the tracking of mo ving objects Fig 1 Left projection of measured points tak en at C to location R Right points projected to R sho wn in polar coordinates Dashed lines represent bearings which the scanner w ould ha v e sampled In the se gmentation simple rules are used such as a range reading is in the same se gment as its pre vious neighbor if the y are closer than a threshold or if the range reading is closer than a threshold to the e xtrapolation of the pre vious 2 readings Range readings further than a threshold in the results we used 10m are not used therefore such readings break se gments A point in a se gment consisting of just one point is tagged and ignored in the scan matching process The tracking and marking of mo ving objects are important for rob ustness since the y can ha v e a ne gati v e ef fect on scan matching W e ha v e not implemented the tracking of mo ving objects yet b ut we plan to do so in the future B Scan Pr ojection An important step in scan matching is nding out ho w the current scan w ould look if it were tak en from the reference position F or e xample in Fig 1 the current scan w as tak en at location C and the reference scan w as tak en at position R The range and bearings of the points from point R see Fig 1b are calculated r 0 ci  p  r ci cos   c   ci   x c  2   r ci sin   c   ci   y c  2 1  0 ci  atan 2 r ci sin   c   ci   y c

at the reference scan bearings  r i are calculated using interpolation The aim is to estimate what the laser scanner w ould measure from pose R This step consists of checking  r 0 ci   ci  0 i.e 1,2,..10 in Fig 1b of each se gment if there are one or more sample bearings between 2 consecuti v e points i.e between 1 and 2 there is one between 6 and 7 there are 2 By linear interpolation a range v alue is calculated for each sample bearing If a range v alue is smaller than an already stored range v alue at the same bearing then the stored range is o v erwritten with the ne w one to handle occlusion As in 12  a ne w range v alue is tagged as in visible if the bearings of the 2 se gment points are in decreasing order  


C T r anslation Estimation After scan projection for each bearing  r i there is at most one r 00 ci from the projected current scan and a corresponding r r i from the reference scan The aim is to nd  x c  y c  which minimizes P w i  r r i  r 00 ci  2  where w i is a weight used to reduce weighting 1 of bad matches T o minimize the weighted sum of square residuals we applied linear re gression to

is then calculated by minimizing the sum of weighted range residuals P w i  r r i  r 00 ci  2 using the well kno wn equation for weighted least squares 10    x c  y c    H T WH   1 H T W  r 00 c  r r

1  d m i d m i  c m 8 where d i  r 00 ci  r r i is the error between projected current scan range measurements and reference scan range measurements and c is a constant Equation 8 describes a sigmoid function with weight 1 at d i  0 and a small weight for lar ge d i  P arameter c determines where the sigmoid changes from 1 to 0 and m determines ho w quickly the sigmoid function changes from 1 to 0 In 7  8 w as used to weight the distance of a laser scan point to a line in a point-to-feature scan matching method T o reduce the ef fects of association errors in the implementation of equation 7 only those visible measurements are tak en into consideration which are not tagged see IIA Also the errors between reference and current scan range measurements ha v e to be smaller than a preset threshold to be included Please note that the equation used in other point-to-point scan matching methods which operate in XY coordinate systems such as ICP or IDC nd the correct translation 1 Note that there is also an implicit weighting of closer objects since the y co v er a lar ger angle and rotation of the current scan in one step if the correct associations are gi v en Our PSM approach due to the use of linearization requires multiple iterations Since the correct associations are in general not kno wn multiple iterations are necessary for the other methods as well Also note that our PSM approach for translation estimation w orks most accurately if the correct orientation of the current scan is kno wn Estimating the orientation of the current scan is described ne xt A ne gati v e property of this translation position estimation approach is apparent when matching scans which were tak en of long featureless corridors the position error along the corridor can drift D Orientation Estimation Change of orientation of the current scan is represented in a polar coordinate system by a left or right shift of the range measurements Therefore assuming that the correct location of the current scan is kno wn and the reference and current scans contain measurements of the same static objects the correct orientation of the current scan can be found by shifting the projected current scan  r 00 ci   r i  until it co v ers the reference scan A  20  shift w as implemented at 1  interv als of the projected current scan and for each shift angle the a v erage absolute range residual is calculated Orientation correction is estimated by tting a parabola to the 3 closest points to the smallest a v erage absolute range residual The estimated orientation change is then added to  c  E Heuristical Err or Estimation If correct associations are assumed then the co v ariance estimate for the translation is 10  C   2 r  H T H   1  9 where  2 r is estimated range error v ariance Unfortunately e v en if the current and reference scan were tak en of the same scene there can al w ays be mo ving objects or objects which appear dif ferently from dif ferent location e.g v ertically non uniform objects observ ed from a slightly tilted laser scanner F or this reason for rooms we use a simple approximation of the co v ariance matrix by scaling a diagonal matrix with the a v erage square range residual A lo wer bound on the co v ariance matrix is also applied It is assumed that smaller range residuals are the result of better association and better scan matching result A non-diagonal co v ariance matrix is scaled for corridors which e xpresses the lar ger along-corridor error  Classication of scans into corridors is done by calculating the v ariance of orientations of line se gments obtained by connecting neighboring points If this v ariance is smaller than a threshold then the scan is classied as a corridor  The orientation of the corridor necessary for the co v ariance matrix generation is estimated by calculating an angle histogram 16  from the line se gment orientations The angle perpendicular to the location of the maximum of the histogram will correspond to the corridor orientation

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
