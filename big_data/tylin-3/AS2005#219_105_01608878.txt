Abstract 227 This work describes a novel synthesis technique of inline low pass prototype filters with arbitrary transmission zeros. The inline topology is constituted by the cascade of elementary building blocks extracting single or multiple transmission zeros. The novel synthesis method is  based on the matrix rotation technique; starting from a recently proposed canonical prototype \(wheel topology\s are introduced for determining the sequence of matrix rotations with the corresponding rotation angles which lead to the desired inline topology \(which must satisfy the feasibility conditions for the given transmission zeros\. The proposed technique does not require optimization procedures and it allows the association of a transmission zero to a specific block \(such as the triplet, the quadruplet, the box section, etc\creasing the degree of freedom in the filter design process I INTRODUCTION 
A common approach to the design of microwave filters is based on the synthesis of a low pass prototype, whose frequency domain is defined through a well known frequency transformation. However the direct synthesis of such a prototype is possible only in very few cases, especially when asymmetric transmission zeros are required in the frequency response \(assumed equiripple in the passband\. In this case some specialized canonical topologies [1-3 o w the direct evaluation of the normalized coupling matrix which defines the prototype; on the other hand the most usual configurations practically employed in microwave filters are characterized by a inline modular topology, obtained by cascading elementary blocks \(triplets, quadruplets, bo x sections, etc\extracting single or multiple transmission zeros. For obtaining the 
coupling matrix of this modular topology, some approaches have been suggested in the literature, almost all based on optimization techniques [4  In t h is wo r k we pr esen t a technique for the synthesis of inline modular prototypes which is based on the Given\222s transform \(matrix rotation\ applied to the normalized coupling matrix of a canonical wheel prototype; the proposed method does not require optimization or iterative procedures and it is applicable to any arbitrary sequence of blocks \(the only required condition is the compatibility of the blocks employed with the transmission zeros characterizing the prototype frequency response\The result obtained from the synthesis consists in the sequence of matrix rotations \(pivots and rotation angles\ required for transforming the starting matrix \(wheel canonical prototype 
into the coupling matrix of the desired inline topology II T HE C ANONICAL STARTING P ROTOTYPE The first step in the proposed procedure is the synthesis of the wheel prototype exhibiting the required transmission zeros in the frequency response \(generalized Chebycheff\is prototype was introduced by Bell in a workshop presentation  at the 2004 Intern ational Microwave Symposium its general configuration is illustrated in fig. 1 In this topology the load is coupled to all resonators from n up to m so the non-zero elements of the normalized coupling matrix M are only on the main diagonal, on the first two subdiagonals, on the last row and on the last column. Moreover 
the index m last coupled resonator\ depends on the overall number n z of transmission zeros in the prototype frequency characteristic m=n-n z  The wheel prototype is canonical, i.e. whatever frequency response with equiripple passband and prescribed transmission zeros n z n can be synthesized with this topology; reducing any coupling matrix to Bell\222s wheel form is a straightforward task which can be accomplished by a well defined sequence of matrix rotations: let assume M full a generic n+2

When all the transmission zeros have been extracted, the final matrix generated will have the inline configuration desired B Quadruplet block With this block a pair of complex transmission zeros can be extracted; let consider first the case of asymmetric imaginary transmission zeros at frequencies if z1 if z2 Following the procedure previously explained, the triplet p-3, p-2, p-1  extracting if z1 generated from M 0 producing the matrix M np+1 the extraction of the second zero if z2 is repeated on M np+1 with the triplet p-2, p-1, p   matrix M 2n-2p+2 is generated\This double-triplet extraction produces a lattice block formed by the resonators p, p-1, p-2, p-3   with al l t h e possible couplings \(fig. 2 Now a further matrix rotation of M 2n-2p+2 with pivot p2,p-1  allows to can cel o n e of t h e tran sv e r sal cou p l in g  f o r  realizing the quadruplet block; the required rotation angles are given by 1\(222 222 2 1 tan np np Apppp MM  Annihilation of 2 2 2 2 np pp M  3 1\(222 222 1 3 3 2 tan np np Bpppp MM   Annihilation of 2 2 2 1 3 np pp M  Note that the overall number of rotations required for the quadruplet extraction is 2n-2p+4  It is interesting to observe that this method for extracting a quadruplet from the wheel prototype works even with complex transmission zeros \(it is known that a quadruplet allows to extract a pair of complex zeros with the same imaginary part and oppos ite real part s z  261f zr if zi are the complex zeros, the expression of the angle 0,1 to employ for starting the triplets extraction is the following \(from \(1 0  1 0,1 0 1 cot zr zi n n nn if f M M 4 It must be observed that, being this angle complex, also the elements of the coupling matrices M n-p+1 and M 2n-2p+2 will have in general complex elements; however, after imposing the annihilation of one of the lattice block transversal couplings \(rotation of M 2n-2p+2 with angle A or B he final matrix M 2n-2p+3 will have only real elements C Quintuplet block The construction of a quintuplet block defined by nodes p, p1, p-2, p-3, p-4   fig. 3  in wit h t h e extraction  of  t h e following three triplets in sequence p-4, p-3, p-2   p-3, p-2 p-1  p-2, p-1,p    A l a t t i c e bl oc k of or de r 5 \(m a t ri x M k s then obtained; applying the following rotations to M k the unwanted couplings are eliminated and the quintuplet is formed Fig. 2.

CONCLUSIONS This paper derives a Bayesian procedure for track association that can solve a large scale distributed tracking problem where many sensors track many targets. When noninformative prior of the target state is assumed, the single target test becomes a chi-square test and it can be extended to the multiple target case by solving a multidimensional assignment problem. With the noninformative prior assumption, the optimal track fusion algorithm can be a biased one where the regularized estimate has smaller mean square estimation error. A regularized track fusion algorithm was presented which modifies the optimal linear unbiased fusion rule by a less-than-unity scalar. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed track association and fusion algorithm through a three-sensor two-target tracking scenario 7. REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and W. D.

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA. In other words, the number Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05 0.055 0.06 N um be r o f C ou nt ed P at te rn s Support Threshold Mafia Min_Conf=0 Min_Conf=0.1 Min_Conf=0.3 Min_Conf=0.5 Min_Conf=0.7 Min_Conf=0.9 Figure 8.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
