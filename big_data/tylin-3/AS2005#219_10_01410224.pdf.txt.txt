Za  ane Mohammad El-Hajj Yi Li Stella Luk Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta Edmonton, AB, Canada zaiane,mohammad,yli,stella}@cs.ualberta.ca Abstract Benchmarking technical solutions is as important as the solutions themselves. Yet many fields still lack any type of rigorous evaluation. Performance benchmarking has always been an important issue in databases and has played a significant role in the development, deployment and adoption of technologies To help assessing the myriad algorithms for frequent itemset mining, we built an open framework and testbed to analytically study the performance of different algorithms and their implementations, and contrast their achievements given different data characteristics, different conditions and different types of patterns to discover and their constraints. This facilitates reporting consistent and reproducible performance results using known conditions 1 Introduction Mining for frequent itemsets is a canonical task, fundamental for many data mining applications and is an intrinsic part of many other data mining tasks. Mining for frequent itemsets is the major initial phase for discovering association rules. Associative classi?ers rely on frequent itemsets. These frequent pattern are also used in some clustering algorithms. Finding frequent items is also an inherent part of many data analysis processes. Many frequent itemset mining algorithms have been reported in the last decade. From the famous Apriori algorithm[1], many extensions and sophisticated implementations have been suggested. Recently, new approaches relying on intricate data structures have been introduces claiming to outperform the apriori-based techniques. Some algorithms model transactions horizontally. Others transpose vertically the transactions. Some techniques traverse the pattern search space top-down, Others favour a bottom-up strategy. The puzzling reality is that most of these authors, when publishing their work claim to outperform, with their new method, the rest of the pack, supporting their claim with experiments carefully planned. Unfortunately, given some conditions and datasets, it is very dif?cult to know which algorithm is the most appropriate. A recent study [18] has shown that with real datasets, Apriori, the oldest algorithm for mining frequent itemsets, outperforms the newer approaches. Do we then need any of these new sophisticated approaches? An analysis done recently for a workshop on frequent itemset mining[7] demonstrates the importance of ?ne and clever implementations of algorithms, making the selection of an appropriate approach even more perplexing What has rarely been directly reported is that when dealing with extremely large datasets, discovering frequent itemsets is an impossibility for most algorithms. The problem is reduced to ?nding the set of frequent closed itemsets or the set of frequent maximal itemsets. A frequent itemset X is closed if and only if there is no X ? such that X ? X and the support ofX equals to the support ofX ?. A frequent itemsetX is said to be maximal if there is no frequent itemset X ? such that X ? X ?. Frequent maximal patterns are a subset of frequent closed patterns, which are a subset of all frequent patterns. Finding only the closed item patterns reduces dramatically the size of the results set without loosing relevant information. From the closed itemsets one can derive all frequent itemsets and their counts. Directly discovering or enumerating closed itemsets can lead to huge time saving during the mining process. The set of maximal frequent itemsets is found, in general, to be orders of magnitude smaller in size than the set of closed itemsets and the set of closed itemsets is found, in general, to be orders of magnitude smaller in size than the set of all frequent 


ders of magnitude smaller in size than the set of all frequent itemsets [5]. While we can derive the set of all frequent itemsets directly from the maximal patterns, their support cannot be obtained without counting. Again, many algorithms have been proposed to ?nd these types of patterns Nonetheless, the exact thorough comparison between proposed approaches is still lacking and researchers as well as developers are still perplexed when it comes to selecting an appropriate approach for mining a given dataset The state of affairs is even more complex since there is also the issue of expressing constraints on the patterns to discover. While some algorithms cannot treat these constraints and a post-pruning is necessary, others can handle Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE during the mining process some types of constraints. Different types of constraints can be enforced on the patterns to discover: monotone and anti-monotone[12]. These constraints are expressed using aggregations on descriptors of items such as price, weight, height etc. of an item in a transaction. Yet again different claims are made [13, 4] but a rigorous comparison between constraint-based itemset mining algorithms has never been reported We propose a framework and a performance testbed to compare any frequent pattern mining algorithm given different datasets and dataset characteristics, and providing different parameters and constraints on the patterns to discover. The reporting obtained provides a consistent and precise analysis to discriminate among the approaches given speci?ed conditions 2 The benchmarking testbed The testbed consists of a collection of real datasets such as the UCI dataset collection [14], the worldcup98 weblog [16], the ?mi collection [7], and synthetic datasets generated by the IBM QUEST data generator 11], as well as an interface \(API ment of a variety of algorithms. Some representatives of this set of algorithms are: The Apriori implementation from [3], Closet+[15], ChARM[17], FPMAX[9 GenMAX[8], MAFIA[5], MaxMiner[2], FP-Growth[10 COFI+[6], dualminer[4], and other implementations shared in the ?mi forum [7]. The testbed also includes a collection of pre-computed tests and benchmarks, and a graphical user interface to tune the available parameters and specify constraints on the patterns to discover Input GUI Meta data on support Output GUI Algorithm 2 . . .

Result and Data generator data 3 Value to the community The workshop on Frequent Itemset Mining Implementations held in conjunction with the IEEE International Conference on data Mining in 2003 and 2004 brought together eminent researchers working on various issues related to frequent itemset mining. The agreement of the attendees was that the research community needs reliable means to rigorously analyze algorithm performance and verify claims. Given the experimental algorithmic nature of frequent itemset mining, it is crucial that other researchers be able to independently verify the claims made by authors of new algorithms [7 Another important issue raised is the issue of providing a common set of databases for testing frequent itemset mining. We intend to make our data collection as well as the benchmarking system as part of the ?mi shared repository 7]. The signi?cance of our performance benchmarking system is measured by the interest expressed by researchers in the ?eld of frequent itemset mining and data mining as a whole. We expect the testbed to have a signi?cant impact in the community and would constitute an initial stage towards de?ning a framework for benchmarking algorithms for other data mining tasks References 1] R.

GENERAL TRACK ASSOCIATION VIA MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSIGNMENT We want to consider the association of local tracks to more than one target. The problem can be formulated as finding the best hypothesis regarding the track-to-target correspondence which has been studied extensively in the framework of multiple hypothesis tracking \(MHT  approach to solve the MHT problem is via the multidimensional assignment [1, 15 Assume there are S local sensors \(S ? 3 Si provides a list of Ni tracks to the fusion center. Denote by ?i1i2...iS the binary assignment variable and by ?i1i2...iS the likelihood ratio of the local tracks i1, i2, ..., iS being from the same target vs. from different targets. The S-D assignment finds the most likely hypothesis by solving the following integer program min i1i2...iS N1 i1=1 N2 i2=1      NS iS=1 ci1i2...iS ?i1i2...iS \(24 subject to  N2 i2=0       NS iS=0 ji2...iS ? 1, j = 1, ..., N1 N1 i1=0  N3 i3=0       NS iS=0 i1ji3...iS ? 1, j = 1, ..., N2  N1 i1=0      NS?1 iS?1=0 i1i2...iS?1j ? 1, j = 1, ..., NS 25 i1i2...iS ? {0, 1}, i1 = 0, 1, ..., N1      iS = 0, 1, ..., NS 26 The above integer program is in general NP hard for S ? 3 However, efficient algorithms exist to find a suboptimal solution with quantifiable upper and lower bound of the optimum via Lagrangian relaxation \(see, e.g., [1, 7 4. REGULARIZED TRACK FUSION When noninformative prior is used for the target state at the fusion center, equations \(4  5 class of linear unbiased estimators [12].

improve the estimation accuracy by exploring biased estimators. Various modifications of the least squares estimator have been proposed in [8, 9, 10]. The general guideline is that a biased estimator can reduce the mean square error when the variance being reduced is larger than the squared bias term. In the sequel, we present a scalar modification of the least squares estimator, which results in a regularized track fusion formula We introduce a multiplicative scalar bias term b and assume the regularized estimator \(RE x  RE = bx  LS \(27 The RE class includes shrunken estimators, an example of which is the well-known James-Stein estimator [8]. To find the optimal bias, we want to solve the following problem which directly minimizes the trace of the mean square error matrix min b E[\(bx  LS ? x bx  LS ? x 28 The solution is given by b E[\(x  LS E[\(x  LS  LS 29 where E[\(x  LS  30 E[\(x  LS  LS] = tr[xx? + \(H ?P?1H x||2 + tr[\(H ?P?1H 31 Thus the optimal bias is b x||2 x||2 + tr[\(H ?P?1H 32 We can see that the optimal bias is always less than 1 which implies that it is always possible for the regularization to reduce the mean square error compared with the LS solution b = 1 parameter xwhich can be replaced by the estimate x  LS. The 518 resulting estimator is a nonlinear function of x  In practice if we assume that x has a bounded norm, i.e., ||x||2 ? B then the bias can be chosen as b B B + tr[\(H ?P?1H 33 which makes the resulting regularized estimator linear. The mean square error of the regularized estimator is PRE = \(1? b H ?P?1H 34 where the unknown state x can be replaced by its estimate It is easy to verify that tr[PRE x||2tr[\(H ?P?1H x||2 + tr[\(H ?P?1H lt; tr[PLS] \(35 5. SIMULATION STUDY We consider a ground target tracking scenario where three sensors are located at \(?50,0 0,187 50,0 respectively. All three sensors measure the target range and bearing with the same standard deviations of the measurement error given by ?r = 50m and ?b = 2mrad. The sampling interval of sensors 1 and 2 is T1 = T2 = 2s while the sampling interval of sensor 3 is T3 = 5s The two targets are initially at \(0,86.6 0.4,86.6 respectively. Both targets move in parallel with a speed of 300m/s. They initially move toward south-east and then at t = 15s both targets make a course change with a constant turn rate of 4?/s \(acceleration of about 2.1g over a duration Tman of about 11s make a second course change at t = 35s with a constant turn rate of 4?/s and heads toward north-east. The total time for the two targets to complete the designated trajectories 


for the two targets to complete the designated trajectories is 60s. The true target motion has the random acceleration modeled by the white process noise spectrum q = 1m2/s3 in each realization. The trajectories of the two targets are shown in Fig. 1 where the true target positions are indicated at the time instances at which a measurement is made by one of the three sensors. The total time for the two targets to complete the designated trajectories is 60s. Note that the target ranges are around 100km at the beginning for all sensors, where the standard deviation of the crossrange measurement is around 200m Two tracking configurations for performance comparison are implemented as follows i models and sequentially updates the target state with measurements from sensors 1  3. This IMM estimator has a discretized continuous white noise acceleration \(DCWNA model [4] with a low process noise PSD ql to capture the uniform target motion and a DCWNA model with a high 0 5000 10000 15000 7.5 8 8.5 9 x 10 4 Position x \(m P o s it io n y m  Sensor 1 Sensor 2 Sensor 3 Fig. 1.

For each local IMM estimator, 2-D assignment is used to solve the measurement-to-track association problem and the most likely hypothesis is chosen for the filter update. The track-to-track association is based on the most likely hypothesis obtained by solving the 3-D assignment among three local trackers. If the local tracks are declared as from the same target, then the track-to-track fusion is carried out using regularized track fusion with approximate cross covariance 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 50 100 150 200 Time \(sec R M S p o s it

The improvement of the tracking accuracy is fairly large for both targets and during both non-maneuver and maneuver segments. The position errors do not increase significantly during target maneuver.

We can see that tracking accuracy does not improve too much because the sensors do not directly measure the velocity state. The velocity errors increase during the two maneuver segments with certain delay after the maneuver onset time.

We can see that the track fusion has smaller RMS velocity error when the targets have a nearly constant velocity but larger RMS velocity error after the targets start maneuver. Overall, the proposed assignment solution for the track-to-track association is very effective when the quality of the local tracks is good.

square distribution is also shown in the figure. We can see that the distributed track fusion yield larger NEES than the centralized estimator during the target turns. This indicates that the fused track is optimistic about its mean square estimation error. Thus caution has to be exercised when fusing the local estimates that are not credible on their own NEES statistics 520 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Time R M S v e lo c it y e rr o r m s  Target 1 Sensor 1 Centralized Est Track Fusion 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 Time R M S v e lo c it y e rr o r m s  Target 2 Sensor 1 Centralized Est Track Fusion Fig. 6.

CONCLUSIONS This paper derives a Bayesian procedure for track association that can solve a large scale distributed tracking problem where many sensors track many targets. When noninformative prior of the target state is assumed, the single target test becomes a chi-square test and it can be extended to the multiple target case by solving a multidimensional assignment problem. With the noninformative prior assumption, the optimal track fusion algorithm can be a biased one where the regularized estimate has smaller mean square estimation error. A regularized track fusion algorithm was presented which modifies the optimal linear unbiased fusion rule by a less-than-unity scalar. Simulation results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed track association and fusion algorithm through a three-sensor two-target tracking scenario 7. REFERENCES 1] Y. Bar-Shalom and W. D.

The percentage of additional traf?c the cache at every clock tick. A similar scheme has been proposed in [13], which uses fv, a function of the access rate of the data item only, to evaluate the value of each data item i that becomes available to the client on the channel If there exists a data item j in the client  s cache such that fv\(i j replaced with i A prefetch scheme based on the cache locality, called UIR scheme, was proposed in [7]. It assumes that a client has a large chance to access the invalidated cache items in the near future. It proposes to prefetch these data items if it is possible to increase the cache hit ratio. In [6], Cao improves the UIR scheme by reducing some unnecessary prefetches based on the prefetch access ratio \(PAR scheme, the client records how many times a cached data item has been accessed and prefetched, respectively. It then calculates the PAR, which is the number of prefetches divided by the number of accesses, for each data item. If the PAR is less than one, it means that the data item has been accessed a number of times and hence the prefetching is useful. The clients can mark data items as non-prefetching when PAR &gt; b, where b is a system tuning factor. The scheme proposes to change the value of b dynamically according to power consumption. This can make the prefetch scheme adaptable, but no clear methodology as to how and when b should be changed. Yin et al. [19] proposed a power-aware prefetch scheme, called value-based adaptive prefetch \(VAP the number of prefetches based on the current energy level to prolong the system running time. The VAP scheme de?nes a value function which can optimize the prefetch cost to achieve better performance These existing schemes have ignored the following characteristics of a mobile environment: \(1 query some data items frequently, \(2 during a period of time are related to each other, \(3 miss is not a isolated events; a cache miss is often followed by a series of cache misses, \(4 eral requests in one uplink request consumes little additional bandwidth but reduces the number of future uplink requests. In this paper, we addressed these issues using a cache-miss-initiated prefetch scheme, which is based on association rule mining technique. Association rule mining is a widely used technique in ?nding the relationships among data items. The problem of ?nding association rules among items is clearly de?ned by Agrawal et al. in [5]. However in the mobile environment, one cannot apply the existing association rule mining algorithm [4] directly because it is too complex and expensive to use This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in 


This makes our algorithm different from that of [4] in twofold. First, we are interested in rules with only one data item in the antecedent and several data items in the consequent. Our motivation is to prefetch several data items which are highly related to the cache-miss data item within Proceedings of the 2004 IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management \(MDM  04 0-7695-2070-7/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE the cache-miss initiated uplink request. We want to generate rules where the antecedent is one data item, but the cache-missed data item and the consequent is a series of data items, which are highly related to the antecedent. If we have such rules, we can easily ?nd the data items which should also be piggybacked in the uplink request. Second in mobile environment, the client  s computation and power resources are limited. Thus, the rule-mining process should not be too complex and resource expensive. It should not take a long time to mine the rules. It should not have high computation overhead. However, most of the association rule mining algorithms [4, 5] have high computation requirements to generate such rules 5. Conclusions Client-side prefetching technique can be used to improve system performance in mobile environments. However, prefetching also consumes a large amount of system resources such as computation power and energy. Thus, it is very important to only prefetch the right data. In this paper, we proposed a cache-miss-initiated prefetch \(CMIP scheme to help the mobile clients prefetch the right data The CMIP scheme relies on two prefetch sets: the alwaysprefetch set and the miss-prefetch set. Novel association rule based algorithms were proposed to construct these prefetch sets. When a cache miss happens, instead of sending an uplink request to only ask for the cache-missed data item, the client requests several items, which are within the miss-prefetch set, to reduce future cache misses. Detailed experimental results veri?ed that the CMIP scheme can greatly improve the system performance in terms of increased cache hit ratio, reduced uplink requests and negligible additional traf?c References 1] S.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
