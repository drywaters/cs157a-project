However, lists obtained in this way may be too short. Indirect association rules are introduced to extend classical, direct association rules and supplement the knowledge they contribute. The relation between ranking lists created on the basis of association rules and hyperlinks existing on web pages has also been examined in the paper 1. Introduction Recommendation systems are an important part of recent web based applications, especially for e-commerce services [13]. Some data mining methods are usually introduced to them to correlate presented items with items likely to be suggested, such as pages, products, advertisements, learning objects, etc., as well as to personalize web systems more effectively. Sequential patterns, association rules, and clustering methods are most commonly used for this purpose So far typical association rules have widely been exploited as a source for recommendation ranking lists However, they come with some limitations: lists are often too short to provide enough suggestions for recommendations for each web page. The purpose of this document is to introduce a way to extend them and supplement the knowledge they contribute with a new kind of association rules  indirect ones. Yet another problem that has been considered is the correlation between ranking lists created on the basis of association rules and hyperlinks on a site 2. Related Work Association rules have been utilized in many web recommendation systems, applied in various domains such as suggestions in personalized distance learning [21], or next steps in web navigation, i.e. hyperlink recommendation [5 17, 22], personalized shopping adviser [3, 4, 6], extension of web searching [2]. In the web environment association patterns can be extracted from server logs [5, 17, 21, 22 purchased products [3, 4, 6], or products placed into the basket [3], as well as web content [2]. Association rules outgoing from a certain page \(fixed body of the rule usually ordered according to their quality measure, confidence, what enables the creation of a ranking list for this page. Chun et al. personalized such rankings using ruleuser relevancy matrix derived from data about products purchased by the individual user [4 Special kind of association between items, which include transitive itemset  mediator, has been called indirect association rule and proposed originally by Tan Kumar, and Srivastava [18, 19]. However, their indirect rules differ from those described in this paper. Tan et al assumed that two items, e.g. web pages, must not be associated directly if they are expected to be related indirectly Thus, original indirect rules reflect rather negative associations existing between items. In our approach indirect rules are treated as an extension of direct ones, rather than as that kind of negative associations Tan et al. proposed that one pair of items may possess many indirect rules with many mediator sets which may overlap. In web recommendation systems we need one measure that helps us find out whether the considered page should or should not be suggested to a user on the given page. There is no simple method of joining many rules to obtain such a single measure Additionally, we extract indirect rules from direct ones instead of from source data what is much more effective 


instead of from source data what is much more effective Hamano and Sato proposed their own method to mine both negative and positive indirect association rules similar to Tan  s et al. using special  measure [7]. Another algorithm HI-Mine was suggested by Wan and An [20 3. Direct Association Rules in the Web Definition 1. Let di be an independent web page \(document the web page domain that consists of independent web pages di?D Definition 2. A set X of pages di?D is called pageset X The number of pages in a pageset is called the length of the pageset. A pageset with the length k is denoted by kpageset Definition 3. The i-th user session Si is the pageset containing all pages viewed by the user during one visit on the web site; Si?D. SS is the set of all user sessions gathered by the system, Si?SS. Each session must consist of at least two Proceedings of the 2005 5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and  Applications \(ISDA  05 0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE pages: card\(Si only if X?Si Note that pagesets and user sessions are unordered and without repetitions  we turn navigational sequences \(paths into sets. Additionally, user sessions may also be filtered to omit too short and too long ones, which are not representative enough [11, 12 Definition 4. A direct association rule is the implication X?Y, where X?D, Y?D and X?Y=?. A direct association rule is described by two measures: support and confidence The direct association rule X?Y has the support sup\(X?Y X?Y SS X?Y number of sessions Si containing both X and Y: X?Y?Si The confidence con for direct association rule X?Y is the probability that the session Si containing X also contains Y con\(X?Y X?Y X X  the number of sessions that contain the pageset X. The pageset X is the body and Y is the head of the rule Direct association rules represent regularities discovered from a large data set [1]. The problem of mining association rules is to extract rules that are strong enough and have the support and confidence value greater than given thresholds minimal direct support supmin and minimal direct confidence conmin. In this paper, we consider dependencies only between 1-pagesets  single web pages, so the 1pageset X including di \(X={di a direct association rule from di to dj is di?dj 4. Indirect Association Rules Definition 5. Partial indirect association rule di?P#dj,dk is the indirect implication from di to dj with respect to dk, for which two direct association rules exist: di?dk and dk?dj with sup\(di?dk di?dk sup\(dk?dj dk?dj di,dj,dk?D; di?dj?dk. The page dk, in the partial indirect association rule di?P#dj,dk, is called the transitive page There may be many transitive pages dk for a given pair of pages di,dj and as a result many partial indirect association rules di?P#dj,dk Each indirect association rule is described by partial indirect confidence conP#\(di?P#dj,dk conP#\(di?P#dj,dk di?dk  con\(dk?dj 1 Pages di,dj in di?P#dj,dk do not need to have any common sessions, but in \(1  good  direct associations to ensure that indirect associations are based on sensible grounds.

In consequence, it was assumed, rules di?dk and dk?dj must be  strong  enough so that con\(di?dk con\(dk?dj Partial indirect confidence is calculated using direct confidence without access to source user sessions.

The set of all possible transitive pages dk for which partial indirect association rules from di to dj exist, is called Tij \(Fig. 1 Transitive pages Tij dj Complete indirect association rule Partial indirect rules di Figure 1.

A complete indirect association rule from di to dj exists if and only if there exists at least one partial indirect association rule from di to dj. Complete indirect association rules are not symmetric: the rule di?#dj may exists but the reverse one dj?#di not necessarily 5. Complex Rules, Recommendation Lists To enable the usage of both direct and indirect association rules for recommendation, the joined complex association rules are introduced [9, 10]. They combine the main parameters of direct and indirect rules  confidences Definition 8. Complex association rule di?*dj from di to dj exists, if and only if direct di?dj or complete indirect di?#dj association rule from di to dj exists.

For this purpose the Kendall  s coefficient of concordance was used to determine the similarity between two ranking lists Let X and Y be any n-item rankings, then the Kendall  s coefficient of concordance ?\(X,Y the following formula [15                     n i n j ijij yyxx nn YX 1 1 sgnsgn 1 1 4 where: xi and yi are the positions of the same i-th item in ranking X and Y, respectively; they range from 1 to n sgn\(xj-xi item j follows item i in ranking X, then sgn\(xj-xi they are at the same position sgn\(xj-xi sgn\(xj-xi every position, the Kendall  s coefficient for them is equal to +1. However, when two rankings have all the same items but they occur in reverse order, their Kendall  s coefficient equals -1 As \(4 sumed that when the only item in both rankings was the same, the Kendall  s coefficient was assigned the value of 1, otherwise the value of -1 was assigned. The formula \(4 works fine for rankings with the same number of items However, as far as recommendation ranking lists derived from association rules are concerned, it is rarely the case The length of ranking lists ranges from 1 to several hundred sometimes. Therefore a method for handling different length rankings had to be devised. We suggest appending all items from ranking Y, which do not occur in list X after the last item in ranking X. All appended items obtain the same position: the origin length of X plus 1 7. Experiments A series of experiments has been conducted in order to discover the influence of direct and indirect association rules on recommendation ranking lists 7.1. Test Environment The data used for the experiments came from web log files of two big Polish sites, one significant e-commerce that offers hardware, and the other the main portal of Wroclaw University of Technology \(WUT First the log data were cleansed. All multimedia requests and those generated by search engine spiders which constituted over 90% of all entries, were removed Then sessions were identified on the basis of the same user hostname, the same agent and the time interval between two consecutive requests within 25.5 minutes [16 After removing one-page sessions and too long ones more than 80 pages behavior, 173,896 sessions were left for WUT log data for the period of 9 weeks. For e-commerce this number was 16,085 sessions for the 4-month period. Statistical data for the two sites are presented in Table 1 Table 1.

Similarly iconmin was introduced for complete indirect rules. Its value was set to the square of conmin for both of the sites The parameter ? used to reinforce or dump direct rules at the expense of indirect ones was set to a very small value for both the sites: 2% for e-commerce and 5% for WUT, since the mean confidence for filtered direct rules was significantly greater than the mean confidence for filtered indirect rules for both the sites; 213 and 102 times greater for e-commerce and WUT, respectively 7.2. Ranking Lists Comparison Having direct, indirect and complex association rules we compared recommendation ranking lists by means of Proceedings of the 2005 5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and  Applications \(ISDA  05 0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE the Kendall  s coefficient for e-commerce and the WUT site. In particular, similarities between direct and complex ranking lists were examined. We cut the lists at various lengths: 1, 2, 3, 4 as well as 5, and tested the Kendall  s coefficient for such rankings The results of the experiment show that the median for 1-item rankings was 1 for both the sites \(and for 2-item rankings for e-commerce pages recommended at the first position were the same for direct and complex rankings, more for e-commerce, as the average is greater and the standard deviation is smaller Nevertheless, 12.8% of rankings for e-commerce and 46.6% for WUT had the first item that was different. The results for 1-item rankings do not follow a pattern set by a bit longer lists. For lists with up to 5 items the mean and the average appear to increase gradually and the standard deviation appears to fall as the length of the list rises \(Fig 2 and 3  s coefficient for all ranking lengths examined was higher for e-commerce This may have resulted from the value of the ? parameter reinforcing more direct rules and thus making direct and complex recommendation ranking lists more similar The greatest changes between direct and complex ranking lists can be observed in the first and second position. It is also in these very first positions that we gain most from introducing indirect and complex rules, as they offer completely new knowledge. Moreover, even for very short rankings the percentage of pages for which new items were added for direct rankings was quite high, which indicates that they were certainly enriched with new suggestions \(Fig. 4 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1

Extension of Direct Ranking Lists with Complex Rules The main reason for using indirect association rules is the fact that they provide substantially more suggestions for recommendations compared with direct rules In our experiments there was a great number of pages with very few recommendations \(5 items or less  25.5% of all pages with any ranking for e-commerce and 27.7% for WUT. This is the case when indirect association rules may become very useful, since they can considerably lengthen short direct ranking lists. On average, indirect rankings were 13 times longer than direct ones for e-commerce and 11 times longer for WUT 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 1 2 3 4 5 R an k in g l en g th Kendall's coefficient average standard deviation median Figure 3.

Our solution to this problem is the extension of direct ranking lists with indirect and complex ones. We tested the contribution of pages with too short rankings which were successfully extended with complex rules within all pages with short rankings. In order to do this, we took the number of pages with too short direct rankings for which complex ranking list was longer than direct one, for a required list length and next we divided it by the total number of pages with too short direct rankings. The obtained results were very similar for indirect and complex rules. They show how much short direct ranking lists can be extended with indirect or complex ones \(Fig. 6 percentage started from 97.5% for e-commerce and 70.1 for WUT \(for 2-item rankings commerce and 95.1% for WUT This definitely emphasizes the usefulness of complex and in consequence indirect association rules 60 70 80 90 100 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Required length of recommendation list P er ce n

Do Recommendation Ranking Lists only Confirm Existing Hyperlinks A vital question one can ask is whether recommendation ranking lists only confirm existing hyperlinks or maybe they add new knowledge as well. If all they did was confirm the existing structure of hyperlinks on a site the recommendations offered to a user might not be interesting to them In order to test if ranking lists add anything new, the content of the WUT site was downloaded. From it information about all hyperlinks on each page was extracted Having the structure of the site we were able to assess recommendation lists in the following way: the number of common items in hyperlink sets and ranking lists cut at various lengths was divided by the ranking length i.e. the required length or the actual length if it was smaller than the required length. Such calculations were performed for direct, indirect and complex recommendation lists, Fig. 7 The results for direct, indirect and complex rankings for very short lists \(1 and 2 items 27.1%, 4.6% and 11.7% respectively for 1 item. The same is true for 20-item long lists: 19.9%, 19% and 11.7% respectively. This indicates that for very short indirect and complex rankings \(up to 2 pages 20 items and more existing hyperlinks and add new potentially useful knowledge 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 1 2 3 5 10 20 Ranking lenght P er ce n ta g e o f ra n k in g i te m s Direct Indirect Complex Figure 7.

Assessment of Hyperlinks by Association Rules Another application of direct, indirect and complex rules may be the assessment of hyperlinks on a site. We can test whether the hyperlinks on a page have been 


can test whether the hyperlinks on a page have been placed appropriately by analyzing significant navigational patterns \(association rules In our experiments the percentage of hyperlinks confirmed by rules was calculated by dividing the number of common items in hyperlink sets and whole ranking lists for a given page, by the number of hyperlinks on the page separately for direct, indirect and complex rules \(Fig. 8 Note that the number of hyperlinks was put in the denominator as opposed to calculations in section 7.4 where it was ranking length 48 89%87 0 20 40 60 80 100 direct indirect complex Figure 8. The average percentage of all hyperlinks confirmed by rules Proceedings of the 2005 5th International Conference on Intelligent Systems Design and  Applications \(ISDA  05 0-7695-2286-06/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE The average percentage of hyperlinks confirmed by direct rules amounted to only 48%, probably because there were too few of them. Indirect and complex rules, on the other hand, confirmed many more hyperlinks  87% and 89%, respectively, due to their larger quantity. These relatively great values that we received may have resulted from the enormous differences between the average number of hyperlinks on a page  10 and the average ranking length: 51, 177, 180 for direct, indirect and complex rules respectively. Concluding, indirect and complex rules appear to be better at assessing the usefulness of hyperlinks compared to direct rules Note that in any case at least 11% of hyperlinks were not confirmed by any rule, so they may be recommended to be removed from the content of pages 8. Conclusions and future work Complex rules combining both direct and indirect rules usually increase the length of rankings compared to those based on direct associations. This helps overcome the problem of a multitude of pages with too short rankings Fig. 5 quested ranking length \(Fig. 6 rules substantially change the order of ranking lists \(Fig. 2 and 3 greater extent only confirm hyperlinks existing on web pages compared to lists extracted from complex rules, for short and long ranking lengths \(Fig. 7 of rules, especially indirect and complex ones, can be useful for the assessment of hyperlinks Concluding, far more diverse indirect rules can significantly improve potential value of recommendation. Nevertheless, to confirm the usefulness of indirect rules for end users, some tedious tests with their participation are required Acknowledgements The authors are indebted to thank Marcin Pilarczyk for providing cleansed data about hyperlinks on WUT pages 9.

lossless frequent patterns representations with borders. In practice, they are also much more concise than representations based on closed itemsets and approximate representations. In this paper, we offered three methods of deriving an upper bound on the length of sets in such representations. We proved that the upper bound on the length of a longest generalized disjunction-free set depends logarithmically on the number of records in the database. The obtained result is of high importance as it guarantees that any generalized disjunction-free set representation for all patterns \(both frequent and infrequent scans, where n is the number of records in the database irrespectively how strong or weak correlations among items in the database are and irrespectively of the lengths of records and number of distinct items The modifications of the basic estimation take into account the support threshold of the representation to be found or, additionally, the information on the length of longest sets of the representation already calculated for a higher support threshold. Though these estimations are more accurate than the basic one, they are still quite rough. Further improvements of the quality of estimating the length of longest itemsets in generalized disjunctionfree representations is subject to further research References 1] R. Agrawal, H. Mannila, R.

In this paper, we formalize the current state of AM: Data are a table of symbols. The patterns are the formulas of input symbols that repeat. The method of derivations is the most conservative and reliable one, namely, mathematical deductions. The results are somewhat surprising 1. Patterns are properties of the isomorphic class, not an individual relation - This implies that the notion of patterns may not mature yet and explains why there are so many extracted association rules 2. Un-interpreted attributes \(features can be enumerated 3. Generalized associations can be found by solving integral linear inequalities. Unfortunately, the number is enormous. This signi?es the current notion of data and patterns \(implied by the algorithms 4. Real world modeling may be needed to create a much more meaningful notion of patterns. In the current state of AM, a pattern is simply a repeated data that may have no real world meaning. So we may need to introduce some semantics into the data model [12],[10],[11 Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE References 1] R.

than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
