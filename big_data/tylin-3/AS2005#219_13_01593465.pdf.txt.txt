However, the data contained in the web is not well organized which makes obtaining useful information from the web a difficult task. The successful development of eXtensible Markup Language \(XML semistructured data makes the data contained in the web more readable and the task of mining useful information from the web becomes feasible. XML has become very popular for representing semistructured data and a standard for data exchange over the web. Mining XML data from the web is becoming increasingly important The previous studies adpot an Apriori-like candidate set generation approach but candidate set generation is still costly. We propose that extracting association rules from XML documents without any preprocessing or postprocessing using XML query language XQuery is possible and analyze the XQuery implementation of the efficient FP-tree based mining method, FP-growth, for mining the complete set of frequent patterns by pattern fragment growth. FP-tree based mining adopts a pattern fragment growth method to avoid the costly generation of a large number of candidate sets and a partitionbased, divide-and-conquer method is used. Divide-andconquer method divides the problem into a number of subproblems and the subproblems by solving them recursively. If the subproblem sizes are small enough however, just solve the subproblems in a straightforward manner and then combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem. In addition, we suggest features that need to be added into XQuery in order to make the implementation of the FP growth more efficient  Keyword: XML data, XQuery, FP-growth method  1. Introduction  Data mining traditionally is used to find trends in data stored in a database. One data mining technique that has proved popular is association rule mining[7 which finds associations between items in a database. In recent years, the successful development of eXtensible Markup Language \(XML  semistructured data and the fast growing amount of available XML data sets a pressing need for languages and tools to manage collections of XML documents, as well as to mine interesting information out of them[9 With developments like Xyleme [3, 4] which is a huge warehouse integrating XML data from the Web, it is essential that direct techniques for mining XML data are developed. The query language XQuery [5] was proposed by theW3C [6] in order to provide a flexible way to extract XML data and provide the necessary interaction between the web world and database world XQuery is expected to become the standard query language for extracting XML data from XML documents. Therefore, if we can mine XML data using XQuery, then we can integrate the data mining technique into XML native databases. So, we are interested to know whether XQuery is expressive enough to mine XML data. One data mining technique that has proved popular is association rule mining [7, 8 


that has proved popular is association rule mining [7, 8 It finds associations between items in a database. In this paper, we will show that XML data can be mined for association rules by implementing the FP-growth algorithm using XQuery. The algorithm that we introduce works with any XML document as long as the structure of the document is known in advance The outline of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we describe the related work. In section 3, we describe the basic concept of association rule mining. In section 4, we discuss the FP-growth algorithm. In section 5, we describe XQuery. In section 6, we discuss the XQuery expression for the FP-growth algorithm that is used to mine XML data. We conclude this paper in section 7  2. Related Work  Algorithms for mining association rules from relational data have been well developed. Several query languages have been proposed, to assist association rule mining such as [10,11]. The topic of mining XML data has received little attention, as the data mining community has focused on the development of techniques for extracting common structure from heterogeneous XML data. For instance, [12] has proposed an algorithm to construct a frequent tree by finding common subtrees embedded in the heterogeneous XML data. On the other hand, some researchers focus on developing a standard model to represent the knowledge extracted from the data using XML. For example, the Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML  which provides a way for applications to define statistical and data mining models and to share models between PMML compliant applications. To date, mining XML documents requires mapping the data to the relational data model and using techniques designed for relational databases to do the mining. For instance, the XMINE operator has been introduced by Braga et al. [9 for extracting association rules from XML documents where mapping the XML data to a relational structure is required before mining is performed  3. Association Rules  In this section we overview the basic concepts of association rule mining. We refer the reader to [7,8 for further details. Association rule mining was first introduced by Agrawal et al.[7], and was used for market basket analysis. The problem of mining association rules can be explained as follows: There is the itemset I=i1, i2  in, where I is a set of n distinct items, and a set of transactions D, where each transaction T is a set of items such that T I. Table 1 gives an example where a database D contains a set of transaction T, and each transaction consist of one or more items    Transaction-id Items bought 1 A,B,C 2 A,C 3 A,D 4 B  Table 1: An Example Database  An association rule is an implication of the form X?Y, where X, Y I and X Y = ? I ? . The 


form X?Y, where X, Y I and X Y = ? I ? . The rule X Y has support s in the transaction set D if s of transactions in D contain X  Y. The support for a rule is defined as support \(X  Y holds in the transaction set D with confidence c if c% of transactions in D that contain X also contain Y. The confidence for a rule is defined as support \(X  Y support \(X 1. Let minimum support be 50% and minimum confidence be 50%. When people buy A , they also buy C of the cases, for rule A C  U U U  support = support \({A}  {C confidence= support \({A} U  {C A 66.6 Association rule mining is a two-step process 1. Find all frequent itemsets: each of these itemsets will occur at least as frequently as a pre-determined minimum support count 2. Generate strong association rules from the frequent itemsets: these rules must satisfy minimum support and minimum confidence    4. FP-growth algorithm  In 2000, Han et al. proposed the FP-growth algorithm  the first pattern-growth concept algorithm FP-growth constructs an FP-tree structure and mines frequent patterns by traversing the constructed FPtree The FP-tree structure is an extended prefix-tree structure involving crucial condensed information of frequent patterns  a  The FP-tree structure has sufficient information to mine complete frequent patterns. It consists of a prefixtree of frequent 1-itemset and a frequent-item header table. Each node in the prefix-tree has three fields: item-name, count, and node-link   item-name is the name of the item  count is the number of transactions that consist of the frequent 1-items on the path from root to this node  node-link is the link to the next same itemname node in the FP-tree. Each entry in the frequentitem header table has two fields: item-name and head of node-link  item-name is the name of the item  head of node-link is the link to the first same item-name node in the prefix-tree   b  FP-growth has to scan the TDB twice to construct an FP-tree. The first scan of TDB retrieves a set of frequent items from the TDB . Then, the retrieved frequent items are ordered by descending order of their supports. The ordered list is called an F-list. In the second scan, a tree T whose root node R labeled with  null  is created. Then, the following steps are applied to every transaction in the TDB . Here, let a transaction represent [p\\P] where p is the first item of the 


represent [p\\P] where p is the first item of the transaction and P is the remaining items In each transaction, infrequent items are discarded Then, only the frequent items are sorted by the same order of F-list Call insert_tree \(p\\P,R tree The function insert_tree \( p\\P,R transaction [p\\P] to the root node R of the tree T Pseudo code of the function insert_tree \(p\\P,R shown An example of an FP-tree is shown in Figure 1 This FP-tree is constructed from Table 2 with minsup=2. In Figure 1, every node is represented by \(itemname: count represented by dotted arrows    Table 2. Sample TDB              function insert_tree \( p|P,R let N be a direct child node of R, such that N  s item-name = p  s item-name if \( R has a direct child node N increment N  s count by 1  else create a new node M linked under the R set M  s item-name equal to p set M  s count equal to 1  call insert_tree  \(  P ,N    Item ID Support count Node-link A B C D E 7 4 4 2 2 null B: 7 A: 4 D:1 C:2 C:2 D:1E:1 E:1  Figure 1: Example of an FP-tree 


Figure 1: Example of an FP-tree   c  FP-growth mines frequent patterns from an FPtree. To generate complete frequent patterns, FP-growth traverses all the node-links from  head of node-links  in the FPtree  s header table. For example, we describe how to mine all the frequent patterns including item C from the FP-tree shown in Figure 1. For node C , FP-growth mines a frequent pattern \(C:4  s nodelinks through node \(C:2 C:2 C  s prefix paths; &lt;B:7,A:4&gt; and &lt;B:7&gt;. To study which items appear together with C , the transformed path lt;B:2,A:2&gt; is extracted from &lt;B:7,A:4&gt; because the support value of C is 2. Similarly, we have &lt;B:2&gt;. The set of these paths {\(B:2,A:2 B:2  s conditional pattern base. FP-growth then constructs C  s conditional FP-tree containing only the paths in C  s conditional pattern base as shown in Table 3 . As only B is an item occurring more than min_sup appearing in C  s conditional pattern base, C  s conditional FP-tree leads to only one branch \(B:7 pattern \(BC:4 including item C are \(C:4 BC:4 TID Items Frequent Items 100 A,B,E A,B,E 200 B,D B,D 300 B,C B,C 400 A,B,D A,B,D 500 B,C B,C 600 A,B,C,E A,B,C,E 700 A,B,C A,B,C  5. XQuery  A query language allows to select elements/attributes from input documents, join data from multiple input documents, make modifications to the data, calculate new data, add new elements/attributes to the results and sort the results  XML Input XQuery Query XML Output   Figure 2: XQuery processing  XQuery Example Input document lt;ordernum  00299432  date  2004-09-15  cust  0221A  gt lt;item dept  WMN  num  557   quantity  1  color  tan  gt lt;item dept  ACC  num  563  quantity  1  gt lt;item dept  ACC  num  443   quantity  2  gt lt;item dept  MEN  num  784   quantity  1  color  blue  gt lt;item dept  MEN  num  784   quantity  1  color  red  gt lt;item dept  WMN  num  557   quantity  1  color  gage  gt lt;/order&gt  Query for $d in distinct values \(doc  ord.xml   let $items:=doc  ord.xml    order by $d return &lt;department name  d   total Quantity  sum\($items/@quantity  gt

XQuery Expression  We refer to the sample XML document depicted in Figure 3 where information about the items purchased in each transaction are represented. For example, the set of transactions are identified by the tag lt;transactions&gt; and each transaction in the transactions set is identified by the tag &lt;transaction&gt;. The set of items in each transaction are identified by the tag lt;items&gt; and an item is identified by the tag &lt;item&gt  lt;transactions&gt lt;transaction id  1  gt lt;items&gt lt;item&gt; A &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; B &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; E &lt;/item&gt lt;/items&gt lt;/transaction&gt lt;transaction id  2  gt lt;items&gt lt;item&gt; B &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; D &lt;/item&gt lt;/items&gt lt;/transaction&gt lt;transaction id  3  gt lt;items&gt lt;item&gt; B &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; C &lt;/item&gt lt;/items&gt lt;/transaction&gt lt;transaction id  4  gt lt;items&gt lt;item&gt; A &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; B &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; D &lt;/item&gt lt;/items&gt lt;/transaction&gt lt;transaction id  5  gt lt;items&gt lt;item&gt; B &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; C &lt;/item&gt lt;/items&gt lt;/transaction&gt lt;transaction id  6  gt lt;items&gt lt;item&gt; A &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; B &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; C &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; E &lt;/item&gt lt;/items&gt lt;/transaction&gt lt;transaction id  7  gt lt;items&gt lt;item&gt; A &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; B &lt;/item&gt lt;item&gt; C &lt;/item&gt lt;/items&gt lt;/transaction&gt lt;/transactions&gt  Figure 3: Transaction document \(transactions.xml  Consider the problem of mining FP-growth

Conclusion  In this paper, we presented the XQuery expression of the FP-growth method from XML data We use the FP-growth algorithm to generate the large itemset document, and then select all association rules from the large item set where support is greater than or equal to the minimum support. We have proposed frequent pattern tree \(FP-tree growth method, FP-growth. There are several advantages of FP-growth over other approaches. It constructs a highly compact FP-tree, which is usually substantially smaller than the original database, and thus saves the costly database scans in the subsequent mining processes. It applies a pattern growth method which avoids costly candidate generation and test by successively concatenating frequent 1-itemset found in the \(conditional divide-and-conquer method which dramatically reduces the size of the subsequent conditional pattern bases and conditional FP-trees. To our knowledge, the FP-growth method has been implemented using the query language XQuery, without pre-processing or post-processing of the data. Many issues remain open, one of the issues concerns the structure of the XML data. Since the structure of the XML data can be  very complex and irregular, identifying the mining context on such XML data becomes difficult. Our current and future research in this area focuses on investigating what other standard data mining algorithms can be expressed in XQuery  References  1] PMML 2.1 Predictive Model Markup Language http://www.dmg.org, March 2003 2] World Wide Web Consortium.

dress a related problem In the problem is to monitor continuously changing numerical values which could represent frequency counts in a distributed setting The objective is to maintain a list of the top k aggregated values where each aggregated value represents the sum of a set of individual values each of which is stored on a different node The work of assumes a single-le v e l communication topology and does not consider how to manage synopsis precision in hierarchical communication structures using in-network aggregation which is the main focus of this paper The work most closely related to ours is the recent work of Greenwald and Khanna which addresses the problem of computing approximate quantiles in a general communication topology Their technique can be used to nd frequencies of frequent items to within a congurable error tolerance The work in focuses on providing an asymptotic bound on the maximum load on any link our result adheres to the same asymptotic bound It does not however address how best to congure a precision gradient in order to minimize load which is the particular focus of our work 5 Summary In this paper we studied the problem of nding frequent items in the union of multiple distributed streams The central issue is how best to manage the degree of approximation performed as partial synopses from multiple nodes are combined We characterized this process for hierarchical communication topologies in terms of a precision gradient followed by synopses as they are passed from leaves to the root and combined incrementally We studied the problem of nding the optimal precision gradient under two alternative and incompatible optimization objectives 1 minimizing load on the central node to which answers are delivered and 2 minimizing worst-case load on any communication link We then introduced a heuristic designed to perform well for the second objective in practice when data does not conform to worst-case input characteristics Our experimental results on three real-world data sets showed that our methods of setting the precision gradient are greatly superior to na  ve strategies under both metrics on all data sets studied Acknowledgments We thank Arvind Arasu and Dawn Song for their valuable input and assistance References  R Agra w a l and R Srikant F ast algorithms for mining association rules In VLDB  1994  I Akamai T echnologies Akamai http://www akamai.com   A Ak ella A Bharambe M Reiter  and S Seshan Detecting DDoS attacks on ISP networks In PODS Workshop on Management and Processing of Data Streams  2003  A Arasu and G S Manku Approximate quantiles and frequency counts over sliding windows In PODS  2004  B Babcock and C Olston Distrib uted top-k monitoring In SIGMOD  2003  M Charikar  K  Chen and M F arach-Colton Finding frequent items in data streams In International Colloquium on Automata Languages and Programming  2002  E Cohen and M Strauss Maintaining time-decaying stream aggregates In PODS  2003  G Cormode and S Muthukrishnan What s hot and whats not Tracking frequent items dynamically In PODS  2003  E D Demaine A Lopez-Ortiz and J I Munro Frequency estimation of internet packet streams with limited space In European Symposium on Algorithms  2003  DynaServ er R UBis and R UBBos http://www.cs rice.edu/CS/Systems/DynaServer   eBay Inc eBay  http://www.ebay.com   C Estan and G V a r ghese Ne w directions in traf c measurement and accounting In SIGCOMM  2002  M F ang N Shi v akumar  H  Garcia-Molina R Motwani and J Ulmann Computing iceberg queries efciently In VLDB  1998  P  B Gibbons and Y  Matias Ne w sampling-based summary statistics for improving approximate query answers In SIGMOD  1998  P  B Gibbons and S T irthapura Estimating simple functions on the union of data streams In Symposium on Parallel Algorithms and Architectures  2001  M Greenw ald and S Khanna Po wer conserving computation of order-statistics over sensor networks In PODS  2004  J Han J Pei G Dong and K W ang Ef cient computation of iceberg queries with complex measures In SIGMOD  2001  Internet2 Internet2 Abilene Netw ork http abilene.internet2.edu   R M Karp S Shenk er  and C H P apadimitriou A simple algorithm for nding frequent elements in streams and bags ACM Trans Database Syst  2003  H.-A Kim and B Karp Autograph T o w ard automated distributed worm signature detection In Proceedings of the 13th Usenix Security Symposium  2004  A Manjhi V  Shkapen yuk K Dhamdhere and C Olston Finding recently frequent items in distributed data streams Technical report 2004 http://www cs.cmu.edu/manjhi/freqItems.pdf   G S Manku and R Motw ani Approximate frequenc y counts over data streams In VLDB  2002  Open Source De v elopment Netw ork Inc Slashdot http://slashdot.org  Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Data Engineering \(ICDE 2005 1084-4627/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

Firstly, while only association rules and string patterns are usually considered there and no attempt is made towards a general pattern model, in our approach no prede?ned pattern types are considered and the main focus lies in devising a general and extensible model for patterns Secondly, di?erently from [10], we claim that the peculiarities of patterns in terms of structure and behavior together with the characteristic of the expected workload on them, call for a logical separation between the database and the pattern-base in order to ensure e?cient handling of both raw data and patterns through dedicated management systems Finally, we remark that even if some languages have been proposed for pattern generation and retrieval 14, 11], they mainly deal with speci?c types of patterns \(in general, association rules sider the more general problem of de?ning safe and su?ciently expressive language for querying heterogeneous patterns 7. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we have dealt with the issue of modelling and managing patterns in a database-like setting Our approach is enabled through a Pattern-Base Management System, enabling the storage, querying and management of interesting abstractions of data which we call patterns. In this paper, we have \(a de?ned the logical foundations for the global setting of PBMS management through a model that covers data patterns and intermediate mappings and \(b language issues for PBMS management. To this end we presented a pattern speci?cation language for pattern management along with safety constraints for its usage and introduced queries and query operators and identi?ed interesting query classes Several research issues remain open. First, it is an interesting topic to incorporate the notion of type and class hierarchies in the model [15]. Second, we have intentionally avoided a deep discussion of statistical measures in this paper: it is more than a trivial task to de?ne a generic ontology of statistical measures for any kind of patterns out of the various methodologies that exist \(general probabilities Dempster-Schafer, Bayesian Networks, etc. [16 nally, pattern-base management is not a mature technology: as a recent survey shows [6], it is quite cumbersome to leverage their functionality through objectrelational technology and therefore, their design and engineering is an interesting topic of research References 1] Common Warehouse Metamodel \(CWM http://www.omg.org/cwm, 2001 2] ISO SQL/MM Part 6. http://www.sql99.org/SC32/WG4/Progression Documents/FCD/fcddatamining-2001-05.pdf, 2001 3] Java Data Mining API http://www.jcp.org/jsr/detail/73.prt, 2003 4] Predictive Model Markup Language \(PMML http://www.dmg.org

The reason of the hiding failure of SWA is the same in Fig.8 Notice the result at x = 0.7646 in Fig.14, because the hiding failure is occurred at the seeds of the sensitive patterns, a high weakness is produced As shown in Fig.15 and Fig.16, the misses cost and dissimil arity of our work decreases as RL2 increases. This is because the larger RL2 is, the less effect on non-sensitive patterns. Also weakness and dissimilarity of SWA are independent of RL2 5. Conclusion In the paper, a novel method improving the balance between sensitive knowledge protecting and discovery on frequent patte rns has been proposed. By setting entries of a sanitization matrix to appropriate values and multiplying the original database by the matrix with some probability policies, a sanitized database is gotten. Moreover, it can avoid F-I Attack absolutely when the confidence level given by users approximates to 1. The experimental results revealed that although misses cost and dissimilarity between the original and sanitized database of our process are little more than SWA, ours provide more safely protection than SWA. Unlike SWA, our sanitization process could not suffer from F-I Attack and the probability policies in our approach also take the minimum support into account, the users only need to decide the confidence level which affects the degree of patterns hiding 6.
