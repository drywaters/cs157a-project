Identifying d g Pornographic Content W.H Ho and P.A Watters Department of Computing and Postgraduate Professional Development Program Macquarie University NSW 2109 IA sharonho,pwatters@ics.mq.edu.au Abstract Content filtering on the WWW is significant social issue since children can easily access pornography and other illegal material with ease In this study a descriptive and predictive model of pornographic web page characteristics was developed to assist with recognition of pornographic pages in a content filter Support and confidence results from simple association rules suggest that using individual terms to identify pornographic web pages is useful for description but unreliable for prediction However Bayesian classification provided 99.1 accuracy in classifying test pages from both pornographic and non-pornographic corpora The challenges for multimodal filtering are discussed 1 Introduction The WWW contains more than 4 billion pages of diverse content While it is a very rich source f information it also s ge amounts of illegal matter and material unsuitable for children including race hate violence and pornography In contrast some adult surfers quite legitimately and legally access Internet pornography Most WWW users are typically only interested in a small part of the web that is relevant to them governed y their interests and needs The existence of other web pages may be irrelevant to them with accidental exposure possibly undesirable To both children and adults the web access experience will be more pleasant and productive if web pages not within their interests and needs are ranked lower in the lists returned to them by search engines or web pages considered to be undesirable are not shown at all To companies and schools the exclusion of shopping web sites and pornography from web accesses of their employees during office hours for examples creates a more productive working environment and reduces risk due to vicarious liability The aim of the current study is to determine whether descriptive and predictive data mining techniques can be successfully applied to automatically classifying requested web pages as acceptable or non-acceptable based on user preferences 1 T he s p e c i f i c e x a m pl e u s e d i s pornogra phy 205 t he r e appear to be two very distinct classes of web user here 205 some deliberately seek it out while others are annoyed by accidentally being exposed to it Mabasher 3 f i r st d e sc r i b e d web personalisation as any action that makes the Web experience of a user personalised to a user\220s taste The actions can range from simply making a presentation more pleasing to an individual to anticipating the needs of the user and providing the right information The scope of personalisation goes beyond just the construction of web pages suited to their tastes but also the web they are accessing 205 in essence a tailored-made virtual web Some web surfers are disgusted with the unintentional access to pornographic materials embedded within SPAM e-mail messages or banner 215pop-up\216 advertisements Of great concern to families is that one in four children who use the Internet is exposed

women respectively admitted to have accessed pornography at work Howe ve r t h e c urre nt technology mainly the blacklisting of web sites employed by existing filtering products to filter unwanted materials does not achieve a satisfactory result for either the group who want to access pornography or those who never want to see it This is where data mining can potentially provide a solution by creating an accurate classifier that can discriminate between pornographic and non-pornographic web pages One can imagine that such a classifier could be used in a search engine to optimise search results for pornography or could be used to block access to such pages based on user preference The blocking aspect is significant given the limitations of 215white listing\216 a set of hand-picked and verified sites or the 215black listing\216 of sites known to be unacceptable In this paper we present the results of an investigation into the identification of pornographic materials based on the development of a descriptive and predictive model of pornographic web page content The aim is to a determine the set of features or characteristics that identify a page as being pornographic and b to develop a classifier that can be used to predict given a set of tokens extracted from a web page and ts constituent parts header body title etc whether any given page is pornographic The first part of our study focused on identifying the characteristics of web pages based on their structure and term distributions derived from a training corpus of several thousand pages The results of this work indicate that the structure of pornographic web pages is Proceedings of the 21st International Conf erence on Data Engineering \(ICDE \22205 1084-4627/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE 


distinct from non-pornographic web pages and that many terms appear only within pornographic web sites or rarely in non-pornographic web pages The second part of our study focused on the determination of simple association rules using terms to identify unseen pornographic web pages While the association results were of great descriptive interest support and confidence results suggested that a predictive model might be better able to predict category  Thus in the ird part f our study we examined whether a Bayesian classifier could be used to determine the probability that a requested web page belongs to the pornographic class The study show that the on accuracy of the Bayesian assifier was 99.1 on an unseen sample of me 258 pornographic web pages and 3,153 non-pornographic web pages with low false positive and false negative rates 2 Modelling rnographic Pages A corpus of pornographic and non-pornographic web pages was constructed to facilitate the analysis of textual compositions and HTML structures in both categories The corpus comprised some 1,232 Pornographic web pages sampled from 864 web sites according to the adult web site directory provided by the AltaVista e search engine and 6,967 Non-Pornographic web pages from 5,040 sites obtained by following links from the Google Yahoo and Infoseek directories The pornographic web pages sampled consisted of the following 3 main groups 001 Entry pages which tell viewers that the web sites contain adult material and are suitable only for people of age 18 or higher Some of these web pages already contain photographs primarily of women though they may not be particularly erotic or considered as pornographic in their own right 001 Actual web pages that contain nude women or very occasionally men and erotic material 001 Directories of pornographic web sites The non-pornographic web pages belonged to 18 subgroups of a different nature each having around 400 web pages These groupings were not directly used in any of the work that follows but were sampled to reduce any biases in the construction of the non-pornographic corpus Thus the non-pornographic category is very broad by design although further studies could examine whether specific sub-categories were more or less accurate in terms of category prediction compared to pornographic pages The total number of web pages sampled was 8,199 with 15 being pornographic and 85 non-pornographic 1.1 Structural Modelling A large number of structural differences between the pages belonging to the pornographic and nonpornographic categories were found as shown in Table 1 Some of these differences indicated an order f magnitude difference in the pornographic category compared to the non-pornographic category For example only 0.8 of non-pornographic web pages had more than five links to images while some 40 of pornographic pages did The analysis also showed that pornographic web pages were linked to or embedded with more images but were relatively more standalone linking to fewer other web pages Though fewer tokens were found in pornographic web pages a r portion of them were being highlighted We also found that by visually inspecting the web pages collected pornographic and non-pornographic pages used different background colours nonpornographic pages tended to use white or light background colours while pornographic used much darker ones Only images of size greater than 40*40 pixels were counted eliminating icons or 217section separators\220 The links to other HTML pages include same site or external web site references and the only tokens tagged within b b or font font and having large font size or colour other than black were counted Pornographic Non-pornographic  74 have more than 5 images 32 have more than 5images Image count 60 have more than 10 images 13 have more than 10 images 73 have more than 5 links 85 have more than 5 links Links to other HTML pages 46 have more than 10 links 76 have more than 10 links 40 have more than 5 links 0.8 have more than 5 links Links to images movies 36 have 11 to 20 links 0.2 have 11 to 20 links 36 have less than 40 words 17 have less than 40 words Passage Words not used for links 28 have more than 200 words 50 have more than 200 words 75 have more than 10 of their words highlighted 54 have more than 10 of their words highlighted Highlighted Words 21 have all their words highlighted 9.7 have all their words highlighted Table 1 Structural Differences in Pornographic and Non-pornographic web pages In both categories Title was specified in 98 of the web pages with 97 having text in the Body Only 58 of non-pornographic web pages had usable Meta information keywords or descriptions with slightly less for pornographic web pages at 52 Proceedings of the 21st International Conf erence on Data Engineering \(ICDE \22205 1084-4627/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE

Given that simple ation rules were not suitable as predictors of category ership for pornographic web pages we developed a more sophisticated classifier using Bayes\220 Rule whi c h u s e s t he te rm di s t ri buti on of a resentative number f terms found in both pornographic and non-pornographic web pages to determine the likelihood that an unseen web page is pornographic or not To use Bayes\220 rule an unclassified document D was represented by a term vector consisting of n terms D  t 1 203.t n  The conditional probabilities of an unknown document D being in class C i for both pornographic and non-pornographic categories were calculated and the document was then assigned to the class with a higher conditional probability According to the Na\357ve Bayes\220 rule the probability that a document belongs to a given class is a function of the observed frequency with which ms occurring in that document also occur in other documents known to be representative members of that class using the formula     1 Dp CpCtp DCp nj j iij i 001    The occurrence obtained from the analysis of the corpus of 8,199 web pages described in the previous sections was converted to term frequencies 5.1 Test Corpus The algorithm was evaluated using a testing corpus of 3,411 web pages with 258 web pages being pornographic and 3,153 web pages being non-pornographic The test and training sets were drawn from independent groups of websites to eliminate any testing bias and this preliminary testing set of pornographic pages is relatively small Among them 294 were close positive cases as shown in Table 10 001 Abortion 001 Nude 001 Arts 001 Sex Education 001 Contraception 001 Sex Law 001 Gay Right 001 Sexual Health 001 Glamour 001 Swim Suit 001 Medical Health 001 Nude 001 Abortion Table 10 Composition of the testing corpus 5.2 Evaluation Metrics The following metrics were used in the evaluation of the statistical approaches employed in the classification of pornography 001 True Negative T.N Number of pornographic pages misclassified as non-pornographic 001 False Positive F.P Number of non-pornographic pages misclassified as pornographic 001 Macro Recall Rate being the average of the portion of pornography correctly classified and the portion of non-pornography correctly classified 100   2/1 002 003 004 005 006 007 001  001 Non PFNon Porn NTPorn where Porn was the total number of pornographic pages in the test corpus and Non was the total number of non-pornographic pages in the test corpus 001 Macro Precision Macro Prec being the average of the portion of web pages classified as pornographic that were actually pornographic and the portion of web pages classified as non-pornographic that were actually non-pornographic 100     2/1 002 003 004 005 006 007  001 001   001 001 NTPFNon PFNon PFNTPorn NTPorn  where Porn was the total number of pornographic items in the test corpus and Non was the total number of non-pornographic items in the test corpus 001 Accuracy Acc the ratio of correctly classified web pages to the size of the testing corpus 100 NonPorn NegativeTruePositionFalseNonPorn  001\001  5.3 Results Table 11 shows that applying Bayes\220 Rule to the three sections Title Meta and Body all resulted in an accuracy rate higher than 95 with the highest of 98.4 achieved by the Body section The main reason for Title\220s lower score was that titles of web pages are usually shorter h many containing less than 10 terms Thus the improvement over the use of a single term ch based on an association rule is not significant In addition a term hat normally appears more often in the category other than the one it should be in can bias the classification result significantly The low accuracy rate of the Meta section is again due to the low percentage of web pages containing Meta information There were nine True Negative cases for e Meta section but the figure used in calculating the accuracy rate was much higher as Proceedings of the 21st International Conf erence on Data Engineering \(ICDE \22205 1084-4627/05 $20.00 \251 2005  IEEE

While the focus of the current study is in web page personalisation vis-\340-vis pornography the techniques utilised are clearly generalisable to other content categories given the high test

to integrate text based pornographic page identification algorithms with video and image-based systems This is a significant requirement since the target material that we are seeking to block is more likely to be video and images rather than text 205 the text simply provides the set of types that we use to identify a page as pornographic by inference Current research i ndi c a te s t h a t 215 fle

distinguish between an identified image of a breast that is part of a presentation on breast cancer as opposed to a pornographic image Similar issues exist for video where there are few standards for marking up streaming data with text augmentation 17  Given that entry pages into pornographic sites consist mainly of text but that actual presentation of pornographic data is video or images feature extraction techniques need to be integrated with a common classification system that can make the most informed choice in a given context For example if an image is detected as having a high proportion of skin then the s of any associated web pages need to extracted and used in the classification procedure Integrated multimodal classification remains the major challenge to filtering

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
