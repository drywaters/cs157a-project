This new approach can not only find the relations of continuous attributes, but also discrete \(nominal using crisp sets as special fuzzy sets, moreover combine them together to get good rules for analysers However, compared with traditional models, fuzzy models generally have space and time complexity problem. We therefore develop the effective reduced database algorithm with less space and time complexity, which effectively form the transparent and k n o w l e d g e  b a s e d  f u z z y  m o d e l    r e d u c e d  d a t a b a s e  t a b l e   s o  t h a t  we can simply discover fuzzy association rules from the reduced database table Keywords  Simple shaped fuzzy partition; Fuzzy association rules; Reduced database table \(RDBT algorithm \(ERDB I II A B INTRODUCTION Association rules are useful machine learning model used to represent commonly found patterns in original data.[1 Compared with traditional association rules, fuzzy association rules provide linguistic explanation and overcome the sharp boundary problems [2] in continuous \(numerical and also can be used to analyse the mixture relations both in discrete \(nominal However, the space and time complexity problem is one of the big issues of fuzzy models. To solve this problem, we discover fuzzy association rules whose credibility is reasonably high from the reduced database table by using the effective reduced database algorithm Reduced database table \(RDBT  distribution over  words  which is inferred from the original database. It is represented in the form of a table in which each line represents a combination of particular attribute values of each attribute with its associated probability. It is also a knowledge based transparent fuzzy model, and can be used to discover other fuzzy models, such as fuzzy association rules Effective reduced database algorithm \(ERDB  by Jim Baldwin is an efficient algorithm to effectively form the reduced database table which only reflects the main characteristics and ignores information which rarely occurs. It therefore overcomes the space and time complexity problem of fuzzy models in soft computing Fuzzy association rules can be used to summarise the information of original database in some applications, such as information retrieval, document content management, etc. In section IV, we will show a new approach of supermarket basket analysis, which uses fuzzy association rules discovered by the effective reduced database algorithm to analyse supermarket basket data FUZZY ASSOCIATION RULES Simply triangular or trapezoidal shape fuzzy sets To be able to handle imprecision and uncertainty of the representation of concepts and words in the real world, most machine learning models have been united with fuzzy logic introduced by Zadeh in 1965 [4]. These fuzzy models overcome the sharp boundary problems [2], and hence provide a soft controller surface and good accuracy in dealing with 


a soft controller surface and good accuracy in dealing with continuous attributes Fuzzy set theory [4], proposed by Zadeh in 1965, shows a good idea that is the use of simple linguistic words in place of numbers for soft computing and reasoning. This provides fuzzy logic with a simplified explanation power of being a suitable interface between human users and computing systems. This power does, though, depend on the form of fuzzy sets. If the fuzzy sets are simple triangular or trapezoidal in shape, then they can be given an easy interpretation. If they have a complicated shape, they do not provide a useful linguistic description Optimised fuzzy sets, such as neuro-fuzzy sets [5], are used to obtain good accuracy but they have no explanation power because of their complicated shape. We investigate methods of deriving fuzzy association rules based on Ruspini fuzzy partition [6] for each attribute, which is defined as a family of triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy sets such that for any argument value the memberships add to 1 Fuzzy sets models and membership function In this paper, we use either equal space fuzzy sets \(ES-FS model in Fig. 1 or equal data points fuzzy sets \(EDP-FS 0-7803-9158-6/05/$20.00  2005 IEEE. The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems779 model in Fig. 2 for continuous \(numerical which are based on Ruspini fuzzy partition [6], and still use crisp sets as a special case of fuzzy sets for discrete \(nominal attributes [7  n21 a b 3Fuzzy set 1-n a-ba  1-n a b-\(na  Fig. 1: Equal space fuzzy sets \(ES-FS In the fuzzy sets model in Fig. 1, the ranges of the fuzzy sets are equally spaced in the universal set [a, b], and therefore those fuzzy sets are symmetrical and equally spaced  n21 a b 3Fuzzy set  1-n 2  m  n  a  v a l   1-n m\(a val  m/\(n-1 n-1 n-1 n-1 Number of instances Fig. 2: Equal data points fuzzy sets \(EDP-FS In the model in Fig. 2, the number of instances in each interval covered by a fuzzy set in the universal set [a, b] is equal. Normally, those fuzzy sets are asymmetric Mass Assignment Theory [5] proposed by Baldwin in 1991 integrates fuzzy logic and probability theory. It shows that for simple shaped fuzzy partition {f i} of kth attribute, input such as x = g  is translated into distribution over fuzzy sets of words using membership function Ff : x o [0, 1], where g can be point value, fuzzy set or probability distribution [4]. The membership values Fi\(x f i | g a point value, then Pr \(f i | g g point value semantic unification [5] to calculate it C. Fuzzy association rules based on Ruspini fuzzy partition Association rules represent the interesting relationships in data. The format of association rules is X?Y \(IF X THEN Y with support and credibility \(confidence  association rules, X and Y are either fuzzy variables that take fuzzy sets as values for continuous attributes, or traditional variables that take crisp sets for discrete attributes. This makes 


variables that take crisp sets for discrete attributes. This makes fuzzy association rules more powerful than traditional association rules Supposing there are k attributes in total and the jth attribute is on the right side of a fuzzy association rule, the rule based on fuzzy sets models in section II.B is of the form shown in rule 1 IF \(A1 is small  AND \(Aj-1 is small Aj+1 is medium AND  AND \(Ak is large Aj is large where the set of terms between IF and THEN is the left side of fuzzy association rule and the term after THEN is the right side of the rule, and the clauses of the terms are words of attributes defined by fuzzy sets. Each fuzzy association rule has its support and credibility defined as below Definition 1: The joint probability pr = Pr\(A1 is small   Aj-1 is small ? Aj is large ? Aj+1 is medium  Ak is large is the support of the fuzzy association rule in rule 1 The support of a fuzzy association rule represents the frequency of occurrence of the particular combination of attribute values in the fuzzy association rule in the data set. If the right side of the rule contains more than one attribute, pr will be the joint probability of all attributes except for those attributes appearing the right side using definition 5 Let p = Pr\(A1 is small  Aj-1 is small ? Aj+1 is medium   Ak is large  kA...Pr largeisA 1 j large Definition 2: The value of p p r  is the credibility \(confidence of the fuzzy association rule in rule 1 The credibility of a fuzzy association rule represents how often it is likely to be true Only the fuzzy association rule whose credibility is greater than or equal to the credibility threshold H are chosen. Those rules are likely to be true, if H is reasonably high. The credibility threshold H is inputted by user D. Unification and consistency of fuzzy association rules If fuzzy association rules with the same fuzzy sets on the right side of rules are satisfied with one of attributes on the left side of rules containing all fuzzy sets and the other attributes containing the same fuzzy set, those fuzzy association rules can be combined into one rule For example, assuming 3 attributes X, Y, Z with 3 fuzzy sets in each, 3 fuzzy association rules in Fig. 3 are therefore equivalent to a single fuzzy association rule: IF \(Y is small THEN \(Z is large IF \(X is small Y is small Z is large IF \(X is medium Y is small Z is large IF \(X is large Y is small Z is large IF \(Y is small THEN \(Z is large Fig. 3: Unification of fuzzy association rules We generally keep the single unified fuzzy association rule instead of 3 separated rules Our experiments are based on consistent fuzzy association rules whose fuzzy set of related attribute on the right side should not be conflict with one another if they have the same left side For example, fuzzy association rules rule 2 and rule 3 are The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems780 inconsistent, because rule 2 includes IF \(X is large Y is small Z is small IF \(X is large Z is small IF \(X is large Y is small Z is medium If a high enough credibility threshold, such as 0.9, is used during the procedure of discovering fuzzy association rules the set of rules will be consistent. The demonstration is shown in section III.E REDUCED DATABASE TABLE AND EFFECTIVE 


REDUCED DATABASE TABLE AND EFFECTIVE REDUCED DATABASE ALGORITHM III A B Why we need reduced database table &amp; effective reduced database algorithm Soft computing, unlike conventional \(hard represent and reason with vague and uncertain information in the real world, which provides good performance in control modelling, and decision making in complex systems However, these algorithms face two main problems: space and time complexity, and transparent knowledge representation For example, to build the fuzzy model of a commercial database with 100 attributes, assuming we can take 3 possible values each attribute which could be fuzzy sets or linguistic sets, there will be 3100 | 5.15u1047 possible combinations Supposing we use 1 byte to store 1 combination, it requires 5u1038 gigabyte space to store these combinations, and would take about 7.5u1030 years to read these combinations using 2 GHz CPU. This is impossible for any present personal computer On the other hand, some fuzzy models using a black box learning approach, such as fuzzy neural network, might give better accuracy, but users have no idea why the system generates such a result. In most practical cases, users would like the system to be so transparent for the generalizing and reasoning that they are able to explain the results to their customers or managers, even though the accuracy might be slightly worse than using black box models Reduced database table \(RDBT transparent fuzzy model to solve these problems. Effective reduced database algorithm \(ERDB to form reduced database table with less space and time complexity.  In this paper, we use this model to discover fuzzy association rules, which drops those rows in the reduced database table whose joint probabilities are less than the threshold G without losing main information Reduced database table \(RDBT The reduced database table \(RDBT  original database is a joint probability table over  words  It includes two parts. The part on the left side is a table which has a column for each data attribute and the rows containing the relevant combinations of attribute values. Those values of attributes can be words defined by fuzzy sets, linguistic sets discrete sets, and so on. The other is the joint probability distribution, and each one is associated with a particular combination in each row on its left side For only one line of original database with k attributes and triangle fuzzy partition {f i} of kth attribute, as input x = g the joint probability Pr joint = Pr \(attri_1 ? attri_2  attri_k one row of reduced database table is Pr joint k kki g F , where F k i \(g k f k i | g k 1 For example, assuming we already know Pr \(f k i | g k on the right of Fig. 4, the joint probability Prjoint-2 associated with fuzzy sets combination {small, small, medium} in the second row of reduced database table on the left of Fig. 4 is calculated as Pr joint-2 = Pr \(Asmall ?

Effective reduced database algorithm \(ERDB Compared with traditional models, fuzzy models generally have more complexity, because of the number of fuzzy sets required in the model. We therefore develop an algorithm to 


required in the model. We therefore develop an algorithm to form the reduced database table effectively and hence to discover fuzzy association rules, which uses the idea of dropping those entries \(rows joint probability is less than a reasonably threshold G. It is namely effective reduced database algorithm [3 Definition 3: Any entry with Prjoint &lt; G in the reduced database table is eliminated by the effective reduced database algorithm ERDB inputted by user The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems781 The joint probability threshold G could be either a certain value for each reduced database table, or the maximum probability of each reduced database table with a certain percentage. We call the former threshold probability threshold, and the latter maximum probability threshold Because the maximum probability threshold is adjusted with joint probability of the table, it has no problem with the curse of dimensionality for large number of attributes The effective reduced database algorithm \(ERDB  illustrated below EFFECTIVE REDUCED DATABASE ALGORITHM \(ERDB Calculate all one attribute only reduced database tables Choose that one with least rows Do loop until all attributes are extended 1 more attribute for attributes not already chosen 2 database tables 3 End do loop When a reduced database table extends a new attribute, the rows of attribute values in the new reduced database table formed will initially be all combinations of the rows of attribute values in the previous reduced database table plus the extended attribute  s one attribute only reduced database table Then we calculate the joint probability distribution of the new table. Finally forming the new reduced database table will be fully completed, after dropping the rows whose joint probabilities are less than the threshold G.

However, those entries with small joint probability are removed to help to reduce noisy rules. The removed entries will not be extended to form the next new reduced database table with one more attribute D E Less space and time complexity, transparency, knowledge based Effective reduced database algorithm provides the advantage of forming reduced database table with less space and time complexity As what we discussed in section III.A and III.C, there would be i k possible entries in reduced database table in total which will be huge number in practice. However, the effective reduced database algorithm can significantly reduce space and time complexity without losing too much information. For example, in them first example of supermarket basket analysis application in section IV, because there are 11 attributes in database and 3 fuzzy sets in each attribute, the possible combinations in total would be 311 = 177,147. It is a huge hypothesis space to search the right set of fuzzy association rules. However, there are only 9 entries left to generate fuzzy association rules by using the effective reduced database algorithm The reduced database table formed by using the effective reduced database algorithm is transparent for users. Each combination of words on its left side represent a rule discovered from original database, and the joint probability distribution on its right side will tell users how often the related combination of words in the same row occurs in the original database. And we can also work out more measurement of those rules according to the joint probability distribution, such as credibility of fuzzy association rules Those words associated with joint probability distribution are also very easy to understand for a human being The reduced database table can also be known as a knowledge based table contained the main information of 


knowledge based table contained the main information of original database, and it can be further used to discover other fuzzy models in the soft computing and machine learning such as fuzzy association rules, fuzzy decision tree [9], fuzzy Bayesian net [10], etc Fuzzy association rules from reduced database table After we get the final reduced database table by using the effective reduced database algorithm, we need determine attributes to be on the right side of rules as so to form the set of fuzzy association rules, and then drop those rules whose credibility is less than credibility threshold H from the reduced database table For example, if we assume the joint probability threshold G is 0.01 and select attribute C as the attribute on the right side of rules, we can respectively form rule 4 from the 2nd row and rule 5 from 3rd row in the reduced database table in Fig. 4 IF \(A is small B is small C is medium The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems782 IF \(A is small B is small C is large As the nature of reduced database table, the support of each fuzzy association rule is the joint probability associated with the row to form the rule on the right side of reduced database table. Therefore, supportrule 4 = Pr joint-2 = 0.018 and supportrule 5 Pr joint-3 = 0.162. According to the Definition 2, p = Pr joint-1 Pr joint-2 + Pr joint-3 = 0 + 0.018 + 0.162 = 0.18, therefore credibilityrule 4 = Pr joint-2 y p = 0.1 and credibilityrule 5 = Pr joint-3 y p = 0.9. If the credibility threshold H is 0.9, we only keep rule 5 in the end. This procedure is also applied to the right side of rules containing more than one attribute F. A simple experiment to prove fuzzy association rules from reduced database table In this simple experiment, we create a 3-attribute 289example original dataset \(attributes X, Y ? [0, 8 values of X, Y attributes are symmetrically selected with the interval 0.5 and values of Z attribute are inferred using consistent fuzzy association rules in Fig. 6, where every attributes use 3 equal space fuzzy sets defined in definition 2 IF \(X is small Z is small IF \(Y is large Z is small IF \(NOT \(X is small Y is small Z is large IF \(NOT \(X is small Y is medium Z is medium Fig. 6: The original set of fuzzy association rules Then, we discover another set of fuzzy association rules from the original dataset formed previously, by using the effective reduced database algorithm with probability threshold G = 0.035 and credibility threshold H = 0.5. After unifying the set of rules we discovered, we get the exactly same set of fuzzy association rules as the original set of rules in Fig. 6 IV A SUPERMARKET BASKET ANALYSIS APPLICATION For supermarket basket analysis, association rules can be used to adjust store layouts, cross-selling, promotions catalogue design and to identify customer segments based on buying patterns [11]. However, traditional rules are only restricted in the interested relations of certain groups of items consistently purchased together, so that the original database has to only use discrete attributes. This brings the big complexity problem, while analysing the relationship of hundreds of items or more Fuzzy association rules can deal with continuous attributes in database. We therefore develop a new approach associated with continuous attributes for supermarket basket analysis, in addition to using discrete attributes as well. For instance, in the first example of supermarket basket example database, we discover the set of fuzzy association rules to describe customer  s favourite by using the relations among spending or shopping frequency and nutrient contents. It therefore reduces the number of features or attributes to be analysed. In the second example, we discover the rules combined both discrete and continuous attributes as so to cover more important 


and continuous attributes as so to cover more important features for analysis, compared with traditional association rules The example database and data set The supermarket basket database contains three tables illustrated in Fig. 7 a customers, such as name, sex, age, postcode, etc b panel data, which is randomly generated by data generator according to several certain shopping behaviours of customers. It includes UPC \(universal product code number of items purchased, total price, etc c information published in the website [12], such as energy, fat content, sugar content of each product in per 100 gram Fig. 7: Supermarket basket database example B 1 The parameters and examples To mining fuzzy association rules using the effective reduced database algorithm from prepared data set, we set up maximum probability threshold G as 0.15, which drops those entries whose joint probability is less than 15% of the maximum probability of each reduced database table, and credibility threshold H as 0.9 Nutrient contents not items We use SQL to select an customer shopping history to form 2 data sets, which contains his total spending or the amount of items purchased in each day separately and 10 kinds of nutrient contents of products purchased in that shopping in total, to discover fuzzy association rules In the first data set, we discover 9 fuzzy association rules and one of them is shown below IF \(sum_of_energy is high sum_of_protein is high sum_of_carbohydrate is high sum_of_vitamins is medium sum_of_fat is high sum_of_sodium is high sum_of_sugar is medium sum_of_fibre is high sum_of_starch is high sum_of_iron is medium THEN \(total_spending is high In the second data set, we discover 8 fuzzy association rules, and one of them is shown below The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems783 IF \(sum_of_energy is high sum_of_protein is high sum_of_carbohydrate is high sum_of_vitamins is medium sum_of_fat is high sum_of_sodium is high sum_of_sugar is medium sum_of_fibre is medium sum_of_starch is high sum_of_iron is medium THEN \(amount_of_items_purchased is big We can use this method to analyse the favourite poroduct or behaviour of a certain customer or a certain group of customers. The new approach of using nutrient contents instead of items in the relations gives much less complexity of association rules, especially to analyse hundreds or thousands of items in the supermarket 2 V Both discrete and continuous attributes We give another simple example below that includes both discrete and continuous attributes in the fuzzy association rule which is discovered from the data set containing customer  s sex, age and the sum of sugar content of products he/she purchased each time IF \(sex is male age is old sum_of_sugar is medium As it can be seen, if we use crisp sets as special fuzzy sets in fuzzy association rules, we still have the traditional association rules Combining discrete attributes such as customer details \(sex postcode, city, etc attributes such as nutrient contents, spending, price, stock, cost and customer  s age in the association rules is very helpful in 


and customer  s age in the association rules is very helpful in various kinds of business analysis. It provides alternative new approach to find some good relations for analyser CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Compared with traditional association rules, fuzzy association rules provide good linguistic explanation, and can deal with both discrete attributes and continuous attributes. It provides an alternative new approach in the applications of association rules, which not only can be used to reduce the complexity of association rules, but also to cover more important attributes in the rules In order to solve complexity problem of mining fuzzy association rules, we discover those rules by using the effective reduced database algorithm \(ERDB The reduced database table \(RDBT database algorithm are good methods to build a transparent and knowledge based fuzzy model with less space and time complexity. Afterwards it can be used to discover various kinds of fuzzy models, such as fuzzy association rules, fuzzy decision tree, fuzzy Bayesian net, etc In the end, we only keep those fuzzy association rules whose credibility is not less than credibility threshold H, which are discovered from the final reduced database table It is helpful to either use feature selection before running the ERDB algorithm or combine it with the ERDB algorithm which can drop redundant and unimportant attributes to reduce the dimension of the final reduced database table.

accurate estimates for distinct value queries and event reports This algorithm outperforms other estimators that are based on uniform sampling[8 9 e v e n when using much less sample space We also provide comparison with our Implication Lossy Counting ILC algorithm described in Section 5.1 which is based in the Lossy Counting algorithm introduced in For this series of experiments we used a real dataset of eight dimensions which was given to us by an OLAP company whose name we cannot disclose due to our agreement The cardinalities of the dimensions are presented in Table 3 The parameters of the algorithms are presented in Table 5 For NIPS/CI we used 64 concurrent bitmaps with a fringe size of four thus requiring memory enough to hold  2 4  1   64  K  1920 itemsets We expect that the averaging\([5 o v e r these man y bitmaps will result in an error less than 10 We used the exact same sample space for DS The bound parameter t for DS was set to  1920  50  following the suggestion in F o r ILC we used an approximation parameter   0  01 which increases the memory requirements of ILC relative to those of NIPS/CI or DS On the average ILC used more than twice the memory that NIPS/CI and DS used For example for the experiment in Figure 7\(B it used more than 8,000 entries We evaluate the results of the algorithms with respect to the number of tuples the cardinality of the participating dimensions and the implication conditions To simulate a real data stream scenario we tracked the conditional implication counts of A  B  E  F and the unconditional B  E using the aforementioned algorithms The rst workload corresponds to quite large compound cardinality while the second to very moderate cardinalities Table 4 presents the actual aggregates for various instances of the stream for   5 and  1  60 We believe that most workloads fall somewhere in the middle with respect to the complexity of the wanted implications and the size of the returned counts Figure 7\(A depicts the relative error as the stream evolves for workload A using the algorithms DS NIPS/CI and ILC for different implication parameters In Figure a we show the results for minimum support   5 and  1  60 or  1  80 The different  1 are encoded in the parentheses next to identication of the algorithm in the legend of the graph In Figure b we increased the minimum support to   50 We observe that the behavior of DS varies widely while NIPS/CI remains always below the expected 10 error DS actually keeps a sample of the distinct elements seen so far and tries to scale the implication count that holds for that sample to the whole set of distinct elements In most cases the data in the sample is not representative of the implication The situation for DS is exacerbated when the minimum support increases where quite a lot of samples do not participate in the count making the scaling even more errorprone Algorithm ILC in all cases returned very erroneous results although it used much more space than NIPS/CI and DS since it tries to store not the implication counts but the actual implicated itemsets In these workload the implicated itemsets overwhelm its available memory which is actually larger than the amount given to NIPS/CI and DS In gure 7\(B we present the results of the algorithms for workload B The situation is still in favor of NIPS/CI whose relative error remains always close to the expected 10 unlike DS who returns highly skewed errors even though the domain cardinalities are much smaller and therefore keeps in the sample space much more data As expected from the analysis the error guarantees of NIPS/CI are virtually unaffected by changes in the cardinalities or the number of tuples seen so far in the stream ILC returns very erroneous results although now the cardinalities and the implicated items are much smaller compared to those of workload A The reason is not only because it keeps too much information in memory i.e all the implicated itemsets while both NIPS/CI and DS only hold a mantissa for the count but also because the constraint    rel is broken as the number of tuples increases 7 Related Work There are unique challenges in query processing for the data stream model Most challenges are the result of the streams being potentially unbounded in size Therefore the amount of the storage required in order to get an exact size may also grow out of bounds Another equally important issue is the timely query response required although the volumes of data the need to be processed is continually augmented at a very high rate Essentially the amount of computation per data item received should not add a lot of latency to each item Otherwise any such algorithm wont be able to keep up with the data stream In many cases accessing secondary storage such as disks is not even an option In  there is a discussion of what queries can be answered e xactly using bounded memory and queries that must be approximated unless disk access is allowed Sketching techniques\([14 ha v e been introduced to build summaries of data in order to estimate the number F 0 of distinct elements in a dataset In three algorithms that      approximate the F 0 are described with various space and time requirements Distinct is dri v e n by hashing functions similar to those studied in 14 and provides highly accurate results for distinct value queries compared to those taken by uniform sampling by using only a fraction of their sample size In the algorithms Stick y Sampling and Lossy Counting are introduced that estimate frequency counts with application to association rules and iceberg cubes In a framework for performing set expression on continuously updated streams based on sketching techniques is presented In a general framework over multiple granularities is presented for both range-temporal and spatio-temporal aggregations In a framework for identifying hierarchical heavy hitters i.e hierarchical objects like network addresses whose prexes denes a hierarchy with a frequency above a given threshold is described The effect of impications between columns has been emphasized in the system that identies correlated pairs of columns and soft-dependencies and has been proved very useful in query optimization 8 Conclusions We have presented a generalized and parameterized framework that can accurately and efciently estimate implication counts and can be applied to many scenarios To the best of our knowledge this is the rst practical and truly scalable approach to the problem Proceedings of the 21st International

Figure 3a and 3b, is negative since CBA and PART achieved a higher classification rate against this particular dataset A comparison of the knowledge representation produced by our method, PART and CBA has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the set of rules derived. Figure 4 represents the classifiers generated form the hyperheuristic datasets. Analysis of the rules sets indicated that MMAC derives a few more rules than PART and CBA for the majority of the datasets. In particular, the proposed method produced more rules than PART and CBA on 8 and 7 datasets, respectively. A possible reason for extracting more rules is based on the recursive learning phase that MMAC employs to discover more hidden information that most of the associative classification techniques discard, since they only extract the highest confidence rule for each frequent item that survives MinConf Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 6. Conclusions A new approach for multi-class, and multi-label classification has been proposed that has many distinguishing features over traditional and associative classification methods in that it \(1 that contain rules with multiple labels, \(2 evaluation measures for evaluating accuracy rate, \(3 employs a new method of discovering the rules that require only one scan over the training data, \(4 introduces a ranking technique which prunes redundant rules, and ensures only high effective ones are used for classification, and \(5 discovery and rules generation in one phase to conserve less storage and runtime. Performance studies on 19 datasets from Weka data collection and 9 hyperheuristic scheduling runs indicated that our proposed approach is effective, consistent and has a higher classification rate than the-state-of-the-art decision tree rule \(PART and RIPPER algorithms. In further work, we anticipate extending the method to treat continuous data and creating a hyperheuristic approach to learn  on the fly   which low-level heuristic method is the most effective References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1].
