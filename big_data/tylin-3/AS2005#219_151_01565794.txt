C TC Correlating Tree Patterns for Classication Albrecht Zimmermann Bj orn Bringmann Machine Learning Lab Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg Georges-K ohler-Allee 79 79110 Freiburg Germany E-mail  azimmerm,bbringma  informatik.uni-freiburg.de Abstract We present C TC  a new approach to structural classication  It uses the predictive power of tree patterns correlating with the class values combining state-of-the-art tree mining with sophisticated pruning techniques to nd the 
k most discriminative pattern in a dataset In contrast to existing methods C TC uses no heuristics and the only parameters to be chosen by the user are the maximum size of the rule set and a single statistically well founded cut-off value The experiments show that C TC classiers achieve good accuracies while the induced models are smaller than those of existing approaches facilitating comprehensibility 1 Introduction 
Classication is one of the most important data mining tasks Whereas traditional approaches have focused on at representations using feature vectors or attribute-value representations there has recently been a lot of interest in more expressive representations such as sequences trees and graphs 4 5 1 12 3  M ot i v at i ons for t h i s i n t eres t i ncl ude drug design since molecules can be represented as graphs or sequences Classication of such data paves the way towards drug design on the screen instead of extensive experiments in the lab Regarding documents XML essentially a tree-structured representati 
on is becoming ever more popular Classication in this context allows for more efcient dealing with large amounts of electronic documents Existing approaches to classify structured data can be categorized into various categories namely propositionalization approaches 5 1 association rule approaches 12 and integrated techniques 11 9 3 The y d i f fer l a r gel y i n the way they derive structural features for discriminating between examples belonging to the different classes They share the need for the user to set parameters inuencing the feature derivation and the use of heuristics Also the rst 
two approaches typically produce large feature sets making classiers rather difcult to interpret In this work we present C TC  an approach situated between the association rule technique and integrated systems It is motivated by recent results on nding correlated patterns allowing to nd the k best  i.e most discriminating features according to a convex maximization criterion such as  2 8 Rather than generatin g the complete set of patterns satisfying a given criterion and post-processing them or searching for good features in a heuristic manner C 
TC computes the set of k best patterns by employing a branchand-bound search Only two parameters have to be specied decoupling the success of the classier from decisions about parameters inuencing the search process The paper is organized as follows in Section 2 we describe earlier work on the topic and relate it to our approach in Section 3 we discuss technical aspects of our method and outline our algorithm in Section 4 the experimental evaluation is explained and results are discussed We conclude in Section 5 and point to future work directions 
2 Related work Structural classication has been done with different techniques Firstly there are several propositionalization approaches e.g 5 and  1   W hile details may dif fer  t he basic mechanism in these approaches is to rst mine all patterns that are unexpected according to some measure typically frequency Using these instances are transformed into bitstring representation and classiers trained These approaches can show excellent performance and have access to the whole spectrum of machine learning techniques but there are also problems The decision which patterns to consider meaningful e.g frequent ones will have an effect on the quality of the model The resulting feature set can be 
very large requiring pruning of some kind Finally interpretation of the resulting model is not easy especially if the classier is non-symbolic e.g a SVM A second group of approaches is similar to the associative classication approach Again une xpected patterns 1 Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE 


are mined each of them associated with the class value An example is Zaki et al s X R ULES classier Each pattern is considered as predicting its class Usually the resulting rule set has to be post-processed and/or a conict resolution technique employed As in the propositionalization techniques the choice of mining constraints is not straightforward and the resolution technique can strongly inuence performance as has been shown e.g in 10 13  Additionally the resulting classier often consists of thousands of rules making interpretation by the user again difcult Finally there exist integrated techniques that do not mine all patterns but generate features during classier construction Since structural data can be represented in predicate logic techniques such as F OIL 11 and P ROGOL 9 can be used for the task of structural classication While ILP approaches are elegant and powerful working on large datasets can be too computationally expensive Approaches such as DT-GBI 3 c ons truct the features us ed by graphmining Most integrated approaches have in common that feature induction is done in a heuristic way e.g using beam search The user sets the parameters governing this search such as beam size and maximum number of literals per rule in F OIL and beam size maximum number of specializations per node and possibly minimum frequency in DT-GBI In contrast only two parameters have to be specied for C TC  The rst one is the maximum rule size giving the user an intuitive way to decide on the complexity of the resulting model The second one the cut-off value below which to not consider rules interesting anymore is optional By setting this value the user can enforce the signicance of included rules By basing it on e.g the p-values for the  2 distribution the user has a well-founded guide-line for choosing this value 3 Methodology In this section we sketch the pattern matching notion used by the C TC approach discuss upper bound calculation the main component of the principled search for the most discriminating pattern and formulate the algorithm itself 3.1 Matching embedded trees Several types of structured data exist such as graphs trees and sequences In this paper we will focus on tree structured data like XML only Thus we need a notion for matching tree structured data We use tree embedding to compare our approach with Zaki et al s technique Due to space constraints we cannot give a formal denition here and refer the reader to 12 This particular notion is more exible than simple subtrees and the mining process is still efcient In general other matching notions see 4 and e v en dif ferent representations could be used with C TC  This includes not only Table 1 A contingency cable c 1 c 2 T y T x T  y T x T  T m  y T n  m   x T  y T  n  x T m n  m n        y c x Threshold f\(k k f\(c f\(l l   x ,y c ,c \(x y y ,y x 0,0 y T c ,c uu ll T x T T T T x y ,0 T y T T T A Convex function B Convex hull of  s domain Figure 1 Convex function and convex hull of the set of possible  x  T y  T  other notions of matching trees but also graphs sequences etc since the general principles of our approach apply to all domains 3.2 Correlation measures A correlation measure compares the expected frequency of the joint occurence of a pattern and a certain class value to the observed frequency If the resulting value is larger than a given threshold the deviation is considered statistically signicant enough to assume a causal relationship between the pattern and the class We organize the observed frequencies in a contingency table cf Table 1 Since x T and y T are sufcient for calculating the value of a correlation measure on this table we view these measures as real-valued functions on N 2 for the remainder of this paper While we focus on binary class problems a multi-class problem can be tackled by choosing the right measure and training round-robin classiers Since correlation measures are not anti-\one directed search becomes more difcult But if they are convex an upper bound for the score of future patterns can be calculated making it possible to prune the search tree 3.3 Convexity and upper bounds Convex functions like  2 and Information Gain see 8 for a proof take their extreme values at the points forming the convex hull of their domain D  Consider the graph of f  x  in Figure 1\(A with D   k l  which also makes those points the convex hull Obviously f  k  and f  l  are locally maximal and f  l  the global maximum Given the current value of the function at f  c   evaluating f at k and l allows to check whether it is possible for any future value of c to put the value of f over the threshold For the two-dimensional case the extreme values are reached at the vertices of the enclosing polygon such as the parallelogram in Figure 1\(B in our case This parallelogram encloses all possible tuples  x  T y  T  that cor2 Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE

pattern is treated as a rule predicting the more frequent class among the training instances covered by it In case of a tie the majority class in the dataset is predicted 3.5 Classication strategies The computed ruleset can be used in different ways in the classication process A rst simple strategy often refered to as decision list DL uses the rst rule from the ordered ruleset matching an instance for classication A second strategy called majority vote MV collects all rules and in the least complex version predicts the class that is predicted by the majority of the matching rules Since it is counter-intuitive that rules of different strength are given the same weight we also evaluate two discounting strategies from the eld of associative patterns 6 12  O ne i s t h e average strength method AvgStr introduced by Zaki et al in 12 F o r each clas s  the s trength e.g condence w  r  t this class of the rules matching the instance is added up and normalized by dividing by the number of rules The class with highest average strength is predicted or the majority class if no class achieves higher than default strength Finally the weighted  2 heuristic WChi introduced by Han et al 6 discounts the  2 value for each rule against the maximum  2 value that rule could have attained In all cases the majority class is predicted if no rule matches the instance to be classied 4 Experimental evaluation For the experimental evaluation we compared our approach to Zaki et al s X R ULES 12 and T REE 2 anintegrated approach introduced in 2 b as ed on s i milar principles as C TC ontheXMLdatausedin[12  The XML data used in our experiments are log les from web-site visitors sessions They are separated into three weeks CSLOG1 2 and 3 and each session is classied based on whether the visitor came either from an edu domain or from any other domain For the mining process we set k  1000 and  user 3  84  the 90%-p value for the  2 distribution For the comparison with T REE 2 we built decision trees with the same cut-off value In each setting we used one set of data for training and another one for testing Following Zakis notation CSLOG x y denotes that we trained on set x andtestedonset y  The results are summarized in Table 2 Each column is labeled with the setting and reports the error rate for the classier and its complexity Complexity for XR ULES and C TC are given in number of rules for T REE 2 in number of inner nodes The mining step itself gave rise to less than 1000 rules for C TC on each dataset ranging from 497 on CSLOG2 to 981 on CSLOG12 To arrive at the subset of rules used in the classier whose size is reported in Table 2 the n best rules mined were evaluated on a validation set half the test set with n ranging from 10 to the maximum number mined with increments of ten A graph showing the effects of using a subset of the rules mined is shown in Figure 2 It is interesting that less than 100 rules cause high error rates and increasing n past 200 decreases the quality of the classier again The resulting classier was then evaluated on the other half of the test set As expected T REE 2 has the least complex models since it creates features on-demand It is however outperformed by XR ULES and the rst three C TC versions MV,DL,AvgStr except for the rst setting XR ULES  models are two orders of magnitude larger than C TC s while not being signicantly better than the rst three of the C TC versions on the 5 level for all settings XR ULES shows better performance than C TC using the Weighted Chi heuristic on the settings CSLOG2-3 and CSLOG12-3 5 Conclusion and future work In this work we presented C TC  a rule-based approach to structural classication Using an optimal branch-andbound search the algorithm nds the k most

Experiments In order to test the effectiveness of our method, several experiments are performed and the results are compared with RBE. The datasets, DA and DB, are generated syntactically. In DA, data are randomly generated and the variables in DA have no particular dependency relations. In DB, three variables, X1, X2 and X3, are defined and each variable has three different instantiations, xij, i=1,2,3 and j=1,2,3. Cases in DB are generated \(1 X1=x11  X2=x22}, {X2=x21  X3=x32}, and X3=x33  X1=x13}, and \(2 associations do not hold. The datasets, Monk, TAE and Solaris are from [4]. Table 3 describes the basic information of these datasets. In these datasets, we randomly remove some data from completed cases and test if our method can successfully recover the missing ones. For nm missing data, the accuracy of recovery D is defined as 1- nw/nm if nw data are incorrectly guessed From the experimental results shown in Table 4, our method is more accurate than RBE is Table 3.

Discussions &amp; Conclusion We presented in this paper a new method for completing missing data using data associations. The basic concept is that association rules describe the dependency relationships among data entries in a Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Hybrid Intelligent Systems \(HIS  04 0-7695-2291-2/04 $ 20.00 IEEE 


0-7695-2291-2/04 $ 20.00 IEEE dataset and missing data should hold the similar relationships. One of the advantages of using this approach for completing missing data is that data associations can be easily and reasonably obtained Most reasonable datasets include reasonable association rules. Clearly, data associations truly describe the cross-relation among data instantiations more accurately. The score function that we presented in Eq.\(1 2 There may exist other measures, such as [16], that reveal more information for the applicability of data associations. The score function can be further improved. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the proposed method depends on the number of data associations When the threshold of minsupp and minconf are low there will be a large number of data associations being generated, resulting in inefficiency of the completing procedure. The future work includes developing a better informative score function and reducing the number of data associations and determining suitable values of minsupp and minconf. Currently, in this paper, only discrete data are discussed and the data existing in datasets are assumed to be correct and noise-free. We are extending the proposed method to handle non-discrete, noisy, and incorrect datasets 7.

Experimental Results The aim of our experimentation is to measure performance bene?ts given by our framework, and to quantify the information gained w.r.t. the other lossy approaches 


approaches All the tests were conducted on a Windows XP PC equipped with a 2.8GHz Pentium IV and 512MB of RAM memory, within the cygwin environment. The datasets used in our tests are those ones of the FIMI repository1, and the constraints were applied on attribute values \(e.g. price gaussian distribution within the range [0, 150000 In order to asses the information loss of the postprocessing approach followed by previous works, in Figure 4\(a lution sets given by two interpretations, i.e. |I2 \\ I1 On both datasets PUMBS and CHESS this di?erence rises up to 105 itemsets, which means about the 30 of the solution space cardinality. It is interesting to observe that the di?erence is larger for medium selective constraints. This seems quite natural since such constraints probably cut a larger number of equivalence classes of frequency In Figure 4\(b built during the mining is reported. On every dataset tested, the number of FP-trees decrease of about four orders of magnitude with the increasing of the selectivity of the constraint. This means that the technique is quite e?ective independently of the dataset Finally, in Figure 4\(c of our algorithm CCIMiner w.r.t. Closet at di?erent selectivity of the constraint. Since the post-processing approach must ?rst compute all closed frequent itemsets, we can consider Closet execution-time as a lowerbound on the post-processing approach performance Recall that CCIMiner exploits both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed ing time. This exploitation can give a speed up of about to two orders of magnitude, i.e. from a factor 6 with the dataset CONNECT, to a factor of 500 with the dataset CHESS. Obviously the performance improvements become stronger as the constraint become more selective 1 http://fimi.cs.helsinki.fi/data Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  04 0-7695-2142-8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE Information loss Number of FP-trees generated Run time performance 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 x 10 5 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 m I 2 I 1  PUMSB@29000 CHESS @ 1200 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 2 x 10 6 10

6. Conclusions In this paper we have addressed the problem of mining frequent constrained closed patterns from a qualitative point of view. We have shown how previous works in literature overlooked this problem by using a postprocessing approach which is not lossless, in the sense that the whole set of constrained frequent patterns cannot be derived. Thus we have provided an accurate de?nition of constrained closed itemsets w.r.t the conciseness and losslessness of this constrained representation, and we have deeply characterized the computational problem. Finally we have shown how it is possible to quantitative push deep both requirements \(satisfying constraints and being closed process gaining performance bene?ts with the increasing of the constraint selectivity References 1] R.

dense data sets for evaluating pattern mining algorithms These two data sets are obtained from IBM Almaden at http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/quest/demos.html. Recently, theMAFIA algorithm [6] was proposed to ef?ciently discover maximal frequent patterns. As shown in their paper, MAFIA can be several orders better than some alternatives, such as DepthProject, for mining maximal frequent patterns. Hence, we chose MAFIA as the base line for our performance evaluation. Finally, please note that only the size-2 patterns are generated in the ?rst BFS phase Experimental Platform We implemented the MHP algorithms using C++ and all experiments were performed Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE on a Pentium III    MHz PC machine with    megabytes main memory, running Linux Redhat 6.1 operating system 5.2.

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb* Data Set Figure 4 shows the number of patterns that MHP and MAFIA have to check during the pattern mining process on the pumsb* data set. As can be seen, for MHP, the number of checked patterns is increased with the decrease of the h-con?dence threshold. However, the number of checked patterns of MHP can be signi?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA even if a low h-con?dence threshold is speci?ed To check a pattern, we need to count the support of the patterns. Counting the support of a pattern is the most timeconsuming task during the pattern mining process, since we need to retrieve all the transactions which include one of its sub-pattern, or for Ma?a, retrieve all the bit of the bitmap of this pattern [6]. Therefore, an algorithm is more ef?cient if smaller number of patterns need to be checked 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 N

The RunTime Comparison on the Pumsb Data Set The runtime comparison of MHP and MAFIA on the Pumsb* data set is shown in Figure 5. In the ?gure, we can observe that the runtime of MHP can be signi?cantly reduced with the increase of h-con?dence thresholds. Also the runtime of MHP can be several orders of magnitude less than that of MAFIA even if the h-con?dence threshold is as low as 0.3. The reason is that the number of checked patterns of MHP is sign?cantly smaller than that of MAFIA Similar results are also obtained from the pumsb data set as shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For the pumsb data set the number of checked patterns of MHP is much smaller 


than that of MAFIA and the runtime of MHP can be significantly less than that of MAFIA 5.3. The Effect of the MHP Algorithm on Finding Maximal Hyperclique Patterns Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the number of maximal patterns identi?ed byMHP andMAFIA on Pumsb* and Pumsb data sets respectively. As can be seen, the number of maximal hyperclique patterns identi?ed by MHP can be orders of magnitude smaller than the number of maximal frequent patterns identi?ed by MAFIA. In other words, the number Proceedings of the 16th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence \(ICTAI 2004 1082-3409/04 $20.00  2004 IEEE 100 1000 10000 100000 1e+06 1e+07 1e+08 1e+09 0.02 0.025 0.03 0.035 0.04 0.045 0.05 0.055 0.06 N um be r o f C ou nt ed P at te rn s Support Threshold Mafia Min_Conf=0 Min_Conf=0.1 Min_Conf=0.3 Min_Conf=0.5 Min_Conf=0.7 Min_Conf=0.9 Figure 8.

The number of MFI/MHP Patterns in the Pumsb Data Set of maximal hyperclique patterns is much easier to manage than that of maximal frequent patterns. Indeed, in realworld applications, it is dif?cult to interpret several million maximal frequent patterns. However, it is possible to interpret the results of maximal hyperclique pattern mining In addition, due to the memory limitation, we cannot extract maximal frequent patterns with MAFIA on the Pumsb data set if the support threshold is less than 0.4, as shown in Figure 7. In contrast, MHP can identify maximal hyperclique patterns when the support threshold is 0.1, if we set the h-con?dence threshold to 0.5. In other words, MHP has the ability to identify patterns which can be dif?cult to identify for MAFIA. Hence, MHP can better explore the pattern space and ?nd interesting patterns at low levels of support 6. Conclusions and Future Work In this paper, we present a two-phase Maximal Hyperclique Pattern \(MHP best features of both the BFS strategy and the DFS strategy. More speci?cally, we adapted DFS pruning methods such as equivalence pruning, to an apriori-like approach In addition, we proved the correctness and completeness of the MHP algorithm. Finally, our experimental results show that the MHP algorithm can be several orders of magnitude faster than standard maximal frequent pattern mining algorithms and has the ability to identify patterns at extremely low levels of support in dense data sets There are several directions for future work. First, in 


this paper, we only generate the size-2 patterns in the BFS phase. It will be interesting to investigate the impact on the performance if the ?rst phase is stopped at a deeper level Also, the projection is a very ef?cient method for ?nding patterns, especially for parallel implementation of pattern mining algorithms [1]. We plan to adapt the projection ideas into our algorithm and design an ef?cient parallel algorithm for mining maximal hyperclique patterns References 1] R. Agarwal, C. Aggarwal, and V. Prasad.
