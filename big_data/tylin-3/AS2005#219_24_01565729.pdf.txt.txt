A set of such properties are summarized and a user can choose any of these properties. A lattice is built with all the discovered clusters which enables further analysis and discovery of useful knowledge about the clusters and their inter-relationships 1 Introduction Subspace clustering algorithms search for groups of similar objects under all possible subspaces. Since the number of possible subspaces increases exponentially with the dimensionality of the data space, it is inef?cient to search for clusters in all subspaces Different heuristic measures have been employed [1, 6, 7, 8] to search for subspace clusters having different properties Criterion of minimum density is used for pruning in most of the existing algorithms. Clusters with the highest dimensionality satisfying the minimum density criterion, are reported as the ?nal results. However, many applications have different criteria for the interestingness of clusters, and use of minimum density threshold for search cannot meet their needs. We propose many other interestingness properties for clusters and ways to integrate them into the levelwise search algorithm to ?nd clusters with various kinds of properties. Most existing algorithms tend to return the longest descriptions for the clusters, that is, clusters with the highest dimensionality are preferred. Longest description adds burden to the search algorithm, and also makes the interpretation of the clusters harder. Our algorithm, instead, tries to ?nd the most concise descriptions for the subspace clusters. Thirdly, many recent applications such as pattern discovery in gene expression data require not only ?nding interesting clusters, but also interpreting the relationships among various clusters. Each subspace cluster signi?es some functional group of objects in the domain. It is very common to have some objects participate in multiple functional groups and hence should belong to multiple subspace clusters. Reporting only the highest dimensionality clusters does not reveal information about such relationships. Levelwise search produces subspace clusters for all cardinalities of attribute subsets, and a partial order can be de?ned on them to enable the discovery of inter-clusters dependencies. We present such a partial order and organize all clusters into a lattice structure. In the following sections we present our algorithms and demonstrate our contributions from the perspective of the above-mentioned three aspects 2 General approach and related research Levelwise search has been widely used in solving many data mining problems such as association rule mining [2], sequence mining [3], and in other machine learning areas such as concept learning and conceptual clustering [9]. This approach has been very effective in reducing the hypothesis space by pruning away unpromising branches. Pruning is achieved by using monotonic or anti-monotonic properties. First we introduce some notations and de?nitions used in this paper A data space DS is characterized by a set of attributes A \(attribute space object space object oi ? O has a value assigned for each attributes aj ? A denoted as dij . A subspace Si of DS is a subset of A. A subspace cluster Ci is de?ned as &lt; Oi, Ai &gt;, where Oi ? O and Ai ? A. We call Oi and Ai the object set and the attribute set of the subspace cluster respectively. Subspace clustering is a search for a subset of P\(A power set of A exist. A partial order between subspaces is de?ned as follows 


exist. A partial order between subspaces is de?ned as follows De?nition 1 For two subspaces S1 and S2, S1 is more general than S2 \(and S2 is more speci?c than S1  S 1    S 2    d e n o t e d  a s  S 2    S 1  o r  S 1    S 2  For ?nite number of attributes, all subspaces form a complete lattice, denoted as Ls. Minimum specialization from a subspace is achieved by adding a single dimension that is not in the original subspace, and minimum generalization is achieved by removing one of the dimensions in the original subspace. Figure 1 is an example lattice of subspaces for a dataset with four attributes a1, a2, a3, a4}. Similarly, a partial order between subspace clusters is de?ned as follows De?nition 2 For two subspace clusters C1 =&lt; O1, A1 &gt; and C2 =&lt; O2, A2 &gt;, C1 is more general than C2 \(and C2 is more s p e c i  c  t h a n  C 1   i f  A 1    A 2  a n d  O 1    O 2        d e n o t e d  a s C 2    C 1  o r  C 1    C 2  All subspace clusters form a complete lattice for ?nite data spaces, denoted as Lc. If we group all clusters in the same subspaces in Lc into a single node, then Lc and Ls will have similar Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE Figure 1. Lattice of Subspaces structure, but they are based on two different orders. Each node in Lc is a group of subspace clusters under the same subspace, while a node in Ls is simply the subspace The second requirement for levelwise search is that the interestingness measurements, i.e., the properties of the target subspace clusters, must be monotonic or anti-monotonic w.r.t. the partial orders that we de?ned above. For the two lattices we introduced, two sets of properties are de?ned correspondingly Property of Subspaces: A property of subspace, denoted as ps, is a function de?ned on P\(A and a subspace Si is considered as interesting when ps\(Si 1, and uninteresting otherwise De?nition 3 A property ps is a monotone specialization property of subspace \(MSPS S2 ? S1, ps\(S2 S1 a monotone generalization property of subspace \(MGPS Ls if for any S2 ? S1, ps\(S1 S2 Similarly, we de?ne property of subspace clusters denoted as pc, monotone specialization property of cluster \(MSPC monotone generalization property of cluster \(MGPC Related Research: The subspace clustering algorithm CLIQUE [1] is a levelwise search algorithm for ?nding clusters of density above some minimum threshold. All attribute value ranges are partitioned into units of equal-length intervals. Since density is anti-monotonic w.r.t. Lc, this algorithm returns all dense units. ENCLUS [6] follows the density based idea, but uses entropy as an MGPS to ?nd minimally correlated subspaces with high density and coverage. MAFIA [7] is another density-based algorithm which uses an adaptive grid based on the distribution of each dimension to reduce the number of candidates. It uses the same minimum density MSPC asCLIQUE. SUBCLU [8] proposes a newMSPC called density-connected set, where the boundary of the clusters can be any shape in contrast to the grid de?ned in CLIQUE. All these algorithms suffer from the problem that the number of candidates grows exponentially with the highest dimensionality k of a subspace that contains clusters of the desired property 3 Properties of Interesting Subspace Clusters In this section, we summarize several pc and ps properties that can be used to de?ne interestingness of subspace clusters of various properties Density Property: Density of a subspace cluster Ci is the ratio between |Oi| and |O|, denoted as den\(Ci property in the form of  den\(Ci  where ? is a prede?ned threshold value, is a very effective MSPC in limiting the search space. Maximum density property in the form of  den\(Ci  is an MGPC. Both of them are very useful in many application domains [10 Succinctness Property: A subspace cluster Ci is succinct iff its 


Succinctness Property: A subspace cluster Ci is succinct iff its density is strictly less than the density of all subspace clusters Cj that are strictly more general than Ci, and it is strongly succinct iff its density is at least ? less than the density of all subspace clusters Cj that are strictly more general than Ci, where ? is a prede?ned threshold value. Both succinctness property and strong succinctness property are MSPC in the sense that if a subspace cluster Ci is not succinct \(or strong succinct space clusters that are more speci?c than it cannot be succinct \(or strong succinct power than succinctness property Max &amp; Min &amp; Average Property: This set of properties de?ne some quantitative constraints on the values of all the objects in the clusters. Consider  Max\(Ci  as an example, it requires that for every object in the returned cluster, the maximum of all its attribute-value pairs is larger than some prede?ned threshold In summary  Max\(Ci  and  Min\(Ci  are MSPC, and  Max\(Ci  and  Min\(Ci  are MGPC  Average\(Ci  and  Average\(Ci  are neither MSPC nor MGPC, so they cannot be directly used as pruning criteria in the levelwise search. But we will show later that they can be combined with other MSPC or MGPC to be applied in the pruning process Distance Measurement Property: This set of properties are similar to the distance measurements between objects. It is de?ned as a function on the values of a set of objects, and returns  1  indicating that they are similar to each other and belong to a cluster, and  0  otherwise. Various distance measurements can be de?ned between objects in subspaces, and clusters being found using different distance measurements have different properties. Examples include conjunctions of similarities on individual attributes \(grid used in CLIQUE [1 Euclidean distance Properties of Subspaces: Since each subspace may contain more than one cluster, ps is usually de?ned as a function \(such as summation ple, coverage of subspace is de?ned to be the sum of the densities of all clusters contained in the subspace. Another example is the discrete version of entropy property proposed in ENCLUS [6 Notice that since minimum density is an MSPC, minimum coverage is an MSPS. Similarly, maximum coverage, following the maximum density, is an MGPS. On the other hand, minimum entropy is an MGPS, while maximum entropy is an MSPS. We can see that pc and ps are closely related but distinctive, and be used in combination to de?ne various interesting clusters 4 Finding Interesting Subspace Clusters In this section, we propose several cases of combinations of properties, and the algorithms for ?nding the corresponding clusters. Although the following discussion is based on pc, it also applies to ps Conjunction of MSPC: Employing multiple constraints together Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE helps reduce the number of clusters being found, and it also helps reduce the search complexity. Subspace clusters satisfying conjunctions of MSPCs, such as clusters that are both dense and succinct, can be found using algorithm 1. Algorithm for conjunctions of MGPC and MGPS is similar due to the duality of the lattice It can be proved that the levelwise algorithm 1 ?nds all clusters satisfying conjunctions of MSPC Algorithm 1 FINDCLUSTER Initial Stage Set iteration counter i to 1 Let C1 be the set of most general subspace clusters in Lc Loop Stage W h i l e  C i       a n d  i     A  Evaluation: Fi = {C ?

Candidate Generation stage ?nds all subspaces of size i + 1 that could satisfy pcj based on the anti-monotonic property that if a subspace S of size i + 1 satis?es it, then all its minimum generalization subspaces of size i must also satisfy it, that is, all of them should be in Fi. The program terminates when the candidate set is empty or when it reaches the most speci?c subspace MSPC and Non-monotonic Properties: The average property we mentioned in section 3 is neither MSPC nor MGPC, so it cannot be used alone in levelwise algorithms. However, it can be used together with other MSPC, and the following new loop stage can be used to ?nd such clusters. Here Fi is the subset of Ci that actually satis?es all those MSPC properties, and Di is the subset of Fi that satis?es both the MSPC and non-MSPC. Since non-MSPC is not monotonic with respect to Lc, the candidate generation is based on Fi instead of Di New Loop Stage W h i l e  C i       a n d  i     A  Evaluation MSPC: Fi = {C ?

It is very similar to the complexity of CLIQUE [1] \(O\(\(cl + ln our algorithm is the highest dimensionality of clusters satisfying all user speci?ed properties, while l for CLIQUE is the highest dimensionality of dense grids. k is less than l in most cases, which results a speed-up of O\(\(cl + ln ck + kn Insights from The Lattice: All subspace clusters are organized into a lattice structure, and the overhead for building the lattice structure is very small compared with the whole mining process Simulation results suggest that on average it takes less than 1 of the mining process. Various algorithms can be applied on the built lattice to obtain more information about the dataset. Here we mention only some preliminary examples. An end-user can specify constraints to limit the number of clusters being returned, such as asking for clusters that contain certain objects and attributes and the lattice structure enables ef?cient searching for such clusters. The lattice structure also provides good hints about how two remote objects are related to each other, considering the lattice as a fully connected graph, where each cluster is connected to its generalizations and speci?cations. Furthermore, clusters being found using the above algorithm maybe very restricted since only objects that are similar to each other in all dimensions of a subspace will be grouped into one cluster. Clusters satisfying looser conditions such as most of the objects are similar to each other in most of the dimensions of the subspace, can be found by performing unions of adjacent nodes in the lattice 5 Performance Experiments and Comparisons We implemented our algorithm and CLIQUE [1] \(labeled as  density only  in Figure 2 the same platform. We did not apply the coverage pruning as presented in [1], since it tends to miss smaller sized clusters in less dense subspaces. All the experiments are performed on a P4 3GHz PC with 512 megabytes main memory running on Redhat Linux 8 Synthetic Data: We implemented a synthetic data generator as described in [1]. Comparisons between our algorithm and CLIQUE are performed on scalability with the size of the dataset, the dimensionality of the dataset, and the dimensionality of the clusters. Results show that the running time for both 


ity of the clusters. Results show that the running time for both algorithms increases linearly with the size of the dataset, and quadratically with the dimensionality of the dataset. The difference between the two algorithms remains constant for all dataset size and dimensionalities. Differences between the performances of the two algorithms become more signi?cant with the increasing dimensionality of the clusters. The running time for density only pruning increases exponentially with the increasing of the cluster dimensionality, while pruning with both minimum density and succinctness has almost constant running time. This is because the data produced by the synthetic data generator has very simple structures. For example, if we design a ?ve-dimensional subspace cluster in S = {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5}, the data generator causes all the data in this cluster to be evenly distributed in each of these ?ve dimensions. So the equally succinct cluster can be equivalently de?ned by a three-dimensional subset of S, such as S? = {a1, a2, a3}. When the succinctness property is used in pruning, the algorithm stops when it ?nds the three-dimensional clusters. Although the dimensionality of the speci?ed clusters is ve or even higher, the succinctness property guarantees that we only ?nd the simplest descriptions for each of the subspace clusters Proceedings of the Fifth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining \(ICDM  05 1550-4786/05 $20.00  2005 IEEE Real Data: We also tested our algorithm on the mushroom data set [5] and the cancer data [4 1 10 100 1000 10000 100000 1000000 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 size of subspaces n u m be r of s ub sp ac es e va lu at ed density only with succinct \( &gt;5 with succinct \( &gt;20 Figure 2. Mushroom Dataset Mushroom dataset contains 8124 instances \(rows tributes \(columns removed. Minimum density threshold is set to be 1%. Figure 2 shows the number of subspaces being evaluated for three different threshold values of the succinctness property 1. The y-axis is the logarithm of the number of subspace being evaluated. The effectiveness of the succinctness pruning becomes more signi?cant with the increasing of the dimensionality of the subspace for both  gt; 5  and  gt; 20  The ratio of the number of subspaces being evaluated between  gt; ?1  and  gt; 5  increases exponentially from 1.25 in size-2 subspaces to 44723 in size-9 subspaces, while the difference between  gt; 5  and  gt; 20  stays below 2.56. The big difference between the density only pruning and with succinctness pruning is because many of the dense regions are not succinct and using density only pruning produces many duplicates. The small difference between the two succinctness pruning thresholds 


small difference between the two succinctness pruning thresholds suggest that the clusters for this dataset are very crisp, in the sense that any two clusters contain at least a certain number of different objects from each other Cancer dataset contains the micro-array gene expression data of 2000 genes \(rows columns ues are discretized into binary values, representing expressed and not-expressed. Several combinations of different minimum density threshold values and succinctness threshold values are tried on this data set. Similar to the mushroom dataset, the ratio of pruned subspaces becomes more signi?cant with the increasing of the dimensionality. Our tests also show that the number of subspaces being evaluated remains almost stable when the minimum density threshold values goes from 1% to 10%, while a slight change of the succinctness threshold values from 15 to 20 reduces a large number of subspaces being evaluated. The lattice of subspace clusters can not ?t in the main memory any more when the size of subspaces reaches 6 for the case of  gt; 15  This means that cancer dataset contains many clusters having minuscule difference in the object set. One explanation is that every gene is distinctive, so adding or removing a small number of genes may lead to another 1  gt; ?1    gt; 5  and  gt; 20  respectively, where  gt; ?1  refers density only pruning meaningful cluster 6 Conclusions We have presented a levelwise search subspace clustering algorithm to build a lattice of clusters, which satisfy various user speci?ed combinations of different properties ef?ciently. One doable extension of the current research is when the lattice of subspace clusters is too large to ?t in the main memory. One possible solution is to ?nd the  skeleton  of the lattice initially, and enrich it as requested by the user. Here the  skeleton  can be de?ned in various ways, such as setting a higher size constraints or a constraint on the objects and attributes being involved References 1] R. Agrawal, J. Gehrke, D.

ear The speedup is 1.65 for the 2-node system indicating some degree of parallelization overhead mainly due to the interprocess communication to exchange the support count information The speedup is 3.76 for the 4-node system but the increasing rate of the speedup is 2.27 as the number of nodes is doubled from 2 to 4 As the number of nodes is doubled from 4 to 8 the increasing rate of the speedup is higher than linear again which indicates that PMIHP is quite scalable Number of Processors Time \(seconds 0 20000 40000 60000 80000 1 2 4 8 Figure 6 Total execution time of PMIHP to nd frequent 3-itemsets in 1,427 documents minsup  0.15 Number of Processors Speedup    0 2 4 6 8 2 4 8 Figure 7 Speedup of PMIHP minsup  0.15 The PMIHP algorithm has two main data mining activities counting the support of local candidate itemsets in the corresponding local database and counting the support of global candidate itemsets in multiple local databases These two activities are interleaved during the mining as the global support counting is invoked when the number of identied global candidate itemsets exceeds a certain number at each processing node which was set to 20,000 in our experiments To measure this global support counting time we recongured PMIHP to defer the global support counting of the global candidate itemsets at each node and synchronized the nodes before the start of the global support counting phase Figure 8 shows the global support counting time of the mining process with the logest run time among all the mining processes executed on different processing nodes Moreover we used the wall clock time to measure this global counting time hence it is an upper bound of the actual global support counting time of all the mining processes Comparing Figures 6 and 8 we can see that the 2-node case has a much longer global support counting phase than 4-node and 8-node cases The portion of the global support counting phase for the 2-node case is about 8 of the total execution time but it is about 4 for the 4-node case and about 3 for the 8-node case Thus the impact of the global support counting time on the overall speedup is very small and it is reduced further as the number of processing nodes increases Number of Processors Time \(seconds 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 2 4 8 Figure 8 Global support counting time to nd frequent 3-itemsets Since our processing environment does not provide the statistics for job accounting exact CPU time measurement was not feasible So we measured the average execution of a processing node using the wall clock time Figure 9 shows the average execution time of a node in the 1-node 2-node 4-node and 8-node congurations We can see that the 2-node case requires signicantly less average execution time per node than the 1-node case and as the number of processing nodes increases further the average execution time per node deceases more than linearly This result is completely consistent with the observed speedup values and also indicates that increased efciency is behind the performance gain Since the identical PMIHP algorithm was executed on all of our system congurations the differences in execution time must be associated with some workload differences Figure 10 shows the average number of candidate 0-7695-2132-0/04/$17.00 \(C Proceedings of the 18th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium \(IPDPS04

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and benet the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R  A gra w al and R  S r i kant   Fast Al gori t h ms for M i n i n g A ssociation Rules Proc of the 20th VLDB Conf  1994 pp 487499  R Agra w a l and J C S hafer  Paral l e l M i n i n g o f A ssoci at i o n Rules IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 8 No 6 1996 pp 962969 3 M  S  C hen J Han and P  S  Y u   Dat a Mi ni ng An Overview from a Database Perspective IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 8 No 6 1996 pp 866883 4 D  W  C heung S  D L ee and Y  Xi ao  E f f ect of Dat a S k e w ness and Workload Balance in Parallel Data Mining IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 14 No 3 2002 pp 498514 5 S  M  C hung and J Y ang  A Par al l e l D i s t r i b ut i v e J oi n A l gorithm for Cube-Connected Multiprocessors IEEE Trans on Parallel and Distributed Systems  Vol 7 No 2 1996 pp 127137  R  F e l dman and H Hi rsh F i ndi ng Associ at i ons i n Col l ections of Text Machine Learning and Data Mining Methods and Applications  R Michalski I Bratko and M Kubat editors John Wiley and Sons 1998 pp 223240  R F e l dman I Dagen and H  H i rsh Mi ni ng T e xt Usi n g Keyword Distributions Journal of Intelligent Information Systems  Vol 10 No 3 1998 pp 281300  C  Fox L e x i cal Anal ysi s and S t opl i s t s   Inforamtion Retrieval Data Structures and Algorithms W.FrakesandR Baeza-Yates editors Prentice Hall 1992 pp 102130 9 M  G or don and S  Dumai s Usi ng L a t e nt S e mant i c I nde xi ng for Literature Based Discovery Journal of the Amer Soc of Info Science  Vol 49 No 8 1998 pp 674685  J Han J P e i  and Y  Y i n Mi n i n g F r equent Pat t e r n s w i t hout Candidate Generation Proc of ACM SIGMOD Intl Conf on Management of Data  2000 pp 112  J D Holt and S  M Chung Multipass Algorithms for Mining Association Rules in Text Databases Knowledge and Information Systems  Vol 3 No 2 Springer-Verlag 2001 pp 168183  J D Hol t and S  M C hung Mi ni ng Associ at i o n R ul es Using Inverted Hashing and Pruning Information Processing Letters  Vol 83 No 4 Elsevier Science 2002 pp 211220  J D Hol t and S  M C hung Mi ni ng associ at i o n R ul es i n Text Databases Using Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning Proc of the 14th IEEE Intl Conf on Tools with Articial Intelligence  2002 pp 4956  J S  Park M S  C hen and P  S  Y u   Usi n g a Hash-B a sed Method with Transaction Trimming for Mining Association Rules IEEE Trans on Knowledge and Data Engineering  Vol 9 No 5 1997 pp 813825  G  S a l t on Automatic Text Processing The Transformation Analysis and Retrieval of Information by Computer  Addison-Wesley Publishing 1988  E  M V oorhees and D K Harmon edi t o rs The Fifth Text Retrieval Conference  National Institute of Standards and Technology 1997  O R  Z a i a ne and M L  Ant o i ne C l assi f y i n g T e x t D ocuments by Associating Terms with Text Categories Proc of the 13th Australian Database Conf  2002 0-7695-2132-0/04/$17.00 \(C Proceedings of the 18th International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium \(IPDPS04 


  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
