Mining Calendar-based Asynchronous Periodical Association Rules with Fuzzy Calendar Constraints Jung-Yi Jiang Wan-Jui Lee and Shie-Jue Lee Dept of Electrical Engineering National Sun Yat-Sen University Taiwan  jungyi  wrlee  leesj  water.ee.nsysu.edu.tw Abstract  We propose a new representation of calendars such that users can specify fuzzy calendar constraints to discover asynchronous periodical association rules embedded in temporal databases We borrow the fuzzy set theory and use the 
conjunction operation to construct fuzzy calendar patterns and each fuzzy calendar pattern represents an asynchronous periodical behavior Moreover different time intervals have different weights corresponding to their matching degrees to the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern An ef\036cient algorithm is also proposed to 036nd association rules with the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern Unlike levelwise Apriori-based approaches our method scans the underlying database at most twice In the 036rst scan frequent 2-itemsets with their weighted counts in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are obtained and then all candidate itemsets are generated from the discovered frequent 2-itemsets Finally all frequent itemsets with their weighted counts in the speci\036ed 
fuzzy calendar pattern are discovered in one shot Asynchronous periodical association rules in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are then obtained I I NTRODUCTION Recently temporal association rules are attracting more and more attention Unlike traditional mining techniques which discover unordered correlations between items from a given database of transactions each of which contains a collection of items activated at a certain time the temporal patterns reveal ordered correlation between transactions For example in a temporal database a kind of periodic behavior like customers might look for chocolates and 037owers together on February 14th every year may be discovered There are 
various forms of periodic temporal patterns e.g periodical association rules c yclic association rules 5 and calendric association rules Both periodical and c yclic patterns are basically in terms of a single time granularity but calendar patterns are based on a framework with multiple time granularities In real world humans usually use multiple time granularities instead of single granularities Therefore system support and reasoning involving calendars with multiple time granularities have been recognized to be an important issue For mining association rules in temporal databases several kinds of approaches to specify periodicities with multiple time granularities have been studied In users could specify the interesting period with multiple time granularities by them 
selves In and 7 tw o dif ferent algorithms are proposed to discover all calendar-based temporal association rules in a speci\036ed calendar schema However all the approaches above are crisp descriptions about their desire periodicities To consider the activities of humans they may often be shifted from original schedules by external factors And in real world humans usually donít act on a certain time interval but during several continuous time intervals Those situations above canít be described successfully with crisp descriptions Therefore a new representation of calendars to specify uncertain periodicities and continuous time intervals of time granularities is necessary To achieve the purposes mentioned above the technique 
using fuzzy set theory is adopted which can describe the uncertainty and can give different weights corresponding to their matching degrees to different time intervals by specifying the calendars In fact an useful fuzzy calendar algebra was developed to allow users to describe desired temporal requirements in fuzzy calendars easily and naturally In this paper  we allow users to describe their desired periodicities with fuzzy calendars of multiple time granularities and combine fuzzy calendars with a conjunction operation to form a fuzzy calendar pattern then each time interval of the fuzzy calendar pattern can have a weight corresponding to its matching degree When the fuzzy calendar pattern is given association 
rules in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern can be discovered For example an association rule in a fuzzy calendar pattern is turkey and pumpkin pie are frequently purchased together near November 25th every year where near November 25th every year is a fuzzy description of periodicities We also propose an ef\036cient algorithm to discover asynchronous periodical association rules with fuzzy calendar constraints Unlike levelwise Apriori-based approaches our method scans the underlying database at most twice In the 036rst scan frequent 2-itemsets with their weighted counts in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are obtained and then all candidate itemsets are generated from the discovered frequent 2-itemsets Finally all frequent itemsets with their weighted 
counts in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are discovered in one shot Asynchronous periodical association rules in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are then obtained The rest of the paper is organized as follows In Section 2 we brie\037y describe the concept of the fuzzy calendar pattern A formal description about calendar-based asynchronous periodical association rules is also given In Section 3 we describe our method in detail Simulation results are presented in Section 4 and 036nally a conclusion is given in Section 5 0-7803-9158-6/05/$20.00 © 2005 IEEE The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 773

E Calendar-based Asynchronous Periodical Association Rules A temporal database D consists of transactions with each transaction t in D being associated with an identi\036er TID and a time information t t which indicates the time when the transaction occurred Let I  i 1 i 2 i n be a set of items and each transaction t in D is a subset of I  that is t 005 I  Given m time granularities i.e U 1 U 2 U m  let D be divided into a sequence of k partitions i.e P 1 P 2 P k  each P i containing a set of transactions occurring in the corresponding time interval T i  Given a user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern FC consisting of m basic fuzzy calendars discovering the calendar-based asynchronous periodical association rules in a temporal database is to 036nd all interesting patterns in FC in the temporal database That is we want to discover all association rules which have an enough weighted average constrained by FC  1 Association rules in time intervals An association rule with respect to a time interval T i  is an implication of the form X 006 T i Y 5 where X 005 I,Y 005 I and X 007 Y  002  Let  P i  J   be the number of transactions containing itemset J in the partition P i where each transaction occurring in T i is included in P i  and  P i  denotes the number of transactions in the partition P i  The association rule X 006 T i Y is said to have support S X 003 Y in the partition P i  where S X 003 Y   P i  X 010 Y    P i   6 and the association rule X 006 T i Y is said to have con\036dence C X 004 T i Y in the partition P i  where C X 004 T i Y   P i  X 010 Y    P i  X   or S X 003 Y S X  7 For a user-given pair of con\036dence and support thresholds c  and s  association rules in a time interval T i are those which have con\036dence and support greater than or equal to c  and s in P i  respectively 2 Calendar-based Asynchronous periodical association rules A calendar-based asynchronous periodical association rule with respect to a user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern FC  is an implication of the form X 006 FC Y 8 The match ratio m  represents the frequency of an association rule in the fuzzy calendar pattern needs to be calculated Intuitively we adopted the weighted average to calculate the match ratio However by taking crisp cycles and fuzzy cycles into the same position the measurement will lose some patterns discovered in only crisp cycles To keep general patterns in crisp cycles and discover patterns in fuzzy cycles we de\036ne two criteria to let the match ratio be more practical The 036rst criterion GM is the general match ratio as in and 7 which measures the frequency of an association rule occurring in crisp periodical time intervals And the second criterion FM is the in\037uence of fuzzy calendars which represents the frequency of an association rule occurring in the time intervals close to crisp periodical time intervals Let an association rule which is included in an user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern FC  then the general match ratio and fuzzy calendar match ratio of the association rule GM and FM  are as follows GM  002  FC  T i   e i 002  FC  T i   for each  CF  T i 1 9 FM  002  FC  T i   e i 002  FC  T i   for each 0  CF  T i   1  10 Where each time interval T i 002 U 1  U 2    U m  and e i is the existence of the association rule in T i  If the association rule exists in T i  e i 1  else e i 0  After the general match ratio and the fuzzy match ratio of the association rule are obtained the match ratio m of the association rule in the fuzzy calendar pattern is obtained as follows m  GM  003F M 11 For emphasizing and ensuring the in\037uence of the certain time intervals of crisp cycles it is necessary to keep the patterns discovered in the general crisp cycles Therefore we suggest keeping the value of the general match ratio GM  We address the fuzzy match ratio as an assistant and propose to give a weight 003  to the fuzzy match ratio FM  where 003 is a value between 0 and 1 Usually we de\036ne the threshold of a match ratio 004  between 0 and 1 To avoid the match ratio being much great than 1 we suggest 003 be assigned as 1  004   That is when the general match ratio of an association rule is equal to 004  we expect that GM  003F M 003 1  when GM  004 12 where FM is at most equal to 1 We expect that the match ratio will be equal to 1 when the fuzzy match ratio is equal to 1 Then the weight of fuzzy match ratio can be calculated as follows GM  003F M 1  003  1  GM FM  1  004 1 1  004 13 If the match ratio m of an association rule is greater then the user-given match ratio threshold 004  we say the association rule is a calendar-based asynchronous periodical association rule in the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern Refer to Example 1 Assume the match ratio threshold 004 0  6  Then the weight 003 1  0  6=0  4 and an association rule A exists in 2001 2 13 2001 2 14 2002 2 14 2002 2 15 2003 2 13 2003 2 15 2004 2,14  and 2005 2 15 The match ratio m A of A can be calculated as follows For simplicity The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 775

rules with an userspeci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern can be divided into three phases i.e discovery of all frequent 2-itemsets which satisfy the match ratio threshold in the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern generation of candidate patterns from frequent 2-itemsets discovered in phase 1 and discovery of all frequent itemsets which satisfy the match ratio threshold in the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern It must be noted that the single-item frequent itemsets are not generated for our method Suppose a fuzzy calendar pattern FC  and a match ratio threshold 004  are given by users Let L  L 2 and L k be the sets of all frequent itemsets frequent 2-itemsets and frequent k-itemsets with their general match ratios GM s  and fuzzy match ratios FMs  in the fuzzy calendar pattern Initially both L and L 2 are empty For each partition P i which has a matching degree d i  to the fuzzy calendar pattern where d i is a real number between 0 and 1 Let G be the sum of all d i  where each d i is equal to 1 and let F be the sum of all d i  where each d i is less than 1 In phase 1 for each partition P i which has a nonzero degree d i  036nd all frequent 2-itemsets l 2  in the partition To count supports of all 2-itemsets we calculate all combinations of any two items of transactions in the partition Then we consider the following cases Case1 The degree of the partition is equal to 1 For each 2-itemset l 002 l 2 if l is not currently in L 2  then itís inserted into L 2 and the general match ratio of l  l.GM  is assigned as 1 If l is currently in L 2  then the general match ratio of l  l.GM  increases by 1 Case2 The degree of the partition is less than 1 For each 2-itemset l 002 l 2 if l is not currently in L 2  then itís inserted into L 2 and the fuzzy match ratio of l  l.F M  is assigned as d i If l is currently in L 2  then the fuzzy match ratio of l  l.F M  increases by d i  When the 036rst scan over the database is done the match ratio of each 2-itemset l 002 l 2  l.m  can be calculated as follows l.m  l.GM G 1  004   l.F M F  14 Then all frequent 2-itemsets which have match ratios greater than the match ratio threshold in the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are obtained where L 2   l 011 l 002 L 2 l.m 012 004   15 Once frequent 2-itemsets have been obtained in phase 1 phase 2 begins Candidate itemsets C k  for k 012 3  are generated as follows C k  003 L 2 005L 2 k 3 C k  1 005C k  1 k  3 16 where 005 is the JOINT operation given in and the generation of candidates will stop when no candidate kitemset could be generated from  k  1 itemsets Initially for each candidate itemset c 002 C k k 012 3  the general match ratio and the fuzzy match ratio of c  c.GM and c.F M  are assigned as 0 Once all candidate itemsets are generated the second scan of the database is performed In the 036nal phase for each partition P i which has nonzero degree d i  we count the supports of candidate itemsets in the partition and for each candidate itemset c 002 C k k 012 3 we consider the following cases Case1 If the degree of the partition is equal to 1 the general match ratio of c c.GM increases by 1 Case2 If the degree of the partition is less than 1 the fuzzy match ratio of c c.F M  increases by d i  When the second scan over the database is done the match ratio of each candidate itemset c 002 C k k 012 3  c.m  can be calculated as follows c.m  c.GM G 1  004   c.F M F  17 Furthermore the itemsets whose match ratios are greater than the match ratio threshold can be obtained as follows L k   c 011 c 002 C k c.m 012 004 k 012 3   After the third phases all frequent itemsets whose match ratios are greater than the match ratio threshold in the userspeci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern can be obtained as follows L  L 2 010 L k k 012 3  19 Therefore all asynchronous periodical association rules in the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern are obtained IV E XPERIMENTAL R ESULTS We present the results of our algorithm with a fuzzy calendar pattern and with a general calendar pattern to show the effect of fuzzy calendar patterns We also compare the performance of our method with an Apriori-based method proposed in in this section The e xperiments described below are performed on a PC with 2.2 GHz CPU and 1.0G The 2005 IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems 776

the user-speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern FC days close to 15 of every month in every year is shown in Fig 2 The technique introduced in is used to generate synthetic datasets T10.In.D1000K.Ch for n=3 4 5 6 and h  15 25 35 45 where T is the mean size of transactions I is the mean size of potential maximal large itemsets and C is the correlation between patterns We divide the dataset into 1000 partitions where each partition contains 1000 transactions and is corresponding to one basic time interval in the calendar schema In Experiment 1 we insert some target patterns into the dataset T10.I4.D1000K.C25 to design a speci\036c dataset with asynchronous periodical association rules in the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern and compare the results discovered by our algorithm with a fuzzy calendar pattern and with a general calendar pattern to show that our algorithm with the fuzzy calendar pattern can discover asynchronous periodical association rules successfully In experiment 2 we compare the performances of our method and the Apriori-based method with a general calendar pattern by using both methods to discover general calendar-based periodical association rules with a speci\036c general calendar pattern in several different datasets In experiment 3 we compare the results discovered by the algorithm with the fuzzy calendar pattern and the algorithm with the general calendar pattern in several synthetic datasets to show the effect of the fuzzy calendar patterns in general cases A Experiment 1 To identify the effect of the fuzzy calendar pattern constraint in discovering the calendar-based asynchronous periodical association rules we insert 240 frequent itemsets as targets into partitions around the 15th day of every month in every year in the dataset T10.I4.D1000K.C25 randomly In this experiment the match ratio threshold is speci\036ed to be 0.5 0.6 0.7 and 0.8 the support threshold is speci\036ed to be 0.07 and the speci\036ed fuzzy calendar pattern FC is days close to 15 of every month in every year as shown in Fig 2 To compare with general calendar patterns we run the same thresholds of match ratio and support with the general calendar pattern 15th of every month in every year where the membership functions of every year and every month are the same as FC and the membership function of 15th is described with a singleton whose function value is equal to 1 only when the day value is 15 In TABLE I the column total is the total number of frequent itemsets discovered with the general calendar pattern and the fuzzy calendar pattern FC and the column target is the number of target patterns discovered by the general calendar pattern and the fuzzy calendar pattern As shown in TABLE I for match ratio thresholds from 0.5 to 0.8 the number of target patterns with the general calendar pattern is zero that means the target patterns are not appeared in the crisp period enough and it is possible to get the target patterns when the match ratio threshold is smaller than 0.5 However the number of target patterns with fuzzy calendar pattern indicates that our method with fuzzy calendar patterns can discover the association rules in asynchronous periodicities successfully while the general calendar pattern canít be used to mine the asynchronous periodical association rules B Experiment 2 In Experiment 2 we use both the Apriori-based method and our method to discover general calendar-based periodical association rules with a general calendar pattern 15th of every month in every year in 16 different datasets on different scales of support thresholds to compare the performances of the Apriori-based method and our method In Fig 3 the average execution time of the Aprori-based method applying to different datasets with support thresholds 0.03 0.04 0.05 0.06 and 0.07 is drawn in a dotted line while our method is drawn in a solid line From the 036gure we can see that our method has better performance for smaller support thresholds For smaller support thresholds the length of maximal frequent itemsets will be longer Therefore the number of database scans in the Apriori-based method increases when the support threshold decreases but our method always scans the database at most twice As the result our method is ef\036cient in all kinds of support thresholds but the performance of the Apriori-based method varies dramatically for different cases C Experiment 3 To observe the in\037uence of the fuzzy calendar pattern in general cases we use our method with a fuzzy calendar pattern days close to 15 of every month in every year and a general calendar pattern 15th of every month in every year respectively to discover association rules in the fuzzy calendar pattern and the general calendar pattern

In addition the authors proposed a ?fth strategy, ACS, where more speci?c rules are given a higher precedence than less speci?c rules but using con?dence as the most signi?cant factor for tree pruning during the generation process The principal ?ndings of the evaluation are as follows 1 used in the experiments, \(2 mechanism works better than ìbest î in all the data sets tested, \(3 that a relatively high con?dence threshold is used \(a threshold of % is suggested 4 olds \(% to a ìbest ?rstî case satisfaction produced good results References 1] Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. \(1994 for mining association rules.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneﬁt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements.
