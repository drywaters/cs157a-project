possible conclusions Within this process we formulate methodologies e.g computer algorithms that digest the data and possibly produce results i.e patterns In this paper I explain the concept of granular computing where data are represented as granules and how granules are used in data mining Among the data mining technique granule computing is used to find association rules Keywords granule computing bitmap performance costs association rules frequency I INTRODUCTION Analysts 
database designers and programmers create mathematical models to aid concept development In classical relational model data representation is designed for human processing attribute values are just meaningful symbols for humans For high performance we have used bit representation 6 However the drawback of bit representation where the order of bits are fixed forces us to develop the granule computing model for theoretical discussion of computation 4 So for theoretical reasoning 
we create granular computing model for bit computing II GRANULAR COMPUTING AND RELATIONAL DATABASE In relational database we begin with the universe U of entities and a collection of elementary concepts the set of current attribute value In figure 1 we have considered a single column representation each entity is mapped to one of the colors red blue and green The subset of entities that map into the same color forms a equivalence class or granule 
This representation is summarized in Table I As mentioned previously for performance we convert the table into bit map See Table II For theoretical discussion we introduce the granular computing view Table III Granule computing view of relational database is to replace all the attribute values instead of bitmap by granules For example the color red blue and green in Table I will be replaced by e3 e4 e2 e5 e6 and ei

in Table VI A Association Rules Finding association rules is a common data mining technique used to search for information about a dataset Given a set of transactions or records where each transaction is a set of items an association rule is an expression X X Y where X and Y are sets of items 1 The expression is determined an association rule when it satisfies a certain criteria For 0-7803-9017-2/05/$20.00 02005 IEEE 556 


el  e2 e2 VIEW OF SINGLE COLUMN RELATION this paper when enough records in the dataset contain the set of items in X and Y then that expression X a Y is an association rule Known as minimal support this criteria focuses on high frequency representation of the dataset The basic algorithm to find association rules begins with counting all attribute values the elementary concepts in the dataset The attribute values with a count equal or higher than the minimal support are determined to be association rules and are forward in the main loop of the algorithm The loop is 1 to generate a list of possible expressions X X Y of length n 2 to count the number of times each generated expression contains in each record in the dataset and 3 record the expressions that exceed the minimal support On each iteration of the loop the generated expression's length is increase by one The algorithm exists the loop when no new expressions are generated or association rules are discovered With the discovered association rules of length 1 the first iteration of the loop will generates expressions of length 2 In this case each attributes value is joined with every other attribute values on other columns On the nth iteration of the loop the number of the generated expressions is controlled using the previous knowledge from the discovered association rules From 1 the generated expressions i.e candidates of length n are joined by two association rules of length n-i that differ only by the last item Moreover each generated expression requires a subset validation before that join expression can be considered a viable candidate The subset validation of a candidate for length n must have all subsets of length n-i discovered an association rule in the previous iteration For expression of length n 8C7 2 subsets of length n-I must be verified association rules The subset validation promotes the theorem that if an expression is an association rule then all subsets must also be association rule The theorem is recursive so validation of all subsets of length of one less item is only needed Validating the candidates ensures that the next step counting those candidates are worthwhile Color Granule as List Granule as Bits Red e3 e6 0 1 0 0 1 1 Green el 100000 TABLE IV TRANSLATION TABLE Table Fonn id crop Lot Water Fresh Ill caffot 2 water T7fresh 2  Entity Granule el 100000 e2 010011 e3 0 001100 e4 0 0 1 1 0 0 e5 0 1 0 0 1 1 e6 01001 1 TABLE II BIT COMPUTING VIEW OF SINGLE COLUMN carrot 3  dry T fresh 3 celery 2 water stale 4 14 beets I 1 t water fresh 5 cafrot 3 1dry fresh TABLE V CLASSICAL VIEW OF A MULTIPLE COLUMN RELATION B Granular Computing with Association Rules When granule computing is used as the model the algorithm is generally the same however the access to the data the comparison between the data and the count of the expressions X a Y are changed The table scan which is required normally on each set of generated expressions of length n is replaced with reading granules the attribute values in each expression The compare instruction between each expression and record in the dataset is replaced with the AND operation Finally the increment count that offers on expressions contained in records is replaced with fast logarithmic low level SHIFT and ADD machine instructions Louie2000 In Table VII the expression carrot dry fresh is counted against the dataset using granule computing The bit representations of the three granule carrot dry and fresh are read from storage to memory the three granules are operated with the AND instruction and the bits of AND result bits are counted The result is the support count of this particular expression against the dataset If the minimal support is 2 then this expression carrot dry fresh is an association rule IV EXPERIMENT Using granules to find association rules was conducted on an 2600 MHz AMY system running Red Hat Fedora Core 3 The dataset was generated with random data from a defined domain for each column Furthermore the the minimal support was set low so that long rules would appear To verify correctness of the result and to compare the performance ratio the experiment was also conducted using classical relational data model on the same dataset Table VIII shows the interesting result of the experiment The first column is the length of the candidate The next two columns are the number of generated expressions candidates of that length and the number of discovered association rules of that same length The next columns are the runtime in seconds for granules and records On each computing model the times are split on generating candidates and counting candidates on the dataset 557 e4 0 0 1 1 0 0 Blue e2 e5 e4 e5 e2 e5 e6 e6 e2 e3 e3 e4 e4 e3 e5 e6 e5 e6 TABLE Im GRANULE COMPUTING RELATION Entity Granule el

out the variable R on both sides A 1 B P The significance of this formula is that the value B in the left side of the equation is a large number compared to value P For 4K-size pages the value of B is 32K Hence granule computing benefits the most when the page size is large On the right side the equation the value of P is influenced by the record length For long records the value of P decreases So granule computing benefits when the page size is large or record length is long B CPU operations As explain earlier the count of the number of times candidates appear in the dataset requires loading the granules into memory performing the AND operations and finally counting the bits Loading the granules is simple and fast since only the specific attributes values are the loaded and the values are packed For example if the candidate a,c is to be counted the pages of the granules a and c are loaded into the memory All other attribute values pertaining to the records of those granules remain in storage Furthermore the granules are aligned one bit after another and since the bits belong to one column they are of one type in the page On record model for each attribute value in the candidates the algorithm must index the record to reach the attribute value plus check on the data type of the attribute value before executing any compare operation The granule model loads attribute values without any index without any runtime data type check and with the data pipelined ready for the AND operation Considering only the first pages of the granules loaded into memory the cost of the AND operations for the first pages of each granule in a candidate of length n is following n-1 n  Number of attribute values in the candidate B  Number of bits in one page W  Number of bits in a word size that AND instruction operates For a candidate of length 2 32K bits in a page and 32 bits in a word 1024 AND instructions are execute to check if 32K records has the candidate In comparison with the record model a candidate of length 2 requires 1 or 2 comparisons per record thus the first 32K records requires from 32K to 64K comparisons For candidates of length 2 the granular computing model runs at least 32 times faster compared to the record model On Table VIII the granule computing model ran 167 times faster than the record model when counting the candidates of length 2 Moreover the AND operation in the granule computing model checks every attribute value in the candidates on the record and does not exit early even if earlier AND operations between granules indicate the candidate are not in the records Before proceeding to the next pages of each granule the bits in the AND result are counted using a fast algorithm where the bits are partitioned shifted and added in parallel To count one 32 bits in a word it takes 1og232 iteration Details of the algorithm are explained in earlier paper 6 C The disadvantage of granule computing The disadvantage of granular computing is the transformation of the dataset from records storage to bit storage Before the algorithm starts the records are read and the attribute values are transformed to the respective granules Even though the transformation requires CPU resources the cost is compensated by the load and count later in the algorithm Typically the transformation is executed once early in the program The second disadvantage to granular computing is the additional storage space require to store granules In our experiment the storage of the data by granules was less than the storage of the data by records However the data storage of granule could be easily larger of the two The case is true when the average number of active domain elements per column is above 32 The third disadvantage is the fixed position in bit representation of the granule in order to perform the fast bit computing This reduces the flexibility of moving bits in the granule D Experiment Notes Comparing the rules among the lengths Table VIII has two peaks one at length 2 and another at length 8 Since the number of subsets of length m that support an association rule of length n is nCm then the midpoint n/2 is the peak among the subsets of length m Therefore multiple peaks are possible when multiple association rules of various length do not share in their subsets The generations of the candidates of length n have the same time and number for both the classical and granule models since the algorithm to generate candidates are the same The average domain for each column is 11.5 elements  368 total elements/32 columns  The storage requirement for the granules is 10,551,296 bytes  200 000rows 1 368totalelememts 26btsepg 4O96bytesperpage 32768bitsperpage The storage requirement for the record model depends on the record length With the record length of 128 bytes 25,600,000 bytes are required 200 000rows L 4096bytesperpage L128bytesperrecordj u4o96ytesperpage VI CONCLUSION Granular computing is the model to use for data mining Once the relation database model has been converted to granular computing data model the operations for the association rules becomes native for the computers The concise data representation

Data Engineering K H Tung V EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We tested our methods on some datasets from UCI ML Repository 16 Class association rules with x2 test were extracted by GNP then built classifiers using extracted rules Descretization of continuous attributes is done using the Entropy method All the categorical attribute values are transformed to a set of attributes whose attribute value is 1 or 0 A 10-fold cross validation was performed on each dataset and results are given as the average of the errors over 10-fold cross validation We use 3  2  6.63  4 minsup  0.05 5 7 anew  150 and 1  n\(i  8 Class association rules are extracted for each class using each specific GNP The population size is 120 The number of processing nodes and judgement nodes in each GNP individual are 10 and 75 respectively The conditions of crossover and mutation are P,c 1/5 Pml  1/3 and Pm2 1/5 We used the probability P\260 of 8 i.e the inverse of the number of attributes for selecting the attributes of judgement nodes in mutation2 The condition of termination is 500 generations All algorithms were coded in C Experiments were done on a 1.50GHz Pentium M with 504MB RAM The results of classification using test data are shown in Table III cleveland and breast-w have 2 classes for prediction The transformed cleveland and breast-w dataset consist of 25 attributes 297 tuples and 18 attributes 683 tuples respectively allp,,I 0.8 and 0.9 in Table III denote the cases using all rules the rules satisfying confidence  0.8 and the rules satisfying confidence  0.9 in the pool respectively The results for CBA and C4.5 are taken from 13 The results show that the proposed method has comparable accuracy with conventional models It is found that using the condition of minimum confidence affects the accuracy of classification a bit Especially the error rate increases in cleveland by the increase of the threshold of confidence Medical dataset sometimes includes different characteristics individual by individual in data set so we can say that it is not good to use too strict rules for classification of medical data In this simulation minsup we used is 5 however minsup in conventional models such as CBA is 1  Therefore our method can avoid over fitting and can acquire the rules with high reliability for classification Table IV shows the error rates versus the number of used rules for classification Each extracted rules in the pool has an inherent numeric order by its appearance We examined 6 cases of using 10 30 100 300 1000 rules by numeric order and all the extracted rules for each class It is found that using 300 rules is almost equivalent to using all rules in the pool Table V shows averaged run-time versus the number of extracted rules in the pool This shows that the proposed method extracts the rules sufficiently enough for classification in a short time Table VI shows the error rates of using long rules whose antecedent contains 7 or 8 attributes A small number of rules in method 1 cannot predict the class accurately On the other hand method 2 is effective even in the case of a small number of rules Using a sufficient number of rules reduces the error rate in both methods In the proposed method all the extracted rules satisfy the conditions of importance and have the qualification for the classifier Therefore we need not store retrieve prune and sort a large number of rules for classification as conventional methods This is one of the features of our method The proposed method cannot extract all the rules meeting the given definition of importance but extracts important rules sufficiently enough for user's purpose in a short time As a result the proposed method suits the classification problems that need real-time processing In addition the method can be used for incomplete test dataset such as having missing data VI CONCLUSIONS In this paper we propose an efficient algorithm for important class association rule mining using GNP Instead of generating a large number of candidate rules the method can obtain a sufficient number of important association rules for classification The method measures the significance of the association via the y2 test Therefore all the extracted important rules can be used for classification directly We have performed some experiments and estimated the performances of the method The results showed that the proposed method extracts the important class association rules effectively The proposed method suits class association rule mining in dense dataset and uses x2 value for importance so it could be applied to medical dataset We are currently studying the applications of our method to real world databases REFERENCES 1 R J Bayardo no.1 pp.43-56 no.1 pp.102111 2006 11 B vol.36 no 1 pp 179-193 rule

6. Conclusion In this paper a number of alternative rule ordering and case satisfaction strategies have been considered. Four established ordering strategies were examined. In addition the authors proposed a ?fth strategy, ACS, where more speci?c rules are given a higher precedence than less speci?c rules but using con?dence as the most signi?cant factor for tree pruning during the generation process The principal ?ndings of the evaluation are as follows 1 used in the experiments, \(2 mechanism works better than “best ” in all the data sets tested, \(3 that a relatively high con?dence threshold is used \(a threshold of % is suggested 4 olds \(% to a “best ?rst” case satisfaction produced good results References 1] Agrawal, R. and Srikant, R. \(1994 for mining association rules.

to achieve a high degree of skewness Text documents arranged in a chronological order do appear to have a high degree of skewness and beneÞt the PMIHP algorithm 4 Conclusions The proposed Parallel Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning PMIHP algorithm is a parallel version of our Multipass with Inverted Hashing and Pruning MIHP algorithm and it is effective for mining frequent itemsets in large text databases The Multipass approach reduces the required memory space at each processor by partitioning the frequent items and pro cessing each partition separately Thus the number of candidate itemsets to be processed is limited at each instance The Inverted Hashing and Pruning is used to prune the local and global candidate itemsets at each processing node and it also allows each processing node to determine the other peer processing nodes to poll in order to collect the local support counts of each global candidate itemset PMIHP distributes the workload to multiple processing nodes to reduce the total mining time without incurring much parallelization overhead The average number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller than the case of sequential mining while the time for the synchronization between processing nodes to exchange the count information for the global candidate itemsets is very small compared to the total execution time PMIHP is able to exploit the natural skewed distribution of words in text databases and demonstrates a superlinear speedup as the number of processing nodes increases It has a much better performance than well-known parallel Count Distribution algorithm 2 becaus e the a v erage number of candidate itemsets to be counted at each processing node is much smaller especially when the minimum support level is low Overall the performance of PMIHP is quite scalable even when the size of the text database is large and the minimum support level is low which is the case of high workload References  R

  11 could be improved by a simple modification of the feed by adding a small tuning vane to th e feed. Therefore, it can be stated that some improvement can be expected by modification of the feeds, and adaptation of the test antenna in such a way that surrounding Ku-band element are closed   Figure 28 Reflection coefficient of Ku-band stacked patch antenna element in dual-frequency antenna stack  Figure 29 shows the influence of the L-band slots on the return loss of the Ku-band antenna element. To this end, the four connectors of the L-band elements were alternately open and terminated by means of 50 loads. The deviations were measured with respect to the set-up where all connectors were terminated Apparently, the deviations are acceptable  Figure 29 Influence of L-band termination on return loss of Ku-band antenna element, with and without termination Figure 30 and Figure 31 show the isolation between the Lband and Ku-band elements in L-band and Ku-band respectively. To this end the S21-parameters have been measured. These figures reveal that the mutual coupling between the L-band and Ku-band elements is sufficiently small  Figure 30 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in L-band frequencies  Figure 31 Measured isolation between L-band and Ku-band antennas in Ku-band frequencies From these measurements it can be concluded that opportunities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-band elements antenna and the measurement set-up \(closure of surrounding Ku-band ports and use of appropriate connectors for the open Ku-band ports 7  M ODIFIED DUAL FREQUENCY ANTENNA  In order to benefit the str ong points of the two separate designs as discussed in section 4, an alternative antenna is proposed that exploits the properties of a \221best of both worlds\222 solution employing ideas from both designs. The modified antenna possesses an aperture fed L-band patch of a similar form to first design, but situated towards the bottom of the stack. Ku band el ements are located within the L-band perforations and para sitic patches are situated above a foam spacer \(see Figure 32 and Figure 33\A measurement campaign is underway to assess the behaviour of this modified test antenna

This requires the inclusion of a broadband beam forming network. Beam steering can be realized by adding RF-phase shifters and LNA\222s to the antenna elements of the array. However traditional phase shifters in ge neral have a narrow band, and hence do not yield the re quired broadband capability Alternative technologies for broadband beam forming are switched beam networks \(using Butler matrices innovative designs for RF-compone nts such as phase shifter LNA components in \(M\IC technology, or beam forming by using opti cal ring resonators  The German SME IMST is involved in several projects for development of electronica lly steerable phased array antennas for satellite communication. In the NATALIA project \(New Automotive Track ing Antenna for Low-cost Innovative Applications\ ESA, IMST is investigating the possibility of realizing a compact costeffective solution for a recei ve-only full electronically steerable antenna for cars in Ku-band. This antenna is a planar array composed of approximately 150 patches circularly polarised by using a 90\260 hybrid, and arranged in a hexagonal fashion. Each patc h is equipped with a MMIC corechip containing a phase sh ifting unit, LNA and digital steering logic  In the Netherlands, a consortiu m \(consisting of University of Twente, Lionix BV, National Aerospace Laboratory NLR and Cyner Substrates developing in the national FlySmart project technology for a broadband optical beam forming network. For the steering of the beam of the conformal phased array a squi nt-free, continuously tunable mechanism is proposed that is based on a fully integrated optical beam forming network \(OBFN optical ring resonators \(ORRs as tunable delay elements. A narrowband continuously tunabl e optical TTD device is realized as a recirculating wa veguide coupled to a straight waveguide. This straight wave guide can behave as a bandpass filter with a periodic, bell-shaped tunable group delay response. The maximum group delay occurs at a tunable resonance frequency. A larger delay-bandwidth product can be achieved by cascading multiple ORR sections. A complete OBFN can be obtaine d by grouping several delays and combining elements in one optical circuit. Such an OBFN can be realized on a si ngle-chip. Electrical/Optical E/O O E by means of filter based single-sideband modulation suppressing the carrier lanced coherent optical detection. Further details of the optical beamforming network have been presented in Re The proof-ofconcept has been shown by manufacturing a chip for an 8x1 OBFN. Essential components of the OBFN are the optical modulators, which are used to modulate the light in the ORR system 9  C ONCLUSIONS  For enhanced communicati on on board aircraft, novel antenna systems with broa dband satellite-based capabilities are required. So far, existi ng L-band satellite based systems for communications are used primarily for passenger application \(APC\i nistrative communications AAC and now data are tending to evolve towards broadband dig ital applications \(Voice over IP\any studies are going on worldwide to employ Kuband TV geostationary sate llites for communication with mobile terminals on aircraft The inbound traffic is about 5 times higher than the outbound The inbound traffic requires the availability of a broadband Ku-band antenna in receive mode only. The outbound traffic services can be supplied by the Inmarsat SBB link, whic h requires the installation of an L-band transmit antenna. In order to avoid both the installation of L-band antenna and Ku-band antenna, the concept of a hybrid dual frequency antenna operating L 


  13 band and Ku-band with low aerodynamic profile has been investigated in this paper. Keyaspects of this research are 200  Design and testing dual-fre quency antenna elements operating in both L-band and Ku-band 200  Conformal aspects of Ku-band phased array antennas 200  Beam forming algorithms for planar and conformal phased array antennas Two designs for dual-frequency antenna tiles consisting of 8x8 Ku-band antenna elements and one L-band element The designs have been analysed by means of computer simulations. Both designs show promising performance both in L-band and Ku-band. The design with slotted Lband antenna has a resonant fre quency in receive mode with a bandwidth of about 1 GHz. The Ku-band antenna is a stacked patch configuration where a parasitic element is placed above a lower patch separated by dedicated space filler. The manufactured protot ype antennas indicate that the bandwidth is sufficiently large In order to be able to communicate with geostationary satellites also at high latitudes e.g. during inter-continental flights\stem should have sufficient performance at low elevation angles. The antenna Ku-band system is required to have a small beamwidth \(to discriminate between the satellite signals\gain 30 dB angles. The effects of these requirements on the size and positioning of the antenna on the aircraft fuselage have been investigated. These requirements can be best satisfi ed by installing two planar phased array antennas on both side s of the fuselage with at least 1600 Ku-band elements. Each element has two feed lines, one for each polarization Every feed line has to be connected to the beam formi ng network. This means that the connections cannot be routed to one of the four sides of the antenna. Instead the concept of vertical feed lines \(by means of vias in a sufficiently thick substrate recommended. These vertical f eed lines connect the L-band and Ku-band antenna elements in the upper layer with feed networks in multiple lower laye rs. This vertical feed line system was not available so far due to manufacturing problems The performances of one dua l-frequency antenna design have been investigated by manufacturing two test antennas without vertical feed line syst em. The first antenna contains only a multilayer structure with L-band slots and 8x8 Kuband stacked patches. The performances of the L-band slots and Ku-band stacked patches c ould be measured separately It was concluded that opportun ities should be considered to improve the design of the dual-frequency antenna \(by optimizing the feeds of the Ku-b and elements the dual frequency test-antenna and the measurement set-up More important, however, is the realization of a mechanically stable vertical feed line system, so that the properties of L-band and Ku-band elements can be measured adequately The second test antenna contains only a multilayer structure with 8x8 Ku-band stacked patches and a feed network with 8 combiners, where each comb iner coherently sums 8 antenna elements. In combination with a prototype 8x1 OBFN, a Ku-band phased arra y antenna is obtained of which the beam can be steered in one direction. This second test antenna is used to analyze the broadband properties of the 8x8 Ku-band antenna array and 8x1 OBFN. The measured performances of this antenna are presented in Ref   A CKNOWLEDGMENT  This work was part of the EU 6 th Framework project ANASTASIA., and the FlySmart project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic A ffairs, SenterNovem project numbers ISO53030 The FlySmart project is part of the Eureka PIDEA  project SMART Cyner Substrates is acknowle dged for technical assistance during the fabrication of the prototype antennas
